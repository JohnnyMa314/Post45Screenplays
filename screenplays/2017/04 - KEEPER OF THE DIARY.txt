           ANNELIES MARIE FRANK, 15, sits and stares out the grimy
           windowpane at the pale wash of morning light. Skeletal
           branches of an chestnut tree dappled against the ruddy, grungy
           brickwork, a small atrium courtyard of ramshackle prewar
           townhouses, soot-flecked.

           Light washes in across her, silhouetting her, pressing her
           shadow over the jumbled, worn-out bed sheets, two cramped
           little mattresses on bare metal frames. The faintest wistful
           smile upon her lips. She absently fusses with her long hair.
           Pencil, paper laid out across her lap. 

           INT. STAIRWAY, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- SAME TIME

           Scuffed-up black shoes HAMMER up the flaking, chewed-up wooden
           steps, scarred plaster walls exposing naked grungy brickwork.
           Narrow-nosed FN 1922 .17mm PISTOLS drawn. Four husky MEN in
           threadbare suits, tense, panting, clambering up the stairs.
           NAZI SWASTIKAS, crimson ARM-BANDS on their arms.

           INT. MAIN OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- SAME TIME

           Eckstein cigarette jammed between her fingers, mostly ash,
           nails chipped-up, worn down to the quick, MIEP GIES, 35,
           short brown hair, exhaustion pitting her shadowed eyes, gazes
           down at a rumpled, weather-worn ledger book. Narrow columns
           jammed with chicken-scratch writing, numbers in RED INK. 

           Chattering typewriters fill the muggy little office. BEP
           VOSKUIJL, 25, pert, narrow-shouldered, hunched over her
           Underwood Standard Portable. JOHANNES KLEIMAN, 48, pitched
           back in his weather-beaten wooden office chair, on the PHONE.
           His listless gaze falling upon Miep through the sunlight.

           Miep, unaware of him, her glassy eyes fixed on the tiny torn
           scrap of PAPER wedged beneath the chewed-up corner of the
           ledger book. SHOPPING LIST scrawled in hasty, dull pencil.
           Brown beans, navy beans, potatoes, veg soup. Tacked on at
           the end in a child's leaning cursive: chocolates.

           Miep, a fractional tug of a smile flickering. 

           INT. HALLWAY, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- SAME TIME

           Pushing down the narrow, weakly-lit hallway, grungy old lathed
           walls, linoleum floors, KARL SILBERBAUER, 33, pinch-nosed,
           pressed Gestapo S.S. Sergeant's UNIFORM, motions to GEZINUS
           GRINGHUIS, 55, yellowed skin, thinning hair, liver spots,
           toward the cramped OFFICE DOOR to the right. Pushing toward
           the BACK OFFICE with the other THREE PLAINCLOTHES GRÜNE
           POLIZEI DUTCH POLICEMEN.

           Gringhuis, .17mm PISTOL drawn, sweating through his threadbare
           jacket, draws a breath. Grips the scratched-up DOORKNOB.
           Glances down the hall as Silberbauer and the OTHER DUTCHMEN
           surround the back OFFICE DOOR. 
           Gringhuis steels himself. TWISTS the DOORKNOB. Pushing in -

           INT. MAIN OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- CONTINUOUS

           - to the soupy, muggy warmth, sun streaming through the grimy
           windows, Kleiman, his back to the door, phone pinned with
           his shoulder, scribbling something in a book. Bep, fingers
           CHATTERING on her Underwood typewriter. Movement in the corner
           of her eye. Glances over. Lurches. STOPS TYPING. 

           Miep looks over at the sudden SILENCE. Freezes. Eyes locked
           on Gringhuis, filling the doorway in his shabby suit. Finger
           wrapped around the TRIGGER of the PISTOL. TREMBLING slightly.
           Kleiman, noticing the women's gazes, twists in his chair.

                                 GRINGHUIS
                            (in German)
                        Don't move. Just sit quietly. 

           Miep pushes down a dry swallow. Ash flicking from her
           cigarette. Eyes dragging to the petrified, rigid Bep, her
           fingers still poised over the Underwood. She meets Miep's
           gaze. Miep, DREAD in her eyes.

           INT. PETER'S BEDROOM, SECRET ANNEX -- SAME TIME

           OTTO FRANK, 55, kind-faced, gaunt, cradles a steaming cup of
           weak tea. Vapor blossoming into his face. He gazes at the
           yellowed, creased PHOTOGRAPH jammed partly beneath the weather-
           worn mattress, narrow, bedsheets tangled, overhung by
           overstuffed bookshelves nailed to the walls. The smiling
           black-and-white FACE of his daughter, Anne Frank. He drags
           his attention to -

           - PETER VAN PELS, 17, hunched at the cramped desk beside
           him, lanky knees smashed up beneath its chewed-up wooden
           frame. Textbooks leafed open, gawky elbows pinning a rumpled
           paper covered in smudged pencil script, messy handwriting.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        One "b," Peter. One "b" in "double."

           Peter, mid-dictation, cut off, squints back down at the
           rumpled page. Weak light spilling over him from the hanging
           lamp. Stairs jutting down through the middle of the room.

           Peter picks up a worn-down nub of a pencil. Scratches out a
           word midway through the column. Otto, watching his studied
           focus, intent determination, a slight tug of a smile.
           Oblivious to the soft SQUEAK of the stairs, gentle footsteps.

           Otto gives a start as the door abruptly WRENCHES OPEN. Peter
           twists in his seat. Freezes. Elbow catching the pencil. It
           rolls off the desk. Clatters to the floor.

           Silberbauer, FN 1922 .17mm PISTOL drawn. Peter, breath
           catching in his throat, terror flashing in his eyes, glances
           at Otto. Otto pushes down a swallow. Raises his hands.
           INT. MAIN OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- SHORTLY LATER

           Miep draws to the window, face puffy, eyes streaked with
           tears. She peers out through the gritty glass, clasping the
           simple silver pendant around her neck. 

           Down on the cobblestone street, a canvas-covered green Opel
           THREE-TON TRUCK has been backed up onto the sidewalk.

           Otto Frank stands apart from his huddled family, Peter and
           the Van Pelses. Watching them, his shoulders slumped, a broken
           man, as one by one they are roughly shoved up over the metal
           tailgate, into the yawning dark maw of the back of the truck. 

           Warehouse manager WILLHELM VAN MAAREN, 49, conferring with
           Gringhuis, nodding, gesturing toward the factory.

           Otto turns, flicks the slightest glance upward. Toward the
           office windows. Toward Miep. She draws a ragged breath.
           Blanches under his gaze. The slight, pale figure of Anne
           Frank climbing unsteadily into the truck behind him.

           Silberbauer steps forward, BARKS at Otto in German. Otto
           nods, turns. Obedient. Grips the metal rails and hoists
           himself up onto the metal tailgate. 

           Miep, trembling, face crumpling as she watches him haltingly
           disappear into the dark of the truck. She draws back from
           the window, presses a hand to her mouth. Turns away, eyes
           stinging. Wipes the tears that escape with her knuckles.

           Catches the gaze of Bep, across the room, telephones ringing,
           typewriters abandoned, coffee cups gone cold, cigarette still
           issuing a twist of smoke from the ashtray. Their world turned
           upside-down.

           INT. FILE ROOM, SECRET ANNEX ENTRYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Miep stands in a wash of weak morning light. Papers strewn
           in flurries across the floor. Squat wooden BOOKCASE, formerly
           wedged beneath a rumpled map of Belgium against the wall,
           now pulled away to expose the HIDDEN DOOR and STAIRCASE to
           the Secret Annex behind it. Gaping dark stillness beyond.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SECRET ANNEX -- MOMENTS LATER

           Miep, clenching her hands, mouth pressed into a taut line to
           choke back the sobs, steps gingerly into the room. Sheets,
           blankets wrenched off the twin dirty mattresses, left in
           clumps on the floor. Wooden dressers, draws yanked out,
           clothes tossed and strewn in jumbles.

           Smashed glass twinkles hazily beneath the tattered curtains
           on the two narrow windows at the far end of the room. Miep
           steps forward. Shoes CRUNCHING over rumpled papers, broken-
           spined books dumped carelessly among piles of PHOTOGRAPHS,
           an abandoned leather belt, shoes.
           Bep draws to the doorway. Red-eyed, quivering. Watches in
           silence as Miep draws to the center of the wreckage. She
           bends. Drags aside a jumble of crumpled papers, a Hebrew
           prayer book. Shimmies out the small, cloth-bound red checkered
           DIARY left behind among all of the relics, junk.

           Miep rises. Holding it. Stares down at it through tear-blurred
           eyes.

                                                                  BLACK.

           INT. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY

           Hard fluorescent. Washing, sallow, over stark beige plaster
           walls. Bookshelf. Laden with MANUSCRIPTS. Loose-leaf, bound
           together with rubber bands, metal clamps. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN,
           23, bookish, mousy, attractive, thick black glasses, hair
           combed back, crisp white blouse, wool skirt, hunches at the
           cluttered oak desk. Filling the middle of the room. IBM Model
           01 electric TYPEWRITER. Telephone. Manuscript open in front
           of her. Her concentration on the smearing typescript - 

           - nagged by the slight FLICKER of the fluorescent overhead
           strip. She glances up at it. Distracted. It sputters back at
           her. She presses her attention back to the page. Eyes dragging
           across it. Glances back at the flickering light.

           SUPER: "November 8, 1950. New York City."

           She slouches back. Rolling, padded office chair wheezing
           beneath her. Flips the manuscript shut. Regards it. Smudged
           TITLE, Dunkirk: The Miracle That Saved England. She lifts
           it, impulsively places it into the wire metal OUTBOX. Masking
           tape LABEL peeling from the side: "LOG & DISCARD." 

           She drags her glasses off. Rubs at her bleary eyes. Twists
           in her mewling chair. Crisp New York afternoon SUNLIGHT
           slashing in around the meager, narrow corners of the pull-
           down SHADE. She cuts a glance at the crinkled Marlboro
           CIGARETTE PACKAGE resting on the edge of the desk. A reward
           not yet earned.

           She twists in the chair. Reaches for the wire-frame INBOX
           beside the OUTBOX. Stack of rumpled MANILA ENVELOPES slouching
           between its ribbed walls. Beaten-up. Battered by the Postal
           Service. She drags the next one in front of her. 

           Affixes her tired eyes upon the hand-written address. "Editor,
           Doubleday & Company." She draws a breath. Steeling herself.
           Grabs the tarnished silver LETTER OPENER from beside the IBM
           typewriter. Shimmies the envelope open. Fresh MANUSCRIPT
           jammed inside. 

           Eyes sticking for a moment on the DISCARDED MANUSCRIPT,
           Dunkirk, in the OUTBOX. She drags her attention back. Wriggles
           out the NEW ONE.
           INT. KATZ'S DELICATESSAN -- DAY

           Murky fishbowl of smoke, babbling voices, laughter, clattering
           dishes. Barbara sits at a small table by the window, by
           herself. Matzo-ball soup, smeary glass of water, no ice.
           Glasses reflecting back the rumpled MANUSCRIPT she is reading.
           Cigarette twisting smoke from the plastic ashtray beside
           her. She is absorbed. Draws back. Nagging at her. 

           INT. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY

           Barbara draws into the fluorescent cave of a room. Purse
           slung over her shoulder. Hair ruffled slightly. New Manuscript
           tucked under her arm. Her eyes instantly flicking to the
           OUTBOX. "LOG & DISCARD." Emptied now. She grimaces. Flicker
           of guilt. She hesitates. Debating. 

           Sets the NEW MANUSCRIPT on the desk, rumpled, ruffled, beside
           the typewriter. Slouches her purse into the cracked leather-
           padded office chair. Drawing away. 

           INT. MAILROOM, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- AFTERNOON

           Metal-framed shelves. Floor to ceiling. Airless warmth. Mail
           crates, stacked side by side. Every shelf filled. Brimming
           with manila envelopes, clumps, spilling burlap sacks, of
           crinkled letters, envelopes. 

           Barbara, embarrassed, pushes through the dented metal door.
           Draws up short. Timid. Unaccustomed to being down here.
           Squints at the looming jam-packed SHELVES. Gives a START as -

           JASON EPSTEIN, 22, crouched beside a metal mail CART, flipping
           through meticulously-organized envelopes, pushes to his feet.
           She presses a hand to her mouth. Taken by surprise. 

                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

           She pushes a smile at him. Jason, pleasantly surprised to
           see her down here. Watches her as her eyes rake around the
           stale room. Overwhelmed. Daunting rows upon rows of shelves,
           crates overflowing with bulging envelopes.

                                 JASON EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                        Is there something I can help you
                        with?

           She flicks a glance at him. Awkward, slightly, in his
           eagerness. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I discarded a manuscript this morning.
                        I think I may have been too hasty.

           Jason, a tug of a shy smile. Turns. Instinctively knows this
           labyrinth. Nods toward a fresh JUMBLED PILE of envelopes in
           a crate on a second CART.
                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        It would be in there if it was from
                        this morning.

           Barbara nods, grateful. Steps toward the CART. Flicks a glance
           at him. Slurry of jumbled envelopes and pouches. He registers
           her consternation. Smirks. Slides one last envelope into
           place. Twists away from his own cart.

                                 JASON EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                        Here, let me help you with that.

           Eyes sticking on her. He draws to the chipped-up metal cart.
           Pries his attention away from her. Straining to focus.
           Expertly flips through the wash of unorganized, rumpled
           MANUSCRIPTS.

           She watches him work. Dexterous, confident. He flicks a glance
           at her. She avoids his gaze. Awkward, slightly. Eyes fixing
           on the MANUSCRIPTS in the crate on the LOWER SHELF of the
           CART. 

           Rumpled black-and-white PHOTOGRAPH paper-clipped to the title
           page of a smashed MANUSCRIPT. Discarded. Corner of a youthful
           girl's FACE. Barbara, etch of a frown. Eyes sticking on it.

                                 JASON EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                        Was it this one?

           She drags her attention back to him. Smash-edged MANUSCRIPT
           in hand. Bravest Marine of Them All. She shakes her head. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        It was called "Dunkirk. The Miracle
                        that Saved England."

           Jason nods, flips back through the other rumpled SUBMISSIONS
           in the crate. Barbara, distracted. Eyes gravitating back to
           the PHOTOGRAPH. Drawn somehow to it.

           She stoops. Thumbing back the stacked ENVELOPES jammed on
           top of the PHOTOGRAPH. Masking tape label: "DONALD BLACK -
           LOG & DISCARD." She shimmies out the MANUSCRIPT attached to
           the PHOTOGRAPH. Eyes sticking again on the -

           FACE of the YOUNG GIRL. Beaming. Wide. Innocent. Something
           haunting about her. Junior Editors' REPORTS stapled to the
           title page. All PASSES. She peels it back -

           "THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL BY ANNE FRANK."

           Barbara blinks. Peels back the title page. Eyes dragging
           over the smeary TYPESCRIPT, paragraphs, prose. Darting from
           word to word. Flicker of a frown. She flips it closed again.
           Skewered once more by the beaming GIRL'S FACE. Anne Frank.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Where did this one come from?
           Jason tosses a glance over his shoulder. Squints. 

                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        I have no idea.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. RUSSIAN CAMP, WOODS, POLAND -- MORNING

           IVAN MARTYNUSHKIN, 21, shucks open a tin of canned pickled
           cabbage and peers down at it, flecked and gummy and mostly-
           eaten. He reaches in with a filthy finger, scoops his way
           along the ridged inner wall of the tin. Jams it into his
           mouth, sucks it clean.

           SUPER: "January 27, 1945. Oswiecim, Poland."

           He digs back into the tin, scraping and clawing for every
           last fleck and morsel. Flicks a glance at the RUSSIAN
           CORPORAL, 18, soggy chestnut uniform, cross-legged on a slick
           wet stone, shivering, watching him. FIRE snapping and popping
           and sputtering, a sprinkle of sleet, frozen rain. 

           Ivan licks his teeth. Jams the tin back into the ragged burlap
           gunnysack pinned between his boots. Tips his head back for a
           moment. Flecks of snow flittering down between the fat, icy
           raindrops. His cheeks flushed pink with the cold. 

           EXT. WOODS, POLAND -- LATE MORNING

           Crunching through the snow. Ivan, huffing, sweating in his
           thick canvas uniform, soggy fur at the collar flecked with
           ice and frozen rain, draws up short. Breath hazing at his
           face. He swipes it away. Squints out into the sprawling BLEAK
           WHITE EXPANSE of the landscape ahead. Tosses a glance back -

           - over his shoulder, naked birch trees huddled against the
           frigid cold. Narrow column of RUSSIAN RIFLEMEN, sodden and
           ragged and exhausted, hunched on mangey-coated PONIES,
           clopping and rattling, canteens clanking, rifles smacking
           against their flanks. 

           Ivan holds up a hand. The Corporal, first up behind him,
           grasps the reins of his HORSE. Tugs. White knuckled. Nervous.
           Horse rearing back. Snorting. Sputtering. Stumbling to a
           halt. The other MOUNTED MEN behind him following suit as -

           - Ivan twists forward again. Eyes sticking on the SMUDGE of
           DIRTY BLACK smearing up into the charcoal-gray sky ahead.
           Furrowed berm of tufted snow, pockmarked by jutting rocks, a
           brittle, frozen birch sapling, masking the SOURCE.

           Ivan, steam huffing, holds his breath. Listens. The CLANKING,
           SHUFFLING dying down behind him. Muffled SILENCE blanketing
           across him, the other MEN. Chilly breeze wafting through the
           skeletal forest behind them. Droplets spitting from the
           branches. The Corporal trembles. Strains to muffle a SNEEZE.
           Ivan, senses on high alert. Eyes fixed on the SMOKE in the
           sky.

           EXT. AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP -- LATE MORNING

           Dreamlike, dragging smear of weathered, sooty brick. Pitted
           black windows, empty, yawning from vacant, gutted walls.
           Barbed-wire fences, snarled. Muddy troughed, rutted roads,
           train tracks. Ivan, on HORSEBACK, gripping the weather-beaten
           wooden stock of his Simonov RIFLE, stares.

           Haunted. Anxious. Breaths coming in shallow bursts. Eyes
           darting across the low BARRACKS BUILDINGS, clustered and
           vacant, doorways hanging open through the mesh fences.

           Soot-blacked CHIMNEYS, leaning, scarred and blasted and half-
           demolished. Haze of smoke still curling from a gutted brick
           OUTBUILDING set back from them. Ivan tugs on the reins of
           his HORSE. Slowing. Squints. Not understanding.

           Piled, smoldering clumps of CLOTHES, singed, soggy.

                                 CORPORAL (O.S.)
                        Kapitan.

           Ivan jerks. Twists back. Corporal, a few horse-steps behind
           him, shivering and trembling, white as a sheet, petrified.
           Nearly drops his own RIFLE. Pins it with an elbow. Lifts a
           shaking FINGER to POINT. Ivan follows his gaze -

           Pale SHAPES melting into view in the DOORWAY of the hunched
           one-story brick STRUCTURE up ahead to the right. TWO of them
           hobbling, shuffling out into the dirty slush and snow. 

           Ivan blinks. Wipes at his smeary eyes. Freezing rain droplets
           clotting his vision. Mixing with flecks of ASH. Squints.
           Filthy gray-striped shirts hanging off bony shoulders like
           coat hangers. The other MEN on HORSEBACK behind him hefting
           their RIFLES. CLACKING MAGAZINES, loading SHELLS. Cursing
           under their breaths. 

           Ivan frowns. Holds up a hand. HALTING the MEN behind him.
           Eyes fixed on the hobbling SHAPES in the doorway. He drags
           his gaze to the wrought-iron SIGN arching the barbed GATEWAY:

           "ARBEIT MACHT FREI"

           Corporal, haunted eyes fixed on the gaunt, emaciated SHAPES.
           Petrified. Hands gripping his RIFLE.

                                 CORPORAL (CONT'D)
                        Kapitan. 

           Ivan drags his eyes back to the DOORWAY. A skeletal MAN, a
           CHILD, 8, skull almost larger than its pitiful, starved body.
                                 CORPORAL (CONT'D)
                        What is this place?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN CAR [MOVING] -- EVENING

           Jolted, jostled, carriage rattling around him, a hazy babble
           of Dutch, German, Russian, the same Man, 56, sits. Turned
           slightly toward the window. His murky eyes fixed on the soot-
           caked buildings dragging by. Craggy brickwork, wrought-iron
           balconies, smashed-out windows, blackened and scorched. 

           SUPER: "June 3, 1945. Amsterdam, Netherlands."

           His gaze sticks on a portly WOMAN leaning out a third-floor
           window, reaching to drag in a flapping gray-white sheet from
           the clothesline stretched to the building across the narrow
           alley from her. Streets strewn with trash, singed clumps of
           once-scarlet TAPESTRIES left to molder, NAZI SWASTIKAS
           blackened and smeared and all but scoured away.

           He gives a start, glances forward. Every seat JAMMED with
           JABBERING, filthy, emaciated MEN and WOMEN, bony CHILDREN
           shouting to each other. Everything a foggy blear. The train
           shuddering, jostling, slowing.

           He grasps with dirty fingers the grimy striped CLOTH BAG in
           his lap. Shoeless, barefoot, his skin blackened. His kneecaps
           jutting through the canvas fabric of his trousers. He is
           dwarfed in his grungy shirt, swimming in it. Collarbones
           like coat hangers, pitted cheeks. Eyes sunken in his skull.

           INT. PLATFORM, STATION AMSTERDAM CENTRAAL -- EVENING

           Hazy tumult, chaos of babbling voices, jostling PEOPLE.
           Clinging to their meager beat-up canvas satchels, valises.
           Children screaming, stumbling, staggering. The MAN bends,
           catches the flailing, skinny hand of a GIRL, 8, as she trips,
           nearly takes a spill to the floor. She shyly looks back up
           him. Wriggles away. Dashes off between the churning feet.

           He shudders forward, clutching the striped CLOTH BAG, his
           only worldly possession. Wall to wall PEOPLE, confused,
           clamoring, trying to find each other. A WOMAN, 32, screaming
           in tears about something. He watches her. Drags himself
           onward. Train schedules, reader-boards.

           A WOMAN in a GRAY DRESS, RED CROSS stitched to her breast,
           SNAGS the Man as he squirms his way through the seething
           crowd. Her CLIPBOARD covered with scrawled names, pages curled
           back, several deep. Blonde, 24, tired, energy she manufactures
           from some inner well of good. Shouts to be heard.

                                 RED CROSS WOMAN
                            (in Dutch)
                        Name? What is your name? 
           He clears his throat. Strains to speak. Parched, exhausted -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Otto Frank.

           His voice is lost in the JABBERING CHAOS. MAN behind him
           SHOUTING to another WOMAN through the thick, churning crowd.
           She shimmies closer. Cups her hand to her ear.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        OTTO FRANK.

           She nods. Draws back. Fumbles with a worn-down pencil. Flashes
           him a smile. Turning toward the Man beside him. He catches
           her by the arm. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Margot Frank? Anna Frank?

           She squints down. Eyes flicking over the smeared, penciled
           names. She fumbles with the next page up, peeling back. Meets
           his eyes again. SHAKES her head. He nods his thanks. Pulls
           back.

           EXT. SIDEWALK, AMSTERDAM -- NIGHT

           His filthy bare feet slap the rounded, weathered cobblestones.
           He walks with a shambling, hobbling limp. Tattered trouser
           legs dangling, ragged, at his bare ankles. His shirt dwarfs
           him. Hangs off of him like a canvas tent. He is hunched.
           Rawboned. Emaciated. 

           Otto stares up at the passing buildings. Slate-gray sky giving
           way already to the sooty smear of dusk. Impassive windows
           reflecting back, mirrorlike, down at him. He watches the
           guttural diesel Opel TRUCKS, passing Mercedes-Benz sedans.
           He drags his gaze out to the sloshing churning CANALS, flecked
           with goose feathers, clumped trash. The city he used to know.

           INT. STAIRWELL, APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

           Otto climbs the steep, narrow stairs with measured paces.
           Breath wheezing in and out of him. He perspires through his
           filthy shirt. He clutches the CLOTH BAG and huffs and turns
           to shimmy his way up past a descending BOY, 14, who twists
           to stare back up at him. Unsettled by this wraith.

           INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           He draws to the door and stands and lifts his hand, holds
           it, trembling slightly. Draws a breath. He KNOCKS on the
           door. He stands, flecks of perspiration dewing his temples,
           sinewy neck. He glances down the hallway. An ARGUING COUPLE
           rounds the stairs and claps their way down and keeps arguing.

           He turns back to the door. He hesitates. Lifts his hand.
           RAPS again on the chipped-up wood. He waits. Listens. Muffled
           WOMAN'S VOICE on the other side. Not happy. 
           Thumping footsteps, heavy, stamping closer. 

           A CLACK as the dead bolt is turned. Knob twisting. Door
           abruptly jolting OPEN. Warm light spilling out. Threadbare
           rug, slivered bookcase, photographs in frames, clogs piled
           in a wicker basket. Filling the doorway -

           Miep Gies, flushed in the face, wrapped in a worn-out sleeping
           gown, hair disheveled, in the midst of an ARGUMENT, holding
           a smeary water glass. Her eyes settle on Otto. She sees him.
           Absorbs.

           The water glass slides out of her hand and SMASHES to the
           floor at her feet. Color draining from her face. He flinches
           at the shattering glass. Takes a haltering half-step back.

           Miep SURGES out, pushing the door wider. She grasps him by
           both hands, SQUEEZES. Then, cannot help herself. ENVELOPS
           him in a tight embrace. 

           He totters backward. Weak. Air smashed out of him. Staggers
           and struggles to catch his footing. Eyes all at once stinging.
           She is squeezing him. Holding him.

           JAN GIES, her husband, draws to the corridor behind her,
           blinking and angry at the breaking glass, their argument cut
           short. He sees Otto. Stares. Looking at a ghost.

           Miep, sobs heaving, wracking through her body, clings to
           Otto. He lifts a hesitant, tentative hand. Places it on her
           back. He gazes at Jan. Self-conscious. Door across the hallway
           juddering open, a NEIGHBOR, chubby, mustached, squinting
           blearily out at the commotion. 

           Miep draws back, face streaming with tears. She drags in a
           ragged breath. The sight of his gaunt face, almost inhuman. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Is it you?

           He manages to nod.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It's me. Yes. It is me. 

           He flinches as she cups his face in her hands. Touch of this
           type unfamiliar. He stands rigidly. She releases him. His
           probing, wondering eyes.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        We spent that entire summer, after
                        they released us, attempting to locate
                        you.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Have you heard anything of the girls?

           Miep draws back. Shakes her head. Eyes watery, red. He nods. 
                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Edith is not coming back. Neither
                        are the Van Pelses or Dr. Pfeffer.
                        But I have great hope for Margot and
                        Anna.

           She embraces him again. Wrapping her arms around his gaunt
           body once more. Pulling him to her. He stands, brittle. Gently
           hugs her back. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        I saved as many of their things as I
                        could.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Otto tugs open scratched-up metal clasps, fumbles with the
           threadbare length of rope that binds them shut. His hands
           are shaking. He gazes down into the wooden Opekta Jam CRATE
           and his breath catches in his throat. Margot's weather-worn
           hairbrush. Rumpled school papers, scrawled with her
           handwriting. Anne's shoes. Red checkered DIARY wedged into
           the bottom. He looks upon it and is shaken, cannot move.

           He grips the sides of the crate. Steadies himself. He glances
           to Miep, watching him, hands clasped before her. She looks
           away, uncomfortable. All at once aware she is an intruder in
           this private moment. 

           He steps back, disoriented. Narrow twin beds, weak light
           spilling from the dusty desk lamp over a scuffed-up leather
           blotter. Drapes hanging from the windows. Narrow fireplace.
           His striped cloth sack, ragged and filthy, resting on the
           other bed. 

           He squeezes his eyes shut. Drags them open. Bleary exhaustion,
           numbness, loss. Miep steps forward to steady him. Stops
           herself. She glances to Jan, lingering in the doorway,
           watching, uncertain how to treat this once-close friend,
           returned a stranger.

           He catches his breath. He musters a weak smile for them.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Thank you. I should rest.

           Miep nods vigorously. She does not move for a moment. He
           totters his way to the bed. Catches himself, pushes a hand
           against the wool-blanketed mattress to prop himself up,
           springs softly wheezing beneath his meager weight. Miep takes
           a faltering step toward him. Restrains herself. He turns,
           shaking. His eyes stick on the Opekta crate.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I would like to go back. In the
                        morning. To the Annex.
           She glances at Jan again. He is motionless, impassive. Otto,
           lowering himself onto the creaking mattress, drags pained
           eyes, yearning, needing, onto Miep.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        It is the first place they would go. 

           She hesitates. Glances at Jan again. Nods. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Of course. Of course, Otto. We will
                        go in the morning.

           She takes a step toward him. She reaches out, places a hand
           on his shoulder. He blanches at the touch. Looks up at her.
           Her face, bleary, soft, pained, gazing down on him. She has
           aged in this time, too. Hardship weighing. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Rest. We will find them.

           He manages a flicker of a smile. Nods. She reflects it back
           at him. Withdraws to the door. Looks back one last time.
           This shadow of a man. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN [MOVING] -- DAY

           THE WOMAN, 18, hunches in the beat-up wicker seat. Fusses
           absently with the sleeve of her hand-knit wool sweater. Train
           car rattling around her. Hubbub of bleary voices. CHILD
           laughing somewhere. She flicks a glance at the -

           - small rucksack smashed into the compartment by her feet.
           Weather-worn. Stitched up and patched in several places.
           Bulging at its zippers. She drags her emerald-green eyes
           back to the window. Wedge of complete blackness, train tunnel,
           pushing back a smeary reflection of her hawkish face, hollowed
           eyes. Etched with worry. 

           Darkness all at once GIVING WAY to LIGHT. Dragging PLATFORM
           smearing by outside. JAMMED with TRAVELERS. Clumped sea-green
           Samsonite luggage. KIDS laughing, dashing between their
           parents. The Woman twists in her seat. Presses her face to
           the smeary glass. Peering out. Flickering excitement.

           INT. PLATFORM CONCOURSE, PENNSYLVANIA STATION -- DAY

           Jostled, elbowed, she shimmies her way out the narrow door.
           Platform muggy, besieged with sweaty TRAVELERS, families,
           businessmen in wool Brooks Brothers suits, leather briefcases,
           fedoras. She slows. Her attention pulled upward - 

           Hazy summer light leaching down through the arching steel
           frame latticework of the glass canopy, 150ft overhead. Murky
           babble of VOICES cradled by the majestic, arching dome. Pink
           granite, travertine walls. A crystal palace.
           The Woman stares. Enthralled. JOSTLED, sidestepped by a Wall
           Street BANKER, 42, pasty, annoyed. Men, women, surging around
           her. She drags her attention back. Shimmies her way forward.
           Tug of a smile lingering on her lips. Disbelief. Wonder. 

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (O.S.)
                        Zimm! Zimmerman!

           She flicks a glance upward. Leaning over the rail of the
           grated passenger concourse at the top of the stairs, ALICE
           MCGRATH, 23, fiery Irish redhead, grinning ear to ear. The
           Woman, a younger Barbara Zimmerman, breaks into a reciprocal
           smile. Alice laughing, waving. Excitement infectious. 

           INT. BARBARA'S BEDROOM, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

           Barbara stands at the window. Brown muggy summer bathing in
           across her rumpled sweater, short black hair. Her eyes, thick
           black glasses, settled on the forested Art Deco skyscrapers,
           brick brownstones, clumped rooftop water tanks, Chrysler
           Building, Empire State. Manhattan.

           She is overwhelmed. Flattened by the sheer size and breadth
           of the city. Bare plaster walls, hardwood floor, shoebox
           bedroom spreading, hollow, empty, at her back. 

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (O.S.)
                        It's a long way up but at least you'll
                        keep your figure.

           Barbara gives a start. Twists from the window. Framed in the
           doorway, Alice, smirking at her. She steps into the room.
           Footsteps echoing on the naked plaster walls, uneven hardwood
           floor.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        I have a secret. It's bubbly and it
                        comes in a bottle. 

           Barbara, a flicker of a coy smile. Throws one last glance
           out the window. Difficult to pull herself away from the view.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I should unpack.

           Alice snorts. Eyes flicking to the lone rucksack slouched in
           the middle of the naked room. Single anemic Cattleya orchid
           in a chipped-up clay pot. 

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        That'll take you all of five minutes.

           Barbara, a self-conscious smile. Stoops to tug at the tinkling
           zipper. 
                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        We'll get you fixed up with some
                        furniture in no time. I know a guy.
                        As long as you don't mind pastels.

           Alice watches her, smile fading. Barbara, fixed on a framed
           PHOTOGRAPH wedged in her backpack - her SISTER in a lacy
           wedding dress. Handsome GROOM, 24, at her side. Pressed in
           among the long train of BRIDESMAIDS - Barbara at 17, mousy,
           lost in the shadow of the others. Their PARENTS beaming
           proudly at her sister.

           Alice, a flicker of a momentary shadow. Uncertain whether
           she should say anything. Unable not to -

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        Your mother telephoned.

           Barbara looks sharply up. Alice presses her lips together.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        She just wanted to know where you
                        were. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Did you tell her?

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        My mother did.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        How did my father take it?

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        I don't know.

           Barbara skewers her with a look. Alice, uncomfortable.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        He was apoplectic. 

           Barbara blanches. Returns her attention to shimmying open
           the rucksack. Clothes, hastily-packed, smashed inside.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, I just thought you should
                        know. But enough of that. We should
                        be celebrating.

           Alice draws back. Wheezing floorboards echoing against the
           naked plaster walls. 

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        I'll get us some glasses.

           Barbara, a tug of a smile in spite of herself.
                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I probably shouldn't. The interview
                        is first thing in the morning. And I
                        still need to register for class.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        You've got your whole life to work
                        and study. You're only eighteen and
                        free in New York City once.

           Alice flashes her a grin.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        Besides, it's too late. I already
                        opened it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. 1939 MORRIS EIGHT SERIES 3 SEDAN [MOVING] -- DAY

           Otto gazes out the smeary window, slate-gray sky, hollow in
           his glassy eyes. Weathered brickwork, soot-smeared butcher
           shop sliding by. Narrow townhouses, walls chipped and pock-
           marked with bullet holes. 

           He stiffens in his seat. Green warehouse doors coming into
           view. 263 Prinsengracht. Faded Opekta Jam sign hanging from
           rusty nails. Sun-bleached and peeling. 

           He draws back from the window. In the passenger seat, Miep
           glances back at him. Jolting and shuddering to a halt on the
           cobblestones. He soaks it in. 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SECRET ANNEX, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- DAY

           Otto stands, immobile. His eyes, glazed and murky and lost,
           take in the slivered hard sunlight piercing the worn holes
           and tatters in the yellowed curtains. Washing across the
           flaking green painted woodwork. Wallpaper blistered and
           bulging with water damage, faded and weathered by time. 

           The bed is gone, dresser absent, a shadow where it stood
           against the wall. Otto stoops and picks up a tattered sweater
           left in a clump on the floor. Dust blossoming into the air.
           He lets it drop. He turns, eyes raking across the rumpled
           map of Normandy still tacked up to the wall, pushpins tracking
           the Allied invasion, frozen in time. 

           His gaze sticks on the smudged chalk markings hashing the
           doorframe like a climbing ladder. Margot and Anne's heights
           as they grew in this place. He draws a ragged breath. 

           INT. BEDROOM, SECRET ANNEX, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- DAY

           He picks his way into the middle of Anne's tiny room. Draws
           to a halt. Turns in a slow circle. Eyes raking across the
           yellowed PHOTOGRAPHS of Greta Garbo, Ginger Rogers. 
           Colorful Het Beursspel board game, Cinema & Theater Magazine,
           rumpled photograph of Dame Libelle, a fashion magazine.

           Her bed, too, is gone. Desk where she sat taken away. Otto
           reaches out and snares a trailing black strand of hair caught,
           coiled, on a flake of paint curling from the doorway. He
           purses his lips. Abundantly apparent that no one has been
           back here. Rooms frozen in time.

           INT. FILE ROOM, SECRET ANNEX ENTRYWAY -- DAY

           Otto emerges from the cramped, hunched door into the hard
           pale morning light falling in through the grimy windows. He
           turns, instinct, automatic. Carefully shuffles the bookcase
           shut to conceal the door. Miep draws up short as he turns
           back. He holds a rumpled PHOTOGRAPH of Margot and Anne, a
           nub of a pencil in his hands. Gnawed and pockmarked. Peter's,
           from the morning they were taken. 

           He stares at the pencil, turns it over in his hands. Runs
           his thumbs across the indentations, the marks of Peter's
           teeth. He looks up. Miep watching him.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        The last words he spoke to me were
                        "I'll make it."

           He looks back at the sad little bookshelf. Shut-up, stagnant,
           stale tomb closed away behind it. He places the pencil on
           the shelf. Gazes at Anne in the PHOTOGRAPH.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        She will be heartbroken. 

           He is weighed down all at once by grief. Loss. Exhaustion.
           He summons his energy. Focuses on Miep. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        We should leave.

           He affords one last glance back at the bookshelf. Sunlight
           catching in his eyes. He shambles forward. Joining Miep.

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- DAY

           Otto draws up short in the doorway of the office. Bright
           morning sunlight streaming through the two windows across a
           cataclysm of clumped paperwork, manila file-folders, three-
           ring binders. Underwood typewriter, telephone buried. Ashtray
           filled with smashed cigarette butts, flecked with ash. 

           He takes it all in. Miep draws up behind him. Sees it through
           his eyes. Displeasure etching her face. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Van Maaren ran it all while they
                        were gone - Mr. Kleiman and Mr. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Kugler. Mr. Kleiman has been working
                        to put things back in order.

           He gazes at the tired, rusty metal Opekta Jam sign propped
           against the wall. Crates filled with more yellowing files.
           Miep hesitates. She glances at him. Impulsive, welling up
           out of her.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        It was him. They think. It was Van
                        Maaren who informed them about you.
                        They have him at Levantkade. 

           Otto does not look at her. He stares at the hard puddling
           sunlight on the bare wood floor. The clumped files. The little
           office, fading wallpaper, cracked plaster, yellowed with
           age. He draws away from the door. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Margot and Anna are all that matter
                        to me now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Barbara stands before the cramped porcelain sink. Checkered
           bathroom tiles crisscrossing the floor, walls. Cast-iron
           bathtub, tarnished brass feet. She leans in toward the narrow
           mirror. Grimaces, grabs up a towel. Wipes the smudged lipstick
           at the corner of her mouth. Draws back. Assesses herself.
           Straining to appear like an adult. An etch of dissatisfaction.
           She wills it away. Squares her shoulders.

           INT. TYPING POOL, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- AFTERNOON

           Barbara sits, ramrod-straight, alone, at her desk. Head
           wrapped in bulky IBM headphones. Fingers chattering on the
           Model 01 electric typewriter. Pressed white blouse, hair
           combed severely back. A fierce focus in her gaze. Hammering
           through the work. She reaches reflexively. Takes a pull from
           the Marlboro cigarette burning in the plastic ashtray beside
           a small stack of COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS. Small reward for another
           PAGE completed.

           Flicks a glance across the clustered metal desks, wire-frame
           inboxes, file cabinets. Flicker of a frown. Eyes sticking on -

           - the TWO DOZEN other TYPING GIRLS. Blouses, skirts. Drawn
           to the line of windows across the opposite wall of the room.
           Muggy sunlight streaming in. Barbara reaches to the wax
           cylinder Dictaphone on her desk. Flips the switch on the
           side. 

           Stopping the playback. Drags the headphones from her ears.
           Becoming aware of the -
           ROARING CROWD

           - eddying in through the open windows. She squints. Lays the
           headphones atop a rumpled manila file folder. Pushes to her
           feet.

           Wends her way across the room, weaving between the clumped
           desks, abandoned ringing telephones, cigarettes twisting
           smoke from ash trays. Draws into the murky warmth of the
           windows, sidles up alongside the TWENTY other TYPING GIRLS.
           Her breath catching in her throat. Through the WINDOW -

           - below, spreading out in a churning, seething ocean, tens
           of THOUSANDS of PEOPLE. Unbridled jubilation filling the
           streets. Ticker tape, confetti fluttering in a blizzard.

           SUPER: "August 15, 1945. Victory Over Japan Day."

           Barbara stares, floored by the sight of it. EMILY, a blonde
           TYPIST, 19, willowy, sobbing in joy. Overwhelmed. 

                                 TYPIST EMILY
                        Look at all the Marines.

           CORA, hard-edged, brunette, beside her. Squinting downward.

                                 TYPIST CORA
                        We should be down there with them.

           Barbara, transfixed. Numbed by the grandeur of it. Twists
           back as -

                                 DONALD BLACK (O.S.)
                        Go on, go celebrate, girls.

           - DONALD BLACK, 47, Editor, tie loosened, Oxford shirt
           unbuttoned, flabby face already flushed with whiskey, smirks.
           The TYPING GIRLS eagerly drawing back. Hustling to collect
           their purses. Barbara registers them. Breaking off in
           CHATTERING pairs and groups. She stirs.

           Jason Epstein, freshly arrived with the chipped-up metal
           mail cart, jammed with rumpled manila envelopes, stopped
           short in the doorway by the scrambling girls. Eyes sticking
           on the new girl, all by herself -

           - Barbara, as she draws her gaze back to her desk. The roaring
           tumult at her back. Unfinished work. Flick of a glance at
           the other departing TYPISTS as she peels away from the window.

           Donald draws to the smoggy glass. Gazes down upon the churning
           CROWD outside. Tosses a hazy glance back as Barbara drags
           her chair back. Picking up her headphones.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Go on, sweetheart.
           She draws up short. Glances over at him, self-conscious. Had
           not wanted to be noticed.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I should finish these dictations.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        They can't be that important.

           She looks back down at the typewriter. Uncertain. Half-
           transcribed letter curling out over the metal IBM case. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        He marked them "urgent."

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        He sent them to the typing pool.

           He pushes away from the window. Condescending smirk.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Go. Enjoy yourself. Make some lonely
                        sailor happy to be home. 

           Jason Epstein, in the doorway, flinches. Barbara, stung. 

           INT. CHUMLEY'S SPEAKEASY, WEST VILLAGE -- EVENING

           Barbara hunches on a chewed-up mahogany barstool. Ensconced
           in a babble of boisterous VOICES, sweaty warmth, cigarette
           smoke. Straw strewing the sticky hardwood floor. 

           Jostled by a WOMAN, 24, peach-colored summer dress, blonde
           locks slightly tangled, flushed in the face from the empty
           Heineken, bottle a froth of suds, LAUGHING at something the
           scrawny YOUNG MAN, 26, is telling her. Oblivious to Barbara. 

           Barbara, eyes catching on Alice, pink-cheeked, LAUGHING,
           surrounded by a CIRCLE of YOUNG MEN in crisp ARMY UNIFORMS,
           NAVY WHITES, hair combed beneath their caps. Riveted by her.
           Alice, the blossoming flower of the party, reveling in the
           attention. She tosses a glance in Barbara's direction. Motions
           for Barbara to join them.

           Barbara, self-conscious, turns abruptly back. Reaches for
           her sweating bottle of Heineken, untouched. Cocktail napkin
           clinging to it as she lifts it to her lips. Drinks. MAN, 32,
           rumpled seersucker suit, tossing a glance at her. He grins.
           SAYS something to her. Has to SHOUT over the DIN. She musters
           a flicker of a smile back at him. Looks away.

           Catches her own EYES in the foggy MIRROR behind the jumbled
           bar. Awkward. Etch of melancholy. Hunched against the crowd.
           Surrounded on all sides by teeming jubilation. Very much
           conscious of how out of place, alone, she is in this crowd.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. BAKERY COUNTER, STATION AMSTERDAM CENTRAAL -- DAY

           Otto leans across the smudged glass of the baker's counter.
           Loud DUTCH WOMEN waiting with tickets, a BOY, 4, stretching
           from his mother's hand to peer in at the loaves of sweet
           breads, zeeuwse bolus pastries flecked with cinnamon, brown
           sugar. Otto shows the portly BAKER, 61, grizzled, the rumpled
           PHOTOGRAPH of Margot and Anne. The Baker squints, shakes his
           head.

           Otto nods. Turns. Shuffles toward the Women. Shows it to
           them. Two of them ignore him. The third flicks a fleeting
           glance at the PHOTOGRAPH, shakes her head. Disdain toward
           this returned stranger.

           He nods to himself. Shambles toward the door. Exhaustion
           beginning to weigh on his stooped shoulders. The Boy stares
           after him. Lifts a hand to wave. His mother tugs him sharply
           back. Admonishing.

           EXT. NEWSSTAND, AMSTERDAM -- DAY

           He hunches beneath the rippling awning of a newsstand. Sun
           washing down across his tattered coat. He squints at the
           taped-up newspaper columns, LISTS of returned REFUGEES. Names
           in smeary newsprint. Runs his thumb down the column of names. 

           Draws a breath. Steps back. Wrestles out the rumpled
           PHOTOGRAPH of Margot and Anne to show to the NEWSSTAND
           PROPRIETOR, 42. He squints at Otto, the picture. Shakes his
           head. 

           INT. RED CROSS OFFICE -- DAY

           Otto pushes and jostles his way into the muggy warmth of the
           office, jammed with other anxious MEN in tattered, ragged
           coats, WOMEN, gaunt-faced, tangled hair, mildewed shawls
           draped around their shoulders. Tear-streaked CHILDREN
           snuffling, bawling through the babble. 

           He squints through the haze toward the folding wooden tables
           at the front of the room. RED CROSS WOMEN in fraying gray
           uniforms and matching caps straining to hear over the SHOUTING
           BABBLE of the room, leafing through ledgers, checking names. 

           Otto, jolted, exhaustion weighing, hobbles out of line.
           Drawing to the long, rumpled lists tacked up on the cracked
           plaster walls. He squints at the smeary typewritten names.
           Shuffles to the next column, shouldered by a BURLY MAN, 66,
           with thinning hair, jowly cheeks, hooded eyes. Otto squints.
           Skimming his way down the column. Eyes sticking on TWO NAMES.

           Annelies Marie Frank (X)

           Margot Betti Frank (X)

           He stares at their names. The X SIGNS beside each of them.
           He is motionless. 
           The Burly Man shuffles around him, jostles him. Otto staggers.
           Catches himself against the wall. He is trembling. Face
           pallid, drained of color. 

           He turns, pasty, foggy-eyed. Pushes, shimmies his way urgently
           back through the jumbled sweaty MEN and WOMEN calling out,
           straining to be heard over the BABBLE. Otto draws to the
           folding table. Catches himself against the edge of it. Jolting
           the PORTLY WOMAN, 31, behind the desk. She squints up at him
           through smudged glasses. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Who was it who gave the information
                        about Margot and Anna Frank? What
                        was his name?

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE, LAREN NEIGHBORHOOD -- AFTERNOON

           Otto waits on the doorstep. Raps again on the green door.
           Paint chips flaking, leprous, flittering to the cement stoop.
           He squints upward toward the sheet-metal sky as a light
           drizzle begins to fall gently across his face, the shoulders
           of his jacket. He clasps his hands in front of him, taut,
           anxious. He raps on the door again, brisk, sharp. He draws
           back. Squints across the impassive windows, reflecting back
           the clattering street cars, guttural diesel delivery truck,
           plumes of black exhaust. 

           His eyes stick on the faintest movement beyond the reflection.
           Lace sash settling back into place. He reaches, raps on the
           door another time. A CLACK from the other side. Deadbolt
           drawing back. The door shudders, drags open. 

           LIN BRILLESLIJPER, 33, her own face somber, gaunt, shadowed
           and hollowed, wool shawl draped around her narrow shoulders,
           squints out at him in the pale afternoon glare. Darkness
           swallowing the entryway behind her. She looks upon him with
           a taut-faced, somber certainty. She knows why he is here.
           She gently pushes the door wider for him to come in. He does
           not move for a moment. Frozen by the admission in her silence.

           INT. KITCHEN, BRILLESLIJPER TOWNHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           Otto sits, hollow and numb, at her kitchen table. She sits
           across from him with a steaming cup of tea. She cradles it
           for warmth. Her eyes rove around the small room, grungy
           porcelain kitchen tiles, banged-up cupboards, cabinets,
           countertop empty save for a canister of Pickwick tea. He
           gazes at the pale sunlight shafting in through the dirty
           window over the sink. She follows his eyes. Settles on the
           puddle of brightness on the bare tile floor. 

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER
                        I had a kitchen that I loved in
                        Watergraafsmeer. I had painted all
                        the cabinets red. 
           She pushes out a breath. Picks up her teacup, blows at the
           steam. She takes a sip. She sets it back in the saucer. Pain
           in her eyes, loss of her own. She regards him. He is silent.
           Motionless. Shell of a man.

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        During the nights, they would hold
                        each other for warmth. Margot would
                        sing lullabies. "Mieke, hou je vast,"
                        "Papegaaitje leef je nog?" I can
                        still hear her little voice.

           Faintest ghost of a sad smile at her lips.

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        Later, when she became too weak, it
                        was Anna who would sing to her. They
                        always had each other.

           He drags his gaze to her. 

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        Margot was hopeful that they would
                        see you again. Anna, she was certain
                        of it.

           She avoids his eyes, fiddles with the dangling chain of the
           tea ball at the edge of her saucer. 

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        They both came down with typhus. At
                        the end. But they were still together.

           She drags her eyes to meet his. Grief weighing upon her,
           swelling up out of her all at once, irrepressible, the memory
           revived. Her eyes watery, stinging with tears.

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        They looked like frozen little birds
                        when we found them. 

           She reaches out, impulsively, and tries to take his hands.
           He draws back. He pushes back from the table, wooden chair
           legs grunting on the tile. Pale, gutted, hollow, his tea
           untouched, he grasps the table, stiffly pushes to his feet.
           His hand, flat against the surface, trembles. He looks ill.
           Falters. Catches himself. Lin watches him in agony.

                                 LIN BRILLESLIJPER (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry, Otto. I'm so sorry.
                        They were beautiful girls. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- EVENING

           Otto hunches at the foot of his bed. Does not register the
           gentle tap at his door. It pushes open. Drawing into the
           weak light from the lamp between the beds, Miep draws up
           short. Stares at him. A broken man. 
           He drags his foggy gaze up to her. He has no words. She is
           at a loss.

           She steps to the bed. Reaches out to place a hand on his
           shoulder. He flinches at the touch. Shies away from it.
           Unwanted. Unable to process, feel anything. His smeary eyes
           land on the Opekta crate, Anne's DIARY beside it.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I want you to take those things away
                        and destroy them.

           Miep stares at him. Twists to regard the crate. Grief
           flickering across her face. She looks back to him. Strains
           to maintain her composure. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Perhaps in the morning, once you
                        have had a chance -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Take them away.

           She jolts, draws back. Startled. He squints up at her with
           burning venom, loss, pain. Her lips tremble, tears beginning
           to sting at her eyes. He is gutted. Empty.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Everything. Everything is lost.

           Miep, unraveling, twists away from him. Clogs clacking on
           the hardwood floor. Hefts the Opekta crate into her arms.
           Notices the checkered diary on the bed. Fumbles with the
           crate, grabs the diary off the bed, balances it on top of
           the crate. Twists back. Her eyes catch on Otto. 

           She stumbles. Diary flipping off the top of the crate to
           CLAP to the floor. He flinches. Miep grimaces, struggles to
           pick it up. Hurries from the room. His eyes settle on the
           empty patch of floor where the diary landed. Anger rising.

           INT. WAREHOUSE HOLDING AREA, LEVANTKADE CAMP -- DAY

           Otto pushes through the babbling noise, dingy darkness broken
           by weak light bulbs strung up on naked wires, dirty orange
           light washing down across the ragged DUTCH MEN, clumps of
           straw that are their grungy bunks. Tin canteens, scattered
           chicken bones gnawed to the gristle. RAGGED DUTCHMAN, 24,
           glimpsing Otto, hobbles to his feet, SHOUTING after him.

           SUPER: "Levantkade Detention Camp. Amsterdam, Netherlands."

           Otto, smeary-eyed, weighted down with exhaustion, fury, grief,
           staggers away from him. He squints at the haze of grubby
           faces, resentful eyes tracking him, distrusting. Anger, venom,
           loss, pushing him forward. He draws to the end of the section,
           cordoned off with fraying rope. Turns back. 
           Drags his eyes across the MEN barking at each other, slapping
           each other around among the straw. Shouting after him.

           Eyes sticking on a MAN hunched against one of the gnawed-up
           wooden pillars, his back partially turned to Otto. Filthy
           white work shirt, jumbled graying hair, head resting against
           the rotting plank. Rage flickering up in his eyes, Otto surges
           toward the MAN. Trips on the slumped sleeping BODY of another
           MAN. Stumbles. Regains his balance, heaves his way to the
           Man.

           The man JOLTS, gives a startled grunt as Otto GRASPS him by
           the shoulders, hauling him, dragging, stumbling up, SLAMMING
           him back against the pillar. He coughs, feebly tries to shield
           himself. Squints back at Otto, grungy, thick-faced. Willhelm
           Van Maaren, now 50, the Opekta Jam warehouse manager.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        How could you. How could you?

           Otto SLAMS him against the pillar. Van Maaren staggers. Pushes
           at Otto, tries to shove him away. Otto a brick wall of boiling
           rage, grief, welling over. SLAPS Van Maaren across the face.
           He staggers. Otto grabs him SLAMS him back against the wooden
           pillar. 

           Grasps his shoulders, ragged shirt, holds him up, pinning
           him. Draws back. Hand clenched into a trembling fist. Van
           Maaren tries to lift a feeble hand, shield himself. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        They are all gone. Because of you. 

                                 VAN MAAREN
                        I did nothing. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        My girls. My little girls. 

                                 VAN MAAREN
                        I swear. I told them nothing.

           Otto, eyes burning, penetrating, skewering Van Maaren. Loss
           gutting him, riving him from inside. Resolve faltering. 

           HANDS seize Otto from behind. Two DUTCH GUARDS, clubs drawn,
           dragging him back. His feet give out. He stumbles, staggers.
           Strains to regain his footing. Heaves toward Van Maaren.

           The Guards WRENCH him back. SMACKING his legs, his back,
           with their CLUBS. Otto stumbles. Coughing. CLUBBED across
           the side of the face. Ears all at once ringing. He is wrenched
           back. Van Maaren stares after him. Otto, stumbling, a
           shuddering sob wrenching through him as the guards YANK him,
           drag him through the JEERING PRISONERS. Shouting. Babbling
           fishbowl of tumult smearing by around him. 
           EXT. SIDEWALK, PLANTAGEKADE CANAL -- NIGHT

           Otto stumbles, staggers, smears his way, loose footing,
           ambling gait. Eyes hazed, fogged. Grasps a half-drunk brown
           bottle of Bols Genever GIN. Trips on the cobblestone street.
           Regains his footing. Dimly aware of the lights burning in
           windows, townhouses, shimmering off the black water of the
           CANAL, dashing against the fishing boats, barnacled pilings.

           Otto trips again on the uneven curb. Drops the bottle. It
           SHATTERS on the cobblestones. He stares down at the scattered
           broken glass, spreading puddle of gin. He sways. Shudder
           wracking its way through him. Twists back toward the WATER.

           Hazy-eyed, breathing shallowly. He edges toward the canal.
           Feet dragging, Jan's borrowed shoes now sticky with gin. He
           shambles to a halt. Gazes out across the water. He reaches
           into his pocket. Hands shaking as he wrestles out the wrinkled
           PHOTOGRAPH of Margot and Anne. He stares at it in the dark.
           Margot, studious in her spectacles. Anne's bright smiling
           face, dark hair ruffled by the wind around her ears.

           He holds it out over the water. Breeze gusting up from the
           water. He loses his grasp. Lurches forward. Snaps the
           PHOTOGRAPH back from the wind. Loses his footing. Stumbles.
           Catches himself. Just short of falling in. He stares down at
           the water, dashing, playing against the rotting pilings. 

           He gazes back out, hopelessness weighing. Eyes catching on
           the splash of warm light washing out from the arched
           brickwork, stained glass windows, of the Nederlands-
           Israëlietische Hoofdsynagoge SYNAGOGUE across the canal from
           him. He stares at it, ragged. 

           INT. SANCTUARY, DUTCH CENTRAL SYNAGOGUE -- NIGHT

           Otto slurs his way inside, draws to a halt in the dimness.
           Shallow breaths coming in gin-flavored bursts. He squints
           with hazy eyes, takes in the weather-beaten bimah altar,
           flickering candles on a tarnished gold menorah beside it.
           Sputtering ner tamid eternal flame hanging over the Aron
           Kodesh Torah Ark. 

           He draws a ragged breath. Hobbles forward. Grasps the back
           of the banged-up wooden bench, guides himself with it. Limping
           as he steps around the side. Draws up. Summoning energy.
           Shuffles into the aisle. Drops heavily onto the bench. He
           clasps his knees with his hands.

           Gazes forward. Bleary-eyed. Head swimming in a murk of alcohol
           and grief. He draws a breath, sniffs. Shuts his eyes. He
           tries to pray. Lips moving silently. He trails off. Drags
           open his eyes. Slumps back into his seat. He becomes aware
           of a MAN at the opposite end of the bench. Watching him.

           The Man pushes to his feet. Wood wheezing beneath him. Turns.
           Begins to shuffle out of the aisle. His gaze raking back
           across Otto. He stops short. Squinting. Otto turns forward. 
           Aware of the man's eyes upon him. Shuffling footsteps drawing
           closer. The man coming toward him. Draws up beside him.

           Otto looks up at him. JACOB SOETENDORPSTRAAT, 31. Head covered
           in a kippah, clasping Tehillim, the Book of Psalms. He is a
           RABBI. He reaches into his coat breast pocket. Drags out a
           white handkerchief. Offers it to Otto. Otto squints at him.
           He nods at Otto's feet.

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        You are bleeding.

           Otto looks down. His wool socks, threadbare trouser cuffs
           flecked with shards of broken brown glass, spattered droplets
           of gin, blood. Otto shifts his legs, tries to hide his feet.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is fine.

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        They will become infected.

           Otto gives a gruff nod, turns forward. The Rabbi lingers.
           Otto flicks a glance back up at him. The handkerchief. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I am all right. Thank you. 

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        Forgive me for saying so. But you do
                        not look like you are all right.

           Otto looks forward again. Eyes stinging, burning. Bleary. He
           squeezes them shut. Drags in a ragged breath. He startles at
           the wheeze of the old wood, shifting weight, as the Rabbi
           lowers himself onto the bench beside him. They sit in silence.

           The Rabbi folds the handkerchief, places it gently on his
           own knee. He gazes across the other empty benches, the
           flickering candles. Hollowed brick alcoves, cracked stones.

                                 RABBI JACOB (CONT'D)
                        Had they known to bomb this place, I
                        imagine they would have. We concealed
                        it as a school. A miracle, really,
                        that anything of us survived.

           The Rabbi regards Otto, his eyes still shut. His gaze sticks
           on Otto's exposed arm, jutting from the sleeve of his wool
           jacket. Barest blurry hint of black numbers, lettering
           TATTOOED into his flesh. B-9174.

                                 RABBI JACOB (CONT'D)
                        You are a survivor then.

           Otto drags open his eyes. He sees where the Rabbi is looking.
           He fumbles, drags the cuff of his jacket sleeve back down,
           covering the TATTOO. The Rabbi, focused on him now.
                                 RABBI JACOB (CONT'D)
                        What you have seen, what you carry
                        with you, is all the more precious.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        You have no idea what I carry with
                        me.

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        It is our legacy. Ours to pass on,
                        to bear witness, for future
                        generations -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        My daughters are dead. I have no
                        family. I have nothing to pass on. 

           The Rabbi shuts his mouth. He notices Otto's hands, quivering.
           Ropey veins protruding from his neck. The Rabbi, dry-mouthed,
           pushes down a swallow.

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        Alav HaShalom. May they rest in peace.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I should have died. Everything I
                        loved was taken away from me and I
                        did not die. Why? For what purpose
                        would I be spared when they were
                        not?

           Otto reaches. Grasps the back of the bench in front of him.
           Pushes, heaving to his feet. He winces, glass shards digging
           into his flesh. He stumbles. Sits heavily back down. Huffing.
           He grits his teeth. Avoids the Rabbi's eyes. 

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        What were their names?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Margot and Annaleis. Anna.

           He breaks. Name sticking in his throat. He looks away. 

                                 RABBI JACOB
                        They are beautiful names. Thank you
                        for sharing them with me. That,
                        perhaps, is purpose enough.

           He places his hands on his knees, pushes to his feet. Lays
           the handkerchief gently on the bench beside Otto.

                                 RABBI JACOB (CONT'D)
                        For your feet.

           He shuffles away. Otto stares after him. Eyes dragging to
           the handkerchief. Left in a neat, folded square.
           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Otto shambles into the room, smearing against the peeling
           wallpaper, ragged handkerchief wrapped around his ankle,
           spotted with blood. He braces himself against the wall. Pushes
           forward. Exhaustion dragging at him. He heaves his way to
           the bed, grasps the metal-railed frame to support himself.
           Limps his way around and finally drops heavily onto the
           mattress. 

           He sits. Glances at the smoldering fire in the small hearth,
           embers reduced to mostly ash. Dawn light washing in through
           the hazy window. He drags tired eyes back toward the lamp,
           nightstand. Sticking on the second bed. Opekta CRATE, red-
           checkered DIARY atop it, brought back into the room. He stares
           at it. Too tired to process, absorb, move.

                                 MIEP GIES (O.S.)
                        I could not make myself destroy them.

           He gives a start. Looks to the doorway. She stands, rumpled,
           ensconced in a sleeping gown and a threadbare sweater, hair
           tangled from sleep. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        It felt like I was destroying their
                        memories. Their lives.

           Her eyes, stuck on the Opekta crate, drag to Otto. She takes
           in his appearance, filthy clothes, bruises turning to angry
           welts on his face, neck, arms. Blood-spotted legs.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        What happened to you?

           He draws a ragged breath. Shakes his head.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is nothing.

           She opens her mouth to say more. Closes it. Senses he should
           not be pushed. She steps into the room, to the fire. Picks
           up the iron poker from the hook by the hearth, and jabs and
           stirs the embers, coaxing a few sputtering flames out of
           them. He watches her, glassy-eyed, listless. 

           She draws back. Regards him. Bundles her sweater more tightly
           around herself. Withdrawing to the doorway. Hesitates.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        I'll put some tea on.

           He nods. She lingers another moment. Then ducks out. He sits
           for a moment, fire snapping and popping in the hearth. He
           stares across the small room at the Opekta crate. He shuts
           his eyes. Exhaustion blanketing him. 
           He plants his knuckles to the mattress, labors and pushes
           himself to his feet. Winces, glass, wounded feet, sore,
           hobbling him. He limps his way painfully across, draws to
           the second bed. Stares down at the crate, DIARY. Scraps of
           paper peeking from its edges. Loop of her handwriting.

           He is wracked with a shuddering, uncontrollable sob. Boiling
           over. He SHOVES the Opekta crate. Sends it TOPPLING to the
           floor. The DIARY tumbles, SLAPS to the bare hardwood. Loose
           pages, a rumpled tongue of PHOTOGRAPHS, taken at a PHOTO
           BOOTH, sliding out. Anne's young, smiling face staring up at
           him.

           He stands, stricken. Fire flickering, crackling, lapping his
           face in warm yellow-orange. He reaches with trembling hands,
           fumbles with the LOOSE PAGE, PHOTOGRAPHS. Picks them up.
           Stares down at them. Eyes moist. Firelight playing in them,
           reflected back. He holds them, shaking. Blurry eyes dragging
           over her looping cursive handwriting. READING Anne's DIARY
           for the first time. "Dear Kitty..."

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BARBARA'S BEDROOM, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Barbara lies awake. Morning light swelling in through the
           simple white sash. Small desk pushed against the window.
           Bookshelves now crowding the walls. Jammed with Gertrude
           Stein, Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse. Jane Austen's Sense
           and Sensibility. Rumpled copy of Jane Eyre, yellowed pages
           fanned open, on the small, banged-up bedside table. COLLEGE
           TEXTBOOKS on literary theory, criticism. William Strunk's
           The Elements of Style.

           The potted orchid wilting slightly. Shriveled. Barbara,
           distant gaze fixed on the slightly-faded PHOTOGRAPH set back
           on her desk in a pearl-white frame - her SISTER and GROOM at
           their wedding. Barbara, 17, pushed back among the bridesmaids. 

           Barbara stirs, squints blearily at the small brass-edged
           General Electric alarm CLOCK propped on the nightstand.
           6:41AM. Becoming aware of the muffled clap of kitchen
           cupboards. Clattering dishes. Sizzling. Bluish haze of bacon
           smoke seeping in. 

           She frowns. Drags back the snarled sheet.

           INT. KITCHEN, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Barbara draws to the mouth of the hallway. Peers in through
           the open kitchen doorway. Freezes. 

           Cramped room lashed with bright muggy sunlight, captured in
           the bluish smoke hanging in the air. Skillet snapping, popping
           at the stove. DEAN CONWAY, 21, handsome, hair smashed with
           sleep, rumpled white undershorts, shirt, stands with a
           spatula. Eyes vacant, glassy. Tormented. 
           He stirs. Draws his focus back to the stove. Reaches to push
           the sizzling bacon with the spatula. Floorboard wheezing
           beneath Barbara, wrapped in her rumpled sleeping gown. He
           gives a start. Glances sharply over at her. Squints. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        Who are you?

           She blinks. Taken aback.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I live here.

           He glances at the sizzling skillet. Down at himself. Self-
           conscious all at once. Embarrassed. Flustered. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        Excuse me, ma'am. Alice didn't tell
                        me she had a sister.

           Barbara drags her gaze to the sticky wine glasses left out
           on the cramped kitchen table from last night. Understanding.
           Flicker of a scowl. Uncomfortable, alone with this stranger.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        We're not. We're just friends. We
                        grew up together.

           She shifts under his gaze. Tries to avoid it, deflect his
           attention.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Your breakfast is burning.

           He looks back at the skillet. Grimaces. Casts around for the
           greasy plate perched on the countertop. Reaches to grab it
           up. Plucking hot pieces of bacon from the skillet. She watches
           him. As stilted, caught off-guard, as she is.

           He switches off the gas-flame burner. Wipes his hands on a
           grungy dishtowel. Awkward. Extends a hand -

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        Dean Conway.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Barbara. Zimmerman.

           He draws back. Assessing the greasy skillet, smashed paper
           towels, soaked dishrag. Aware of her gaze upon him.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        There are more dishtowels in the
                        cupboard with the cups.

           He flashes her a sheepish smile. Begins gathering dishes.
                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        Sorry for the mess. I just got in
                        last night. We met at Chumley's.

           Her eyes linger on him as he neatly stacks the plates, sets
           them into the cast-iron sink. An orderly discipline to him.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        You're a soldier, then.

           He stiffens, glances back at her. Follows her eyes to the
           TATTOO, triangular, yellow, blue, red, thunderbolt in the
           center, exposed beneath his sleeve. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        Eleventh Armored Division. Normandy,
                        Belgium, and Austria. 

           She meets his gaze, shyly. He turns back, brittle. Wriggles
           charring toast out of a smudged silver Proctor toaster. She
           glances back down the hall. Alice's bedroom door still shut.

           He lifts the dented coffee pot. Pours a steaming ribbon of
           coffee into two china cups. Lifts one. Offers it to her. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        You must get tired of people asking
                        you what it was like.

           He presses a taut line of a smile at her.

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        I get tired of the people who ask
                        but don't really want to know.

           She takes the coffee from him. Cradles it with her hands.
           Irked slightly by the presumption. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I want to know.

           He tugs open a cupboard. Reaching down another cup. Tosses a
           glance back at her. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        No you don't.

           Places it on the table. Lifts the coffee pot to pour. Glances
           down the hallway toward Alice's door.

                                 DEAN CONWAY (CONT'D)
                        You want to hear what she wants to
                        hear. How we all went over there, we
                        looked evil in the eye, and we
                        destroyed it with our bare hands,
                        and now we're back to drink and
                        celebrate.
           He avoids her eyes. Turns to the sink and switches on the
           tap. Grabs up the dishrag. She regards him. He grimaces.

                                 DEAN CONWAY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. That was out of line.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I was supposed to be married. 

           He glances sharply back at her. Taken off-guard.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        My sister was last spring, then me
                        this year. We had it all planned
                        out. Like a storybook. He was the
                        son of my father's business partner.
                        He's - pleasant. A gentleman. Quite
                        wealthy. I could have lived a very
                        comfortable life as a housewife,
                        just like my sister.

           He looks over his shoulder at her. Eyes capturing the
           streaming sunlight. She takes a sip of coffee.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I called it off the week before. I
                        couldn't go through with it.

           She meets his eyes.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to be comfortable. I
                        want to make a difference.

           She holds his gaze.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I want to know what it was like.

           He shuts off the tap. Stands, rigid. His back to her.

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        It will haunt me for the rest of my
                        life. 

           He draws a breath. Stares into the streaming sunlight. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY (CONT'D)
                        We were so goddamn scared. The only
                        thing that kept us going was the
                        knowledge that if we quit, it would
                        follow us home. What we saw in
                        Mauthausen, the camps, those poor
                        tortured people, we would see here
                        in America. And that was -
                        unthinkable. 

           He meets Barbara's gaze with desperate eyes.
                                 DEAN CONWAY (CONT'D)
                        I was seventeen when I went over
                        there. Every day I wished I hadn't. 

           She blinks. Taken off-guard. Hunkered against the counter,
           he looks young. A vulnerable boy. Lost. They both JOLT as -

           - Alice's bedroom door mewls open. Alice drawing out, hair
           tousled, wrapped in a bedsheet. Stops short, seeing them.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        Well. It looks like I'm the last one
                        to the party.

           Dean abruptly shifts. Twists away. Mask of false brightness
           in the smile he beams at Alice. Lifts the third coffee cup. 

                                 DEAN CONWAY
                        After all that wine, I thought I'd
                        cook us up some breakfast.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        Such a gentleman.

           He flicks a glance at Barbara as he steps past her. Eyes
           raking away. Tormented. Alice kisses him. Oblivious. 

           Barbara, moved. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- DAY

           Otto sits at his desk. Pale autumn light leaching through
           the smeary windowpane, rain lashing against it in hard,
           speckling whips and spattered droplets. He pins the DIARY
           open with one hand. Glasses reflecting back her spidery
           scrawl. Steam twisting gently from a teacup. Wax paper open
           around a half-eaten brown-bread-and-cheese sandwich, milky
           half-pint of buttermilk in a bottle. 

           He is riveted to the page. Mouth tugged in a slight smile.
           His eyes, focused, darting across her words. Eager. His face
           fleshed out, less pallid. He is more alive now. He pauses,
           pinning the DIARY open. Gropes around for the FOUNTAIN PEN
           left by the blotter on his desk. Drags over a spiral-bound
           black notebook, opens it to a page of his own chicken-scratch.

           He pushes the nib against the paper. Grimaces. Shakes ink
           into it. Glances back at the DIARY page. Scrawls into his
           own notebook, COPYING over a passage from Anne: 

           "It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem
           so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I
           still believe, in spite of everything..." 

           He loses his grip on the page. Grimaces. Pins it down again.
           Squints, eyes darting, excited, over her words. 
           Resumes COPYING:

           "...that people are truly good at heart."

           He grasps for the BLOTTER. Lays the fountain pen down.
           Carefully presses the blotter against his writing. Dries it.
           Drags the blotter back. Reads it over. Brightness flickering
           in his eyes. He rereads the passage in the DIARY. Marveling
           at it. He sits back. Pages flipping shut. He wedges the tip
           of the pen into them, pinning his place. 

           He peels his glasses off. Eyes soaking in the puddled
           afternoon light, streaming rain down the windowpane. Lifted.
           Inspired by his daughter's words. Becoming aware of a fuzzy,
           droning VOICE from down the hall, a RADIO on. 

           He blinks, shakes himself. Lost in another world. He gathers
           the wax paper of his lunch. Lifts one last chunk of cheese
           sandwich into his mouth. Drags open a drawer, gently places
           the DIARY into it, sliding it shut. 

           Reaches for his work binders, account ledgers, mostly RED
           INK. A half-typed letter jutting from the Underwood typewriter
           on the desk. Chewing, he slows. Listening to the RADIO VOICE.

                                 JAN ROMEIN (BBC RADIO NEWS)
                        ...we have witnessed the degradation
                        of the human spirit. The worst crime
                        of that abominable spirit...

           Otto, an etch of a frown. Braces himself against the desk.
           Pushes back, chair legs grinding on the bare hardwood floor.

           INT. MAIN OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Otto draws into the doorway. Pale light puddling across Miep,
           desk besieged in stacks of accounting ledgers, papers clipped
           together, chattering at her Underwood typewriter. Lucky Strike
           cigarette jammed into the ashtray, flecked with ash, butts.
           Bep Voskuijl, 26 now, seated at the other desk, flipping
           through a manila file-folder, drawer dragged open at her
           knee. Fuzzy VOICE issuing from the Volksempfänger RADIO beside
           her. 

                                 JAN ROMEIN (BBC RADIO NEWS)
                        ...the destruction of life and talent,
                        only because of a senseless desire
                        to destroy.

           Miep drags the rumpled page from her typewriter. Absently
           grabs for her cigarette. Eyes sticking on Otto in the doorway.
           He gazes at the RADIO. Expression clouded. Joy, warmth from
           reading the DIARY now leached away. Miep flicks a glance at
           the RADIO, Bep, oblivious, squinting at a rumpled carbon-
           paper invoice in her folder.
                                 JAN ROMEIN (BBC RADIO NEWS) (CONT'D)
                        No matter in what form inhumanity
                        may lay traps for us, we will fall
                        into them...

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Bep. Could you turn that off please.

           Bep, distracted, glances up. Eyes sticking on Otto. Flustered,
           she reaches, carbon-paper invoice sliding out of her lap,
           fluttering to the floor as she snaps OFF the RADIO. Flushing
           slightly in the cheeks.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        Sorry, Mr. Frank. I didn't realize
                        it was loud enough to disturb you.

           He shakes himself. Troubled etch creasing his forehead. Drags
           his gaze to Bep as she reaches, fumbles to retrieve the paper.
           Miep watches him, cigarette clamped between her fingers,
           poised over the ashtray. He drags his gaze back to the RADIO.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Do you share that man's views?

           Bep, skewered, flicks a glance at Miep. Uncertain of herself.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        I don't believe in everything that
                        he says. But I think he makes some
                        interesting points.

           He regards her. Miep watching him.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        You believe the Germans are evil?

           Bep is confused by the question. Not even a question.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        After what you went through, don't
                        you?

           Miep flicks a hard glance at her. Bep absorbs it, swallows.
           Did not mean to speak out of turn. Cheeks flushed. Otto, her
           words hanging in the air, gazes at the puddle of pale light
           on the floor, rippling from the rain outside.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        A few of them, yes. The rest, I do
                        not know. Complacent, perhaps.
                        Willfully ignorant. Afraid, certainly.
                        But to see evil in all of them is to
                        risk seeing evil in everyone.

           He drags his gaze up to her, meets her troubled eyes. 
                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I, of course, was born in Frankfurt. 

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        I didn't mean -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        We have more in common with them
                        than not. 

           Bep glances at Miep again. Uncomfortable to be having this
           conversation. Miep watches only Otto. Bep shifts in her seat.
           Hand pinning the carbon paper invoice to her lap. He becomes
           aware of the effect he is having on her. Antagonizing her.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        You may turn it back on. I did not
                        mean to intercede. 

           He pushes away from the scratched-up doorframe. Turning.
           Bep, embarrassed, explanation surging up out of her.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        He means well. 

           Otto stops short. Looks back at her. Bep, cheeks burning, no
           retreating now. Miep's skewering gaze upon her.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL (CONT'D)
                        He has nothing but sympathy for what
                        you - for what we all went through.
                        He is hosting a symposium on Thursday.
                        I was going to go. If you wanted to
                        join me. You could hear more of what
                        he believes.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Bep.

           Bep cringes. Aware she is overstepping. Otto regards her.
           Dry-mouthed now, but she persists.

                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        He is becoming quite popular. 

           He drags his gaze to Miep. She stares back at him. Bep, the
           flustered youth in their midst. The voice of the future. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Is he.

           INT. CINEMA HOUSE, THEATER TUSCHINSKI -- NIGHT

           Otto stands smashed against the wall by the SWEATY, JEERING
           CROWD, jamming the aisles, folding seats, on their feet to
           see over each other. 
           He can barely make out, beyond the LANKY MAN in front of
           him, the WOMAN, 20, beside him, the wash of cigarette-murked
           spotlight bathing JAN ROMEIN, 53, long-faced, rumpled grungy
           suit, perspiring, stirred-up, energized by the kinetic fervor,
           anxious agitation of the crowd.

                                 JAN ROMEIN
                        We are still just as far away from
                        this kind of democracy as we were
                        before the war. We have won nothing.

           He BARKS out at them, fire in his eyes. Relishing the effect
           he is having on them. His acolytes, followers. Otto watches
           not Romein but the YOUNG MEN, WOMEN, shoulder-to-shoulder,
           soaked in sweat, in the cinema seats.

                                 JAN ROMEIN (CONT'D)
                        We have lost the battle against the
                        beast in man. We have lost because
                        we have not been able to substitute
                        something positive for it. And that
                        is why we will lose again.

           Spittle-flecked mouths, veins standing out in their necks as
           they SHOUT, nod. Venomous. Eager to be stirred, enlivened.
           Bep, among them, transfixed. Otto watches her. Unsettled.
           She surges forward in her seat. SHOUTING with the others.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- DAWN

           Otto sits in a wash of pale morning light, hunched at the
           tiny, cramped desk. Murky gray rain streaming down the grungy
           glass. Anne's PAPERS are laid out all around him, the DIARY,
           his own spiral-bound notebook. Wrapped in a weather-worn
           bathrobe, rings beneath his eyes. He has not slept. He
           scribbles with a dull-nibbed pen into his notebook. Pins the
           loose page on the leather blotter, squints at her cursive
           scrawl. 

           He copies over the passage, nib dragging on the paper. He
           halts at the end of it. Eyes sticking on the words he has
           just written. "How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a
           single moment before starting to improve the world."

           He peels off his glasses. Eyes, bleary, unfocused, settling
           on the streaming rain, silvery sky outside. Rumpled bed behind
           him, covers turned back. Opekta crate still resting on the
           other bed. Cramped little room holding him in. He pushes out
           a breath. Reaching a decision.

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- MORNING

           Freshly showered, hair combed neatly back, eyes still shadowed
           with sleeplessness but a flickering fire within them, Otto
           tugs the canvas dust cover off of the Underwood TYPEWRITER.
           DIARY, loose-leaf pages, bound together with rubber bands,
           placed in the middle of the desk. He tugs the typewriter
           toward him. Leans, squints into its machinery. Glances up as -
           Miep draws into the doorway, small wooden tray, steaming
           teacup, ceramic pot, a plate of fresh strawberries. He musters
           a flicker of a smile for her, distracted, fumbling with the
           bail-bar, rollers. She draws to his desk with the tray, teacup
           chattering, lifts it gently down, places it between his
           stacked papers, chewed-up leather ledgers, spiral-bound
           notebook, leather address book. Notices his fretting.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Is there something I can help you
                        with?

           He finally pries it loose. Reaches, drags a clean, fresh
           sheet of paper off of a neat stack by the wooden inbox. Knobs
           it into the typewriter.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Do you know an address where I can
                        reach the journalist? Jan Romein.

           She draws up short. Taken off-guard. She regards him. He is
           absent to it, reaches, drags the DIARY out from the sheaf of
           loose-leaf papers. Squints through his glasses at the
           typewriter. Becomes aware of her gaze. Stares up at her. She
           shakes herself. Registers the question.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Bep knows his wife. Annie Verschoor.

           He nods. Curt. Businesslike. She draws back. Tucking the
           wooden tray under her arm. She watches him. Focused, fixed,
           flipping open the DIARY, pinning it with his elbow as he
           poises his hands over the Underwood's keys.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure it is wise to engage
                        with him? He seems so - easily
                        provoked.

           He flicks a glance up at her. Returns his penetrating gaze
           to the page clamped in the Underwood.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        The loudest and angriest voice is
                        not the only one that should be heard. 

           He returns his focus to the typewriter. DRILLS out the first
           LINE of TEXT at the top of the blank page: Het Achterhuis,
           Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944. [The Annex:
           Diary Notes Jun 14, 1942 - August 1, 1944]. He drags his
           burning eyes back to the DIARY. SNAPS out, one letter at a
           time - by Annaleis Frank. Strikes the carriage return twice. 

           His fingers HAMMERING across the page, beginning to transcribe
           the DIARY. Miep, drawing back to the door, gazes at him. Sun
           washing in around him like a cloak. His face, his eyes more
           alive than he has been since his return. She allows herself
           a flickering ghost of a smile. 
           Her friend, the man, Otto Frank, beginning to come back.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DONALD BLACK'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY

           Barbara draws to the open doorway. Arms loaded down with two
           bulging manila file-folders, fresh transcriptions. Muggy
           sunlight washing in through the twin vast windowpanes. 

           Shearing across the mahogany desk, awash in jumbled paperwork,
           rumpled MANUSCRIPTS. Twin towering bookshelves jammed with
           leather-spined volumes. Dusty PHOTOGRAPHS in frames. American
           flag in a wooden stand. Pacing through the soupy sunlight,
           cigarette smoke - 

           - Donald Black, pacing, telephone stretched to his ear,
           incensed. Brown suit rumpled, hair disheveled slightly. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                            (into the telephone)
                        I don't care who your father is.
                        It's a paperback edition of a treatise
                        on appeasement.

           He draws up short. Seeing Barbara. Grimaces. Gestures for
           her to come in, leave the dictations on the desk. She steps
           into the hazy room. Donald draws to the window. Glowers out.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        Jack, that's what we're offering.

           She places the two fresh file folders into his wire-frame
           INBOX. Draws back. Hesitates. Watching him. 

           He pushes out a smoky breath. Turns back. Eyes sticking on
           Barbara, still lingering in the doorway.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        I have to go. Think about it.

           He shakes his head. Claps the receiver into its cradle.
           Squints at Barbara. Distracted. 

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Was there something I needed to sign?

           Barbara, caught on the spot. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        No...

           She balks under his hard stare. Summons her courage.
                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I had hoped we might revisit the
                        possibility of my taking an editorial
                        position. 

           He regards her, implacable. She swallows.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I saw the listing for the opening in
                        the break room.

           He snorts, smoke streaming from his nostrils. Leans in over
           the desk to stub out his cigarette. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You think you're better than the
                        typing pool.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I have a background in literature. I
                        feel I could make a difference.

           He scowls at her. Filled with scorn. Drags back his chair. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You typing girls. You've been here
                        what, less than a year?

           He sits heavily. Cushion wheezing beneath him. Assesses her.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        What's a pretty face like yours doing
                        in an office anyway? Surely you've
                        had offers to settle down.

           Barbara flushes. Needled. Perseveres. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I met a soldier. A month ago, after
                        the Victory parade. I think his story
                        is important. A true firsthand account
                        of the wartime experience. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        He got back a month ago and he's
                        already written his memoirs?

           She swallows, caught out.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I thought perhaps we could help him
                        through the process.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You want me to assign an editor to a
                        manuscript that doesn't even exist.
                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I am prepared to work alone. On my
                        own time. I'm quite accustomed to
                        it. 

           Donald rakes his glasses off. Rubs at his bleary eyes.
           Mountains of rumpled papers. He gropes, reflexive, for the
           Marlboro package. Flicks an irritated glance at her. Pushes
           out a weary breath.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        Are you prepared to face the other
                        girls' resentment?

           Barbara blanches. Steeling herself.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        If need be.

           He regards her. A black sheep yearning for a purpose.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        If you find me something that we
                        publish, you may edit it. Under
                        supervision.

           Barbara, swelling with excitement.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Any lapse in your other work, and
                        you can show yourself the door. You're
                        not getting paid to be a book scout.

           She hardens. Enthusiasm blunted. He is already reaching for
           the top file folder in his INBOX. Scowls, impatient, at her.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Something else, sweetheart?

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Only...it would be helpful to have
                        an office of my own.

           He fixes her with a hard stare. Galled by her nerve. 

           INT. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- LATER

           Barbara stands in the office doorway. Gazes in at the blank
           gray area carpeting, naked plaster walls. Empty oak desk.
           Bookcase, shelves dusty, bare. Weak afternoon light leaching
           through the single small window. Musty curtains.  A single
           black-and-white photograph triptych, Ellis Island, Statue of
           Liberty, Empire State Building, frame dusty, propped against
           the wall, left behind by the previous editor. 

           In spite of its humble cheerlessness, Barbara, a flicker of
           a smile, steps in. Cardboard box of her belongings in her
           arms. Potted orchid protruding through the open flaps. 
           She sets it down on the corner of the desk. Draws back.
           Turning slowly to take in the room. Pride, satisfaction,
           swelling. 

           Finally, a space, an office, of her own.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Otto pushes out into the splintered morning light. Hair combed
           back, color returning to his cheeks. He winces at the glare
           of it off the ceramic kitchen tiles. Streaming in through a
           soup of blue cigarette smoke. Eyes finding the sticky plate,
           glaze of applestroop syrup left spattered across it, bread
           crumbs, crumpled napkin where Jan ate. 

           Miep, hunched against the counter, preoccupied, perturbed,
           cigarette twisting smoke from between her fingers, still
           dressed in a rumpled, disheveled bathrobe, looks up at the
           wheeze of his delicate weight on the floorboards. Her eyes
           find his as he draws up short in the doorway. Senses something
           wrong. Uncertain what to make of her. Her breakfast plate,
           his place setting untouched. NEWSPAPER folded beside it.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        He wrote about her. About the diary.

           Otto stares at her. Eyes raking to the NEWSPAPER. He is caught
           up short, unprepared. He takes a faltering step forward.
           Faced with the prospect of a stranger writing about Anne.

           SHORTLY LATER:

           He sits at the table. Plate, toasted bread, small pot of
           appelstroop untouched. Steam twisting from his teacup. His
           hands shake slightly, NEWSPAPER spread open, enveloping him.
           She watches him as he reads. Seated across from him. Anxious.
           She takes a pull from her cigarette. His eyes drag across
           the smeary typescript: 

           "...apparently inconsequential diary by a child embodies all
           the hideousness of fascism." 

           He draws a ragged breath. Unable to read on. His hands
           quivering. He lowers the newspaper, folds it in on itself.
           Miep, riveted to him, awash in a cloud of smoke.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        He calls her "lucid." "Intelligent."
                        "A natural - " what was it he said?

           He scowls at the rumpled fold of NEWSPAPER, the article.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        "The way she died is unimportant. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        More important is that this young
                        life was willfully cut off by a system
                        of irrational cruelty." That is what
                        he says. "We too easily forgive, or
                        at least forget, which ultimately
                        means the same thing."

           He dumps the newspaper on the table with a SLAP. Miep cringes. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        He has missed the point altogether.
                        She believed in humanity unreservedly.
                        In hope.

           Otto glowers across the uneaten bread, scattered fruit, cold
           breakfast meats. Teacup untouched. His bright spirits doused.

           INT. PASSENGER STREETCAR TROLLEY [MOVING] -- MORNING

           Jolting, jostling on the chipped-up green wooden bench seat,
           Otto gazes out the grime-hazed windows. Eyes smoldering,
           flickering with anger, indignation. Miep, smashed into the
           seat beside him, shuddering against him, glances at him.
           Worried. His cold, hard stare.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        You are picking a fight with a man
                        who wants a war.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        He used her. To make a point. She is
                        propaganda to him.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        He has the newspaper behind him.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        And so that is it? I should be silent?

           He rakes burning eyes on her. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        "How she died is unimportant." Anna's
                        death is "unimportant" to him. He is
                        taking her precious words and using
                        them to feed his own hateful agenda.

           She looks away. Draws a breath. Summoning the courage to
           speak her mind.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Have you thought about publishing
                        it? 

           He twists to stare at her. 
                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        He said himself he read it in one
                        sitting. He said it was exceptional.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is her diary. It is private.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        If people could see - if they could
                        read her words...

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        These were her personal thoughts.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Right now all they know is what he
                        told them. 

           The trolley SHUDDERS, drawing to a HALT. Otto gathers his
           rain-flecked briefcase, jacket. Troubled. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        She was important, Otto. To you. To
                        me. To us. Her story is important. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        So is her privacy.

           Miep, taken aback by his terseness. He stands. Flustered,
           she grabs for her purse, her damp jacket. Pushes to her feet
           as well. She cannot help herself -

                                 MIEP GIES
                        She always dreamed of being a writer.

           He falters. Meets her gaze. Conflicted. 

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- LATE MORNING

           Otto, woolen vest, suit, stands at the window. Silvery light
           leaching in through the foggy glass, cloaking him in a hazy
           gray glow. His faraway gaze, listless, untrained, sticks on
           the wet cobblestones, canals below. Flock of babbling, ambling
           SCHOOLCHILDREN, huddled under umbrellas, galoshes splashing
           through murky, dirty puddles, shuffle their way to school.
           He watches them. Tracks them across the street. Until they
           dip out of view.

           Ragged jobless MEN agitating in a soup kitchen line across
           the canal. Filthy-clothed, many barefoot, hungry. 

           Otto gazes at them. Pushes out a breath. Turns toward the
           desk. Stacked with cracked leather binders, bound, rumpled
           papers. He flips open the spiral-bound notebook into which
           he has copied passages of the DIARY. Tracing his way down
           the rumpled page until he draws to one: “I don't think of
           all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains.”
           He flicks a glance at the DIARY beside the Underwood
           typewriter. The NEWSPAPER folded in his chair. Jobless,
           homeless men shouting, barking at each other outside.

           He reaches, lifts the NEWSPAPER out of the chair. DUMPS it
           in the dented metal TRASH CAN beside the desk. Sits heavily
           into the wheezing chair. Drags the Underwood typewriter toward
           him. Grabs a fresh sheet of blank paper from the neat stack
           beside his inbox. Feeds it, twisting the roller-knobs, into
           the Underwood. 

           He opens the DIARY. His eyes catching on her lilting, spidery
           scrawl. Flicker of a smile in spite of himself. She gives
           him courage. He draws a breath, pushes it out. Pins the DIARY
           open with a ceramic jar of Opekta jam. Turns his attention
           to the page in the typewriter. SNAPPING out one letter at a
           time. Het Achterhuis. [The Annex]. Transcribing a fresh copy.
           To send out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BARBARA'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY [WEEKS LATER]

           Barbara hunches at the empty oak desk. Bookcase now jumbled
           with a few stacks of loose-leaf MANUSCRIPTS. The potted
           orchid, neglected, petals curling, bunched back among a jumble
           of unwashed COFFEE MUGS, framed PHOTOGRAPHS of her PARENTS.

           Barbara holds the black enamel TELEPHONE to her ear. Pinches
           the bridge of her nose. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                            (into the telephone)
                        Akron, Ohio. The name is Dean Conway.

           Flicks a glance up at Jason Epstein as he timidly ducks into
           the office with a fresh stack of MANUSCRIPTS. Barbara squints
           at them as he deposits them on the edge of her desk. Intra-
           office buck slip paper-clipped to the TITLE PAGE of the TOP
           ONE - "All passes. Not what we are looking for. DB."

           She scowls. Draws back, listening to the telephone -

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        Conway. That's right. Yes, I can
                        hold.

           She takes a breath. Slouches back in the wheezing wooden
           desk chair. Tosses a glance at Jason as he draws back. He
           lingers. Shyly watches her. Trying to muster the courage to
           speak to her, but she is on the phone.

           She registers his presence. Meets his gaze at last. He
           flushes. Confronted. Self-conscious all at once. Flashes her
           a smile. Awkwardly, hastily withdraws. She watches him go.
           Slightest flicker of a smirk.
           Twists to peer out through the smeary glass. Ghostly shadow
           of the Empire State Building, glistening in the sunlight.
           Her smile fading. Her eyes dragging across the -

           - sagging SHELVES of the bookcase. Sparse MANUSCRIPTS,
           rumpled, smashed at the corners. Bustling chatter of
           typewriters, ringing telephones leaching in through the
           doorway. A whole new flock of YOUNGER TYPING GIRLS already
           working their way up. Her time is running out.

           She stiffens, refocuses. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        I've already tried that number. Nobody
                        answered. 

           She pushes out a weary breath. Getting nowhere.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        Conway. Dean. He returned two months
                        ago.

           She blinks. Listening. Paralyzed, left speechless, by what
           she is hearing. She swallows. Flustered. Strains to speak.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                            (into the telephone)
                        When was this?

           INT. KITCHEN, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- EVENING

           Barbara sits in the dark at the cramped kitchen table. Narrow
           rib of light from the hallway cutting across the empty stove
           top, jumbled counter. Puddle of burgundy MERLOT in a hazy
           glass. Half-empty bottle planted beside it. Her gaze vacant,
           removed. Stirring at the GRUNT of a KEY in the door.

           Shuddering open. Bustling, flecked with rainwater, fumbling
           with a whispering umbrella, squelching boots, raincoat, Alice
           shimmies her way in. Grimaces, cloth bag of GROCERIES filling
           her arms. Elbows the door shut. Stumbling forward. Stops
           short at the threshold of the kitchen. Eyes sticking on
           Barbara. The bottle of MERLOT.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        And I thought I had a bad day.

           Tug of a smirk. Huffing, winded from the climb up. She
           shimmies into the cramped room. Wet boots squelching on the
           floor tile. Slouches the grocery bag onto the counter. She
           draws back. Barbara, still unmoved. Flicker of concern.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH (CONT'D)
                        Well what happened?
           Barbara finally stirs. Drags her attention to Alice. Strains
           to focus through wine-fogged eyes. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I tried to reach Dean Conway.

           Alice, flicker of a knowing smile.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        Let me guess: his sweetheart doesn't
                        want him working with some gorgeous
                        young editor in New York City.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        He shot himself.

           Alice, draws up short. Derailed. Twists back. Barbara,
           hollowed, gutted. Alice, momentary ghost of a smile. Certain
           it must be a joke. Fading away.

                                 ALICE MCGRATH
                        What do you mean?

           Barbara meets her gaze. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        He told me he was scared. Over there.
                        He told me he wished he'd never
                        enlisted.

           Alice grips the edge of the counter. Emotion washing over
           her. Barbara slouches back in her chair. Numb, still.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        He was twenty-one.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Otto leans in over the ceramic sink basin. Daubs pomade from
           the beat-up red Royal Crown tin on the edge. Slicking his
           hair back, combing it into place. He squints. Grabs up a
           pair of tweezers. Flinches as he tugs at an errant gray hair.
           Draws back. Regards his reflection. Dapper suit jacket, tie
           knotted around his neck. He draws a breath. Nervous. 

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- MORNING

           He leafs through his beat-up leather portfolio. Plate
           scattered with toast crumbs, flecked with powdered sugar.
           Otto swipes at it, wiping it from the rumpled papers that he
           shimmies into place in the portfolio. Pushes back from the
           table. Rises. Smoothing down his rumpled pants, tugging at
           the cuffs of his shirt. 

           Jan, already rinsing the breakfast dishes in the sink. Miep
           draws up before Otto. 
           She reaches, wipes scattered crumbs from his tie. He glances
           down, chagrined. Straightens it. Squares his shoulders. Draws
           a breath. Meets her eye. Anxious. Excited. Jan glances over
           at them.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        You will do her proud.

           INT. DE NEVE'S OFFICE, UITGEVERIJ CONTACT PUBLISHERS -- DAY

           Otto gazes at the wash of hard afternoon paleness spilling
           in through the window, hollowing out the tall oak bookshelves
           on either side. Blue with murky cigarette smoke. Leather-
           bound volumes jamming the shelves, narrow red-striped spines,
           Uitgeverij Contact logo embossed at the bottoms. Otto,
           enthusiasm gutted from him, dull, glassy-eyed.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        You want me to pay you to publish
                        it.

           He drags his weary, tired gaze to F.E.A. BATTEN, 33, tall,
           lanky, shabby trousers, ill-fitting Oxford shirt on his
           beanpole frame. Leaning, propped, against the vast mahogany
           desk, stacked with piles of papers, loose-leaf manuscripts,
           buried Chestnuttti typewriter, telephone. Looming bookcases,
           jammed with more volumes behind it. Batten glances at - 

           G.P. DE NEVE, 58, fleshy, pasty, filling the high-backed
           leather chair behind the desk. Cigar jammed between his
           knuckles. Eyes torridly semi-focused on Otto. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I have no money. I have nothing.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        She is obviously quite talented. She
                        is a brilliant little girl, really.
                        She makes such insightful
                        observations. We were most impressed
                        with Jan Romein's assessment of the
                        piece.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Jan Romein completely missed the
                        point of it.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        He urged us to publish it, in fact.

           Otto, taken aback. Uncertain where this is going. Batten
           draws a breath. Flicks a glance at de Neve. Smoke curling
           from his cigar. Gazing placidly at the shaft of silvery blue
           sunlight falling in through the window. Bored by this meeting.
           Batten, left to pick up the slack.
                                 F.E.A. BATTEN (CONT'D)
                        We simply feel like the primary market
                        for this book might be a little too -
                        specialized. Girls' lives of course
                        being primarily of most interest to
                        other little girls.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        The perseverance of the human spirit
                        is of interest to everyone.

                                 DE NEVE
                        Mathematically, it is a pass for us.

           De Neve wearily lifts his cigar, takes a long pull from it.
           Sits forward in his mewling leather chair. Sets the cigar in
           the crenelated lip of a ceramic ashtray. Smoke streams out
           of his nostrils. He settles his tired walrus gaze on Otto. 

                                 DE NEVE (CONT'D)
                        If you are willing to alter the
                        mathematics, we are willing to
                        reconsider our determination. 

           Otto stares at him. His daughter's life reduced to such a
           cold calculation. He is stung. Strains to hold his temper.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Her story is important. 

                                 DE NEVE
                        Yes. Well. Importance does not sell
                        the way it used to.

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- LATE MORNING

           Otto pushes into the kitchen, disheveled, jacket freshly
           damped with drizzle, speckling his hair, unkempt. He expels
           a breath. Dragging the door shut behind him. He stands,
           dripping, sniffs. He steps forward, shoes squelching. Weak-
           dishwater light falling, pale and silvery, across the empty
           sink, dish rack loaded with neat stacks of plates, glasses.

                                 MIEP GIES (O.S.)
                        How did it go?

           He gives a start. Turns. Miep stands by the counter at the
           opposite doorway. Beyond her, Jan Gies, hunched at the dining
           room table, looks up, surrounded by papers, file folders. 

           Otto, gaze sticking on the bottle of Moet & Chandon champagne
           nestled beside the refrigerator. Trio of foggy champagne
           flutes. Miep registers his countenance. Presses her lips
           together. Stepping forward to mask the bottle. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        We will find someone else then.
           Jan sits back in his chair. Lays down his fountain pen. Otto
           draws a ragged breath. Leans to place the beat-up leather
           portfolio on the empty table. Miep draws over to him. Reaches
           to place a hand on the damp shoulder of his jacket. Stops
           herself. He gives a weary shake of the head.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        There are no others. Everyone else
                        rejected it. Out of twenty, they
                        were the only ones who showed any
                        interest. As it turns out, all they
                        wanted was money.

           She does not know what to say to that. He avoids her gaze.
           Reaches to refasten the buttons of his jacket. Flicks a glance
           at the clacking wall clock. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        We should go to the office.

           He squares his shoulders. Hesitates. Eyes sticking on the
           afternoon paleness leaching in through the window. Bleak and
           hard. She watches him, concerned. His grief renewed.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        How much did they want?

           He flicks a glance at her. Shakes himself. Reaches to retrieve
           the leather portfolio. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Otto. How much?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Two thousand five hundred guilders. 

           She blanches at the number. He senses it. An enormous sum.
           She steels herself, strains to find hope.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        I could talk to Jan. I could see how
                        much we might be able to spare.
                        Perhaps we could speak to the bank -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I cannot accept your money. Not after
                        everything you have given me.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        It would be a gift. It would bring
                        me pleasure.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        No. 

           She silences herself. Watches him as he lifts the leather
           portfolio from the table, tucks it under his arm. Turns, wet
           shoes squelching on the tiled floor. 
                                 MIEP GIES
                        I have seen you. The way this has
                        given you purpose these last months.
                        I do not want to see you lose that.

           He meets her gaze. Vacant and hollow. Flickering fire from
           before all but extinguished. He forces a flat smile for her.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        We should go. Or we will have no
                        business left to run.

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- AFTERNOON

           Otto gazes out at the silvery sunlight. Shadow engulfing the
           room at his back. Desk overwhelmed with jumbled paperwork,
           flaking leather accounting ledgers, shipping manifests. Boxy
           Phillips RADIO murmuring softly beside the Underwood
           typewriter, besieged in rumpled envelopes, unopened mail. He
           watches a small robin flit among the skeletal branches of
           the chestnut tree. Flicker of a smile at his lips. Fading. 

                                 BBC RADIO NEWS  (V.O.)
                        ...the Nuremberg Indictments make
                        clear the sinister master plan by
                        which the Nazis sought world
                        domination. They recite for history
                        to remember the long list of
                        brutalities and atrocities which
                        blacken the record of this
                        generation...

           Ribbon of blue smoke twisting from a cigarette between his
           fingers. He lifts it to his lips. Takes a long pull. Pushes
           out a hazy breath. Lets it fall away. Stares gloomily out at
           the courtyard. 

           Framed in the doorway, unnoticed by Otto, Jan Gies watches
           him. Black Opekta Jam binder tucked under his arm. Eyes stuck
           on Otto's narrow, solitary silhouette. Slumped shoulders.
           Concerned. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- LATE NIGHT

           Blackness. Otto switches on the desk lamp. Weak warm light
           dimly washing his face, hollowed and pitted, shadowed,
           sleepless. Rumpled white undershirt, hair smashed. He stares
           at the small desk. Flaking leather blotter. DIARY placed
           atop the rubber-banded loose-leaf manuscripts. He sits.
           Watching it. Tormented. He summons his energy. Pushes off
           the wheezing mattress. Hefts to his feet.

           Shuffles across the bare hardwood floor. Around the foot of
           the narrow bed. Draws up to the chewed-up wooden desk chair.
           Drags it back with a soft grunt of wood on wood. He stares
           at the DIARY. Steps around the chair. Braces himself to the
           desk and lowers himself into it. 
           He gazes down at it, coarse red-checkered cloth, frayed and
           worn through at the corners. Curling rumpled pages beneath
           it. He reaches out. Drags it toward him. He hesitates, his
           hand on it. Window over the desk a wedge of black. Steamed
           slightly against the chilly middle of the night.

           Deep shadows, exhaustion beneath his eyes. He pushes out a
           weary breath. Cannot help himself. Flips the diary open. He
           squints down at it in the weak lamplight. Peels back the
           first few pages, thumbs his way deeper into it. Her spidery
           scrawled handwriting flitting, dancing before him. Taped-in
           PHOTOGRAPH of Anne and Margot on the beach, black-and-white
           smiles grinning out at him.

           Otto, faintest flicker of a smile upon his lips. He pauses,
           page pinned open. Drawn, inexorably, back in. "Dear Kitty, I
           asked myself this morning whether you don't sometimes feel
           rather like a cow who has had to chew over all the old pieces
           of news again and again." He smirks, in spite of himself.
           Delighted by the sheer playfulness of the image. 

           He draws a ragged breath. Eyes stinging. Begins to flip the
           diary shut. Catches it. Eyes sticking on another passage. "I
           know I can write but it remains to be seen whether I really
           have talent. I don't want to have lived in vain like most
           people. I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to all people,
           even those I've never met. I want to go on living even after
           my death."

           He stares at her words. Dark room looming around him. Rain
           lashing against the black void of the window. Light glinting
           in the burning moistness of his eyes. Determination stirred.

           INT. LOUNGE, DIKKER & THIJS RESTAURANT -- DAY

           Otto sits and watches the rain stream down the canted window.
           Buttery pale afternoon light. He clasps the chewed-up leather
           portfolio in his lap. Weather-worn shoes damp from outside,
           the shoulders of his shabby jacket soaked. He twists in the
           red padded chair. Flicks a glance at his wristwatch. Elbows
           propped on the upholstered arms of the chair, he gently taps
           the leather face of the portfolio. This task, distasteful. 

           He arrives at a decision. Bracing to push to his feet. He
           draws up short as, wingtip shoes clapping, bustling, late,
           winded, flecked with drizzle from outside, ELIAN AKKERMAN,
           58, impeccable suit, flushed in the cheeks, top hat speckled
           with rain water, pushes through the front door. Shoes
           squelching on the marble. He grins, gives a wave.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        Otto. My god, it is actually you.

           INT. DINING AREA, DIKKER & THIJS RESTAURANT -- SHORTLY LATER

           Otto sits by the vast window. Framed in gray-white paleness.
           Leaching in across the starched white tablecloth. Conscious
           of his scuffed-up shoes, shabby jacket. 
           Silverware sparkling in the afternoon light, immaculate.
           Bowl of creme de volaille chicken soup sprinkled with chives,
           buttery skin untouched. 

           Across from him, linen napkin tucked into the collar of his
           shirt, Elian chews, licks at his teeth, sawing into his cote
           de boeuf rib-eye steak, ris de veau lamb pancreas sweetbreads
           clumped in a fried greasy pile beside his smeary wine glass. 

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        It has all just begun to come back.
                        Rotterdam is a wasteland still. Have
                        you seen it?

           Otto stirs. Attempts to focus. Mind elsewhere. Squints through
           the haze of murky blue cigarette smoke. Elian, prizing another
           morsel of steak from the bone, flicks a glance at him. Becomes
           distracted, lifts a hand to signal the WAITER, 44, immaculate
           suit, pushing a cart with a platter of oysters on ice. 

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I was of course devastated to hear
                        about your family. You have my
                        sincerest sympathies.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Thank you.

           Otto strains. Prepares to speak what is on his mind, but
           must then halt as the Waiter draws over, leans in, white-
           gloved, refills Elian's wine glass from a bottle of Chateau
           Fortia Syrah. He draws back, replaces the bottle. Elian, a
           tug of a smile at him, reaches for the stem of his glass. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I have a question that I must ask
                        you. Regarding an account.

           Elian pauses. Fixes him with a wine-fogged gaze.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Before the occupation, I had amassed
                        a certain sum in savings. 

           Elian draws a disappointed breath. So this is why they are
           here. 

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        You are aware of course that Dresder
                        was dissolved with the fall of Berlin.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        My account was with Handelstrust.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        They were subsidiaries.
           Elian lifts the wine glass. Inhales its earthy scent. Drinks
           from it. Otto watches him as he swallows. Allows it to wash
           over him. Flicker of guilt, annoyance, under Otto's gaze. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It would mean a great deal to me to
                        recover this money.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        It is outside of my control. The
                        bank has closed.

           Elian pushes out a breath. Replaces the wine glass by his
           plate. He sits back. Assesses Otto. They are friends. This
           is money. He dabs at his mouth with his linen napkin.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        If you would like to discuss a
                        personal loan -

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I do not wish to borrow anyone's
                        money. I want what is mine.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        Yes. Well. I am afraid it is gone.

           Otto SLAMS his fist to the table. Silverware, glasses jumping.
           The DUTCH WOMAN, 66, dusty lavender dress, at the next table,
           glances sharply over, alarmed. Elian stares at Otto, frozen. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        "Human greatness does not lie in
                        wealth or power, but in character
                        and goodness." She was fourteen when
                        she wrote that. My daughter. I wish
                        that you could have known her better.
                        I think she could have had a great
                        impact on the world.

           He shakes his head. Eyes burning. Braces to push back from
           the table.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I am sorry to have spoiled your lunch. 

           Elian, taken off-guard by his abruptness, aware their
           friendship is crumbling, reaches out. Catches his arm.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        Otto. Let me give you some money.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I did not come here for your money.

                                 ELIAN AKKERMAN
                        Perhaps not. But you need it.
           INT. 1939 MORRIS EIGHT SERIES 3 SEDAN [MOVING] -- DAY

           Otto hunches in the steamed-up cabin. Rain streaming, sluicing
           down the windshield, wipers dashing back and forth as fast
           as they can. He is glassy-eyed, dull, distant. Wool-shouldered
           jacket, felt fedora, soaked through from the rain. Vacant
           mind elsewhere. Miep draws them to a jolting, shuddering
           halt at an intersection. Glances over at him. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        And so. Did they actually serve
                        oysters?

           He stirs. Drags his gaze, attention, toward her. Focuses.
           Flicker of a smile at her quiet eagerness, curiosity.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        And champagne. Monmousseau. Crémant
                        de Loire.

           She shakes her head. Marveling. His smile fades slightly.
           Clouding as he drags his gaze back outward. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        He gave me five hundred guilders out
                        of pity. 

           She flicks a glance at him. He avoids it. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I took it. 

           Otto, ashamed that this is what he has come to. She looks
           forward again, troubled. Through the hazed windshield, the
           traffic advancing. She grasps the gearshift, lurches them
           ahead. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Jan and I can probably manage two
                        hundred. 

           He allows her a flicker of a sad smile. Eyes still trained
           outward. Raking across the weathered brickwork, murky gutters,
           choked with rushing brown water. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Keep it. It will still be barely a
                        quarter of what they asked.

           He draws a weary breath. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I will convince them to accept five
                        hundred. Or nothing.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, UITGEVERIJ CONTACT PUBLISHERS -- DAY

           Weary afternoon light shafts in across the smooth marble
           wall. Otto squints, half-blinded by it, hard and bright,
           streaming through the arched old windowpanes, cloaking F.E.A.
           Batten, silhouetting him across the weathered, scuffed-up
           oak conference table. 

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        I fear there has been some sort of
                        misunderstanding.

           He draws a breath, plucks at the fraying seams of his wool
           jacket sleeves. Does not enjoy this meeting. Otto regards
           him with a hard, penetrating stare.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN (CONT'D)
                        The sum we require is not a
                        fabrication. It is derived from the
                        cost of production for a book that
                        frankly we do not believe will sell
                        adequately to defray it.

           He flicks a glance at Otto. Face bathed in the pale puddle
           of sunlight. Scowling at him. Batten, shifting in his chair.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN (CONT'D)
                        We are a publisher, Mr. Frank. Not a
                        financial institution. We cannot
                        afford to take risks. Now more than
                        ever. Since the war, the market has
                        collapsed and it has failed to return.
                        Frankly, many still see books as
                        luxuries. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Have you read it?

           Batten pushes out a breath. Feels he is getting nowhere. 

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        It is not a question of quality. We
                        simply believe it is not a book that
                        will sell.

           He feels Otto's gaze upon him. Impossible to escape.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN (CONT'D)
                        My wife has read it three times. But
                        her taste does not reflect that of
                        Holland.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        When you listen to the radio, when
                        you open the newspaper, what do you
                        see? Hatred. Grief. "How do we punish
                        the ones who have wronged us?" 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        In her diary, there is only hope.
                        Love. Beauty. She was locked in a
                        prison for more than two years and
                        she still believed that a kind and
                        gentle spirit was the sharpest weapon
                        of all.

           He shields his eyes. Stares directly at Batten. Beseeching,
           appealing with every fiber of his being.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I am a father who is asking you as
                        one man to another. I have no more
                        money than what I have offered you.
                        I want only to let the world see her
                        for who she was. To understand her
                        and through her understand all of
                        them, all of us, who went through
                        what we went through, and who came
                        through it and are searching for
                        reasons to continue every day, when
                        it is easier to look back in sorrow
                        and decide it is not worth it. What
                        must I do, Mr. Batten? Tell me. I
                        will do anything. But I will not
                        accept a "no" from you.

           Batten, uncomfortable, shifts in his chair. Flicks a glance
           toward the sun falling in through the windows. Irked. Moved. 

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        In the letter that you sent with the
                        manuscript, you stated that you had,
                        in the past, served as an accountant
                        at a bank for ten years.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Eleven.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        Our auditor never returned from the
                        war. Perhaps you could take up the
                        position. Wages garnished, of course.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Toward the publication of the book.

           Batten, a brusque nod. Otto, overwhelmed.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Yes. Yes, of course, then. Yes. We
                        have a deal.

           Spirit surging, bubbling up.
                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        Contingent, of course, on some minor
                        editorial changes.

           Otto, blinded, still reeling, strains to focus. Squints at
           Batten, silhouetted in the brightness. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        What changes?

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Flickering candle dancing, warm yellow-orange light sputtering
           across the wash of typewritten pages, scribbled red ink.
           Otto sits back in his chair, peels off his glasses. Pushes
           out a breath. Gazes across the table at Miep, hunched at the
           opposite end, sticky dinner bowl puddled with stammppot lentil
           stew, chunks of smoked sausage, kale. Reading another page
           of the manuscript. She glances up as -

           - Jan Gies leans in, shadow-eyed, tired, lifts away her dirty
           bowl, smeary water glass. She presses a smile at him. Looks
           back across at Otto. He glances up at her. Flattened. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        He wants to discard a full third of
                        the manuscript.

           Jan sets the plates into the sink. Grabs for a threadbare
           dishrag, switches on the tap. Miep glances at him. Looks
           back across at Otto. Despair settling back over him.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        People will know her story. Her voice.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is not her voice. 

           He looks back down at the blocks of typescript. Large portions
           crossed out in red ink. Riddled with margin notes.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        She speaks of menstruation, and it
                        is somehow "pornographic?" This is
                        what she felt. Who she was.

           Miep draws a breath. Flicks a troubled glance up at Jan as
           he leans back in to collect the platter of smoked sausages. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Let me do that.

           She pushes back from the table, chair grunting on the tile
           floor. Draws to her feet. Reaches, collects the stamppot
           dish. Draws back. Pauses. Cannot help herself. 
                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        They have committed to publishing
                        her diary. No one else even wanted
                        to meet with you.

           Jan flicks a glance at his wife. She is going too far. She
           registers his etch of a frown. Persists.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        If you must scale back on your work
                        at Opekta, we can certainly manage
                        for a couple of weeks. 

           He remains unconvinced.  

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Otto. What other option do you have?

           INT. DE NEVE'S OFFICE, UITGEVERIJ CONTACT PUBLISHERS -- DAY

           Otto stands at the window. Bathed in muted morning light.
           Gloom settling over him. Clouding his gaze. He draws a breath.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I had hoped to discuss the changes.

           He twists from the glass, rain lashing against it. Murk of
           cigar smoke hanging over De Neve's desk. Avalanches of loose
           paperwork, manuscripts rubber-banded, typewriter, telephone,
           immersed in rumpled envelopes, leather address books. De
           Neve, irked, flicks a glance up from the steamed French press
           he is fumbling with. Blossom of murky coffee from the sieve.

                                 DE NEVE
                        There is nothing to discuss.

           De Neve decants a steaming ribbon of coffee into a bone-china
           coffee cup. Warmth gushing out of it. He sits back in his
           leather chair. Drags weary eyes to Otto.

                                 DE NEVE (CONT'D)
                        Whether we hemorrhage money and gain
                        a debtor or hemorrhage money and
                        gain an auditor, we are still
                        hemorrhaging money. I am opposed to
                        it. 

           He pushes out a smoky breath. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        An offer was made in good faith.

                                 DE NEVE
                        So you accept the offer.

           Otto regards him. Aware of what is being asked. Hesitates. 
                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Yes. I accept.

                                 DE NEVE
                        Then you will do whatever Mr. Batten
                        asks of you. You are in his hands
                        now.

           INT. FILING ROOM, UITGEVERIJ CONTACT PUBLISHERS -- AFTERNOON

           Weak morning paleness shafts in through a narrow window.
           Washing across stacks upon stacks of bulging cardboard boxes,
           swollen, strained at the seams. Bookcase lurking in the
           darkness, shelves jammed with curling yellowed papers. 

           As Batten switches on the single naked light bulb hanging
           from the center of the room, the dim light exposes -

           - the beat-up little desk, lacquer chipped and worn away,
           pushed against the wall. Surface covered over with dusty
           stacks of leather-bound ledgers, three-ring binders exuding
           more rumpled papers, receipts, shipping manifests. Water
           damage soaked into the mushy ceiling pile, stale wallpaper.
           Paint peeling, leprous. Dusty typewriter missing its ribbon,
           several of its keys. 

           Otto takes it in from the doorway beside Batten, warm light
           washing in from the hallway behind them.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        We will find you a functioning
                        typewriter, of course. You are welcome
                        to move anything that you wish.

           Otto shuffles forward into the room. Takes in the cramped
           walls, flaking ceiling. Meager shaft of natural light. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Which are the accounting files?

           Batten flicks a glance at him. Not understanding.

                                 F.E.A. BATTEN
                        All of them.

           Otto blinks. Face unreadable. Calculating. Lifts his tired
           leather briefcase. Sets it on the edge of the desk. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Perhaps I could make some tea, then.
                        It seems I will be here a while.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY

           Barbara, eyes shadowed, gaze haunted, etched with weariness,
           aged somehow by the unexpected loss of Dean Conway. 
           Hunched at the cramped desk. Besieged with MANUSCRIPTS, piles
           divvied out, sorted. Buck slips paper-clipped to most of
           them. "PASS - DB." Empty coffee mugs, abandoned. Framed
           portrait PHOTOGRAPH of her MOTHER & FATHER as a young couple,
           nearly buried.

           Barbara, intensely focused. Fixed on an open MANUSCRIPT,
           Valley of No Return! Frustration, fatigue weighing. 

           Fluorescent light, hard, sallow, washing the beige plaster
           walls. Bookcase, banged-up wooden shelves now JAMMED with
           other MANUSCRIPTS. Pages rumpled, smashed. Small navy blue
           sofa moved in to one corner, subsumed in PAPERS. She gives a
           start -

                                 FRANK PRICE (O.S.)
                        You should try opening your shade.

           FRANK PRICE, 46, thinning brown hair, kind-faced, gazes upon
           her from the doorway. He nods at the wilting ORCHID.
           Desiccated. Shriveled petals strewing the desk. Narrow rib
           of crisp sunlight stifled by the window shade. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        They need natural light.

           He steps in. Extends a hand. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        Frank Price. 

           Barbara, flustered, fumbles for a PENCIL. Jams it into the
           open MANUSCRIPT to hold the page. Rises to shake his hand.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Barbara. Zimmerman. It's a pleasure,
                        sir.

           Price, tug of a smirk as he draws back. Takes her in. Rumpled
           blouse. Thick glasses. Flicks a glance toward the window.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        This used to be my office. Half a
                        lifetime ago.

           Barbara, uncertain what to say to that. He turns. Floorboards
           creaking beneath him. Gaze raking across the bookshelf.
           Manuscripts, spines neatly labeled in black marker. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        You have a predilection for stories
                        about the war.

           He glances back at her. Still poised behind her desk. Self-
           conscious, she flicks a glance at Valley of No Return!

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        Did you have a brother who served?
           She stiffens. Avoids his gaze.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I knew someone, once, who had.

           He draws back from the bookshelf. Turning to take her in.
           She looks back down at the MANUSCRIPT. Deflated. Flips it
           shut. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Nothing I have read captures the
                        experience.

           He studies her. Loss, grief, weighing upon her. Rakes his
           gaze toward the streaming afternoon sunlight. Puddled, hard
           and shearing, on the hardwood floor.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Perhaps it's better to look ahead.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Ten years from now, all of these
                        will be forgotten. 

           She plucks a lit cigarette, mostly ash, out of the crenelated
           ashtray. Takes a pull from it. 

           Price, watching her, faintest ghost of a bittersweet smile. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        There are worse things than a little
                        light entertainment.

           She at last drags her attention to him.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        These are cartoons. What is the point?

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Must there be a point? 

           She squints at him through her thick glasses. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        If there is no point then why are we
                        all here? Why bother with any of
                        this?

           He is amused, slightly. Her headstrong conviction. Smile
           fading. He glances back toward the door. Draws a breath.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I came to tell you that Donald Black
                        is arranging to have you fired by
                        the end of the year.

           Barbara, caught up short, stares at him. Blind-sided. 
                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        Evidently you convinced him that
                        your work here would not impinge
                        upon your obligations to the typing
                        pool. 

           Barbara, reeling. Tosses a glance at the piled MANUSCRIPTS.
           Buck slips clipped to the title pages, all PASSES.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        He never wanted me here to begin
                        with. Everything I recommend he gives
                        to his secretary, and she passes on
                        it for him.

           He is weary all at once. Resigned to the way the world works.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        At any rate, I thought it only fair
                        that you should know.

           He meets her gaze. She has put everything into this job. He
           dislikes it as much as she does.

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        You are searching for something that
                        will change minds. Alter perspectives.
                        It frightens him.

            He pushes away from the doorframe. Halts himself.

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        I hope that you find it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, UITGEVERIJ CONTACT -- DAY [WEEKS LATER]

           Otto draws into the stagnant staleness of the room. Curtains
           pulled back, morning light streaming in to puddle, hard and
           sheering, on the marble walls and floor. Splintering across
           the scratched-up wooden conference table. He hesitates in
           the doorway. Eyes sticking on -

           - the BOOK at the edge of the table. Murky brown dust jacket
           wrapped crisply around it. He takes a hesitant step forward.
           Draws to the table. Grips the back of the chair in front of
           him as his eyes find the TITLE. Het Achterhuis [The Annex].
           Across the top in bold blue lettering. Anne Frank.

           SUPER: "June 25, 1947."

           He draws a ragged breath. Lump in his throat. He takes a
           shuffling step forward. Knee pushing against the back of the
           chair. Reaches. Places a trembling hand atop the book. Palm
           leaving a blossom of moistness on the cover. He pries at it.
           Peeling it open. Crisp title page placed opposite a smiling
           black-and-white PHOTOGRAPH of Anne. 
           He presses a hand over his mouth. Eyes stinging. Welling. He
           is trembling all over. He stares down at her smiling face.
           His little girl. Her dream realized. In print. 

           INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAALMANS BOOKSHOP -- DAY [WEEKS LATER]

           Otto stands at the dusty windowpane. Sallow light cutting in
           through ribbed Venetian blinds. He gazes down upon narrow
           aisles of bookcases, shelves jammed with leather-spined
           volumes, flaking dust jackets. Unsold stacks of German author
           Gottfried Benn's Ausgewählte Gedichte, Third Reich poetry. 

           Piles of yellowed periodicals in messy stacks. MAN, 41, in a
           shabby wool suit, flipping idly through a copy of Ferdinand
           Bordewijk's Blokken.

                        Mr. Batten attempted to explain it
                        to me. I must admit I had some
                        difficulty understanding.

           Otto drags his gaze from the window. Hunched in the weak
           glow of a Gispen table lamp, sequestered behind mounds of
           paperwork, fraying volumes in need of mending, dusty glass-
           encased Shakespeare first edition, leather binding buckling,
           MATTHIJS DAALMANS, 46, narrow-faced, nebbish, fusses with a
           brass Spanish cigar cutter. He grimaces. Flicks a glance up.

                                 MATTHIJS DAALMANS (CONT'D)
                        It is a book by a child - written
                        for adults?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is for everyone.

           Daalmans, etch of a frown, a brusque nod. Brow furrowed.
           Does not understand. He slices the cigar. Flecks of loose
           tobacco scattering his papers. He lifts it to his nose.
           Inhales. Tug of a smile in spite of himself. He re-focuses
           on Otto. Gaze clouding. 

                                 MATTHIJS DAALMANS
                        Forgive me, Mr. Frank. It must mean
                        a great deal to you, as her father. 

           He tosses a glance at the crisp copy of Anne's Het Achterhuis
           sandwiched between a pre-release copy of Simon van het Reve's
           De Avonden, fresh translation of Franz Kafka's Amerika. 

                                 MATTHIJS DAALMANS (CONT'D)
                        As a bookseller, however, you must
                        see my dilemma. Do I place her with
                        Hans Christian Andersen or Sigmund
                        Freud?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        You could place her in the front
                        window.
           Daalmans, a tug of a smirk, reaches for the Ronson Touch Tip
           lighter, black enamel, wedged between rumpled manuscripts.

                                 MATTHIJS DAALMANS
                        It is too dry for children and too
                        childish for adults. I am sorry.

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

           Otto draws into the kitchen. Sun falls in through the window
           above the sink. Puddles, hard and glaring, on the tiled floor.
           Miep, laying out a plate of sliced bread, butter in a dish,
           flicks a glance up at him. Slows. Apprehensive. An ENVELOPE
           wedged beneath the edge of his plate, beside the napkin. 

           He draws to the table. Places a hand on the back of the chair,
           drags it back. His eyes stick on the ENVELOPE. He regards
           it. Reaches. Shimmies it out. Uitgeverij Contact. The
           publisher. He stares at the masthead. Stiffly lowers himself
           into the chair. Grabs up the butter knife beside his plate,
           wedges the blade beneath the flap, and pries it open. 

           Miep watches him. Anxious. He fidgets out the folded piece
           of paper inside. Presses it flat, thumbs his glasses up the
           bridge of his nose. Squints. Reads it a second time. Miep,
           lingering, watching. He pushes out a breath. Sits back in
           his wheezing chair. Meets her eyes across the table. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        We have sold forty-seven copies. 

           She hesitates, uncertain whether or not this is good news. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        The print run was fifteen hundred.

           He peels off his glasses. Blearily stares at the creased
           letter. Torn-open envelope beside it. He reaches, nudges his
           butter knife back into place. Her gaze falls, tepid, on the
           plate of bread. Smoked sausage snapping, popping in a skillet
           on the stove. Air sucked out of the room. He draws a long
           breath. Meets her gaze. What is there to say.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I suppose that he warned us.

           She flicks a glance at the skillet. Draws back, grabbing up
           a fork from the greasy stove top to tend to it.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Once people read it, word will spread.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        That is the problem. No one is reading
                        it.

           She draws back. Letting the sausages cook. She regards him
           through the haze of blue smoke, shafting sunlight. 
           He sits, shoulders slumped. Disillusioned. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        They will.

           INT. READING ROOM, TONEN BOOKSHOP -- EVENING

           Otto stands and gazes out through the glass, tender silvery-
           blue dusk leaching from the sky. Streetcar rattling by below.
           Warm orange light spilling from a scattering of windows across
           the cobblestone street. Footsteps wheezing across the
           floorboards behind him. He twists from the window.

           ELENA ADELHEID, 52, kind, drawing up to the table at his
           back. Stacked copies of Het Achterhuis, crisp, untouched.
           Two dozen lacquered wooden chairs arranged to fill the room.
           Face the table. Teapot long since gone cold. Cups set out,
           untouched. Nobody has come to meet the father of the author.

                                 ELENA ADELHEID
                        We were going to close.

           She avoids his gaze. Flicks a glance at him. His eyes stick
           on the untouched stacks of books. He affords her a weary
           smile. Nods. Peels away from the window. 

           Steps to the table. Hardwood floor creaking beneath him.
           Reaches down to the battered cracked leather TRUNK hidden
           behind the threadbare white tablecloth across the table.
           Drags it out. Fumbles with the brass clasps. Opens it. More
           COPIES of Het Achterhuis packed inside. He gazes at them.

           Rises. Reaches to lift the top five copies off of the stack
           on the table. Gently places them into the trunk. He nudges
           them squarely into place so that they cannot move. Hand
           lingering for a moment upon them. Reassuring her.

           Elena watches him. Glances toward the gaping emptiness of
           the room. Flicker of pity. Otto lifts another stack of books
           off the table. 

                                 ELENA ADELHEID (CONT'D)
                        I would like to buy one.

           He pauses, hefting the books down into the trunk. Flicks a
           glance at her. She clasps her hands before her. Presses a
           strained smile at him. Under his gaze, she does not know
           where to look. Turns her attention to the BOOKS. 

                                 ELENA ADELHEID (CONT'D)
                        She was such a beautiful girl.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Yes. She was. 

                                 ELENA ADELHEID
                        I will place a few copies in the
                        window. If you would like.
           He is aware that he is being pitied. She has no hope of
           selling them. He forces a smile for her anyway.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Thank you.

           INT. OTTO'S OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- DAY [DAYS LATER]

           Otto stares, a deadness to his eyes, at a column of smeary
           numbers. Draws a weary breath, flips shut the manila folder.
           Carefully winds closed the fastening string. Lifts it from
           the desk, overcrowded with stacked binders, leather accounting
           ledgers, unopened envelopes, overwhelming neglected work. He
           pushes back from the desk. Rises from the chair, shuffles to
           the dented, scratched-up metal filing cabinets pushed against
           the wall. 

           He presses the manila folder into a hanging file jammed with
           other folders, smashed receipts, shipping orders. He stands,
           gazes down at them. Twists back, takes in the desk. His eyes
           sticking on the windowpane. 

           Light captured in the faint silvery drizzle clinging to the
           glass. Beyond it, just jutting above the slippery tile
           rooftops, the bony sticklike branches of the chestnut tree,
           painted with a speckling of red and yellow leaves. He gazes
           at them. Flicker of a smile.

           He sits back in the chair. Reaches. Shimmies out, jammed
           between the overflowing wooden inbox and the Underwood
           typewriter, his own weathered copy of Het Achterhuis. Flips
           it open. Twisting in his chair. Pale sunlight washing in
           across the pages. He thumbs his way through it. Searching. 

           Slows. Frown etching his brow. He flips back several pages.
           Forward again. Draws to a paragraph. Squints at the
           typescript. He turns back toward the desk. Reaches. Wriggles
           out the original red-checkered DIARY sandwiched between a
           bundle of rubber-banded papers, clipped-together files.

           He lays it out atop the open hardcover BOOK. Carefully peeling
           back the cloth cover. He hesitates, arrested once more by
           the sight of her cursive scrawl. He peels back page after
           page, careful with the thin stationery. Meticulously thumbing
           his way through it until he draws to a halt. Eyes dragging
           across the passage: 

           "The two of us looked out at the blue sky, the bare chestnut
           tree glistening with dew, the seagulls and other birds
           glinting with silver as they swooped through the air, and we
           were so moved and entranced that we couldn’t speak."

           Flicker of a smile at his lips. The vividness of the image.
           Crisp. Clear. He drags the DIARY back. Squints at the smeary
           typescript in the published BOOK. Gives a start as -

           - Bep draws up short in the doorway. Startled to see him at
           his desk. Her arms filled with more bulging manila files. 
                                 BEP VOSKUIJL
                        Mr. Frank. Please excuse me. I was
                        not aware that you were coming in
                        today.

           He gives her a brusque nod. Preoccupied. Returns his attention
           to Het Achterhuis. Runs his finger across the typewritten
           page. The entire passage ABSENT. 

           Bep places two of the manila files atop his wooden inbox.
           Meekly withdraws to the door. Hesitates. Peering back at
           him. Hunched in his chair, two books laid open in his lap.
           She turns as -

           - Miep approaches, heels clacking down the hall. Bep flashes
           her a shy smile. Ducks away. Miep drawing into the doorway.
           Takes in Otto. Stacked binders, ledgers, loose-leaf paperwork
           heaping his desk. Pale murky sunlight glinting off his
           glasses. He has turned away, peers out the window, eyes
           settled on the branches of the chestnut tree. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Otto.

           He glances back. Stirred. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        I wonder if we might have lunch
                        together.

           INT. CAFÉ ‘T HOEKJE -- DAY

           Otto hunches, damp, flushed with warmth. Wool coat speckled
           with drizzle, shucked off, draped over the metal chair behind
           him. Pale light leaching through the steamed glass beside
           him. Sliced bread, small bowl of oily egg salad, beets, cups
           of tea. He is immersed in the fishbowl of babbling voices,
           laughter, clattering cutlery, plates, knives. 

           Miep sits across from him. Spreading farmersalade vegetable
           spread with her knife on a hunk of bread. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Fifty thousand words, they eliminated. 

           He shakes his head. Teacup untouched. Cigarette twisting to
           ash. He pushes out a breath that fogs the glass beside him. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I allowed them to edit her out of
                        her own diary.

           He becomes aware of her eyes upon him. Realizes her silence.
           Eyes shadowed, perpetual etch of a frown creasing his brow.
           He draws a breath. Strains to recover his composure.
                                 MIEP GIES
                        I had hoped we might discuss returning
                        your energy and focus to the office.

           He picks up his own knife. Separates a small hunk of cheese
           from the wedge on his plate. Troubled. Frown deepening. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Business has begun to pick up. Orders
                        are resuming. It would be useful to
                        have you back in a full-time capacity.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I should have found another publisher.

           Miep, face tightening. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Otto. There were no other publishers. 

           He flicks a glance at her, looks away. Squints against the
           hard, silvery afternoon. Not wanting to accept it.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        You must move on from this. You are
                        allowing it to consume you. 

           She leans forward. Intent on capturing his attention. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        You have succeeded. Her work is all
                        over Holland. She would be proud.
                        She would want you to be happy.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM, GIES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Otto sits awake. Carved out in dim lamplight, the twin beds,
           sheets rumpled. He hunches at the cramped little desk.
           Bathrobe, hair disheveled. He has not slept. Laid out around
           him, loose-leaf manuscript pages. Marked up with red ink.
           Het Achterhuis wedged beside the red-checkered cloth DIARY,
           the subsequent second notebook that she filled. 

           He reaches for a cigarette, propped in the ashtray. Takes a
           long draw from it. Eyes sticking on the Opekta crate, jammed
           rumpled PHOTOGRAPHS, papers. Otto, an etch of a frown,
           reaches. Tugs a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING from among the messy pile.
           Cut out, highlighted by Anne, from March 30, 1944: 

           "...Gerrit Bolkenstein, Dutch Minister for Education, Art,
           and Science told a delegation from the United States and
           Great Britain, 'History cannot be written on the basis of
           official decisions and documents alone. What we really need
           are ordinary documents--a diary, letters from a worker in
           Germany, a collection of sermons given by a parson or a
           priest.'"
           He stares at the smudged typescript. Carefully cut out,
           underlined. Drags his gaze back to the DIARY. Paragraphs,
           entire passages struck out in RED INK. Meddlesome notes
           scrawled in the margins. 

           Otto, dogged by them. Galvanized. He turns. Reaches for the
           Underwood Standard Portable typewriter, brought home from
           the office. Hefts it, drags it toward him. Casts around. 

           Replaces the cigarette in the ashtray. Drags back the small
           wooden drawer at his knee. Lifts out a half-depleted ream of
           stationery, enclosed in its waxy packaging. Places it on the
           desk beside him. Shimmies out a sheet. Reaches, knobs it
           into the typewriter carriage.

           He glances at the marked-up manuscript. Pecks out, one letter
           at a time, Het Achterhuis. Reaches for the cigarette. Presses
           it between his lips. Draws in another pull. Gazes down at
           the typewriter with weary, fogged eyes. He looks past it.
           Het Achterhuis, the book, wedged to the back of the desk. 

           Eyes sticking on the rumpled NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. "...a
           delegation from the United States and Great Britain..." 

           He drags his eyes back to the typewriter. Reaches, releases
           the typewriter carriage, drags it backward. Repositions the
           ribbon over the same spot. He smacks the "X" key. Again,
           again, again. XXX XXXXXXXXXX. Masking the original title. He
           stares at it. Cigarette still clamped between his lips. He
           pulls at it, pushes out a smoky breath. 

           His eyes settle back on the original cloth-bound DIARY. He
           rakes his gaze back to the typewriter. Stabs the carriage
           return. Repositions the carriage. Keys snapping as he pecks
           out, one letter at a time, a new title in English: THE DIARY
           OF A YOUNG GIRL BY ANNE FRANK. He stares at it. Flickering
           in his eyes, a swell of renewed hope. Life. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BARBARA ZIMMERMAN'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- DAY

           Barbara hunches at the cluttered oak desk. Manuscript open
           in front of her. Dunkirk: The Miracle that Saved England.
           Her concentration on the smearing typescript - 

           - nagged by the slight FLICKER of the fluorescent overhead
           strip. She glances up at it. Distracted. It sputters back at
           her. She presses her attention back to the page. Eyes dragging
           across it. Glances back at the flickering light.

           She slouches back. Rolling, padded office chair wheezing
           beneath her. Flips the manuscript shut. Regards it. Defeated.
           Lifts it, impulsively places it into the wire metal OUTBOX.
           Masking tape LABEL peeling from the side: "LOG & DISCARD." 
           INT. KATZ'S DELICATESSAN -- DAY

           Murky haze of smoke, babbling voices, laughter, clattering
           dishes. Barbara sits at a small table by the window, by
           herself. Matzo-ball soup, smeary glass of water, no ice.
           Glasses reflecting back the fresh MANUSCRIPT she is reading. 

           Her attention catching, for a moment, on the TABLE by the
           next window. A swell of LAUGHTER from the huddle of YOUNG
           TYPIST GIRLS, 19, leaning in to examine the ENGAGEMENT RING
           that another TYPIST GIRL, 21, pert, black-haired, is showing
           them. Chattering to each other. Eager. Flushed in the face.

           Barbara watches them. Hunched at her own table, by herself.
           They are impossibly young. A new generation. She is aware in
           this moment that time is passing her by.

           She squints back down at the smudged TYPESCRIPT laid out in
           front of her. Irked. Distracted now. Dissatisfied. At last,
           she draws back. Nagging at her. 

           INT. MAILROOM, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- AFTERNOON

           Sallow fluorescent. Windowless aisles of metal bookcases
           weighed down by MAIL CRATES. Jammed with rumpled ENVELOPES,
           MANUSCRIPTS. Jason Epstein, hunched alongside the banged-up
           metal MAIL CART, flips back through rumpled, unsorted
           SUBMISSIONS in the crate. 

                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        Was it this one?

           Barbara, standing behind him, distracted, drags her attention
           to the MANUSCRIPT in his hand. Bravest Marine of Them All.
           She winces at the tacky cover page. Shakes her head. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        It was called "Dunkirk. The Miracle
                        that Saved England."

           She grimaces. The title dubious, hokey, even as she says it.
           She watches Jason as he nods, turns back. Drags her eyes to
           the LOWER SHELF of the CART. The futility of it all weighing
           upon her. These towering shelves, carts, piles of envelopes,
           all REJECTIONS. 

           She blinks. Eyes sticking on something. Stares at it. Then
           stoops. Peeling back the stacked ENVELOPES jammed in the
           CRATE on the lower shelf. Exposing the PHOTOGRAPH that has
           captured her attention. 

           Masking tape label: "DONALD BLACK - LOG & DISCARD."  She
           shimmies out the MANUSCRIPT attached to the PHOTOGRAPH. Eyes
           catching again on the -

           FACE of the YOUNG GIRL. Beaming. Wide. Innocent. Something
           haunting about her. Junior Editors' REPORTS stapled to the
           title page. All PASSES. She peels it back -
           "THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL BY ANNE FRANK."

           Barabra blinks. Peels back the title page. Eyes dragging
           over the smeary TYPESCRIPT, paragraphs, prose. Darting from
           word to word. Slowing. Unable to simply skim it. She flips
           it closed again. Skewered once more by the beaming GIRL'S
           FACE. Anne Frank.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Where did this one come from?

           Jason tosses a glance over his shoulder. Squints. 

                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        I have no idea.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. RECEPTION, LITTLE BROWN & COMPANY [LONDON] -- AFTERNOON

           Otto stands at the window. Glazed in leaching afternoon
           sunlight. He gazes out through the arched, rippling glass.
           Zinc rooftops, jutting dormers, wrought-iron balconies
           spilling off in a jumble of ruddy stonework. Big Ben spearing
           the skyline far off. He is transfixed. London. Turns, startled -

                                 NED BRADFORD (O.S.)
                        Mr. Frank?

           Dapper, soft-edged, jovial, rakish hair, NED BRADFORD, 32,
           simple Oxford shirt, jacket, emerges from the narrow wooden
           door. Plush carpet padded oak benches filling the foyer. He
           smiles. Extends a hand to Otto.

                                 NED BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                        Ned Bradford.

           INT. BRADFORD'S OFFICE, LITTLE BROWN & COMPANY -- AFTERNOON

           Otto sits in a high-backed green felt chair. Cavernous room
           filled with looming mahogany bookshelves, leather-spined
           volumes reaching to the arcing ceilings. Hearth, marble
           stained with soot, ash, yawning between him and Bradford,
           hunched forward in the second high-backed chair. Bradford
           cradles a snifter of cognac. Swirls it in his hands.

                                 NED BRADFORD
                        I have met with some resistance from
                        the senior editors in Boston. I am
                        still waiting on a final opinion
                        from Mr. Sullivan. 

           He lifts the glass to his nose. Draws in a breath. Flicker
           of a smile at his lips. He sits back into the cradle of the
           chair. Crosses one leg over the other. Regards Otto. Stiff,
           out of place here. His own snifter, untouched, clasped
           uncertainly in his hands. 
                                 NED BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                        The American market, you see, has
                        less appetite for stories of
                        occupation. Their experience of the
                        war was different.

           Bradford lifts the snifter to his lips. Takes a small sip.
           Blossoming nutty warmth. He draws his gaze to the arched
           windows, hung with heavy green curtains. 

                                 NED BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                        Having lived in London both before
                        and after, I of course, have a
                        different perspective. I used to
                        watch the bombs fall from that window
                        over there, during the Blitz. 

           He drags his attention back to Otto. Swallows back the bitter
           memory. Re-focuses. 

                                 NED BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                        I must tell you, too, there were
                        some questions of its authenticity.

           Otto, caught off-guard. Squints. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I do not understand. 

           Bradford regards him. Assessing him. 

                                 NED BRADFORD
                        Stylistically, it is quite advanced
                        for a girl of fourteen. Mr. Sullivan
                        voiced some concern. Are you able to
                        prove that she wrote it herself?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I have the original diaries. In her
                        handwriting. 

           Bradford nods, to himself. Considering. Flicker of a smile.
           Replaces his foot on the floor and sits forward in his chair.
           Brandy snifter outstretched.

                                 NED BRADFORD
                        I think it is a marvelous achievement. 

           Otto, still catching up. Taps their glasses together. A toast.
           He strains to understand what is being said. Hope surging.
           He raises the glass to his lips. Drinks. Coughs slightly,
           unaccustomed. Bradford, a tug of a smile, sits back.

                                 NED BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                        It will of course have to be reduced
                        in length. 
           Otto, head swimming, buttery warmth blossoming from the
           cognac, abruptly hobbled. Hope, elation deflating.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Reduced in what manner?

           INT. KITCHEN, GIES APARTMENT -- MORNING [TWO DAYS LATER]

           Otto sits beside the yellowed curtains. Ribbed light piercing
           between them. Paleness washing in, haze of cigarette smoke
           hanging in the air. He cradles a steaming teacup. Gaze
           faraway. Lost in memory. Faintest tug of a sad smile at his
           lips. He shakes himself. Draws a breath. He peers at a pair
           of rusty kitchen scissors on the table. Newly-opened package
           of Pickwick Tea beside them. From the doorway -

           - Miep draws to an abrupt halt. Otto turns in his chair,
           framed in the silvery puddle of light. She is caught off-
           guard. Unaware he had returned. Otto looks back down at the
           scissors, turns them over in his hands.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        We used to cut the girls' hair with
                        these. Margot abhorred it. Anna
                        considered it a game.

           He is lost in the memory for a moment. Shakes himself once
           more. Turns back toward Miep. The room a small cave around
           them. Otto, lost. Uncertain why he is even here.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        In a certain way it was a very happy
                        time. To live in such close contact
                        with the ones that I loved. To speak
                        to Edith about the girls and about
                        future plans, to help the children
                        with their studies. It would never
                        have been possible in a normal life.
                        Outside of the war.

           Otto, a tug of a sad smile. Places the rusty scissors back
           on the table. Hand lingering on them. Reluctant to let go.  

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        They find her most human moments and
                        most striking observations tiresome
                        and irrelevant. They do not see her
                        as a girl. She is merely a statistic.

           He at last drags his hand back. The light catches the
           tarnished metal. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I fear I must ask you a favor.

           She steps forward from the shadowed doorway. Tired floor
           tile wheezing beneath her.
                                 MIEP GIES
                        Anything, Otto. Of course.

           He grimaces. Detests that he must ask what he must.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        At one time you offered me a sum of
                        money as a loan. I am afraid I may
                        need to accept it. 

           He does not look at her. Aware of the surprise washing across
           her face. She recovers. Moves to begin lifting down breakfast
           dishes from the cupboard.

                                 MIEP GIES
                        Of course. I will talk to Jan.

           He hunches in the pale light. Hollowness pitting his shadowed
           eyes. Gaunt once more. She tosses a worried glance at him.

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        Are you all right?

           He is exhausted. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        The man who will make the decision
                        at Little, Brown lives in Boston.

           He blanches. Aware of her instant disapproval. Objection
           swelling within her. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I have heard nothing from any of the
                        others. If there is any possibility
                        that I can persuade him, I must try.

           She sets the plates down heavily on the table. Draws back,
           regards him: Hunched, vulnerable. Waiting to be castigated.
           She does not have it in her all at once. 

                                 MIEP GIES
                        You know, I remember the first time
                        that I met her. You had brought her
                        to the office. She was wearing these -
                        white ankle socks, that drooped around
                        her thin ankles, and she had the
                        brightest electric gray-green eyes I
                        had ever seen. I remember the
                        fascination with which she stared at
                        my shiny black typewriter. And so I
                        held her little fingers to the keys
                        and pressed them. How her eyes flashed
                        when they jumped up and printed black
                        letters on the page. I thought to
                        myself, now here is the kind of child
                        I would like to have someday.
           She smiles to herself. Lost, for a moment, in the memory.
           Drags her attention back to him. Hunched at the table. 

                                 MIEP GIES (CONT'D)
                        If you go to Boston and the answer
                        is still no, what then? 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Will I abandon the cause, do you
                        mean?

           He rakes his gaze to her. Moist eyes catching the light. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        How can I abandon her? I am her
                        father. They took her from me, yes,
                        but I am her father still. I will
                        always be her father. Will I abandon
                        her? No. I cannot say that I will. I
                        cannot say that. I will never say
                        that. She was my little girl, and
                        she is still my little girl, and she
                        will be my little girl until the day
                        that I die. So if I must keep fighting
                        for her and fighting for her, if it
                        drains me of my every last whit of
                        energy and of what little life I may
                        have left, if that is what is required
                        of me, as her father, then so be it.
                        There is no greater joy. Anna and
                        Margot were everything to me. They
                        always were, and they always will
                        be.

           Miep, stricken. Paralyzed. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I do not know what I will do if the
                        answer is no. 

                                 JAN GIES (O.S.)
                        You will have the money that you
                        need.

           Miep, rived with emotion, gives a start. Jan Gies has drawn
           silently to the threshold. Hallway consumed in shadow. 

                                 JAN GIES (CONT'D)
                        Go to Boston. Tell her story to
                        America. Make them understand.

           Otto, deeply affected. Lump in his throat. Looks up at him.
           Gratitude swimming in his eyes.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Otto peers through the smeary porthole. Glazed, fogged with
           speckled saltwater droplets. Woodwork blistered with water
           damage. Banged-up crown molding. Rusted metal clasps. He
           watches the churning gray waves, studded with whitecaps.
           Eyes sticking on the rambling shoreline. Docks, barnacle-
           clotted pilings, piers. Ruddy-faced brownstones. Custom House
           Tower spearing, gray, stoic, beyond them. Foreign land.

           He draws back. Rumpled flannel pajamas. Hair disheveled.
           Freezing. Cramped bunk strewn with rumpled blankets. The
           tiny room hollowed out by a single dim lamp bolted to the
           scratched-up wooden nightstand. He draws a breath. Flickering
           trepidation. All at once so close. Leather valise still
           yawning open. Clothes hanging in the closet. The ship's HORN
           blares through the thrumming, shuddering deck. 

           Announcing their arrival to Boston. 

           INT. RECEPTION, LITTLE BROWN & COMPANY [BOSTON] -- AFTERNOON

           Otto stands at the narrow window. Rain lashing against the
           glass. Half-frozen, ice tickering, bursts of wind rattling
           it in its frame. He is flushed. Too warm in his wool suit
           jacket. Flecked with melted snowflakes. Hair stringy, hastily
           recombed with his fingers. Oak bookcases jammed with leather-
           spined volumes. James Hilton's Goodbye Mr. Chips. James Norman
           Hall's Mutiny on the Bounty. Older, perfectly-preserved
           volumes by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington. 

           SUPER: "November 21, 1950. Boston, Massachusetts."

           Between two high-backed, padded chairs, polished wooden-
           cabinet Philco RADIO, murky orange dial illuminated, softly
           droning at his back. 

                                 W.T.A.O. RADIO NEWS (V.O.)
                        ...Shirley Temple announced her
                        retirement from show business today,
                        to the considerable shock and protest
                        of her fans. The former child starlet
                        told CBS reporters, quote, "I'm so
                        happy. I've found a whole new world
                        with my husband and my children. I
                        have everything I want now."

           He pries himself away from the window. Three YOUNG EXECUTIVES,
           27, ties loosened, Oxford shirts unbuttoned, LAUGHING, emerge
           from gushing warmth, paneled wooden conference room door.
           Leather briefcases tucked under their arms, CHATTERING between
           each other. Shrugging into woolen coats. Patent-leather shoes
           clapping on marble.

           ELAINE, 25, pencil skirt, emerges after them. Her cheeks
           blushed pink with warmth, gin. Champagne. Thanksgiving week.
           Lips still flickering with a smile. 
                                 ELAINE
                        Mr. Frank, he's ready for you.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, LITTLE BROWN & COMPANY -- AFTERNOON

           Otto steps into the stagnant warmth of the room. Vast mahogany
           conference table smeary with spilled champagne. Scattered
           with smashed napkins. Plates, half-eaten corned-beef
           sandwiches abandoned, empty Moet & Chandon bottles sweating.
           Papers scattering the place settings. Easel at the head of
           the room, canvas pre-release mockup cover art. Prancing red
           stallion. Blaring yellow letters. The Catcher in the Rye.

           Silver platters crowding the credenza along the wall. Deli
           ham, clumped cottage cheese. Jell-O, flabby, melting, studded
           with strawberries. Celery, olives. CHARLES SULLIVAN, 43,
           dapper, disheveled slightly, watery gin-and-tonic gone mostly
           flat in a smudged lowball glass. Picking up scattered papers.
           Tosses a glance back at Otto. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        Otto Frank. 

           He twists, extends a hand. Otto, caught off-guard by his
           directness, takes it. Charles shakes, brisk, abrupt. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        Charles Sullivan.

           Otto stands. Unsure where, or if, to sit. Charles grimaces,
           drags a smeary typewritten contract from a soggy ringlet on
           the tabletop. He glances back at Otto.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        Sit anywhere.

           Otto, eyes raking across the chairs. Left jumbled,
           disorganized. Vacated. Napkins left strewing several of them.
           Not at all what he was expecting. Sullivan reshuffles the
           paperwork. Pushes out a breath. Dumps it in another chair. 

           He retrieves his gin-and-tonic from the table. Squints through
           the foggy glass. Grimaces. Mostly water. Casts around for a
           bottle. Tosses a glance at Otto as he draws to the credenza.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        They tell me you came over from
                        Holland.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Amsterdam. Yes. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        We saw pictures, of course, during
                        the war. The devastation. 

           Sullivan sloshes generous pours of Gordon's gin into his
           smeary lowball, a second glass for Otto. 
                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        Ned Bradford tells me half of London
                        is still rubble.

           He offers Otto a glass. Otto, no choice, accepts it.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        I hear that you met with him.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Mr. Bradford was quite enthusiastic
                        about the Diary. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        And so here you are.

           Otto meets his gaze. Sullivan lifts his glass. A toast. He
           takes a sizable swallow of gin. Gestures at the chairs.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        Sit. Please. 

           Otto sits. Sullivan does as well. Takes another drink. Settles
           appraising eyes on Otto.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        It's a remarkable book. Reading it,
                        I felt transported to that miserable
                        Annex. 

           Otto blanches slightly. Gin glass sweating in his hands. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        I simply wonder if that is what
                        readers want.

           Sullivan, slight flicker of a smirk, takes in the festooned
           room with a gesture.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
                        Americans, as you can see, are in
                        good spirits. It is an optimistic
                        time. We saw evil, and we sent our
                        boys over, and they fought it and
                        they vanquished it, and they won.
                        They have come home. They want to
                        enjoy themselves. Be heroes. Not
                        return to purgatory. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Small acts of heroism took place
                        every day during the occupation.
                        Even if they did not capture
                        headlines.

           Sullivan, smirk hardening. Sits forward in his chair.
                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        And so we arrive at the agenda of
                        the enterprise.

           Otto, genuinely perplexed.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        There was no agenda. It was not
                        written as a manuscript, after the
                        fact. She did not believe anyone
                        outside of herself would ever read
                        it.

           Sullivan skewers Otto with a hard, penetrating stare. Otto
           stares back at him, confused.

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        The cadence, the diction, the
                        insights. They seem rather more those
                        of a father than a little girl.
                        Wouldn't you say?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        My only role in the process was to
                        transcribe it.

           He unzips the leather portfolio. Wriggles out the DIARY. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        These are her original notebooks. In
                        her handwriting. See for yourself. 

                                 CHARLES SULLIVAN
                        And so. If these are the girl's
                        notebooks, where is the girl?

           Otto stares at him. Appalled. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        She is dead.

           Sullivan, blind-sided. Words hanging in the air.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        My daughter is dead. 

           He pushes out a ragged breath. Trembling. Unexpectedly
           overtaken by the profound, inescapable reality of it. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I am sorry you found no meaning in
                        her account of her life. 

           He pushes back from the table. Gathers the notebooks.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I will show myself out.
           INT. BEDROOM, BOSTON GATEWAY HOTEL -- EVENING

           Otto sits in dusky stillness. Weak light, falling fast,
           spilling in through the window. Washing through the smeary,
           steamed glass, frost. Flaking windowsill, brittle, yellowed
           windowshade. Wallpaper peeling. Wood footers, crown molding,
           scratched-up and worn. Inky shadows puddling in the corners
           of the room. Smearing out across the weather-beaten carpet. 

           He peels off his glasses. Peers toward the window. Bleary
           haze of fluttering snowflakes flitting idly by. Newspapers
           slumped on the banged-up end table beside the sash. "Snowfall
           Brings City to Virtual Standstill." "66 Die in Wyoming Plane
           Crash." "Communist Troops From North Korea Invade US-Sponsored
           South Area." He gazes foggily at the headlines. Defeat pitting
           his glassy eyes. The world has moved on.

           LATER:

           Otto sits at the cramped writing desk. Window now a black
           wedge, steamed opaque. Dim lamp switched on beside the bed.
           Washing yellowed warmth across the room. He drags the nib of
           his pen, scribbling out a TELEGRAM on a faded Western Union
           card. No from L,B. Nothing from Doubleday. Home soon. Otto. 

           He draws back. Regards his own smudged handwriting. 

           Eyes sticking on Doubleday. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. ENTRYWAY, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- DAWN

           Alice, hair disheveled, last night's rumpled red cocktail
           dress, lipstick smudged, eyes hazed with an early-morning
           hangover, pushes in through the front door. Heels clopping
           on the bare hardwood floor. She stumbles. Drops her KEYS
           with a loud CLATTER. 

           Winces. Bends to collect them. Drawing up, she pushes the
           door shut as softly as she can. Twists back - 

           - leans guiltily to the mouth of the hall. Squints. Eyes
           sticking on the narrow sliver of light already leaking out
           from beneath Barbara's bedroom door.

           INT. BARBARA'S BEDROOM, WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT -- DAWN

           Barbara hunches at the desk in a puddle of weak morning light.
           Eyes bleary. Shadowed. Darting across the final SENTENCES of
           typescript on the last page of the MANUSCRIPT. Drawing to a
           halt. Eyes fixed on the last words of the final entry, dated
           August 1, 1944: 

           "Finally I twist my heart round again, so that the bad is on
           the outside and the good is on the inside - I do this to
           protect myself - as I keep on trying to find a way of becoming 
           what I would so like to be, and I could be, if there weren't
           any Nazis living in the world. Yours, Anne M. Frank."

           She blinks. Sits back in the wooden chair. Rocked. Emotionally
           spent. Unable, for a moment, to move. She pushes out a ragged
           breath. Gaze settling on the framed PHOTOGRAPH of her sister's
           wedding, her beaming parents, the happy family, sequestered
           among the piled papers cluttering the desk.

           She becomes aware of the crisp autumn light washing in through
           the window. Morning. Bed covers neatly tucked away, untouched.
           She has not slept. Hair disheveled. Sleeping gown hastily
           thrown on, now rumpled. 

           She peels off her glasses. Eyes, hazy, fogged, distant,
           settling on the PHOTOGRAPH of Anne, shy smile, mischievous
           eyes. Junior editors' REPORT stapled through the cover page.
           All three PASSES. 

           She stares at them. Drags her eyes toward the hard, shearing
           morning light. Potted orchid, brought home, catching the sun
           in a peach-colored glow.

           INT. OFFICE BULLPEN, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- AFTERNOON

           Heels clacking, wending her way through the metal desks,
           chattering IBM TYPEWRITERS, ringing telephones, TYPING GIRLS,
           headphones plugged into Dictaphone machines, Barbara draws
           up at the desk of Cora, blonde, now 24, formerly a fellow
           TYPING GIRL.

           TELEPHONE pressed to her ear. Wire-frame INBOX, OUTBOX planted
           at the edge of her desk. Manila envelopes sandwiched beside
           a slurry of loose papers, IBM Typewriter, enamel ashtray. 

           Barbara, manuscript tucked under her arm, eyes fixed on the
           frosted glass office door. Hard black stenciled lettering,
           Donald Black, Editor. Cora, scribbling a note on a carbon
           paper call slip replaces the telephone in its cradle.  

           Barbara, ignored, clears her throat.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Is he in?

           Cora tosses a glance at her. Resentful. Shimmying a bulging
           file out of the cabinet.

                                 CORA
                        He's not available, I'm sorry.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I have something for him.

           Cora draws back from the file cabinet. Manila folder in hand.
           Settles a hard, icy, penetrating gaze on Barbara.
                                 CORA
                        He's asked not to be disturbed.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Until when?

                                 CORA
                        Until after the holiday.

           Cora flips open the manila folder, peels back the cover page.
           Groping for a pencil. Knees the file cabinet shut.

           Barbara pushes the rumpled MANUSCRIPT at her. Fresh COVER
           LETTER affixed to the top. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Please see that he gets this. It's
                        important.

           Cora pushes a flat line of a smile at her. 

                                 CORA
                        I'll certainly do what I can, Ms.
                        Zimmerman.

           Barbara, hardening. Draws back. Gaze dragging to his DOOR.

           INT. DONALD BLACK'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- CONTINUOUS

           Donald Black, hunched at the mahogany desk. Tie undone, Oxford
           shirt unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up. Rumpled PAPERS besieging
           the IBM TYPEWRITER. Smeary high-ball glass, mostly empty
           puddle of scotch. He JOLTS, looks abruptly up as -

           - Barbara pushes in through the door. Cora shoving to her
           feet behind her. Manila folder fluttering, spilling papers
           across the floor beneath her desk. Donald looks to Cora.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        What is the meaning of this?

                                 CORA
                        I'm sorry, Mr. Black, she just barged
                        right past me.

           Barbara pushes the MANUSCRIPT at him.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        You asked me to bring you something
                        that we can publish. I have found
                        it.

           He regards her. Eyes flicking to the accordion of smashed,
           dog-eared pages. He twists in his chair. Reaches to take it
           from her. Flipping back the top sheets, stapled letters.
           Halting on the JUNIOR EDITORS' REPORTS. He scowls.
                                 DONALD BLACK
                        My editors have passed on this
                        already.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Your editors are wrong. 

           He looks sharply up at her. Flicker of a condescending smile.
           She balks for a moment under the force of his gaze. Slouches
           back in his chair. Assesses her. Reaches for the smudged
           glass of scotch.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You have better judgment than two
                        Harvard graduates and an Oxford Rhodes
                        Scholar?

           She summons her courage, steels herself.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I have a better perspective on the
                        material.

           He throws back the last of the whiskey. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        Well thank God we have you then.
                        What would Doubleday do without the
                        visionary insights of Barbara
                        Zimmerman?

           Barbara, flushing. Cora, a smug, steely presence in the
           doorway behind her. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        If you read it and you feel that I
                        am wrong then you may have my letter
                        of resignation on Monday morning.

           He meets her gaze. Smirks. Dumps the DIARY MANUSCRIPT into
           the overflowing wire-frame INBOX beside the telephone. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You may as well spend the weekend
                        packing up your desk.

           INT. RECEPTION, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- AFTERNOON

           Otto stands at the vast steamed window. Gazes outward.
           Snowflakes swirling, fluttering in a curtain across the
           rambling trenched infinity of Manhattan. Penn Station, spire
           of the Chrysler Building spearing at the winter sky. Pill-
           shaped Checker Model A3 TAXI CABS honking, troughing through
           the snow already slushing the street far below. Bustling
           umbrellas, New Yorkers scurrying through the blizzard.

           He flicks a glance back at DAWN, 23, the receptionist,
           elegant, blonde, perfect ruby lips, on the TELEPHONE. 
           Dwarfed by her walnut desk, wire-frame inbox and outbox jammed
           with courier envelopes, loosely-bound manuscripts. Woodgrain
           walls washed by the brittle winter light. Two gray-linen
           Danish sofas facing each other. Glass-topped coffee table
           neatly arrayed with red-and-white Publisher's Weekly, grinning
           BRUNETTE WOMAN on the black-and-white cover of Life Magazine,
           "UCLA Homecoming Queen Allyn Smith."

           He glances at the George Nelson metal starburst WALL CLOCK
           on the woodgrain wall. TELEPHONE ringing again. Dawn,
           besieged, scoops it up, listens, looks over as a second
           telephone RINGS. He pushes out a breath. Turns back. 

           Eyes sticking on the Doubleday Catalogue laid out on the
           glass coffee table. He stoops, picks it up. Leafs it open.
           Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles. Isaac Asimov's Pebble
           in the Sky. Donald Black's PHOTOGRAPH in black-and-white.

                                 DAWN (O.S.)
                        Mr. Frank?

           He looks up. She is cupping the telephone.

                                 DAWN (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry, Mr. Black will need to
                        reschedule your appointment. He sends
                        his regrets.

           Otto pushes out a breath. Flips the catalogue shut. Replaces
           it on the stack of magazines. Draws toward her desk.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        What time would better suit him?

                                 DAWN
                        His office suggested the week of
                        January 8th.

           He is caught off-guard. Reeling. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I must return to Boston on Monday.
                        Is there no possibility that he could
                        perhaps make time tomorrow?

                                 DAWN
                        The office is closed tomorrow.

           He peers at her through fogged glasses. Not understanding.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        It is Thursday.

                                 DAWN
                        It's Thanksgiving.

           Exhaustion weighing. Futility. He peels off his glasses. 
                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Has he even read the manuscript?

           She fixes him with an appraising stare. Eyes sticking on his
           ragged wool coat. Trousers worn at the knees. Shabby shoes.

                                 DAWN
                        Did he request it?

           INT. ELEVATOR, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Airless warmth. Cramped. Woodgrain walls splashed with sallow
           fluorescent light. Otto stands, hollowed. Exhausted. OPERATOR,
           67, white-haired, creased black skin, immaculate tasseled
           uniform, his back turned to Otto, consummately silent, weary
           eyes resting on the brass Otis Elevator plaque. Reaching to
           drag the inner scissor gate shut. Halts as -

           Jason Epstein, flushed in the face, slightly disheveled,
           narrowly slips inside. WALTER I. BRADBURY, 35, thick glasses,
           ducking in behind him. Nods to the Operator as he pulls the
           rattling gate shut.

           Elevator descending. Bradbury gazes upward at the cast iron
           floor indicator, arrow gradually dragging downward. Pushes
           out a breath. Frowns. Cocks his neck. Kink in it. Rakes his
           fingers through his hair. Crackling gold wrapper, Jason,
           fumbling with a Sen-Sen breath mint, red package jammed into
           his tweed coat pocket. 

           Bradbury smirks. Jason self-conscious. Wriggles the mint
           out. Pushes it into his mouth. Balls the wrapper back into
           his coat pocket. Bradbury, smile flickering at his lips.
           Unscrews the cap of a small steel hip flask. Takes a sizable
           pull. Winces. Swallows it down. Offers it to Jason. Jason
           shakes his head.

                                 WALTER I. BRADBURY
                        Live a little, kid. She never comes
                        to these things anyway.

           Jason flushes. Fidgets. Fumbling with his tie. Bradbury tosses
           a glance at Otto. Takes another swig from his flask. Sneers.
           Watching Jason fix his cufflinks.

                                 WALTER I. BRADBURY (CONT'D)
                        Wait 'til he starts in about Asimov
                        and the champagne's already run out.

           Jason snorts. Otto, registering. Drags his gaze up.

           INT. LOBBY FOYER, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Otto draws up to the window. Glazed with steam, dappled ice
           on the outside. Wrapping himself in his threadbare woolen
           coat as he stares out across the slushy street. Icy rain
           tickering against the glass. Eyes sticking on the bustling
           shapes of -
           - Jason and Bradbury as they kick their way through the sleet
           and gathering snow toward the warm wash of orange light,
           steamed windows of the Hotel Pennsylvania, across West 32nd
           Street.

           INT. DINING ROOM, CAFE ROUGE, HOTEL PENNSYLVANIA -- NIGHT

           Otto draws into the cavernous, swimming warmth. Instantly
           overwhelmed. Haze of babbling voices, laughter. Flickering
           candlelight. White satin dresses, Brooks Brothers suits,
           dapper hair combed. Limestone walls, terra cotta tiles. Marble
           columns overhung by an antique wood-beam ceiling. Windows
           glazed with steam. Elegant white tablecloths, wine glasses,
           Dom Perignon champagne bottles iced in silver buckets. 

           Lilting string quartet set up beneath the alcove-cradled
           fountain. Glistening ice sculpture, carved in the shape of
           the canted anchor and dolphin, Doubleday's colophon.

           Otto, glasses steamed, flushed in the face, woolen jacket
           flecked at the shoulders with melting ice, absorbs. Jason
           Epstein, Bradbury shimmying their way toward the bar.

                                 MAITRE'D (O.S.)
                        Are you a guest of the party, sir?

           He gives a start, turns. MAITRE'D, 46, thinning hair combed
           severely back. Mustache trimmed to a pencil line. Immaculate
           white starched tuxedo. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I was looking for Mr. Donald Black.

           The Maitre'd flicks a glance up and down him. Underdressed.

                                 MAITRE'D
                        And you are?

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Otto Frank.

                                 MAITRE'D
                        Right this way, Mr. Frank.

           The Maitre'd rounds on his heels. Ducking officiously around
           a YOUNG MAN and WOMAN cradling foie gras canapés. Otto
           shuffling after him. Immersed all at once in -

           Blossoming warmth, laughter, clattering silver cutlery. Plates
           puddled with buttery shirred eggs, oily chicken livers.
           Pearls, sweating gin fizz cocktails. Wending toward a -

           - large round TABLE bathed in flickering candlelight. Flushed
           in the face, tie loosened, shirt unbuttoned, Donald Black,
           hunched over the greasy remnants of a tenderloin steak. Pan-
           fried Potatoes O'Brien. His WIFE, 28, a young slip of a girl,
           beside him, emerald dress, buzzed with gin. Frank Price,
           half a chicken picked mostly clean. 
           His WIFE, 47, thick-framed, sweet-faced, plucking at a crab-
           meat salad. 

           Otto, aware all at once of his appearance. The impropriety
           of being here. Maitre'd turning to him -

                                 MAITRE'D (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Black, may I present Mr. Otto
                        Frank.

           Donald, reaching for the gummy gravy boat, nearly upsetting
           his Wife's sweating Rob Roy. Flicks a glance at Otto. Squints. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        I'm sorry, do we know each other?

           Eyes of everyone at the table settling on him. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I am afraid that we do not. 

           Donald draws back. Fixing Otto with a whiskey-fogged gaze. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        In truth, I do not entirely know why
                        I have come here.

           He settles his glassy gaze on the table. Grease-puddled
           plates. Sagging all at once beneath the futility of it. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        My daughter kept a diary during the
                        occupation, in Amsterdam. I am fairly
                        certain that you have rejected it. 

           Donald, souring. The Maitre'd, mortified, turns hastily back.

                                 MAITRE'D
                        Mr. Black, my sincerest apologies, I
                        assumed -

           Otto, faraway now. A certain peace in the surrender.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        I had come here in the hope that I
                        might convince you to reconsider.
                        But I fear that I do not have the
                        heart for it. To hear one more time
                        how beautifully, utterly irrelevant
                        her life was. 

           He pushes out a breath. Resigned. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I suppose that I must accept what so
                        many have tried to impress upon me:
                        that the world does not care about
                        one girl who died among millions.
           Donald cuts a glance at the Maitre'd. The Maitre'd snaps to
           attention. Reaches. Takes Otto by the arm.

                                 MAITRE'D
                        Mr. Frank, I must ask you to leave.

           Otto stirs. Drags his focus back. Flicker of a sad smile.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Yes. Of course. 

           He turns. Halts himself. The table still frozen. Silent. He
           rakes his eyes back to them.

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        It was suggested to me once that
                        there is a burden upon those of us
                        who survived - to share the names
                        and lives of those who did not. So
                        that the world would know and would
                        appreciate what had been lost. Not
                        by us as Jews or by us as the Dutch
                        or as Europeans. But as the human
                        race. A life is lost in Auschwitz, a
                        life is lost in New York City. Neither
                        is more tragic than the other. What
                        we have lost, you, also, have lost.
                        My daughter's name was Anne Frank. I
                        came here to share her with you. I
                        have found, in fact, that doing so
                        has been no burden at all. It has
                        kept her alive.

           He draws a ragged breath. Now utterly spent. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        I am sorry to have interrupted your
                        dinner.

           Frank Price, gaze lingering upon him. Captivated. 

           INT. OFFICE BULLPEN, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- LATE NIGHT

           Blackness. Flickering, sputtering to life, fluorescent
           overhead lights washing, dully on. Paleness spilling down
           across jumbled metal desks, pushed together. IBM typewriters
           sheathed in vinyl dust covers. Telephones, slouching stacks
           of manila file folders. Desk fans, idle, lifeless. Desk chairs
           neatly pushed in. The office closed for the holiday weekend.

           Frank Price, tuxedo shirt unbuttoned at the collar, bowtie
           undone, dangling loosely, peers across the room. Eyes settling
           on the frosted glass, STENCILED office door. Donald Black,
           Editor.
           INT. DONALD BLACK'S OFFICE, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Price stands in the open doorway. Foggy fluorescent spilling
           in. Washing across two towering BOOKCASES, shelves bowing,
           jammed with MANUSCRIPTS, leather-bound books, loose papers.
           Dusty American flag, hazy old black-and-white PHOTOGRAPHS in
           frames. Price, his back to them, flipping through the jumbled
           pile of MANUSCRIPTS jammed in Donald Black's wire-frame INBOX. 

           He shuffles to the OUTBOX, "LOG & DISCARD," beside it. Flips
           past two heaping MANUSCRIPTS, loosely bound, weary dog-eared
           pages. Draws up short. Burrows his way between them. Wriggles
           out the MANUSCRIPT. Rumpled title page stapled with a COVER
           LETTER, smashed, peeling back to reveal the junior editors'
           REPORTS, all PASSES, beneath it. Wrinkled, creased PHOTOGRAPH.
           Anne. Haunting innocent smile. Life in her eyes.

           He squints. Hefts it over into the wash of pale fluorescent.
           Presses flat the COVER LETTER stapled to the top. Eyes darting
           down the page. "From: Barbara Zimmerman. Recommend strongly
           reconsider...a work that must be published...the voice of a
           lost generation." He blinks. Pries back her letter. The junior
           editors' PASSES. The PHOTOGRAPH staring up at him. Beneath
           it, the title page.

           "THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL BY ANNE FRANK."

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT PORCH, ZIMMERMAN HOME [WESTON, MASS.] -- NIGHT

           Barbara stands, bathed in the pale glow of the porch light.
           Warm yellow-orange light leaking from the lace curtains,
           steamed windows. Patched-up rucksack slung over one shoulder,
           woolen winter coat bundled around her, she waits anxiously.
           Frigid wind swirling snowflakes, frozen rain, in across the
           doormat, aluminum box for the milkman. Jolting as -

           - the crisp red front door pulls abruptly open. HAROLD
           ZIMMERMAN, 57, gray cardigan sweater, ironed slacks, halo of
           gray-white hair ruffled slightly, wine, dinner-table joke
           lingering in his eyes, draws up short. Blindsided. 

           Behind him, the plaster-walled corridor, curling staircase,
           wood-paneled dining room spilling warmth through the open
           doorway. Clattering plates, laughter, voices, a glimpse of
           her MOTHER, 52, in a flowery house dress, passing around a
           greasy plate of potatoes. Her SISTER, 27, face aglow beside
           her HUSBAND, 30, LAUGHING at a COUSIN, 7 holding up a forkful
           of stuffing. Thanksgiving dinner.

           Barbara, emotion welling, overwhelmed, drops the stitched-up
           rucksack on the slatted wooden porch. Surges forward.
           Enveloping her father in a tight embrace. He stands for a
           moment. Caught off-guard. She clings to him. Eyes all at
           once moist. 
           Thawing, he sways forward. Hugs her back. Holds her. The two
           of them rocking back from the doorway. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, SUNSHINE HOTEL [NEW YORK CITY] -- MORNING

           Otto drags awake. Hard November sunlight in his eyes. Cutting
           through the shade pulled down over the grimy window. Razored
           brightness cutting across buckled floorboards, shabby
           armchair, worn through, bursting with stuffing. Banged-up
           bed. Murky, unclean sheets.

           SUPER: "Monday."

           He winces, brightness in his eyes. Pushes onto his back.
           Exhaustion weighing upon him. Rumpled flannel pajamas twisted,
           clinging to him. He gazes up at the ceiling. Sopping brown
           stains, water damage blistering the flaking paint, plaster.
           He lies for a moment. SOUNDS of the STREET below, honking
           taxi cabs, banging trash cans, shouting voices, leaking in
           through the window. 

           He pushes out a breath. Steaming in the frigid cold. Elbows
           his way up to a sitting position. Weary, fogged eyes, a glassy
           deadness to them, falling upon the cracked leather VALISE.
           Slouched in the armchair. Zipped up. Already packed. Leather
           PORTFOLIO, the MANUSCRIPT, resting on the chewed-up end table
           beside it. Eyes sticking on it. Etch of pain. Loss. Guilt. 

           He has failed her.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE BULLPEN, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MORNING

           Hard, harsh fluorescent. Chattering typewriters, ringing
           telephones, bleary smear of secretaries' VOICES, metal file
           cabinet drawers, shuffling papers. Frank Price, rumpled,
           face flushed from the cold outside, overcoat, fedora flecked
           with melting ice, snowflakes, wending his way in. Tormented
           eyes falling on - 

           - Barbara, weary, just arriving, eyes shadowed with the
           anticipation, uncertainty, of facing Donald Black. Lifting
           her purse onto her desk. Manila envelopes jammed under one
           arm. Reaching to sift through the fresh slouching pile of
           them waiting in the wire-frame inbox.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Zimmerman. 

           Barbara, squinting through her glasses at the top submission.
           Flicks a sharp glance up. Disoriented. Price cocks his head. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        Walk with me.
           INT. CORRIDOR, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Wingtip shoes snapping, squelching wetly on the tiled floor,
           Price, keeping his pace, eyes dragging over the wood-paneled
           walls, framed PORTRAITS of Herman Melville, Frank Nelson
           Doubleday, Doubleday & Co. co-founder Samuel McClure. Elegant
           mahogany OFFICE DOORS. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        You've been with us, what, three
                        years?

           Barbara, fumbling, caught off-guard, envelopes still tucked
           under her arm. Uncertain whether she is in trouble. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Four years and three months. This
                        past August. 

           Price nods to Walter I. Bradbury, hung-over, rumpled, ducking
           into the frosted-glass door of the men's room. Twists back. 

           Pushes a rumpled MANUSCRIPT at Barbara. Flustered, she takes
           it. Eyes sticking on the title page. She slows. THE DIARY OF
           A YOUNG GIRL.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I imagine that looks familiar to
                        you. 

           She falters. Dread welling. He rakes a glance at her. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        You did recommend it?

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I did, Mr. Price.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        It was submitted to Donald Black.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I stumbled upon it. In the mailroom.
                        I couldn't put it down.

           She steels herself. Expecting the worst.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Has he spoken to you about it?

           He flicks a glance over his shoulder. Unreadable. Slowing.
           Double doors, oak paneled ahead of them.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        You are aware that all three of Mr.
                        Black's junior editors rejected it.
                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Yes. I am aware of that.

           He draws at last to a halt. Rounding on her. She shifts.
           Nervous. Envelopes slipping under her arm. She reseats them.
           Blanches. His piercing eyes upon her. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I felt it was a voice that I had
                        never heard before. And one that
                        needs to be heard.

           He stares levelly at her. She affords him a timid glance.
           Chagrined. Flushing in the face. Poised to be fired.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I happen to agree with you.

           Barbara, blind-sided. He resumes walking. Toward the double
           doors. She hastens after him. Trying to keep up. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        I'm late for a meeting with Donald
                        Black and Nelson Doubleday. You are
                        the reason that I am late.

           She chokes. Nearly trips.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I'm sorry. I - don't understand.

           He draws up to the doors. Rounds on her once more. Skewering
           her with a hard, penetrating stare.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Do you believe in this manuscript?

           She gulps. Summons her courage.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I do. With all my heart.

           Price, the faintest tug of a smile. Pride. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Good. Now you must fight for it.

           He reaches. Grasps the polished brass doorknob. Twists. Tugs
           it open. Barbara, reeling, no choice but to follow him in.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Murky haze of cigarette smoke. Glazed by cold November morning
           light. Falling in across polished oak-panel walls. Mahogany
           bookcases. Each shelf neatly filled with leather-bound
           Doubleday hardcover first editions. Melville's Moby Dick.
           Rudyard Kipling. Vladimir Nabokov's Bend Sinister.
           Hunched at the polished conference table, NELSON DOUBLEDAY,
           61, hawklike, suit jacket shucked off, vest, tie, bristling
           mustache, glasses, his messy hair catching the buttery morning
           light. Cigarette twisting blue smoke between his fingers. 

           Donald Black, slouched in the chair beside him, pasty, jowly,
           pressing at the dog-eared corner of a budget document. Twists
           in his wheezing chair to glance back as Frank Price steps
           into the room. Pale sunlight glinting in his glasses. Barbara,
           stiff, mortified, at his heels. 

           Donald, a tug of a smirk. Eyes raking over Frank.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        He lives and breathes after all.

           Price pushes a flat smile at him. Donald, twisting back,
           tosses a sneer at Doubleday.

                                 DONALD BLACK (CONT'D)
                        I told Nelson we had likely lost you
                        to the chocolate cream pie.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        Morning, Frank. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Good morning.

           Donald, steely gaze settling on Barbara. Hardening.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You can just leave the letter on my
                        desk, sweetheart.

           Price, dragging back a high-backed leather chair. Glances
           back at her. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        Actually, I asked Ms. Zimmerman to
                        join us this morning.

           Donald, skewers her with a glare. Doubleday squints through
           his glasses at the meeting agenda. Perplexed. 

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        Have we need for a typist?

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        We had an unexpected guest at the
                        party on Wednesday night.

           He drags his gaze to Donald. Buttery brightness streaming in
           around him. Donald scowls at him.
                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        He made quite an impassioned argument
                        for a manuscript that he had submitted
                        on behalf of his daughter.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        It was an embarrassment. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I was sufficiently intrigued to seek
                        out the manuscript. Only to find as
                        it happens that Ms. Zimmerman had
                        recommended it.

           Donald rakes his burning eyes back to Barbara. Livid. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        You went behind my back.

           She stands rooted, skewered. Doubleday squints at her. Not
           understanding. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        She made such a convincing argument
                        that I was compelled to read it over
                        the holiday.

           He twists in his chair. 

                                 FRANK PRICE (CONT'D)
                        I thought it only fair to allow her
                        to explain her position to us.

           Barbara rooted to the spot. Speechless. Donald, seething.
           Rakes a glance at Doubleday. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        It is a treatise on women's issues.
                        A book for women. It bored me to
                        tears. 

           Barbara is stung. Goaded. Lurching all at once out of her -

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        It's not just for women. 

           Donald squints back at her. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        The author is a fourteen-year-old
                        girl.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        A book that is authored by a woman
                        does not have to appeal only to women.
                        I have read plenty of books written
                        by men.
           Doubleday grunts.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        I should hope that you have. Last I
                        was aware, we are not in the habit
                        of retaining editors unfamiliar with
                        the literary canon.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        This book belongs in the literary
                        canon.

           Donald snorts, reaches for his cigarette. Scornful. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        I fear her emotions may be getting
                        the better of her.

           Barbara takes a step forward. Prodded. Spurned by this prig.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        There is no doubt in my mind that
                        this will be the most important book
                        to come out of the War.

           Donald, lifting his cigarette, nearly chokes.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        What does a woman know about war?

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        How to survive it.

           Doubleday, poised, also, to curtail this carnival, arrested.
           Intrigued. Donald tosses a glance at him. Impatient. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        A woman knows how to bear witness to
                        atrocity and emerge with a deeper
                        understanding, not of despair but of
                        the good that evil evokes in good
                        people. A woman knows that to change
                        the world is not a matter simply of
                        defeating an opponent, but of
                        supplanting his malevolence with
                        beauty and forgiveness and acceptance.

           Donald scoffs, pushes out a smoky breath.

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        These are girlish fantasies.

           Barbara, bristling, defiant.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        At fourteen, this girl understood
                        that her life was not defined by

                        what happened to her or what other
                        people told her that she was worth
                        but by what she did with her time
                        and how she affected everyone around
                        her. She has inspired me. She has
                        shown me a new way of seeing the
                        world. If we do not consider that
                        worth publishing, then I would suggest
                        we are not worthy of considering
                        ourselves stewards of literature.

           Price, watching her, pride flickering in his eyes.

           Doubleday, impassive. Expressionless. Eyes shifting from her
           to the rumpled MANUSCRIPT. Lingering. Drags his gaze to Price.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        You've read the book?

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I have.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        And you share Ms. Zimmerman's
                        assessment?

           Price flicks a glance back up at her. Flushed in the face.

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I do.

           Doubleday regards him. Barbara. The MANUSCRIPT. Donald,
           incredulous that it is even being considered. 

                                 DONALD BLACK
                        Mark my words. If we were to publish
                        this book, it would sell exactly
                        three copies in the world: hers, the
                        girl's, and her father's.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        The girl perished. In Bergen-Belsen.
                        So did her sister. Her mother, in
                        Auschwitz. 

           Donald, sneer hardening slightly. Barbara, eyes settled on
           the MANUSCRIPT. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        That diary is all that remains of
                        them.

           Doubleday watches her. Her eyes glinting, moist, reflecting
           back the morning light. He drags his gaze to Price. 

           Price watches him. Doubleday, considering. 
                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                            (to Frank Price)
                        You backed a costly failure for us.
                        You backed two, in fact. 

           Price does not deny it. Donald's smug gaze settling back on
           him.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY (CONT'D)
                        When my father started this company
                        in 1897, he used to say: One failure
                        is an aberration. Two is a pattern.
                        Three is cause for a change in
                        strategy.

           Price meets his gaze again. Doubleday holds it.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY (CONT'D)
                        You are willing to stake your career
                        on this manuscript.

           Barbara, flickering alarm. Not how she intended for this to
           go. 

                                 FRANK PRICE
                        I am.

           Understanding between both men. What is on the line.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        Then we will try your strategy for a
                        third time.

           He drags his gaze up to Barbara. She stands, light-headed. 

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Ms. Zimmerman. You
                        have a book to edit.

           Barbara, reeling. Price smiles at her. Warm. Genuine. Donald,
           stewing, shakes his head.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Doubleday.
                        Mr. Price. I don't - quite know what
                        to say.

                                 NELSON DOUBLEDAY
                        You may start by contacting the father
                        to make a formal offer.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Yes. Of course. Yes. I'll do that.
                        Thank you. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. 1950 CHECKER A3 TAXICAB -- MORNING

           Otto gazes with dull, vacant eyes out through the window.
           Dirty slush, clumped snow. Umbrellas, New Yorkers, splashing
           by in soaked boots, trenchcoats. A GIRL, 8, yellow rubber
           galoshes, skipping her way from one frozen puddle to another.
           Ragged HOMELESS WOMAN, 76, white-haired, wrapped in a filthy
           tarpaulin, dragging a rattling metal cart. Sleet flecking
           her leathery face. Ignored by the bustling FAMILIES around
           her.

           Otto watches her. Sorrow welling. Hardship endured everywhere.
           Suffering. Indifference. He draws back from the window. Eyes
           of the DRIVER fixed on him in the hazy rear-view MIRROR.
           Awaiting instruction. Nowhere left to go. 

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Pennsylvania Station, please.

           He twists, peers back out the foggy rear windshield. Trench
           of high-rises cutting away, infinite. Chevrolet, Ford Custom
           Deluxe coupe, Checker cabs HONKING. Eyes catching on -

           - the red jacket, cap of the HOTEL BELLBOY as he dashes out
           into the rain. Frantically casts up and down the street.
           Waves. Calling out. Otto, taken-aback. Turns forward in his
           seat. 

                                 OTTO FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Wait. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DOUBLEDAY & CO. -- LATER / DAY

           Otto stands at the window. Crisp November sunlight washing
           in across him. Hard-edged. He gazes out. Eyes distant,
           hollowed. Reflecting back the narrow spire of the Empire
           State Building. Street below sheathed in ice and snow.
           Expression unreadable. Frown etching his brow. Behind him,
           hands clasped, uncertain -

           - Barbara stands beside a high-backed leather chair. Tense.
           Watches him. Framed in the slashing sunlight. Hunched
           slightly. Tired. Burdened. 

           Barbara, tormented, unable to hold it in any longer.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Have you already promised it to
                        another publisher?

           Otto stirs. Drags his gaze from the soupy midday glare. He
           turns. Shuffling. Drags weary eyes at last to her. Taut-faced.
           Earnest. Barbara, spurred by his silence. 
                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        We were born only ten months apart -
                        she and I. Did you know that?

           He gazes at her. Taken off-guard.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I felt, when I read her diary, that
                        I had gained a friend. One much
                        brighter than I.

           Barbara, a flicker of a rueful smile. Otto, rooted with
           emotion. She avoids his gaze.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Even now, it does not seem as though
                        she is gone. She is alive in the
                        pages of that book. All I have to do
                        to visit her is open it and start
                        reading.

           He expels a ragged breath. Moist eyes flickering. Welling up
           out of him. She meets his gaze at last.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Your daughter's work is luminous. It
                        is a testament to all that is good
                        in the human spirit. You must let us
                        publish it. It would be a travesty
                        for it to be locked away in a drawer.
                        It must be published. For the good
                        of everyone.

           Otto, thick-voiced. Trembling. Lump in his throat. Strains
           to speak.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        You will publish it in its entirety?
                        You will not let them harm her?

           She smiles. Her own eyes stinging. Understands. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I will guard her words with my life.
                        I promise you.

           He surges forward. Hugs her. She totters backward. Enveloped
           in emotion. He clings to her. Tears welling in his eyes.
           Weight at last lifting.

                                 OTTO FRANK
                        Thank you. 

           She wraps her arms around him. Hugs him back. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. MAIN OFFICE, OPEKTA JAM FACTORY -- AFTERNOON

           Miep hunches at her desk, flipping through carbon-paper
           invoices. Haze of cigarette smoke. Chattering typewriters.
           Telephones ringing. Shuffling files. Bep, pregnant now, arms
           loaded down with rumpled envelopes, invoices, letters,
           shuffles through the stack. Presses a TELEGRAM card at Miep. 

           Miep, squinting through her glasses at a column of numbers,
           flicks a glance up. Etch of a frown. Eyes sticking on it.
           She reaches. Drags it toward her. Reads it.

           "DOUBLEDAY TO PUBLISH DIARY IN AMERICA. OTTO."

           Miep stares. Overcome with a tide of emotion. Flicker of a
           smile even as her eyes well with stinging tears. She sits
           back in her wheezing chair. Smile spreading. Warmth,
           happiness, washing over her.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. FOURTH [PARK] AVE., STRAND BOOKSTORE [NEW YORK] -- DAY

           Otto stands at the broad plate window. TRAFFIC surging around
           him. Muggy warmth. NEW YORKERS brusquely slipping back and
           forth. He is fleshier, slightly, in the face. Eased, relaxed.
           Eyes no longer shadowed. He gazes past his own smeary
           reflection. Through the window at - 

           - ANNE FRANK. Her FACE, PHOTOGRAPH beaming from a DOZEN copies
           of The Diary of a Young Girl, positioned on a large mahogany
           table by the front entrance.

           SUPER: "June 16, 1952."

           A MAN, 36, blond, crisp white polo shirt, stands reading a
           copy. His DAUGHTER, 13, skinny, dark brown hair, bright green
           eyes, beside him, reading another copy. DOZENS of other PEOPLE
           crowding the store. All reading copies of the DIARY. More
           jostling in the LINE that stretches out the smudged glass
           door, pushing away down the BLOCK. Half the world has come
           out to read her words.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY, STRAND BOOKSTORE -- CONTINUOUS

           Barbara stands at the banister overlooking the sales floor.
           Yellow sun dress, warmth flushing her face. Sunlight streaming
           through the hazy windows, washing across the HUBBUB of
           CUSTOMERS jamming the tiny bookshop floor. Turns as -

           - Jason Epstein, rumpled Oxford shirt loosened at the collar,
           draws up beside her. Flicks a timid glance at her. Peers
           down. Awed by the size of the crowd.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        They're sending couriers to Garden
                        City for more copies. They've sold
                        out already.
                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        You must be so proud.

           Barbara, slight flicker of a frown at that. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        I'm proud of her.

                                 JASON EPSTEIN
                        It couldn't have happened without
                        you. 

           She looks over at him. Touched by that. Surprised. He offers
           her a shy smile.  

                                 JASON EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Ms. Zimmerman.

           She stares at him, moved. He flushes, looks back down at the
           crowd. She continues to watch him.

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN
                        Barbara. 

           He flicks a bashful glance back at her. 

                                 BARBARA ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Call me Barbara. 

           He smiles in spite of himself. Does not look away.

           EXT. FOURTH [PARK] AVE., STRAND BOOKSTORE -- CONTINUOUS

           Otto, at the window, deeply, profoundly moved. Eyes dragging
           back to his own reflection. Ghost of FOURTH AVENUE, churning
           Checker taxicabs, diesel buses, smearing by behind him.
           Crisscrossing pedestrians. He flicks one last glance at the
           churning PEOPLE inside the bookstore. Anne's face everywhere.

           He draws away. Squints upward. Across the ruddy towers of
           the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. PEDESTRIANS bustling all around
           him. Hard summer sunlight glinting in the windows high
           overhead. Crisp blue sky. Sun piercing through wispy clouds.
           Life. Everywhere.

           Otto takes it in. Absorbing it. Smiles. Unreserved.
           Unburdened. Smiles the way Anne would have smiled if she
           stood here with him. Seeing it through her eyes.

           This grand, beautiful place.

           POSTSCRIPT: First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote the
           introduction to the first edition of Anne Frank: The Diary
           of a Young Girl. She deemed it, "One of the wisest and most
           moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings
           that I have ever read." 
           POSTSCRIPT: The initial print run of 5,000 copies sold out
           hours after hitting shelves. A second printing of 15,000
           sold out within a day. It would go on to sell more than 35
           million copies in 67 languages, becoming the most successful
           autobiography of all time.

           POSTSCRIPT: The publication of Anne Frank's Diary launched
           Barbara Zimmerman's career. She went on to co-found The New
           York Review of Books, where she remained an editor for 43
           years. She married Jason Epstein in 1953. 

           POSTSCRIPT: Miep Gies lived to the age of 100. She passed
           away in 2010, survived by her son, Paul, daughter-in-law,
           Lucie, and three grandchildren. 

           POSTSCRIPT: Otto Frank married former neighbor Elfriede
