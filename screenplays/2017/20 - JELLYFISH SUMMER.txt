           INT. MAISIE AND REBECCA’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           That sleepy blue hue, just before dawn; not quite dark, not 
           quite light.

           An orange KITTEN snoozes atop an occupied bed. 

           And beneath the thin sheets, MAISIE RAY (10, Black) stirs. 

           Her forehead is rimmed with sweat, a product of the 
           oppressive heat.

           She’s got the unkempt hair of a tomboy, the restlessness of 
           an adventurer. 

           The kitten stretches lazily as Maisie quickly untangles 
           herself from the covers. Her movement disturbs REBECCA RAY 
           (15, Black), also asleep on the slim mattress. 

           Rebecca’s hair is pulled neatly into two tight braids, her 
           body limp and begrudging. 

           Next to the beechwood wardrobe, Maisie dresses hastily in a 
           child’s SWIMSUIT befitting of the current year: 

           Her voice is seeped in a Mississippi southern accent--

                                 MAISIE
                             (loud whisper)
                        Ya comin’?

           Rebecca GROANS. Rolls over, turning her back. 

           Maisie’s not surprised by this response. 

           She scampers out the door, no attempt to soften the volume of 
           her thudding heels. 

           INT. ZEKE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie nudges a lump in the sheets on a twin bed. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (hissing)
                        Zeke! 

           The lump does not react. 

           Maisie monkeys onto the bed and jabs the lump again. 
                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        C’mon! 

           EZEKIEL “ZEKE” RAY (17, Black) barely pokes his brooding head 
           out from beneath his cover. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (Southern accent)
                        Too early...

           He burrows back under his sheets. 

           Maisie jostles him--

                                 MAISIE
                        Zeke! Ya promised! 

           Zeke doesn’t budge. 

           Maisie screws her face up in an indignant SCOWL. 

           She sucks on her pointer finger, then STICKS it into Zeke’s 
           exposed ear-- WET WILLY.

           Zeke scrubs his ear with disgust. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Agh! 

           But Maisie’s already scrambling out the door. 

           INT. RAY KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The dim blue light barely illuminates these rustic living 
           quarters: furniture and appliances stuck a decade earlier in 
           the 1950s. 

           As if the whole house is slumbering, save for: 

           Maisie rummaging through a wooden chest by the back door. She 
           yanks a heavy FLASHLIGHT free and darts outside.

           EXT. RAY HOME BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The flashlight’s beam dances across the crabgrass. 

           Maisie’s shallow PANTING comes in bursts. Her bare feet fall 
           sloppily onto the ground as she hustles down a dirt path to--
           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie’s pudgy feet plod through sludgy sand. 

           Her ramshackle house looms behind her. And before her: 

           The vast ocean. 

           It’s just before the sun crests the earth, the sky kissed 
           pink near the horizon. Incoming waves GRUMBLE as they beat 
           the sand. 

           Maisie’s eyes search the ground below her. Her flashlight’s 
           beam mimics the sweeping motion of her pupils. 

           A-ha! 

           Maisie halts, squatting in place. 

           Her hand reaches toward an iridescent BLOB on the beach, the 
           size of a dinner plate.  Gelatinous. Slimy.  

           She plucks it from the sand and rises back to her feet. 

           Dangling between her palms: it’s a MOON JELLYFISH. 

           The flashlight tucked in her armpit, Maisie waddles her way 
           to the water. She STOMPS the waves before reaching waist 
           level and dropping under the surface. 

           The jelly’s tentacles drag behind her, no threat posed. She 
           swims nimbly through the surf until she’s so deep she can 
           barely stand on her tip-toes. 

           And then she rears her arm back, jellyfish in her fist, and 
           CHUCKS it as far as she can. 

           She studies the jellyfish as it falls through the sky and 
           lands with a PLOP into the ocean’s abyss. 

           Maisie SMILES. 

           Triumph. 

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie struggles back out of the water, every movement she 
           makes like she’s racing against the clock. 

           Her flashlight’s beam flicks down the oceanfront to reveal: 

           The entire beach is COVERED in endless MOON JELLYFISH. 
           Washed up and helpless. 

           Maisie takes off running, skittering to a stop at a clump of 
           jellies. 

           She gingerly scoops up another. Pets its bell sweetly. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Don’t worry, I got ya. 

           And then zips back to the ocean. 

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Tentacles spinning in the current behind her as Maisie flails 
           out to the deep. 

           She pauses again, her chin level with the surface. 

           Her arm drops behind her head, a catapult gearing up--

           And she thrusts the jellyfish with a GRUNT, throwing it as 
           far as she can. 

           Her eyes trail its trajectory. Register the SPLASH when it 
           returns to the sea. 

           A determined GRIN. 

           Movement catches her attention-- she turns to find a 
           begrudging Zeke slogging through the waves toward her. 

           Her expressions drops to a pout. 

           Zeke lands next to her; he SIGHS before unceremoniously 
           CHUCKING a jellyfish through the air and out into the ocean. 

           Zeke peers down at her. Sneers:

                                 ZEKE
                        Happy? 

           Maisie narrows her eyes at him in response. 

           Zeke scoffs. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        They just gonna wash up again 
                        tomorrow, ain’t gonna make a 
                        diff’rence. 

           Maisie points out to where Zeke just tossed his jellyfish--
                                 MAISIE
                        Made a diff’rence ta that one! 

           Zeke snorts, playfully SLAPS some water in Maisie’s 
           direction. 

           She GASPS, spits the water out of her mouth, before SHOVING 
           as much ocean as her small arms can muster at Zeke. 

           A water fight ensues, the two breaking into LAUGHTER as they 
           grow drenched. 

           But they both pause, perk up, when--

           A SHRILL WHISTLING fills their ears.

           Maisie’s small head bobs in the waves as she listens...

           She cranes her neck to follow the direction of the screech. 
           Sounds like it’s coming from above-- over the ocean--

           Her sights catch on a bright orange dot, like a star, moving 
           through the sky toward the earth. 

           And it’s GROWING. 

           Morphing from a star into a discernible hunk of metal. 

           Like a satellite. 

           Maisie and Zeke’s mouths gap in awe, lids widen in fear. 

           They scramble backward, Maisie’s legs flinging themselves to 
           find solid ground in the water. Zeke scoops his hands beneath 
           her armpits to help her stand. 

           Frightened PANTING. 

           HOLLOW ROAR grows in intensity as the object PLUMMETS from 
           the atmosphere. A ripped parachute flaps angrily behind it, 
           offering little help to slow the fall. 

           It SCREAMS as it grows closer and closer--

           Maisie’s feet connect with the sand just as the hunk of metal 
           CRASHES into the ocean with a BOOM. 

           A GEYSER of water shoots up around its landing spot. 

           Zeke ushers Maisie forward as he pauses in the surf--

                                 ZEKE
                        Go!
           Maisie races onto the beach, her flashlight’s beam jostling 
           wildly about. 

           And as she runs back onto the crabgrass, the waves from the 
           impact of the object THUNDER onto the sand. 

           But Maisie just keeps running. 

           Full speed. No looking back. 

                                 TITLES: JELLYFISH SUMMER

           INT. MAMA DELILAH’S ROOM - LATER

           The door to this modest bedroom SLAMS open as Maisie tumbles 
           through it--

                                 MAISIE
                        MAMA! 

           Maisie collides with the bed of a groggy MAMA DELILAH RAY 
           (40, Black), KNOCKING her awake.  

           Mama Delilah sleepily scrubs a bony hand over her angular 
           features.

           Maisie can barely catch her breath:

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Mama! There’s another one! 

           At first Mama Delilah maintains her sure calm. But then she 
           register’s Maisie’s sentence and JOLTS to life. 

           Shaking, Mama Delilah removes herself from the bed. 

           Without stopping--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (southern accent)
                        Get ya brother ‘n sister. 

           EXT. RAY DOCK - LATER

           The sun is now hugging the skyline, stabbing the world with 
           golden light. 

           Collective heavy BREATHING, STAMPEDE of feet, as: 
           Mama Delilah leads her pack of KIDS down the length of a 
           sturdy wooden dock. 

           Mama Delilah’s jaw is tense, her pace unwavering. 

           Maisie follows close behind Mama Delilah, her short legs 
           doing double-time to keep up. 

           Behind Maisie: Zeke TROMPS the dock’s planks, his stocky 
           shoulders tense and prominent brow furrowed. 

           And lastly, Rebecca, still in her nightgown and braids, trips 
           after them. 

           The crew reaches the end of the dock where a rickety 
           SHRIMPING BOAT is moored. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        C’mon, hurry--

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie’s buoyant hair WHIPS frenzied around her face as the 
           ship GROANS through the choppy water. 

           She leans forward over the tip of the boat, JABBING her arm 
           out with a pointer finger extended. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (yelling over motor)
                        There! 

           Mama Delilah’s expression grim as she mans the steering 
           wheel. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Maisie, get back here, I don’t want 
                        ya lookin’ just yet. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (protest)
                        Mama--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        I said get back here! 

           Zeke and Maisie pass each other as Maisie grumpily recedes to 
           the back of the boat. She lands next to Rebecca. 

           Rebecca circles her arms around Maisie, a mix of protective 
           and bossy. 

           Zeke hovers over the side, peering out, readying himself for--
           THE HUNK OF METAL. 

           Maisie perks to catch a good glimpse of it: an oversized 
           metal capsule, a thick titanium door on the side swung wide 
           open. Water RUSHING IN. 

           Mama Delilah cuts the engine. The waves LAP at the side of 
           the boat as it drifts closer...

           Zeke squinting out at the crash site: 

                                 ZEKE
                             (anxious)
                        Mama...

           Maisie eyes Zeke nervously, his body shrinking from what he 
           sees.

           He points-- Mama Delilah looking--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (under breath)
                        Lord...

           Maisie listens as a new sound wafts to her ears.

           Unmistakable: HUMAN YELLING.  

           Rebecca leans in to Maisie with a gasp: 

                                 REBECCA
                        They alive!

           Everyone STUNNED by this revelation. 

           Then jumping to action:

                           ZEKE
                                                      MAMA DELILAH
           What d’we--?
                                              String the net--

           Maisie wrestles free from Rebecca. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Maisie! 

           As Zeke and Mama Delilah heft a bulky shrimping net to the 
           edge of the boat, Maisie hits the sideboard with the full 
           force of her body. 

           Rebecca catches up to her to see--

           Three PEOPLE bobbing amidst the wreckage in the water. 
           All the clothed in ragged white linens that look like a cross 
           between a UNIFORM and HOSPITAL CLOTHING. Their dark hair 
           spilling out to their shoulders, their skin luminously pale. 

           A TEEN BOY (16, White), BELLOWING in a language we don’t 
           know. A deep gash in his thigh drools blood into the ocean.  

           A DEAD MAN (40s, White), floating face-down in the water. 

           And a SKINNY BOY (9, White), SOBBING and clutching on to the 
           dead man’s upper chest. 

           Maisie and Rebecca are utterly horrified. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (voice shaking)
                        What we gonna do with live ones? 

           Rebecca shrugs. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Girls! Get back! 

           Rebecca and Maisie scoot out of the way as Mama Delilah and 
           Zeke TOSS the net into the ocean. 

           It swings out, catching on the ropes connecting it to a 
           hanging pulley system. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                             (calling)
                        HEY! 

           Mama Delilah wags her arms in the air, catching the Teen 
           Boy’s attention. 

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           The Teen Boy screams at the Skinny Boy, waving his hand over 
           at the shrimping boat. 

                                 TEEN BOY
                        Milagch!

           Language sounds throaty like Arabic, yet phlemgy like French. 

           Skinny Boy is inconsolable. 

           Teen Boy begins a pain-staking swim toward the net. 

                                 TEEN BOY (CONT’D)
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Milagch!
           Skinny Boy begrudgingly attempts to swim toward the boat 
           while dragging the Dead Man with him. 

                                 SKINNY BOY
                             (sobbing)
                        Aukana weni!

           Teen Boy reaches back to help the Skinny Boy pull the body 
           along. 

           They float the body until it’s ensnared in the net. 

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           In the boat, Mama Delilah and Zeke’s hands are now sheathed 
           in cracked work gloves. They yank the net up by the pulley 
           system, Teen Boy and Skinny Boy clinging onto the ropes. 

           Mama Delilah barks orders: 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        The one’s dead! Get ‘em to the 
                        back! 

           Rebecca rushes up to Mama Delilah’s side. Maisie tags along--

           With one last HEAVE Mama Delilah and Zeke drop the net into 
           the boat with a THUD! 

           Teen Boy COLLAPSES on the deck, his gushing leg giving way 
           underneath him. He SHOUTS in pain. 

           Skinny Boy continues BAWLING, shoving the net aside and 
           draping himself over the dead man. 

           Maisie stumbles backwards, overwhelmed by the commotion. 

           Mama Delilah immediately begins wrapping the Teen Boy’s leg 
           in a towel, crouched by his side. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Zeke, Rebecca, get the dead one to 
                        the back! 

           But Zeke and Rebecca are FROZEN, staring down at the Skinny 
           Boy’s quivering body curled on the dead man’s chest. 

           Teen Boy is screaming at the Skinny Boy through pained gasps: 

                                                  MAMA DELILAH (CONT'D)
                                              Zeke! Move the dead one! 
                         TEEN BOY
           Bagh rahdu weni! Bagh rahdu 
           weni!
           But Mama Delilah’s three kids can’t do anything but stare 
           mortified at the Skinny Boy on the Dead Body. 

           And the Skinny Boy glares up at them with his tear-stained 
           cheeks, an open-mouthed SOB. 

           Directly at Maisie. 

           Maisie UNBLINKING. 

           INT. RAY KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - LATER

           THUD as Teen Boy lands on the kitchen table, his face pallid. 
           Zeke and Mama Delilah release their hold on him and retreat 
           from his writhing body. 

           Skinny Boy continues to sniffle, glued to Teen Boy’s side.

           Maisie, still in her swimsuit, observes from the edge of the 
           room. 

           Mama Delilah turns to an ashen Rebecca. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Call ya Aunt Sarah, tell her ta get 
                        over right now-- tell her it’s a 
                        ‘mergency. 

           Rebecca slinks to the phone on the wall, wraps the coiled 
           cord around her left fist after dialing. 

           Mama Delilah’s forearms and dress are streaked with blood. 
           She turns assuredly to Zeke:

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Fetch me some sheets ‘n rip ‘em up 
                        like when Daddy got his arm caught 
                        in the rig. 

           Zeke opens his mouth to squabble--

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        No protests, just go. 

           Zeke grunts an angst-ridden SIGH before obeying. 

                                 REBECCA
                             (into phone, feeble)
                        Aunt Sarah? Mama needs ya ta come 
                        over right now... it’s a 
                        ‘mergency...
           Mama Delilah starts picking the linen pants away from Teen 
           Boy’s wound, wrinkles creasing her face in worry. 

           Teen Boy inhales sharply with pain. Mama Delilah shushes him 
           soothingly. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                             (to Mama Delilah)
                        Mama? Aunt Sarah says she got her 
                        curlers in.

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Well, Johnny Carson ain’t here!

                                 REBECCA
                             (into phone)
                        She says Johnny Carson ain’t here--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Jesus Rebecca--

           Mama Delilah swipes the phone from Rebecca. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Sarah, get over here right now! 

           And SLAMS it back on the receiver. 

           Mama Delilah spins to Maisie--

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Go fetch a bucket-a water from the 
                        side tap. 

           Maisie wide-eyed. A nod. 

           EXT. RAY HOME BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie trucks across the crabgrass, the morning light 
           squinting her eyes. 

           She glances down at her bare feet and notices that they are 
           lined with Teen Boy’s BLOOD. 

           She stumbles at the sight.

           EXT. RAY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A faucet poking from the side of the house GUSHES on, 
           Maisie’s little hand wrapped around the knob. 
           The water sounds hollow as it collects in a metal bucket. 

           Maisie dunks a hand into the piling water, scrubs her feet to 
           rid them of the blood. 

           INT. RAY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie struggles with the heavy bucket of water, splashing 
           some onto the floor.

           A newly arrived AUNT SARAH WELLNER (43, Black), a nervy woman 
           donning a nest of curlers and a housecoat, panics near the 
           door. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Oh Lord, oh Lord...

           Skinny Boy cowers at the edge of the table.

           Mama Delilah’s taking strips of sheets from Rebecca and 
           winding them tightly around Teen Boy’s leg. Her face set in 
           concentration. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (to Aunt Sarah)
                        C’mon, get over here, need a nurse 
                        ta tell if I’m doin’ it right. 

           Aunt Sarah gingerly approaches the Teen Boy. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                             (under breath)
                        We don’t got the proper safety 
                        precautions...

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        There ain’t a single case of one-a 
                        us catchin’ it--

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Hospital’s still tellin’ us not ta 
                        touch--

           Mama Delilah boils--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Then put on some damn gloves and 
                        help me! 

           Aunt Sarah SIGHS angrily before snagging a worn pair of 
           yellow rubber kitchen gloves from within the sink. 
           Mama Delilah moves out of the way as Aunt Sarah peers at Teen 
           Boy’s shredded thigh.

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Maisie, bring that water over here. 

           As Maisie does so, she makes eye contact with Skinny Boy. 

           And once Maisie drops the bucket at her mother’s feet, she 
           turns directly toward Skinny Boy to continue her inspection 
           of him. 

           His white linen outfit wrinkled and dirty. His shoulder-
           length dark hair still wet and salty from the ocean. Skin 
           pale and translucent. 

           And he studies her too: Her hand-me-down swimsuit. Her 
           untamed hair. Her dark skin. Her unassuming stance. 

           Face to face. 

           BAM as the front door opens-- Zeke marching through. 

           All eyes on him: 

                                 ZEKE
                        They comin’ down the drive! 

           This sends a new wave of panic through them. 

           Aunt Sarah and Mama Delilah lock eyes. Anxious muttering 
           between them.

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        They kids...

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        They still do the same to ‘em.

           Mama Delilah looks to the Boys, wringing her hands. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        We gotta hide ‘em. 

                        AUNT SARAH
                                                          ZEKE
           They catch you hidin’ ‘em--
                                              But-- Mama!

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        I know! 

           Mama Delilah reaches for the Teen Boy to help him sit up. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        But they kids. 
           A new resolve in Mama Delilah’s demeanor, her commanding 
           voice back at full force. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Rebecca, take this one ‘n hide in 
                        the washroom with ‘em. Lock the 
                        door. 

                                 REBECCA
                        But-- I can’t touch ‘em!

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        That’s all propaganda, now get! Ya 
                        want us in trouble?

           Rebecca WHINES, hesitantly steps forward. She wraps her hands 
           in her nightgown’s skirts to protect them before guiding the 
           Teen Boy off of the table. 

           They make their way laboriously up the steps. Skinny Boy 
           follows after them. 

           Mama Delilah continues giving orders as she yanks an apron 
           over her bloodied dress. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Zeke, Sarah, get the dead one from 
                        the boat and anchor him under the 
                        dock.

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        There’s a dead one!?

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Hurry!

           Zeke heads for the back door--

                                 ZEKE
                             (mutter)
                        Damn Fallen...

           Aunt Sarah GROANS before following Zeke. 

           Mama Delilah rounds the table to where Maisie stands. She 
           crouches down to Maisie.  

           Her voice stern: 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Take the little one ‘n hide like 
                        when Daddy’s real mad. Don’t let 
                        either of ya make a sound. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT'D)
                        Don’t come out no matter what. 
                        Understand? 

           Maisie nods. 

           The sound of a car CRUNCHING gravel on the front drive wafts 
           through the windows. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Good girl. 

           Mama Delilah turns to scrub blood off of the table.

           Maisie races up to the Skinny Boy, who’s following Rebecca 
           and the Teen Boy up the staircase. 

           She grabs the Skinny Boy by the hand and yanks him toward the 
           back door. 

                                 MAISIE
                        C’mon! 

           Skinny Boy pulls his hand free of her. 

                                 SKINNY BOY
                        Gahbi!

           The sound of TWO CAR DOORS SLAMMING OUTSIDE. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (hiss)
                        Maisie! 

           Maisie grabs his arm and tugs again. 

                                 MAISIE
                        C’mon!

           Skinny Boy reaches for Teen Boy--

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Bagh rahdu weni!

           Teen Boy shakes his head and nods at Maisie as he and Rebecca 
           reach the top of the stairs. 

                                 TEEN BOY
                        Shal rahm. 

           Skinny Boy slacks at his brother’s words. Allows himself to 
           be pulled by Maisie to the back door just as there are KNOCKS 
           on the front one. 
           EXT. RAY HOME BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie runs out the back door, Skinny Boy trailing behind. 
           Once at the bottom of the porch stairs she falls to her hands 
           and knees. 

           But Skinny Boy doesn’t follow suit. He begins YELLING 
           instead: 

                                 SKINNY BOY
                        Dak!

           He starts toward where Aunt Sarah and Zeke are floating the 
           dead body under the dock. Aunt Sarah still wearing the rubber 
           kitchen gloves. 

                          MAISIE
                                                   SKINNY BOY (CONT'D)
           Shhh! 
                                              Bagh ehdu poli!

           Maisie restrains him. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Shhh! Quiet! 

           She wrestles him to the ground. 

           Maisie drags Skinny underneath the house with her. 

           INT. UNDERNEATH RAY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           On their bellies, Maisie and Skinny peer out toward the ocean 
           where Aunt Sarah and Zeke finish anchoring the body 
           underneath the dock. 

           Skinny won’t stop chattering: 

                                                         MAISIE
                                              Shh! Shh! Quiet! 
                          SKINNY
           Muha! Wehka badah-- PEH! Bagh 
           ehdu poli!

           Maisie clamps her hand over Skinny’s mouth, but he tears at 
           her hand. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Shh! Look!

           She places her other hand over her own mouth. 

           Skinny slows his speech, watching her hand on her face, her 
           deep breathing. 

           Finally he’s quiet. Maisie’s fingers loosen over his lips. 
           At the same time, she removes her hands from both of their 
           mouths.

           And it’s QUIET under the dark house, save for the distant 
           waves falling against the shore. 

           Then FOOTSTEPS. 

           Maisie watches from beneath the house as her mother’s legs 
           guide two sets of uniformed legs through the backyard. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Yes sir, we saw it comin’ down out 
                        here, but nothin’ washin’ up to 
                        shore yet. ‘Cept the summer 
                        jellies. 

           The legs approach the house, getting closer and bigger. 

                                 OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
                        That’s quite a lot-a blood ya got 
                        on yer dress there, ma’am. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Please ‘scuse that, I just been 
                        cuttin’ up a chicken for us. 

           Skinny begins to whine. Maisie nudges into him and clamps her 
           hand on her mouth again. Her breath puffing from her 
           nostrils. 

           Skinny copies her, clutches his mouth with his hand. 

           Maisie nods at him. 

           The legs all pause by the porch, the feet inches from Maisie 
           and Skinny’s faces. Fingers stretched across their lips. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Been a bad jellyfish summer ‘round 
                        here. 

           A scratching SPARK sound as one officer lights up a 
           cigarette. 

                                 OFFICER 2 (O.S.)
                        Been a bad jellyfish summer all 
                        over, jellyfish been wreckin’ the 
                        beach all the way down in Mobile. 

                                 OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
                        Light?
                                 OFFICER 2 (O.S.)
                        Sure. 

           THUMP. A shiny LIGHTER falls to the grass in front of Maisie 
           and Skinny’s noses--

                                 OFFICER 1 (O.S.)
                        Damn-- 

           Maisie inches slowly backwards, pulling Skinny with her... 

           Officer 1 squats down to retrieve his lighter. 

           Maisie wide-eyed, STOCK-STILL, as the white Officer peers 
           into the darkness under the house...

           Both Maisie and Skinny keep their small fingers clamped over 
           their faces. 

           The Officer narrowing his eyes... his jaw slacks... 

           Maisie and Skinny barely breathing... 

           Until the Officer rises again without a word. 

           A CLICK as the lighter is used again. 

           Mama Delilah SIGHS. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Well, jellies’ll be gone come 
                        September. 

           The legs move around the side of the house and out of view. 

           Maisie army-crawls across the dirt to the other side of the 
           house to keep the legs in her sights. She peers out at the 
           front driveway: 

           Mama Delilah chats with the two WHITE OFFICERS-- look like a 
           cross between cop and military-- beside their official-
           looking, 1965-model vehicle. 

           Maisie can’t hear their words. Her eyes trail them as the 
           officers return to their car, SLAM the doors. 

           Mama Delilah tosses them a polite little wave. 

           The car recedes down the front drive, crunching the gravel 
           and leaving a trail of dust. 

           Until they are out of sight. 
           The sound of Maisie’s BREATHS as she studies her mother: Mama 
           Delilah raking her fingers across her temple with palpable 
           stress. 

           Maisie’s ears perk: 

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                             (in the distance)
                        Maisie!

           Maisie crawls toward the back end of the house--

           EXT. RAY HOME BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie emerges from beneath the house, her whole front caked 
           in mud. 

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                        Maisie!

           And she takes off running toward--

           EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           The dock, where Zeke is waist deep in the rolling waves, 
           struggling with something in the water.  

           His voice is ripped with anger: 

                                 ZEKE
                        They coulda seen ‘em! You tryna get 
                        us killed!? 

           Zeke pries Skinny out from under the waves. Skinny HOLLERS 
           and kicks in Zeke’s grasp. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Bagh ehdu weni!

           Maisie stomps into the water to help--

                                 MAISIE
                        Stop! Ya hurtin’ him! 

           And she yanks on Zeke’s arms. 

                                 ZEKE
                        He gonna drown himself, moron! 

           Zeke releases Skinny, and Skinny immediately dives back under 
           the waves. 
                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        See? 

           Maisie doesn’t respond, just ducks under the surface too--

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie squints in the water-- can barely make out Skinny 
           kicking himself down. His baggy linen clothing and long hair 
           billows around him. 

           His arms reaching for: 

           The Dead Body. Wrapped in rope and weighted by an anchor. 

           Maisie taps Skinny with her hand. He swivels to see her, and 
           she motions toward the surface. 

           She rises in the water. He follows. 

           EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie emerges from the water gasping. Skinny bursts up a 
           foot away. 

           Maisie turns expecting to see Zeke where he was--

           No Zeke. 

           He’s now perched on the edge of the dock. Mama Delilah and 
           Aunt Sarah hover above him anxiously, exchanging tense 
           MURMURS. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (calling)
                        He just wants the dead one.

           Zeke doesn’t pay her any attention, his focus on Mama Delilah 
           and Aunt Sarah.

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! 

           She swims over to Zeke and tugs his hairy leg. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        He just wants the dead one-- 

                                 ZEKE
                        I heard ya!
           Mama Delilah and Aunt Sarah gaze down at them with strained 
           frowns. 

           Maisie turns back to Skinny. But: 

           He’s disappeared. 

           Maisie swivels her head around-- DUNKS under the water--

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Skinny is down by the dead body, his little hands grasped 
           TIGHT around a few chunks of the dead body’s HAIR. 

           He PULLS and PULLS-- the hair tethered tightly to its scalp.

           Maisie observes, unsure of how to respond. 

           Skinny relinquishes and floats to the surface again. Maisie 
           copies him. 

           EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie and Skinny pop out of the water simultaneously. 

           Skinny clearly exasperated. He looks Maisie straight in the 
           eyes and pulls on his own hair. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Weh ackdul swol! Swol!

           He displays his hair again to demonstrate. 

           Understanding dawns on Maisie’s face. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Hair? 

           Maisie yanks at a piece of her own hair. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        You talkin’ ‘bout hair? 

           Skinny nods rigorously and imitates sawing his hair off.

           Then he DIPS back under the waves. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie only watches for a moment as Skinny continues to tug 
           on the dead body’s hair...
           EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie swims over to where Zeke dangles off of the dock and 
           taps his leg repeatedly. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Zeke, Zeke--

           Zeke continues his listening in on Mama Delilah and Aunt 
           Sarah’s discussion. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (hushed)
                        Shh! 

                                 MAISIE
                        Can I have ya knife?

           Zeke proceeds ignoring her. 

           She FLICKS his foot--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Gimme ya knife! I need it! 

           Zeke pulls a SWISS ARMY KNIFE out of his pocket and hands it 
           to her without taking his eyes off Mama Delilah--

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie kicks her way down to Skinny, the waves swaying them 
           back and forth. 

           She gently moves him aside, grasps some of the Dead Body’s 
           hair in her hand. She grimaces at touching the corpse.  

           Skinny eyes her intently. 

           Maisie carefully cuts the hair with the Swiss Army Knife. 
           Strand by strand, the hunk detaches. 

           The second it breaks free from the Dead Body’s head, Maisie 
           allows herself to float back to the surface. 

           EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie and Skinny emerge from the ocean. 

           The whites of their eyes red from salt water irritation. 

           Maisie offers him the hunk of hair. He clasps his hand around 
           it, plucks it from her palm. 
           And cups it protectively to his chest. 

           They bob wordlessly in the surf. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        Where they come from? 

           INT. MAISIE AND REBECCA’S BEDROOM - LATER 

           Maisie sticks close by Rebecca, who leans against the far 
           wall pensively. She answers Maisie’s question: 

                                 REBECCA
                        We don’t know. They just keep 
                        fallin’ from the sky. 

           Teen Boy is stretched across Rebecca and Maisie’s bed, his 
           wounded leg tightly wound with the ripped up sheets. His face 
           glossed with sweat. 

           Skinny approaches the bed. Extends his hand to reveal the 
           tangle of hair from the dead body. 

           Teen Boy’s eyes connect with the hair, his expression frozen. 

                                 TEEN BOY
                             (voice cracking)
                        Badah?

           Skinny nods. 

           And Teen Boy’s face collapses in tears. His whole chest 
           wracked with SOBS. 

           Skinny pulls himself up on the bed and curls into Teen Boy’s 
           shoulder. 

           They cup their hands around the bundle of hair and bow their 
           heads, weeping. 

           Maisie’s eyes threaten tears as she observes the moment. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (whispered)
                        Was that their Daddy? 

           Rebecca’s gaze grim. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Think so. 
           INT. RAY HOME - LATER 

           Mama Delilah and Aunt Sarah SMOKE around the kitchen table. 
           Zeke towers over them amongst the plumes of exhaled fumes 
           with tense shoulders. 

           Maisie and Rebecca watch from the sidelines. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya heard what Fallen did ta folks 
                        down in New Orleans just last week-- 
                        whole lot of ‘em hit a 
                        neighborhood, house by house, 
                        slittin’ throats, killin’ people, 
                        even kids, just for food-- 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                             (mutter)
                        Beasts do anythin’ they get hungry 
                        ‘nough--

           Mama Delilah glances furtively at Maisie, exhaling smoke 
           tersely. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        SHH-- quit it-- these ones just 
                        kids, they ain’t dangerous. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (ignoring her)
                        We shoulda just let officers take 
                        ‘em--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ya seen those camps, that ain’t no 
                        place for children! 

                                 ZEKE
                        Well this house ain’t no place for 
                        Fallen!

           Mama Delilah expels a forced laugh. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ha, callin’ the shots now, is ya? 
                        Got ya big man pants on?

           Zeke SCOWLS. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Daddy’d side with me. 

           Mama Delilah’s tone is deadly. 
                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ya see ya Daddy in this house?

           Zeke doesn’t reply, but doesn’t cast his eyes away from her. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Now I know I didn’t raise ya this 
                        way. I know ya scared, but that 
                        ain’t gonna keep us from doin’ 
                        what’s right. 

           Rebecca pipes up--

                                 REBECCA
                        Mama, what if we get sick from ‘em, 
                        what if they catch us with ‘em--?

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        We ain’t keepin’ ‘em here, baby, 
                        Zeke and I gonna take ‘em up to 
                        Dorothy up in Biloxi first thing 
                        tomorrow, she’ll take ‘em from 
                        there. Ya ‘member Dorothy?

                                 ZEKE
                        But I’m goin’ up ta Mobile day 
                        after tomorrow ‘fore the vote! I 
                        told ya, I need the truck then! 

           Mama Delilah stubs her cigarette out in a cheap ashtray. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        We’ll both go ta Mobile after we 
                        drop ‘em with Dorothy. 

           Zeke sputters to reject this plan. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Bu--but--

           Aunt Sarah dabs her cigarette out as well. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Well ya can keep me the hell outta 
                        it. 

           Her chair SCRAPES as she stands. 

                                 AUNT SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Ya ask me you’re outta ya brain. 
                        They’ll be comin’ back ‘round for 
                        the wreckage, Delilah, and if they 
                        catch ya-- 
                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        I thought ya wanted ta keep the 
                        hell outta it!

           Aunt Sarah dons an indignant snarl. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Well you’re goddamn welcome for 
                        riskin’ my skin for y’all! High and 
                        mighty like ya know what’s divine-- 
                        you’re a piece-a work! 

           Aunt Sarah storms out, screen door THWACKING shut behind her. 

           Zeke spins and stalks toward the back door. 

                                 ZEKE
                        She’s right ‘bout them comin’ back. 
                        I’m dumpin’ that dead one farther 
                        out! 

           Mama Delilah SIGHS, shaking a fresh cigarette from her pack. 

           Maisie glances to Rebecca before confronting her Mama. 

                                 MAISIE
                        What we gonna do with ‘em, Mama?

           Mama Delilah pauses, studies Maisie’s worried expression. 
           Mama selects her words carefully. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ya learnt ‘bout the underground 
                        railroad in school?

           Maisie shakes her head yes. Mama Delilah returns a curt nod. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Like that. 

           And Mama STRIKES up a match to light her cigarette.  

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

           The bath’s rusted faucet SPEWS water into the tub’s basin. 

           Maisie and Skinny, both still caked in mud and sand from 
           their hiding spot under the house, sit on the floor, waiting 
           for the tub to fill. 

           Skinny’s clothes are stained with blood from his brother and 
           the dead body. Patches of dried blood hide behind his ears, 
           in the crevasse of his collar bone. 
           Maisie stares at her own dirty feet. Taps her big toes 
           together. 

           And Skinny SCREAMS! 

           Maisie jumps, swings her attention to him. He’s pointing at--

           The orange kitten. 

           It’s crouched behind the bathtub, its whiskers peeking out 
           from behind the metal edge. 

           Terrified by Skinny’s screech, the kitten rears its back up. 
           Emits a tiny HISS. 

           Skinny scoots back into Maisie, attempting to distance 
           himself from the kitten. Acting as if it’s a ghost.  

           Maisie bursts into GIGGLES.

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama!

           Skinny whimpers. 

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Peh! Bagh ehdu dali!  

                                 MAISIE
                             (giggling)
                        Stop screamin’-- Mama! 

           Skinny’s acting something out to communicate: pointing at the 
           kitten, pointing at himself, acting sick--

           Maisie thinks she understands. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (through her laughter)
                        Ya can’t get sick from a cat, silly-
                        -

           Mama Delilah slips into the room. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        What’s goin’ on? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Lookit-- he’s scared-a the cat!

           Maisie’s giggles can’t be contained. The startled kitten 
           looks adorable. 
           But Skinny’s eyes are wild as he cowers from the kitten. 
           Looks up at Mama Delilah and screeches terrified:  

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Raugh! 

           Mama Delilah takes in the situation and turns on Maisie. She 
           GRIPS Maisie’s arm--

                                 MAISIE
                             (pain)
                        Ah! 

           Maisie ceases her laughter.

           Mama Delilah crouches, pulls Maisie close to her. Maisie 
           WHINES. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ya don’t laugh at people when they 
                        scared. 

                          MAISIE
                                                  MAMA DELILAH (CONT'D)
           Ya hurtin’ me--
                                              Ya listenin’ to me? 

           Angry tears prick Maisie’s eyes.

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Now this boy prob’ly never seen a 
                        cat ‘fore-- he ain’t never seen any-
                        a this ‘fore. Ya think ‘bout if you 
                        never seen a cat ‘fore, and ya 
                        think ‘bout if someone was laughin’ 
                        at you. 

                                                  MAMA DELILAH (CONT'D)
                                                (raising voice)
                          MAISIE
           But Mama he ain’t been scared 
           of nothin’ else, seems he 
           seen some-a it ‘fore--!
                                              You think ‘bout when you and 
                                              ya brotha -- quiet Maisie!-- 
                                              when you and ya brotha saw 
                                              that dead Jackson boy hangin’ 
                                              in town and those white kids 
                                              was laughin’ at you! 

           Maisie clams up. 

           Mama Delilah lets that sink in. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Now, I don’t wanna see ya laughin’ 
                        at this boy no more. 

           Maisie nods begrudgingly. 
                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        When other people’s scared, ya help 
                        ‘em.

           And Mama Delilah releases Maisie’s arm, stands. She scoops up 
           the kitten by the bathtub. 

           Mama Delilah crouches by whimpering Skinny, demonstrating 
           petting the kitten. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        See? 

           She strokes the kitten’s back. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t nothin’ ta be ‘fraid of. 
                        C’mon. 

           Mama Delilah gingerly guides Skinny’s hand across the 
           kitten’s back. 

           Skinny’s fear subsides with each stroke of the kitten’s back. 
           His bulbous pale eyes fixed on Mama Delilah’s reassuring 
           serenity. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. 

           Maisie watches on with furrowed brow. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. 

           INT. RAY HOME - DAY 

           Maisie descends the stairs, clean from mud but still in her 
           swimsuit. Skinny, now in a pair of Maisie’s old clothes, 
           glances up at her from his post by his brother. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Do as I tell ya! 

           Teen Boy is laid out on the family’s lumpy couch. His leg 
           elevated and bandaged, a nose bleed oozing down his lip, a 
           bucket of vomit waiting under his chin for more. 

           Skinny’s eyes well as he watches his brother retch again. 

                                 ZEKE 
                        I ain’t riskin’ my hide no more for 
                        ‘em!
           Zeke SLAMS the front door as he stalks outside. Mama Delilah 
           yells after him through the screen door--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Get ya butt back here! 

           SOUNDS of the truck stirring up outside and squealing down 
           the gravel driveway. 

           Mama Delilah SIGHS flustered, turns to Rebecca behind her. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        He took the damn truck! 

           But Rebecca’s disgusted gaze is on vomiting Teen Boy. She 
           pokes a finger in his direction. 

                                 REBECCA
                        That older one’s tossin’ up again. 

           Mama Delilah’s face falls. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        He ain’t gonna make the underground 
                        railroad like that. 

           Mama Delilah turns to a small pad of paper by the phone and 
           begins scribbling on it with a stubby pencil. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna need ya ta get ‘em some 
                        medicine in town so he’ll be able 
                        ta leave tomorrow. 

           Rebecca shakes her head repeatedly. 

                                 REBECCA
                        I ain’t goin’ inta town by myself! 
                        Make Zeke do it! 

           Mama Delilah can’t contain her exasperation.  

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Rebecca, baby, ya see Zeke here? 

                                 REBECCA
                        Does our medicine even work on 
                        Fallen?

           Mama rips the paper away from its pad and shakes it at 
           Rebecca. 
                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        We gotta make due with what we got, 
                        now c’mon. Get. 

           Rebecca musters up what little courage she has. 

                                 REBECCA
                        I told ya, I ain’t doin’ it! 

           Maisie inches up to Mama.

                                 MAISIE
                        I can go! 

           Mama glances down at Maisie, the paper limp in Mama’s hand. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Please? I ain’t been ta town since 
                        Fallen started comin’ last month. 
                        Not even for church! 

           Mama Delilah raises her eyebrows before pivoting the paper 
           down to Maisie. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Ya think ya old ‘nough ta go ta 
                        town by ya’self? 

           Maisie nods rigorously, a grin blooming on her face. Mama 
           chuckles at Maisie’s excitement. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        I think so too. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Mama! She’s too little! 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (to Maisie)
                        Hand the man at the store this 
                        paper, okay? Ya know where ta go?

           Maisie snatches the paper out of Mama’s spindly fingers. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah! 

                          REBECCA
           Mama!
                                                      MAMA DELILAH
                                              Good girl, now ya listen to 
                                              me--

           Mama Delilah leans close to Maisie whilst giving instruction.
                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t talk ta no one. ‘N if they 
                        ask, ya gettin’ medicine for ya 
                        sick mama. Clear?

           Maisie’s nodding, giddy with the prospect of escape. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t dillydally. 

           And she entrusts Maisie with two crumpled dollar bills.

           EXT. RAY HOME - DAY

           Maisie’s bare feet mount her bike’s pedals and poise to ride. 

           The slip of paper crushed between her hand and the bike’s 
           metal handle. 

                                 SKINNY (O.S.)
                        Peh!

           Maisie pauses, her eyes tracking Skinny as he runs toward her 
           from the house. 

                                 SKINNY (CONT’D)
                        Aukana weni! 

                                 MAISIE
                        You stay here! 

           Maisie stomps down on the pedals, propelled forward. 

           Skinny continues to jog after her. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Peh, bagh rahdu weni!

           Maisie skids to a stop, and Skinny PANTS when he lands next 
           to her.  

           Maisie speaks slowly, gesturing clearly--

                                 MAISIE
                        You. Stay here. I. Go.  

           And she hops back up on her bicycle-- 

                                 SKINNY
                        Aukana!
           Maisie hustles away from him as fast as she can. She peeks 
           behind her, a forlorn Skinny stumbling a few feet after her 
           before stuttering to a stop. 

           He’s slowly obscured by the dust kicked up by her bicycle--

                                 MAISIE
                        Don’t worry! I’m comin’ back!

           And she sets her sights firmly ahead. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 

           Maisie’s bare feet pedal the rusted red bicycle down the 
           dusty road. The tires crunch the gravel beneath. 

           Mississippi tall grasses and dangling trees line the sides. 

           Maisie’s still in her swimsuit, panting with slick skin from 
           the heat. She’s squinting in the noonday sun. 

           Cicadas WHINING. 

           Up ahead, a tall chain link fence appears on the horizon. 

           As Maisie pedals closer, she can see coils of barbed wire 
           wrapped across the top of the gigantic enclosure.  

           Her bike coasts to a stop by the fence. 

           She hops off and walks her bike along the length of the 
           barricade. Her bare feet careful to tread the soft grass, not 
           the gravel. 

           She cranes her neck up, eyes squinting, the fence immensely 
           tall, especially in comparison to her tiny stature. 

           She glances down the way curiously to see two FIGURES behind 
           the fence approaching. 

           Maisie slows her walk... 

           As they come closer, Maisie notices they are WHITE. They have 
           LONG dark hair. They are in matching outfits, white billowing 
           linen pants and shirts, just like Skinny and his family wear. 

           Fallen people. 

           And as they approach even closer, Maisie’s face slips into 
           fear... 

           The two figures begin to resemble ghosts or zombies: 
           They are GAUNT. Their limbs SKELETAL. Their lips cracked with 
           dehydration. Their skin red and scaly from sunburn.  

           ONE has excrement streaked down the inner seam of his pants. 

           The OTHER has blood stained down the front of her shirt. 

           Both open-mouthed and MOANING. 

           CRYING. 

           Maisie involuntarily stutters backward as they near her, 
           their pace now a jog. 

           They collapse at the foot of the fence in front of her, their 
           dirtied, long fingernails tearing at the metal links. 

                       MALE FALLEN 
                                                      FEMALE FALLEN
                 (sobbing)
           Raugh! Raugh weni! Muha! 
                                                (moaning, pointing to 
                                                her chest)
                                              Weh reilagh... weh reilagh...

           Maisie is TERRIFIED, tears boiling to her lids. 

           And she GASPS when she realizes MORE OF THE FALLEN PRISONERS, 
           all in the same Fallen clothes, all thin and broken with long 
           hair, are collecting along the edge of the fence. 

           They form a CHORUS of MOANS and SOBS. 

           Some clutching the fence. Some holding other weak ones up. 
           ONE actively bleeding from the nose. 

           ONE reaches his arm out toward her from the fence. 

           Maisie HYPERVENTILATING. Her eyes BUGGING wide. 

           She TREMBLES as she mounts her bicycle again. 

           Pushes off of the gravel, swerving a bit in her haste to 
           pedal out of there. 

           Her bicycle spokes CLICKING as she pedals faster and faster 
           down the length of the chain link fence. 

           More and more of the FALLEN PRISONERS at the edge, YELLING 
           out at her. 

           And she reaches a HUGE GATE, where several SOLDIERS, in the 
           same uniforms as the officers who visited her house, stand 
           guard. 

           They clutch large GUNS. They wear scary GAS MASKS. 
           The RABBLE of a crowd reaches her ears, and she spies a MASS 
           of PROTESTERS gathered around the main gate. 

           Some hoisting signs and chanting in favor of releasing the 
           Fallen people. Others demanding to keep them locked away. 
           Black and White people on both sides of the argument. 

           TWO PROTESTORS pounce into a fist fight as Maisie passes. 

           Maisie pedals furiously, her petrified gasps releasing tears 
           down her face. 

           Faster and faster until she reaches the end of the enclosure 
           and breaks free to the open grassland again. 

           But she doesn’t slow down. 

           She keeps pedaling with all of her might. 

           And a SCREAM wells up within her and BURSTS from her lungs. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Maisie bikes slowly down the main street of this small 
           southern town. 

           She’s still sniffling, leaking tears.  

           She coasts past the small businesses, a few WHITE PEOPLE 
           seated outside fanning themselves. 

           A sign hanging above a storefront reads: WHITES ONLY, NO 
           COLORED. And tacked haphazardly onto the end: NO FALLEN.  

           A WHITE TEENAGE BOY stands beneath the sign licking a 
           Popsicle, curiously watches Maisie pass by. 

           Maisie looking back at him, her chin trembling, her cheeks 
           tear-stained. 

           And she wheels up to a COLORED ONLY GENERAL STORE. 

           EXT. COLORED GENERAL STORE - CONTINUOUS

           A potbellied and slouching young boy, EARL (10, Black) leans 
           against the store’s front porch. 

           He recognizes Maisie as she dismounts her bike in front of 
           him. His face cracks into a grin when he spies her sniveling. 

                                 EARL
                        Ha! Maisie’s a cry baby! 
           Maisie SHOVES him as she passes. 

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           Maisie’s voice raw from crying--

                                 MAISIE
                        Watch my bike! 

           Earl rubs his shoulder where she hit him as she enters the 
           aged general store. 

                                 EARL
                        I’m tellin’ ya mama ya hit me!

           INT. COLORED GENERAL STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie enters the cluttered general store, passing beneath a 
           “COLORED ONLY, NO FALLEN” sign at the front. 

           A soda fountain HUMS. A jukebox plays a Motown record. A 
           glass counter BOASTS remedies, hygiene products, and 
           cosmetics. 

           Maisie sniffles as she approaches the tall counter, her feet 
           still bare and swimsuit mussed from her frantic ride. 

           A weathered SHOPKEEPER (60, Black) greets her at the counter. 
           His voice deep, dark hair peppered with white streaks. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Why ya cryin’, girl? 

           Maisie isn’t sure how to respond... 

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, what’s troublin’ ya? 

           Maisie hiccups, attempts to find her voice amidst sniffles. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I been by the place for the Fallen, 
                        ‘n they-- they was--

           She pauses to shudder. 

           Shopkeeper CHUCKLES good-naturedly. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Oh, now, they sure look scary, huh? 

           Maisie nods pitifully. 
                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Well, don’t ya worry ya-self ‘bout 
                        them. We keepin’ ‘em locked up so 
                        they can’t hurt ya. 

           Maisie’s wet eyes look up at him confused. 

                                 MAISIE
                        But they don’t wanna hurt me. 

           Shopkeeper’s expression darkens... Maisie lowers her eyes, 
           realizing she’s made a mistake... 

           She offers up her slip of paper from Mama. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Here. 

           Shopkeeper receives the paper, growing even more suspicious 
           after he reads the writing it contains. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        What you need this for, child? 

                                 MAISIE
                        My sick Mama, sir. 

           Shopkeeper narrows his eyes down at her. His face barely 
           moving as he speaks: 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        How ya Mama get sick? 

           Maisie shrugs at him, her eyes stuck on her bare toes. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Ya mama been by one-a the Fallen? 

                                 MAISIE
                        No, sir. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Ya been-- ya touch one-a of the 
                        Fallen? 

                                 MAISIE
                        No, sir. 

           Shopkeeper remains skeptical, calculating her reaction. 

           Maisie shakes her head again for good measure. 
                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        No, sir. 

           Shopkeeper turns reluctantly and fishes a small glass bottle 
           out of a cabinet behind him. 

           He bequeaths it to Maisie, and she exchanges the two dollar 
           bills with him. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Ya got a quarter in change, ya want 
                        anythin’ else? 

           Maisie’s eyes catch on the brightly colored candies showcased 
           in the glass counter before her. 

           She taps the glass. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yellow one. 

           Shopkeeper plucks a yellow taffy out of the basket and passes 
           it to her. But as their hands connect, they freeze--

           For a SHRILL WHISTLING catches their attention... 

           Both perk their ears and eyes above them-- the SCREECH 
           overhead getting louder and louder-- 

           MOVING OVERHEAD UNTIL IT’S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE SHOP DOOR--

           Maisie stampedes out of the shop--

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           CRASH! 

           A metal capsule, like the one that delivered Skinny and his 
           family, SMASHES into the street in front of the general 
           store, cratering the ground. 

           Its parachute flutters shakily to the soil.  

           Maisie and Earl steady themselves against the tremors from 
           the impact of the capsule. 

           Maisie watches nervously as a CROWD OF WHITE PEOPLE quickly 
           forms around the capsule. 

           They hold objects like brooms and bats. 

           They begin SHOUTING, BANGING on the sides of the capsule. 
           Maisie starts toward the crash site, but Earl SNAGS her arm. 

                                 EARL
                        Are ya nuts!? 

           Earl’s eyes are frantic. He lifts his leaning bike away from 
           the wall. 

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        We gotta get ‘fore folks start 
                        goin’ crazy on the Fallen inside. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Nah, we gotta help ‘em, Earl, they 
                        prob’ly hurt--

                                 EARL
                        You live out in the country, 
                        Maisie, things diff’rent here-- ya 
                        gotta stay far away ‘cause people 
                        get real angry when they fall in 
                        town. 

           Maisie tugs on his arm--

                                 MAISIE
                        We gotta get ‘em outta there ‘fore 
                        the soldiers come! Ya seen the 
                        place they put ‘em? 

                                 EARL
                        Ya can’t touch ‘em! You’ll get 
                        their sickness--

                                 MAISIE
                        Nuh-uh, ya wrong. Ya can’t get 
                        their sickness. 

                                 EARL
                        Ya don’t know what ya talkin’ 
                        ‘bout, stupid!

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah I do! We got Fallen at my 
                        house and ain’t none-a us got their 
                        sickness!

           THUNK--

           Maisie and a gap-mouthed Earl swing around to see DILLARD 
           (12, White) GLARING at them from where he dropped his 
           baseball mitt. 
                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Dillard snatches up his mitt and bolts toward the white crowd 
           gathering.  

           Earl reacts as if Maisie has the plague. 

                                 EARL
                             (hissing)
                        Ya shouldn’tve told me that! 

                                 MAISIE
                        Ya think he heard? 

           Earl doesn’t reply, scurries away on his bicycle. 

           Maisie’s breathing quickens, her fearful eyes land back on 
           Dillard. He tugs on the sleeve of a WHITE MAN (40s) on the 
           outskirts of the mob. 

           Dillard points at Maisie. 

           White Man turns to follow Dillard’s point-- 

           His gaze lands DIRECTLY on Maisie. 

           Maisie GASPS and scrambles onto her bike. She pedals away as 
           fast as her legs will pump. 

           Behind her, two injured FALLEN PEOPLE emerge from the capsule 
           to meet the YELLING angry mob. Blood snakes down parts of the 
           Fallen’s bodies, their balance swaying from the crash.  

           The mob won’t touch them, but prods them with the bases of 
           brooms, baseball bats, and the like. 

           The increased volume of the mob causes Maisie to look back 
           over her shoulder, only to see--

           A cluster of MEN in KKK HOODS approach the capsule beyond the 
           angry mob. 

           Maisie GASPS at the sight and speeds away on adrenaline. 

           EXT. FALLEN CAMP - COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

           SUN SCORCHES overhead. 

           Wheezing breaths. 

           Maisie is exhausted in the heat, her bike wobbling as she 
           pedals down the gravel road. 
           Sweat drools down her temple. Her mouth dry and eyelids at 
           half-mast. 

           Delirious. 

           The Fallen Camp LOOMS in front of her on the horizon... 

           Maisie takes a difficult swallow of air and pushes herself to 
           pick up the pace. 

           Fear drives her as she coasts past the PROTESTERS and gas-
           masked SOLDIERS. 

           And when she struggles down the line of fence, she can’t pry 
           her eyes away from the masses of terrifyingly ill FALLEN 
           PEOPLE that gather at the border. 

           They MOAN, their thin fingers REACHING for her--

           She’s sweating, panting, disoriented--

           Her bike slows as she catches her breath. 

           And her eyes halt on one Fallen person in particular. A young 
           BLACK BOY in the midst of the crowd. 

           He’s tear-stained. He’s trembling. He... looks exactly 
           like...

                                 MAISIE
                             (wavering voice)
                        Earl? 

           Maisie tilts her head to look closer--

           It looks exactly like Earl, but with longer hair, wearing 
           Fallen clothes. And looking very sick. 

           She narrows her eyes to look closer, confusion on her 
           features. She calls out again--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Earl! 

           She drops her bike and rushes up to the fence, stumbling over 
           her own feet. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        EARL?

           She’s dizzy with heat. The image of Earl wavers in her 
           eyesight, her squinting-- 
           Earl’s getting lost in the crowd-- sucked up in to the mass 
           of Fallen gathering, and then--

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                             (fearful)
                        Maisie!

           She turns to find Zeke JOGGING toward her along the fence. A 
           PROTEST SIGN limp in his hand. 

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie sits shotgun in the pickup truck, Zeke clenching the 
           steering wheel anxiously. 

           Maisie finishes off a paper cup of water.

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya don’t go close to the fence like 
                        that! Ya don’t know what they’re 
                        capable of, they coulda hurt ya! 

                                 MAISIE
                        They put regular people in those 
                        camps, not just Fallen? 

           Zeke is surprised by her question--

                                 ZEKE
                        What?

                                 MAISIE
                        Thought I saw someone I know in 
                        there...

           Zeke’s wagging his head no. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Those camps just for Fallen, Maise. 
                        And not for you-- ya scarin’ me 
                        bein’ out there, ya moron. 

           Maisie swivels around to look out the back window of the 
           truck. The Fallen camp shrinks in the distance...

                                 MAISIE
                        Zeke? They helpin’ the Fallen in 
                        those camps? 

           Zeke’s focus is on the road ahead. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Don’t be stupid. 
           Maisie studies him, slowly accepts this as a response, and 
           seats herself forward again. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Why ya out here? Mama know ya gone?  

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah, Mama sent me ta get medicine 
                        from town for that older Fallen 
                        boy. 

           Zeke SCOWLS. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya ain’t got no business goin’ inta 
                        town nowadays... 

                                 MAISIE
                        Why ya at the Fallen camp? 

           Zeke SIGHS and glances over at Maisie. He searches her 
           curious face before making his decision. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Can I trust ya? 

           Maisie bobs her head. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        I been protestin’. Ya know what 
                        protestin’ is? 

                                 MAISIE
                             (duh)
                        Yeah--

                                 ZEKE
                        I want the Fallen ta leave. 

           Maisie furrows her brow, reasoning with this information. 

                                 MAISIE
                        But--

                                 ZEKE
                             (interrupting)
                        Ya know how Mama ‘n I been plannin’ 
                        on goin’ down to Mobile this week?  

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah... 

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya know what’s happenin’ in Mobile? 
           Maisie shakes her head no. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        People like me, folks all over, 
                        been protestin’ ta make the Fallen 
                        leave, and now Congress finally 
                        gonna vote on whether we gonna make 
                        ‘em leave this week. Bunch-a people 
                        from the South gonna go ta Mobile, 
                        show Congress what we want.  Mama 
                        wants ta go ta support the side 
                        wantin’ ‘em ta stay, but I’m gonna 
                        stand with the folks want ‘em ta 
                        go. 

           Maisie’s wrapping her head around all of this. 

                                 MAISIE
                        But-- but where they gonna go? If 
                        we make ‘em leave? 

                                 ZEKE
                        Well... they’d... we’d execute ‘em. 

           Maisie wide-eyed at this. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Ya know what execute means? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah! But-- but-- then they’d kill 
                        the boys at our house?

                                 ZEKE
                        Well--

                                 MAISIE
                        But they ain’t done nothin’ wrong! 
                        That ain’t fair! 

                                 ZEKE
                        It ain’t about fair. Yeah, those 
                        boys ain’t hurt nobody, but there’s 
                        other Fallen out there killin’ 
                        people! ‘N they sick as dogs, 
                        that’s why they come here in the 
                        first place we think. And what if 
                        they get us all sick so we’re dyin’ 
                        out? We can’t trust ‘em-- any of 
                        ‘em.

           Maisie can’t find a rebuttal, but remains unconvinced. 
                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Maise, it comes down ta this: Who 
                        ya care ‘bout more, them or ya 
                        family? 

           Maisie looks back out the front windshield. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Mama don’t know I’m goin’ ta 
                        support the other side, she thinks 
                        I’m goin’ ta the pro-Fallen rally 
                        with her. So ya can’t tell Mama. 
                        Else I’ll get in hot water. 

           Maisie absorbs this quietly. Zeke side-eyes her for 
           confirmation. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Ya hearin’ me, Maise? 

                                 MAISIE
                             (softly)
                        Yeah. 

           Zeke sighs. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya prob’ly too little ta understand 
                        anyway... 

           At this, Maisie scowls out her side window. 

           EXT. RAY HOME - DAY

           Zeke pulls the truck into the driveway, climbs out. 

           Maisie hops out too, following Zeke up to the porch but not 
           following him inside. 

           She pauses and squats on the porch next to Skinny. 

           He’s shirtless, hunched over a flattened brown grocery bag, 
           which he’s drawing on with broken stubs of crayons. 

           Maisie observes Skinny quietly. Her forehead creases in worry 
           as she counts his ribs, his knobby spine poking through. 

           Shirtless, Skinny is even more skeletal than he seemed. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Ya need ta eat somethin’. Ya skin 
                        ‘n bones. 
           She pokes one of Skinny’s protruding ribs, and he straightens 
           to look at her. 

           Pools of tears brim in his eyes. His face pink from crying, 
           his nose running. 

           While one hand is gripping the crayons, the other is still 
           cupping the dead body’s hair they cut off. 

           Maisie points to the hair as she seats herself next to 
           Skinny. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        That man was ya Daddy? 

           Skinny looks down at the clump of hair in his hand. He points 
           to it, then points to his heart. 

           Maisie nods at him. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        My Daddy gone too. 

           She kicks her feet back and forth as they dangle off the 
           ledge of the porch. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        He ain’t dead, he just been in 
                        Vietnam. Now he in Mobile, since 
                        they called the troops back ta keep 
                        people from fightin’ each other 
                        over here. But I still ain’t seen 
                        him in a long time. 

           She glances back at Skinny, who is squinting at her, as if 
           trying to decode her language. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t even ‘member what he looks 
                        like, really. But he’s real mean.

           Skinny’s lip trembles, threatening new tears. 

           Maisie softens, recognizing his pain. She reaches toward him 
           for a hug, but he’s startled, scooting away from her. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, look--

           She walks him through the motions of an embrace--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        This a hug. Okay? This how we cheer 
                        each other up ‘round here. 
           Skinny melts, even hugs her back. 

           When they pull away from each other, Maisie offers him the 
           yellow taffy she bought at the general store. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Here. I got this for ya. 

           Skinny reluctantly accepts the taffy, unsure what to do with 
           it. Maisie notices his conundrum. She giggles--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Like this--

           Maisie shows him how to unwrap the candy. Shows him it’s 
           edible. His face lights up at the sweetness. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        See? It’s good. 

           Skinny looks down at his hands... SIGHS morosely at the sight 
           of the clump of hair, and then offers it to Maisie. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        For me? 

           Skinny offers it more forcefully to Maisie’s disgust. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (disgusted, laughing)
                        Aw, no, thanks, ya keep it. 

           Maisie’s eye catches on the drawing he’s made on the paper 
           bag. Looks like a CITY SKYLINE. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        That ya home? 

           She runs a finger along the drawing, tracing the waxy 
           buildings, the horizontal line marking the ground. 

           Maisie tilts her head as she deciphers the figures sketched 
           along the ground. 

           Looks like... people. But they aren’t standing vertical. 
           They’re horizontal... 

           And streaks of RED CRAYON are scribbled over their whole 
           bodies...

           An ominous air coaxes sullen expressions from Maisie and 
           Skinny. 
                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        That blood? 

           She prods the red scribbles. Then looks up at Skinny. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        This where you came from? This why 
                        ya left? 

           Skinny points to the drawing, then points to the ground. 

           Maisie SIGHS, he doesn’t understand. She asks slowly, 
           gesturing to illustrate:

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        No, is this ya home? 

           She points to herself, then to the Ray house:

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        This my home. 

           She points to Skinny’s drawing, then to the sky:

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        This your home? 

           But Skinny immediately shakes his head no, no, no. 

           He points to the picture, then points to the ground. Again. 
           Picture, ground. Picture, ground. 

           Emphatically: Himself. Picture. Ground. 

           Maisie is now confused... furrowing her brow at Skinny... 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m from here? 

           She points to herself and the house. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re from...?

           She points to him. 

           He points to the GROUND. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Here? 

           Their eyes locked, desperately trying to understand...
                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                             (calling)
                        Maisie!

                                 MAISIE
                        Comin’!

           Maisie’s eyes linger on Skinny for a moment before she 
           stands. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon Skinny. 

           INT. RAY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie and Skinny tromp inside, the screen door TWACKING shut 
           behind them. 

           They find Mama Delilah on the phone, Rebecca and Zeke 
           listening in on the conversation with pouts. 

           Teen Boy growing more and more infirm by the moment on the 
           couch beyond the kitchen. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (into phone)
                        Alright, we can meet her at the old 
                        train station, the one right 
                        outside Biloxi. Y’all let her know?

           Mama jots information down on the pad of paper. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Can Zeke and I stay at the Mobile 
                        sanctuary that night? 

                                 ZEKE
                        Mama!

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (to Zeke)
                        Shht--

                                 ZEKE
                        I ain’t stayin’ on the underground 
                        railroad--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (into phone)
                        Okay, well, see y’all tomorrow 
                        then. Bless ya for takin’ ‘em under 
                        ya wing. 
           Mama Delilah smiles faintly at whatever response she hears. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Damn right we ain’t sittin’ down. 
                        Alright, bye now. 

           She hangs up the phone and Zeke springs into argument. 

                                 ZEKE
                        I ain’t helpin’ ya with the 
                        underground railroad, Mama. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Me neither!

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Well, ain’t it nice no one’s askin’ 
                        ya ta help, Rebecca? 

           Rebecca scoffs as Mama turns to Zeke. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama, I can go with ya!

           Mama ignores Maisie altogether--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Zeke, ya comin’ with me, that’s 
                        that. Maisie, ya bring that 
                        medicine back from town? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yes, ma’am. 

           Maisie extends the small glass jar of medicine to her. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Good girl. 

           Mama snatches it and a spoon from the drying rack. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Say whatever ya want, I ain’t 
                        stayin’ at an underground railroad 
                        sanctuary, I just ain’t. 

           Mama SIGHS as she crouches over Teen Boy on the couch. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Fine. We’ll stay with Daddy in 
                        Mobile tomorrow night ‘fore the 
                        rally. 
           Maisie keeps her sights on Zeke, who’s pacing the kitchen. 

                                 ZEKE
                        And what if I tell Daddy what ya 
                        done with these boys? 

           Mama attempts to spoon-feed medicine into Teen Boy’s mouth 
           but he struggles away from her. 

                                 TEEN BOY
                        Ahhh--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Then guess you ‘n I’ll get beat, 
                        won’t we? 
                             (to Teen Boy)
                        C’mon now--

           The medicine dribbles back out of the Teen Boy’s mouth. He 
           tries turning his head away from the spoon. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Hold still!

           Mama Delilah aggressively grips Teen Boy’s head between her 
           arms and shoves the spoon in. 

           Teen Boy GAGS. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama, ya hurtin’ ‘em--

           Mama Delilah forcibly tilts Teen Boy’s head back, smothering 
           his mouth with her hand so he can’t spit it back out. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        He gotta take the medicine. 

           Teen Boy weakly fights her, but she presses her hand harder 
           into his lips. 

           Rebecca, Maisie, and Zeke look on disturbed by their Mama. 
           Skinny grips Maisie’s arm, worried.  

           Finally Mama Delilah releases his head and Teen Boy sputters, 
           COUGHING. 

           Mama Delilah looms over Teen Boy, slowly screwing the cap 
           back on the medicine bottle. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Now Zeke ya best not make me tell 
                        ya one more time-- go pack ya 
                        things, we leavin’ in the mornin’. 
           Zeke doesn’t move. 

                                 ZEKE
                        And what if I say I’m man of the 
                        house? 

           Mama Delilah laughs snidely. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Boy, you got a lot more ta learn 
                        ‘bout bein’ a man. 

           Maisie can’t contain herself any longer--

                                 MAISIE
                        I can go ta Biloxi with ya, Mama! 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Hush up Maisie! 

           Maisie extremely hurt by her mother’s snapping. 

           INT. MAISIE AND REBECCA’S ROOM - LATER

           Now Maisie’s expression is screwed up in determination. 

           She’s packing clothes and Zeke’s swiss army knife in a 
           rucksack from her wardrobe. Skinny watches her from her bed. 

           Rebecca slips into the room--

                                 MAISIE
                        I’m goin’ with Mama tomorrow. 

           Rebecca appears irked, anxious. She eases the door firmly 
           shut. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Ya too young ta understand-- what 
                        Mama’s doin’ is stupid! 

           Maisie slows her packing...

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Bad things happen when people get 
                        caught on the underground railroad, 
                        when people get caught helpin’ the 
                        Fallen. 

                                 MAISIE
                        What kinds-a things?
                                 REBECCA
                        Ya seen them bodies hangin’ from 
                        trees in town? That ‘n worse. 

           Maisie drops her arm and rucksack to her side. Worry clearly 
           displayed across her face. 

           Rebecca notices: 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 MAISIE
                             (hushed)
                        I think... someone might-a heard me 
                        in town... 

           Rebecca slides closer to Maisie. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Heard ya what? 

           Maisie can’t meet her eyes.

                                 MAISIE
                        Say we got Fallen boys at the 
                        house. 

           Rebecca explodes with fear. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Maisie! The hell--? Who heard!? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Just a boy! Just this boy, white 
                        boy, Dillard-- 

                                 REBECCA
                        White boy!? 

                                 MAISIE
                        He’s my friend! Kinda. He prob’ly 
                        won’t say nothin’!

           Rebecca’s eyes wild with fear. 

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s not ‘bout friends now, it’s 
                        ‘bout scared. 

           Maisie steps toward Rebecca, grabs her wrist pleadingly--
                                 MAISIE
                        Rebecca, don’t tell Mama. She won’t 
                        ever let me go inta town by myself 
                        again! 

                                 REBECCA
                        How’d the boy react? What’d he say? 

                                 MAISIE
                        He... he just--

           Maisie looks over to see Skinny anxiously watching...

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Kinda shrugged. 

                                 REBECCA
                        He just shrugged? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah, he don’t care. Said he’s seen 
                        plenty Fallen that fell out by his 
                        house. 

           Rebecca consumes this information hungrily. 

                                 REBECCA
                        So he don’t seem... against the 
                        Fallen? 

                                 MAISIE
                        No. He said he... His family help 
                        ‘em too.  

           Rebecca exhales deeply. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t tell Mama. 

           Rebecca dons a stern expression. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Ya gotta be more careful. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I will. 

                                 REBECCA
                        And ya ain’t goin’ with ‘em 
                        tomorrow neither. 

           Rebecca SIGHS again, her anxiety returning briefly. 
                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Ya know they sayin’ if that vote 
                        don’t go well we might have us a 
                        civil war. 

           Maisie watches her sister pick at her nails. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Then we’d prob’ly never see Daddy. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I don’t care if I never see Daddy 
                        again. 

           Rebecca fumes at this. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Don’t say that! 

                                 MAISIE
                        He ain’t never been nothin’ but 
                        mean ta us!

                                 REBECCA
                        But he’s still ya Daddy, Maisie! 
                        Family counts for somethin’!

           Maisie grapples with what she’s said. 

           INT. RAY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The living room is dark, save for the pale glow from the old 
           black-and-white TV set transmitting the news to Mama in a 
           large worn recliner. 

           Maisie tromps up to Mama’s side to find her stitching on a 
           garment: a delicate embroidery, a pattern of several small 
           hearts that make up a circle. 

           Maisie’s expression grumpy, her voice volatile to match: 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Shh-- I’m watchin’.

           Mama Delilah gestures the garment toward the TV. 

           Maisie’s upset by being cut off. She glances at the images on 
           the TV, absorbs fragments of the newscaster’s tinny voice:

           ON TV--
           Footage of protests turned violent, reminiscent of famous 
           photos from 60s civil rights protests: 

           -White officers wielding German shepherds

           -Fire hoses BLASTING weapon-less individuals 

           -Protesters protecting their heads from batons 

           -A mass of protesters link arms as they march down a street

                                 NEWSCASTER VOICE
                             (breaking up)
                        Congressional vote this week-- 
                        Civil unrest-- Nation divided--

           Now footage of a Fallen internment camp like the one Maisie 
           passed. GAUNT FALLEN PRISONERS stare out behind chain link 
           fences with hollow eyes. 

           And then, grainy footage of a BLACK MAN orating passionately 
           at a podium: DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (O.S.)
                        Ya understand what they sayin’, 
                        Maisie? 

           BACK TO LIVING ROOM--

           Maisie transfixed by the TV. She hesitantly shakes her head 
           no. Mama Delilah pats her lap-- inviting Maisie to sit. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, sit here. 

           Maisie delivers the meanest pout she can muster. 

           Mama chuckles at Maisie’s ire. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Aw, ya still cross with me? 

                                 MAISIE
                        Why won’t ya let me help?

           Mama Delilah pats her thighs again in response. Maisie SIGHS 
           dramatically before plopping in Mama’s lap. 

           Mama wraps her arms comfortingly around Maisie, continues 
           stitching on the garment as she speaks:

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        I’m proud of ya for wantin’ ta 
                        help, Maise. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT'D)
                        But when you’re a Mama someday, ya 
                        gonna learn how Mama’s always wanna 
                        protect they kids. We livin’ in 
                        dangerous times, in dangerous 
                        places. And as ya Mama, I’ll always 
                        be wantin’ ta protect ya. 

           Maisie watches as Mama adds another tiny heart, almost like 
           an x, made from two stitches. She’s almost completed the 
           circle of tiny hearts. 

                                 MAISIE
                        If it ain’t safe... why ya makin’ 
                        Zeke go with ya? 

           Mama begins stitching yet another heart, contemplating her 
           answer. Finally: 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        I love ya, I protect ya... but what 
                        if I ain’t there to protect ya no 
                        more? I need someone else ta love 
                        ya and protect ya for me. Right?

           Maisie nods. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        I need someone to protect ya, not 
                        ‘cause they ya Mama or even ya 
                        family, but just ‘cause you a 
                        fellow human bein’. Just ‘cause 
                        it’s the right thing ta do. 

           Maisie looks up to the TV again to find more dire footage of 
           Fallen internment camps: inhumane and haunting.

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s why we gotta help these 
                        boys, Maisie. ‘Cause the second you 
                        decide someone’s life ain’t worth 
                        the same as yours or your family’s, 
                        who’s ta say someone else ain’t 
                        gonna think your life ain’t worth 
                        anythin’ neither? ... Understand? 

           Maisie nods slowly. She ponders this as she replaces her 
           focus on Mama’s next stitched heart. 

           Mama HUMS a familiar tune to Maisie... Maisie sinking into 
           Mama’s arms as she sews. 

           Maisie joining in with the HUMMING near the end of the ditty. 

           TUG--
           Maisie’s attention is snatched by Skinny tugging on her arm. 
           He’s wearing a pair of too-big swim trunks. 

           Maisie sits upright and turns to her Mama---

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama, can Skinny ‘n me go throw 
                        jellies back in the ocean ‘fore 
                        bed? 

           Mama releases Maisie from her lap. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Alright, but ya gotta promise ta 
                        look after him, hear? 

           Maisie nods vigorously. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s how you can help out. 

           Maisie grins slightly at this before she dashes toward the 
           back door.  

           EXT. RAY HOME BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The flashlight’s beam scatters across the backyard as Maisie 
           jogs toward the beach--

           Skinny struggles to match pace. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (smiling)
                        Hurry up! 

           Their shallow PANTING. Slamming FOOTFALLS. 

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie and Skinny stock-still, facing out to the ocean. 
           Flashlight hanging lamely by Maisie’s side. 

           Before them: 

           The washed-up crash wreckage. 

           EXT. BEACH - WRECKAGE - LATER

           Maisie crawls along the edges of the wreckage capsule, 
           pulling her fingers across the metal exterior. 
           Plucking up a section of the tattered parachute. Inspects it.

           Shining the flashlight directly at a reflective panel, and 
           squinting at the rebounding light. 

           She inches toward the open capsule door, crawls inside--

           INT. CAPSULE - CONTINUOUS

           SPLASH as Maisie’s bare feet land in the waterlogged bottom. 

           She lifts her flashlight in the dark to reveal: 

           Skinny stands knee-deep in seawater. 

           He stares at damp scraps on the wall. Turns to her, his hand 
           shielding his eyes from the flashlight. 

           He points to the scraps. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Milagch. 

           Maisie sloshes over to him and scans the flashlight over the 
           scraps on the wall. 

           Photographs, but matte, on cardboard-like paper, and lighting 
           of the subjects like the harsh flash of a disposable camera.

           The edges curled and some images blurred from water damage. 

           One depicts the Boys with the person who was the Dead Body-- 
           their father. No smiles, formal, like Victorian-era portrait. 

           Maisie’s eyes scan it, move along to another more candid shot 
           of Skinny with a DOG. 

           Skinny in the photo is BEAMING, arms wrapped around the 
           animal affectionately. 

           Skinny in real life taps the image of the dog. 

                                 SKINNY (CONT’D)
                        Wehka eesa. 

           Maisie stares at him, the flashlight’s beam beneath them 
           casting eerie shadows on their facades. 

           Skinny waves his hand for her to follow him as he splashes 
           over to another part of the claustrophobic capsule. 

           He digs his fingernails into a gap in the wall, wrenching a 
           metal panel open, like a drawer. 
           He digs out a tuft of FUR, same color as the dog’s, tied with 
           a red string, like yarn. 

           Holds it up to Maisie: 

                                 SKINNY (CONT’D)
                        Wehka eesaka swol. 

           Tugs on his own hair. Points to the image of the dog again. 

           Maisie glances back at the photo of Skinny and the dog. The 
           flashlight’s circle framing it on the wall. 

           She focuses on Skinny’s look of pure joy in the image. 

           Looks like he’s LAUGHING. 

           Maisie’s eyes gaze in wonder at it... 

           Until her attention is nabbed by SLOSHING again--

           Skinny moving toward the capsule’s door. 

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Skinny and Maisie climb out of the capsule and back onto the 
           sand. Skinny tucks the tuft of fur into his short’s pocket. 

           His demeanor palpably forlorn. 

           Maisie picks up on this, circles her arm around him. 

           They remain unmoving. 

           Silhouetted by the cresting sun. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        This a jellyfish. 

           EXT. OCEAN - LATER

           Tentacles swaying as Maisie hustles into the waves, a 
           jellyfish in her palms. 

           Skinny follows after with a jellyfish of his own. Tripping 
           over the waves as they attack his shins. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        They live in the ocean. 

           Maisie now deep enough to start swimming, knocked about in 
           the choppy water. She glances back at Skinny. 
                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        Some summers the water push ‘em out 
                        ta the sand. 

           Skinny struggles in the waves, his balance wonky from holding 
           the jellyfish above his head. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        But they don’t wanna be on the 
                        sand, they can’t live there for 
                        long. ‘N they can’t get back to the 
                        water by theyselves. 

           Once they’re shoulder-deep, Maisie demonstrates how to rear 
           back, CHUCK the jellyfish out as far as she can to the ocean. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        So we gotta help ‘em get back home. 

           Skinny copies Maisie, thrusting his jellyfish out toward the 
           horizon. Maisie and Skinny watch the jellyfish fall. 

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           The tide tosses new jellyfish up with each wave that greets 
           the beach. 

           Maisie and Skinny squat by a pile of jellyfish. Maisie scoops 
           one up. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        My brother ‘n sister used ta help 
                        me throw ‘em back. But they don’t 
                        help me much now. 

           Skinny places a halting hand on her arm, an idea dawning on 
           his features. He hustles off toward the capsule. 

           Maisie watches him curiously.

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        Says they tired, ‘cause jellies 
                        been washin’ up every day this 
                        summer, and they gotta help mama 
                        with all the chores now they old 
                        ‘nough.

           Skinny returns with a mesh bag. He opens it up and carefully 
           transfers the whole pile of jellyfish into the bag. 

           After a few moments of watching this, Maisie assists him. 
           EXT. OCEAN - LATER

           Maisie and Skinny swim a mad dash out to the ocean. Skinny 
           drags the mesh bag behind him. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        I don’t get as much as I used ta 
                        with them. ‘N they dry up by 
                        noontime on the sand. 

           Once deep enough, Maisie plucks a jellyfish out of the bag, 
           throws it far. 

           Skinny nabs a jellyfish out of the bag and throws it right 
           after her. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        But I get many as I can by myself. 

           Skinny and Maisie watch the two jellyfish land side-by-side 
           in the ocean beyond them. 

                                 MAISIE (V.O.)
                        ‘N I get some-a them back home. 

           Maisie and Skinny both with slight grins of success. 

           INT. RAY HOME - NIGHT

           Maisie and Skinny drip puddles onto the wood floor by the 
           back door. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Watch it! Ya gettin’ water all 
                        over!

           Mama still in the recliner with her stitching. Zeke and 
           Rebecca at the kitchen table reading books. 

           Skinny hustles up to Teen Boy, stretched out on the couch. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Zagh, mehka eesa!

           He offers Teen Boy the bundle of dog hair he extracted from 
           the capsule. Teen Boy weakly smiles at the sight. 

           They share a warm moment of reminiscing. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama, that wreckage washed up. 

           Zeke jolts up from his chair. 
                                 ZEKE
                        Why didn’t ya come get us right 
                        away?!

           He YANKS his boots on by the front door. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, hurry! Help me get ridda it! 

           He trucks out the back door--

                                 MAMA DELILAH
                             (calling after him) 
                        Careful with the boat in the dark!
                             (to Rebecca)
                        Go help ya brother. 

           Rebecca stays put. Maisie and Skinny playfully follow Zeke 
           outside. 

           EXT. SHED - NIGHT

           Maisie holds the flashlight for Zeke as he loads up a 
           wheelbarrow with tools. 

                                 MAISIE
                        How many Fallen white ‘n how many 
                        black? 

           Zeke’s already sweating from the task. Skinny peers into the 
           wheelbarrow curiously. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Some black, some white, some even 
                        look oriental or Mexican. Don’t 
                        matter anyhow, nobody likes none-a 
                        ‘em. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Why they comin’ here? 

                                 ZEKE
                        I dunno, where they from, 
                        everyone’s sick n’ dyin’ so I 
                        ‘spose they tryna escape that.  

                                 MAISIE
                        I know but... where they come from? 

           Zeke snaps:
                                 ZEKE
                        Ya already know nobody’s got the 
                        answer ta that!  

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah but they gotta know somethin’! 
                        Don’t they got NASA workin’ on it 
                        or somethin’?

           Zeke GROANS from Maisie’s tedious questions. Answers 
           reluctantly anyway: 

                                 ZEKE
                        Some people sayin’ from space... 
                        but some people sayin’ from 
                        someplace else. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Like ‘nother country? 

                                 ZEKE
                        No, not ‘nother country, not 
                        ‘nother planet, just... somewhere 
                        else. I dunno. 

           Zeke shrugs. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        People got crazy theories. 

           Maisie inspects Skinny. 

                                 MAISIE
                        They look like us. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Yeah, they look like us, but they 
                        ain’t us. They diff’rent. 

           Zeke drops a final tool in the wheelbarrow with a CLANG. 
           Maisie reads Skinny dubiously. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Zeke’s knees sink into the sand as he crouches to disassemble 
           the washed-up capsule. 

           Maisie emerges from within with an armful of items, which she 
           dumps unceremoniously into the wheelbarrow. 

           Zeke manages to pry a hunk of metal away from the side with a 
           crowbar. With a final CRACK he dislodges it. 
           Skinny SCREAMS! 

                                 SKINNY
                        Peh! Bagh ehdu dali! 

           Skinny falls to the beach beside Zeke and grabs at the 
           crowbar in his hands. 

           Zeke shoves Skinny aside. But Skinny lunges back at Zeke’s 
           chest. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Hey! The hell-- he’s attackin’ me! 

                                 MAISIE
                        ‘Course he is, stupid! This all his 
                        junk!

           Zeke wrestles with one hand to keep Skinny away from him. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Well tell ‘em ta calm down! 

                                 MAISIE
                        He don’t understand me. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Do somethin’! 

           Maisie SIGHS, approaches Skinny purposefully. 

                                 MAISIE
                        C’mon, Skinny, we gotta do it. 

           She wraps a hand around his upper arm and coaxes him 
           backwards. Uses soothing tones:

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s sad, but we gotta hide 
                        it so they don’t catch us with it. 

           Skinny lashes out at Maisie and KNOCKS her to the ground. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Bagh ehdu weni! 

           Maisie lands on her butt with a soft plop-- taken aback by 
           his action.

           Skinny leaps toward Zeke and hangs on his biceps to stop the 
           demolition. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Maisie! 
                                 MAISIE
                        I’m tryin’! 

           Maisie pulls herself back up and drags a squirming Skinny 
           backwards. 

                      MAISIE (CONT’D)
                                                         SKINNY
           C’mon! Quit it! 
                                              Raugh weni! Muha! Bagh 
                                              reilagh dali!

                                 ZEKE
                        Oo, damn, he ain’t happy. 

           Zeke resumes deconstructing the capsule with his crowbar. 

           Maisie sinks to the ground to anchor a struggling Skinny. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Yeah, well ya wreckin’ his home! 

           Zeke doesn’t react as he snaps another hunk of capsule away. 

           Skinny slowly abandons hope of escaping Maisie’s grip. He 
           slumps in the sand... begins to weep. 

           Maisie’s heart breaks when she feels his sobbing. She 
           attempts to calm Skinny by whispering in his ear: 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, Skinny... we gonna find 
                        ya a new home... 

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - NIGHT

           Ropes CREAK as the shrimping net suspends the entirety of the 
           disassembled capsule over the choppy waves. 

           Zeke captains the boat as they motor out to sea. 

           Maisie watches Skinny from the sideboard as he leans over the 
           edge, picks through some of the junk in the shrimping net. 

           He selects a large linen shirt and dislodges it from the 
           pile. He retreats back to Maisie. 

           Skinny pulls the shirt over his head, the hem of the garment 
           skirting his kneecaps. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (yelling over motor)
                        That shirt ya Daddy’s? 
           Maisie points to the hair tuft in Skinny’s fist to 
           illustrate. 

           Skinny nods, burrowing further into the shirt as he curls up 
           on the sideboard next to Maisie. 

           Zeke cuts the engine-- now everything much quieter, the waves 
           LAPPING up against the sides of the boat. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Stand back, Maise. 

           But Maisie doesn’t move as Zeke releases the net--

           The three of them observe the junk rain into the ocean, 
           slowly sink below the surface in the spotlamp of the boat. 

           Skinny brimming with tears. 

           A moment of silence once the net is fully depleted. 

           Then Zeke TURNS the engine to life once more. 

           Maisie YAWNS widely. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        We still an hour out-- y’all can 
                        sleep. 

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - LATER

           NO SOUND--

           Maisie and Skinny slumbering on the floorboards of the boat 
           in the moonlight...

           An ORANGE GLOW creeps across Maisie’s features... 

           SOUND RAMPING UP--

           Maisie opens her eyes groggily-- 

           Zeke is YELLING-- POINTING--

           Maisie scrambles up to see on the shore: 

           Their HOUSE is on FIRE! 

                                 MAISIE
                        ZEKE!

                                 ZEKE
                        Help me dock the boat! 
           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

           Zeke haphazardly docks the boat-- Maisie and Zeke both 
           bounding off, Skinny close behind. 

           They stampede down the dock, but Zeke THRUSTS an arm out at 
           the end, catching Maisie--

           Maisie looks to Zeke: Something... is awry... 

           Zeke squints, then his eyes widen in fear. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Get back in the boat! 

           Maisie grows roots, searching the property, trying to find 
           what Zeke has witnessed. 

                                 MAISIE
                        But Mama! And Rebecca! 

           Zeke nabs her under the arms -- she YELPS!-- He’s dragging 
           her backwards as fast as he can. 

                                 ZEKE
                        C’MON!

           Then Maisie SEES IT: 

           Hooded KKK MEMBERS. 

           Throwing fiery torches onto their home’s roof. 

           And in the oldest, fattest tree in their yard...

           The silhouettes of THREE PEOPLE hanging... 

           Maisie wildly SCREAMS! 

                                 MAISIE
                        MAMA!

           Maisie rips at Zeke’s arms to wrestle free, manages to evade 
           his grasp.

           She RUSHES toward the house--

                                 ZEKE
                        MAISIE, NO!

           But she continues flying down the dock and onto the bank. 

           She’s sobbing, the fire igniting her features in an ORANGE 
           TINGE, racing toward the hanging bodies in the tree. 
           The flames from the house have caught the overhanging limbs 
           of nearby trees on fire as well. 

           The whole yard GLOWS, fiery branches breaking free from above 
           and SHOWERING the crab grass with their embers. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! Look!

           Maisie HALTS in her tracks, scared STIFF, when she spies 
           three HOODED KKK MEMBERS advancing toward her. 

           They are backlit, menacing shadow-y creatures, STALKING her 
           way...

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                             (from the boat)
                        MAISIE! GET BACK HERE!

           Maisie stumbles backward to retreat to the boat, but trips 
           and falls onto her backside. 

           KKK MEMBERS are feet away-- 

           The ONE closest reaching a hand out--

           Maisie SCREECHES in fear, shielding herself with an arm 
           before--

           SKINNY rushes up to her side, HOLLERING at the top of his 
           lungs: 

                                 SKINNY
                        DAK! GAHBI!

           He SWATS at the nearest KKK Member with his hands. KKK Member 
           YELPS and jumps back at Skinny’s touch. 

                                 KKK MEMBER #2
                             (Southern accent)
                        Don’t touch ‘em, he one-a the 
                        Fallen! 

           All three KKK Men hesitate, unsure how to proceed. But Skinny 
           continues his yelling tirade: 

                                 SKINNY
                        BAGH EHDU POLI! FASI VAHS! FASI 
                        VAHS!

           Skinny utilizes his whole body as a shield over Maisie. 
                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                             (from dock)
                        MAISIE! 

           CRACK! 

           KKK Members look up and scramble backwards--

           One of the bigger burning branches from the tree above gives 
           way and CRASHES down between Maisie, Skinny, and the KKK 
           Members. 

           This SNAPS Maisie back to attention as she scurries up and 
           pulls Skinny with her back to the boat--

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie, Skinny, Zeke watch their blazing house recede on the 
           horizon, SOBBING in the dissipating orange glow of the fire. 

           Zeke flies into a rage--

                                 ZEKE
                        This is all ‘cause-a them!

           He turns and SHOVES Skinny to the ground. 

                          MAISIE
           ZEKE! 
                                                      ZEKE (CONT'D)
                                              We should-a never helped them 
                                              boys!

           Maisie crumples protectively around Skinny. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t hurt ‘em! 

           Zeke prowls toward Skinny--

                                 ZEKE
                        Get outta the way, Maise! I’m 
                        dumpin’ ‘em back in the ocean! 

           Zeke nabs Skinny’s arm, attempting to lift him up-- but 
           Maisie KICKS at him--

                                 MAISIE
                        NO! 

           And Zeke SMACKS Maisie in the face. 

           Skinny scampers up and swaps places with Maisie-- now her 
           shield. 
                                 SKINNY
                        DAK!

           Maisie GLARES at Zeke from behind Skinny’s protection. All of 
           their chests heaving from adrenaline breaths. 

           Finally: 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama woulda wanted us ta take 
                        Skinny ta the underground railroad! 

                                 ZEKE
                        Ya wanna end up like Mama and 
                        Rebecca!?

           Maisie doesn’t respond as she watches Zeke unsuccessfully try 
           to stop his tears from flowing. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                             (voice breaking)
                        I ain’t havin’ nothin’ ta do with 
                        Skinny or any-a the damn Fallen! 
                        I’m gonna protest in Mobile ta get 
                        ridda every single last one-a them! 

           Zeke stalks to the back of the boat, leaving Skinny and 
           Maisie in each other’s protection. 

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - NIGHT 

           Maisie GASPS awake from a nightmare-- 

           Catches her breath in the moonlit air. Realizes where she 
           is... what has happened... 

           Begins to break down again. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Mama...

           Skinny is already awake next to her. He’s clutching his dad’s 
           hair like a teddy bear, cheeks also shining with tears. 

           Maisie whispers through her SOBS: 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Skinny--

           She can barely get the words out. 
                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m the reason our families got 
                        killed. 

           Her bawling takes over again. 

           And that’s all she can manage. 

           Skinny doesn’t understand a word, but he offers Maisie a hug. 

           They embrace in a cuddle, their little arms entwined around 
           each other. 

           At the bow of the boat-- 

           Zeke is awake and listening to Maisie. But he’s not surprised 
           by the words she’s said. He’s wiping tears of his own away. 

           EXT. SHRIMPING BOAT - DAWN

           A high-pitched WHISTLING rouses Maisie from her dreams. 

           She lifts her eyelids just in time to witness another CAPSULE 
           CRASH into the ocean. 

           The sun is just peaking above the edge of the water. 

           Maisie and Skinny pull themselves up to peer over the side of 
           the boat, wanting a glimpse of the crash site. 

           They see that their boat is beached on a shore. 

           Zeke discovers the same thing--

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                        Damnit!

           Zeke’s heavy footfalls land by the steering wheel of the 
           boat. He turns the key only to hear a GEARS GRINDING. 

           Out of gas. 

           Zeke GROWLS, KICKS the sideboard. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon Maisie, let’s go! We’re only 
                        at Biloxi, gotta walk the rest-a 
                        the way ta Mobile. 
           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Zeke hops out of the boat and onto the sand. Maisie follows 
           closely after him. 

           Maisie stops to observe: 

           There are HUNDREDS of washed up jellyfish on this beach. 

           Zeke calls over his shoulder at her: 

                                 ZEKE
                        Leave Skinny on the boat-- whoever 
                        comes for these crashed Fallen can 
                        take ‘em too. 

                                 MAISIE
                        But they wanna hurt ‘em! 

                                 ZEKE
                        Get ya ass over here, Maisie Ray! 
                        I’m takin’ ya ta Daddy. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I don’t wanna go see Daddy! 

           Zeke whips around to face her. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Listen here-- I’m the man-a the 
                        house now, and you’re a little girl 
                        who’s gotta listen ta me! 

           Maisie PLOPS down in the sand and DROPS Skinny down with her. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I ain’t goin’ nowhere without 
                        Skinny! 

           Maisie rushes to get the words out as Zeke advances back to 
           them: 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        He saved my life! And now we gotta 
                        save him! 

           Zeke slows next to her, her words striking him. His shoulders 
           slump, exasperated. 

           A pissed-off SIGH. 
                                 ZEKE
                        Fine! We’ll drop Skinny with Mama’s 
                        friend Dorothy, but then we goin’ 
                        ta Daddy in Mobile, and ain’t gonna 
                        be no more fussin’ ‘bout it! 

           Zeke, Maisie, and Skinny step over washed-up jellyfish as 
           they stalk off the beach. 

           EXT. ABANDONED TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           Maisie and Skinny trail after Zeke on the vacant road. 

           Maisie squints in the rising sun toward a truck outside of 
           the abandoned train station. 

           A WOMAN is securing a rope down over the truck bed. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (calling)
                        Dorothy? 

           The woman turns, and indeed, it is DOROTHY GUNN (45, Black). 
           Gruff voice, weathered skin, world-weary as can be, yet still 
           prepared to talk your ear off. 

           And when she recognizes them, she palpably DEFLATES. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Oh no, I tried callin’ ya Mama last 
                        night! 

           The trio reaches her. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (hesitant)
                        Our mama--

                                 DOROTHY
                             (interrupting)
                        The folks she talked to was dead-as-
                        a-doornail wrong, we ain’t got no 
                        more room at the sanctuary. Like 
                        damn sardines up there. Anyway, I 
                        gotta get back to my family after 
                        this goods drop--

           She gestures to the fully stocked pickup truck--
                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause these puppies can’t stand no 
                        more traipsin’ around, I’m done, I 
                        tried ta tell ya Mama that last 
                        night! Ya gotta take ‘em back home. 

           Maisie’s completely crestfallen, bursting into tears. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hush now, child, ya Mama’ll 
                        know what ta do with ‘em--

                                 MAISIE
                        Our Mama was killed! 

           This STUNS Dorothy. Zeke can’t make eye contact with her. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (mutter)
                        Someone snitched ‘bout the boys. 
                        They strung her up. 

           Dorothy expels an impossibly long sigh. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Damn... Goddamnit. Well I sure am 
                        wrecked ta hear it, I’ll tell ya 
                        that. Ya Mama was a good woman, 
                        told my ass of a husband where ta 
                        stick it when he went swingin’ at 
                        me. Use ta hide me out in that boat-
                        a yours ‘fore I left the 
                        sonuvabitch for good. ‘Spose y’all 
                        too young ta remember that now. 

           Dorothy places her hands firmly on her hips as she exhales 
           weightily once more. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Please, ma’am. Ya gotta help us 
                        take ‘em to the underground 
                        railroad. That’s what my Mama 
                        wanted. 

           Dorothy grimaces at the sight of Maisie’s adorable pleading 
           eyes. Dorothy shaking her head no, but knowing she’s decided 
           the opposite. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Oh, alright, consider ‘em part-a my 
                        last drop. But we best find some 
                        Fallen ta adopt ‘em, I’m still 
                        jumpin’ ship the minute this’s 
                        unloaded. 
           Maisie perks slightly at this news. 

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy mans the wheel, Zeke, Maisie, and Skinny crammed next 
           to each other in the cab with her. 

                                 DOROTHY
                             (to Zeke)
                        Few-a us from the sanctuary goin’ 
                        up ta Mobile tomorrow for the 
                        rally, gonna watch the speeches, if 
                        ya wanna join us ‘fore ya get ta ya 
                        Daddy. Gonna be a historic day, no 
                        doubt. 

           Zeke hesitates to answer... causing Dorothy to cast him a 
           suspicious look. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with ya? Don’t ya 
                        wanna be part-a somethin’ big? 
                        Bigger than ya-self? 

                                 ZEKE
                        I’ll just take the ride inta town, 
                        ma’am.

           Dorothy’s eyebrows jump up-- surprised.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ya not tellin’ me ya think the 
                        gov’ment should up and slaughter 
                        all these Fallen, is ya? Kids ‘n 
                        old folks ‘n all?  

           Zeke stone-faced. 

           Dorothy side eyes him venomously. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Oo... you sure is ya Daddy’s boy. 

                                 ZEKE
                        WATCH OUT!!

           Zeke’s jabbing a finger at the road in front of them--

           Dorothy SLAMS on the brakes. 

           A group of FALLEN MEN, long hair, in tattered Fallen linen 
           clothes, are clustered smack dab in the middle of the road. 
           They descend on the truck as soon as it stops. 

           Dorothy’s opening her door--

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Are ya crazy!? KEEP DRIVIN’! 

           Too late--

           One of the FALLEN MEN YANKS Dorothy’s door open the rest of 
           the way and brandishes a KNIFE. 

           Maisie SHRIEKS! 

           The Fallen Man PRESSES the knife to Dorothy’s throat, 
           pinching her arms behind her back. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        LET GO-A HER! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Now, now, Zeke, these folks just 
                        hungry, let’s-- let’s just keep 
                        calm ‘til they get what they want 
                        ‘n wander off--

                                 ZEKE
                        Are ya honestly defendin’ ‘em right 
                        now!? 

           The other two Fallen Men are rummaging in the back of the 
           truck, snagging food and supplies from the crates secured 
           back there. 

           Skinny’s rising on his knees in his seat, jabbering at the 
           Fallen Man holding Dorothy hostage--

                                 SKINNY
                        Dak! Fasi Vahs! Bagh ehdu poli!  
                             (turns to Zeke)
                        Milagch! Raugh! 

           Skinny swats at the knife-wielding Fallen Man, but he hardly 
           reacts. 

           While Skinny protests, Maisie is frozen-- transfixed on 
           something on the Fallen Man’s chest... 

           On his shirt, over his heart, an embroidered pattern: 

           A circle made up of tiny hearts. 

           JUST LIKE WHAT MAMA STITCHED the night before... 
           Maisie glances up, mouth agape, only to LOCK EYES with the 
           Fallen Man. 

           He’s staring at her curiously too... in awe of her--

           He drops Dorothy, stumbles backward, pointing to Maisie and 
           yelling to his two fellow bandits at the back of the truck: 

                                 FALLEN MAN #1 
                        PEH! Shast! Shast! 

                                 ZEKE
                        What the hell is happening!?

                                 DOROTHY
                        I dunno! 

           The other two thieves round the truck as Fallen Man explains 
           something to Skinny--

                                 FALLEN MAN #1
                             (to Skinny) 
                        Meh vul polis gahrpa...

           He points to Maisie...

                                 FALLEN MAN #1 (CONT’D)
                        Milagch, meh yalul neni.

           Skinny’s eyes widen, he inspects Maisie intently before--

           Skinny latches a hand on Maisie’s arm and crawls over 
           Dorothy, lugging Maisie with him--

                          DOROTHY
                                                          ZEKE
           Ow!
                                              Hey! No!

           Zeke extends his arms as far as he can, groping to save 
           Maisie, but she and Skinny plop onto the ground outside of 
           the truck, out of his reach. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Maisie! 

           The Fallen Man is gesturing, encouraging Skinny and Maisie to 
           follow him towards the woods at the edge of the gravel road. 

           Skinny scrambles up, pulls Maisie forcefully with him.  

                          MAISIE
                                                         SKINNY
           Hey! Skinny! Let go! 
                                              Milagch! Muha, milagch! 

           Skinny pleads with her, nodding for encouragement. She 
           hesitantly follows him, swayed by his intensity. 
           The Fallen bandits have trekked into the woods, calling out 
           to Skinny to follow. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Maisie! Stop! 

                                 MAISIE
                        I think Skinny wants me ta follow! 

                                 ZEKE
                        You get ya ass back here! Right 
                        now!  

           But she continues to allow herself to be dragged into the 
           woods by an eager Skinny--

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           And now Skinny drops her arm and begins JOGGING to keep up 
           with the other Fallen. 

           Maisie hesitates a beat-- hears Zeke approaching--

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                        Maisie! Get back here! 

           Skinny spins and wags his hand toward him--

                                 SKINNY
                        Milagch!

           Split second decision-- she picks up pace behind him. 

           Skinny and Maisie dart through the trees and the low-hanging 
           tree moss. 

           Zeke and Dorothy not far behind, calling after them--

                                 ZEKE (O.S.)
                        Maisie!

                                 DOROTHY (O.S.)
                        C’mon back! 

           Maisie’s STRAINED BREATHS, POUNDING footsteps--

           Until she breaks into a--

           EXT. CLEARING/SWAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Swampy marsh: still, filmy water surrounded by a nest of 
           trees. 
           Maisie halts-- ALL OF THE AIR SUCKED OUT OF HER. 

           The sight before her OVERWHELMING. 

           For across the marsh, on the opposite bank, Maisie finds--

           MAMA DELILAH. 

           She can barely believe what she sees; she GASPS, tears 
           gathering in her eyes. 

           She PUSHES past Skinny, sludging through the swamp to get to 
           the other side. 

           Mama Delilah notices Maisie rushing toward her, her 
           expression etched with worry at the sight of Maisie’s tears--

           Mama Delilah outstretches her arms for Maisie, crouching to 
           greet her.  

           When Maisie finally makes it to the opposite bank, Mama 
           scoops her up in an all-encompassing hug. 

           Maisie SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY into Mama’s shoulder. 

           Mama rocks her back and forth soothingly... 

           Finally, Maisie emerges from the embrace: 

                                 MAISIE
                             (through tears)
                        Mama, I was so scared!

           But Mama Delilah appears confused... She doesn’t respond...

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (through tears, whispered)
                        I thought I got ya killed. 

           And now Mama Delilah is TERRIFIED. 

           She releases Maisie and STUMBLES away backwards...

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Mama? 

           Mama Delilah’s horrified gaze is fixed beyond Maisie. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

           Mama Delilah lifts a pointer finger at Maisie... her hand 
           shaking... 
                                 MAMA DELILAH
                        Shast... gahrpa...

           Maisie is STUNNED. Now she’s SCARED. 

           Is Mama... speaking the Fallen language...?

           Mama Delilah continues shaking her pointer finger at 
           something beyond Maisie’s shoulder. 

                                 MAMA DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Gahrpa...

           Maisie slowly pivots to see what she’s pointing at. 

           And she’s face-to-face with: 

           ANOTHER MAISIE. 

           Identical to Maisie, except for longer hair and wearing 
           Fallen clothes. 

           Come to think of it, Mama Delilah is also in Fallen 
           clothes... 

           The two Maisie’s are frozen in shock. Inches away from each 
           other. Their expressions HORRIFIED. 

                           ZEKE
           Maisie!
                                                         DOROTHY
                                              Maisie! C’mon back!

           Dorothy’s and Zeke’s YELLS grow in volume until they burst 
           into the clearing on the other side of the swamp where Skinny 
           and the Fallen bandits stand. 

           They stutter to a stop, noticing everyone in this clearing is 
           COMPLETELY STILL.  

           SILENT. 

           Zeke looks to Skinny-- who points across the marsh--

           And Zeke and Dorothy peer across to see THE TWO MAISIES. 

           Zeke goes slackjaw. 

           Dorothy lights up with fascination. 

           And the Maisies still can’t tear their terrified eyes away 
           from each other. 

                                 DOROTHY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        So the rumors is true!
           EXT. DOROTHY’S TRUCK - LATER

           Dorothy re-packing the looted truck--

                                 DOROTHY
                        They ain’t space travelers, they 
                        time travelers! They us! 

           Zeke paces around her, attempting futilely to come to grips 
           with what is happening. His movements are so sharp, they’re 
           almost violent. 

                                 ZEKE
                        The hell’s that mean!?

           Maisie is SOBBING, she can’t take her eyes off of the Fallen 
           Maisie and Fallen Mama Delilah.

           Meanwhile, Fallen Maisie and Mama can’t take their eyes off 
           of Zeke. They reach out to him, tears streaming down their 
           dirty cheeks. 

           Skinny sticks by Maisie’s side. 

           Dorothy’s re-invigorated by this development, her every 
           action MANIC and zipping with adrenaline: 

                                 DOROTHY
                             (to Zeke)
                        Ain’t ya heard tell-a this? The 
                        Fallen are us-- they us from 
                        another plane--

                                 ZEKE
                        I heard tell, jus’ thought nothin’ 
                        of it, ‘cause it’s crazy! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Crazy, but true--

           Dorothy gestures to Fallen Mama and Fallen Maisie. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I s’pose in another plane-a time 
                        parallel ta ours things added up ta 
                        a plague of some kind ‘n they musta 
                        found some way ta jump ta ours-- 
                        clever rascals--

                                 ZEKE
                             (angry)
                        But-- but-- they ain’t like us! 
                        They don’t talk like us, they don’t 
                        dress like us, don’t act like us--
                                 DOROTHY
                        Just ‘cause there’s diff’rences 
                        ‘tween the two planes that made us 
                        talk diff’rent or dress diff’rent, 
                        or grow diff’rent customs or eat 
                        diff’rent foods, that don’t mean 
                        they ain’t us. It’s clear as day 
                        they us-- jus’ look at ‘em!

           Dorothy finishes her packing and spins to her flock. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ya see!? This changes 
                        everythin’! This’s just the 
                        dynamite our losin’ battle needs! 

           Zeke’s shaking his head no, TUGGING at the hair on his head--

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Surely folks’ll wanna save the 
                        Fallen when they realize they us. I 
                        mean, killin’ the Fallen’ll mean 
                        killin’ ya brothas, ya sistas! Ya 
                        daddys, ya mamas!

           Maisie strokes Dorothy’s arm for attention--

                                 MAISIE
                             (Pointing to Fallen Mama)
                        This my Mama? This really my Mama? 

           Dorothy glances down at Maisie... she studies the crying 
           Fallen Mama, who is still in awe of the stewing Zeke. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ya know, Maisie, I s’pose it is. 
                        Yes. This ya Mama. 

           This ignites a new torrent of tears from Maisie, but with it, 
           a cheek-splitting grin. 

           Zeke meanwhile is DISGUSTED by Fallen Mama, Fallen Maisie, 
           both of whom are inching closer and closer to him, hovering 
           their fingers out in attempts to touch him--

                                 ZEKE
                        GET AWAY!

           Zeke BATS their hands away wildly. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Zeke! Zeke! Take ya some breaths! 
                        Look--
           Dorothy approaches Zeke cautiously, gesturing to the Fallen 
           Maisie and Mama. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        They just as happy ta see you as 
                        y’all are to see ya Mama again, 
                        look-- they musta lost their Zeke. 

           Fallen Maisie extends a clump of black curly HAIR, held 
           together by a worn strand of blue yarn. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        See? 

                                 ZEKE
                        I ain’t their Zeke! I ain’t their 
                        anythin’! 

           Zeke is overwhelmed, hyperventilating as he bursts: 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon Maisie! 

           Zeke grapples onto Maisie’s bicep and drags her down the 
           road. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Wait!

           Maisie jams her feet into the gravel to stop Zeke from 
           carrying her away--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        We ain’t leavin’ Skinny! Or Mama! 

           Skinny’s crying after Maisie--

                          SKINNY
                                                          ZEKE
           Peh, dak!!
                                              That ain’t ya Mama!

                          MAISIE
                                                      ZEKE (CONT'D)
           Zeke--!
                                              It ain’t Mama!

                                 DOROTHY
                             (calling after Zeke)
                        Hey! Ya can’t leave with her, we 
                        need her! 

           Dorothy jogs up to Zeke and snatches Maisie’s other arm. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                             (gesturing to both 
                              Maisies)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        We gotta show these two ta everyone 
                        at the rally tomorrow-- prove the 
                        Fallen really are us, prove why we 
                        gotta save they lives! 

           Zeke halts and drops Maisie’s arm. He’s boiled over-- 
           SMACKING his fist against his chest for emphasis as he 
           declares: 

                                 ZEKE
                        The Fallen holdin’ us back, can’t 
                        ya see that? ‘Fore they come we was 
                        fightin’ for our rights! Black 
                        rights! And we was winnin’! They 
                        here, now we fightin’ for their 
                        rights?! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s the same thing! 

           Dorothy brought to frustrated tears--

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        It’s the same thing, it’s always 
                        been the same damn thing! It’s 
                        white folks thinkin’ like you that 
                        pushed us Black folks down in the 
                        first place! 

           Zeke and Dorothy in a tense stand-off, Zeke’s eyes flashing 
           with tears and anger...

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Now c’mon, we gotta get ta the 
                        sanctuary quick as we can--

                                 ZEKE
                        We ain’t goin’-- 

           Zeke turns to stalk down the road once more. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon Maisie, I mean it! 

                                 MAISIE
                        Zeke, we gotta help ‘em! 

                                 ZEKE
                        No we don’t gotta, we gotta take 
                        care-a ourselves. Helpin’ ‘em’s 
                        what got our Mama ‘n Rebecca 
                        killed. 

           Maisie is visibly hurt by his words, her tears intensifying. 
                                 MAISIE
                        It ain’t Fallen’s fault Zeke, it’s-- 
                        it’s my fault. I let it slip in 
                        town that the boys was at our house-
                        - don’t blame Skinny no more!

           And Maisie can’t keep talking because of her crying. 

           Zeke’s heart breaks at the sight of Maisie’s sorrow. He 
           backtracks to her, pulls her into a hug. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Shhh, it ain’t ya fault, Maise. 
                        It’s Mama’s fault-- she shouldn’t-a 
                        kept ‘em at our house--

                                 MAISIE
                        No, Mama’s just tryin’ ta help ‘em, 
                        ‘n I gave us away! 

                                 ZEKE
                        Maisie--

           Zeke SIGHS, a new weight pulling shoulders down.

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t ya fault, ya hearin’ me? 
                        I-- I told ‘em ‘bout the boys at 
                        our house. 

           Maisie looks up at Zeke, utterly puzzled. 

                                 MAISIE
                        What? 

                                 ZEKE
                             (tearful)
                        When I went ta the protest I told 
                        some-a the boys ta take the Fallen 
                        away from our house. I... I never 
                        thought they’d do it the way they 
                        did-- they been my friends ‘fore... 
                        never thought they’d get those 
                        white men ta do it...

           Maisie’s SHOCKED as she realizes the gravity of Zeke’s 
           confession...

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        But see, it ain’t ya fault, so you 
                        can stop worryin’ ‘bout that. 

           She SHOVES Zeke away from her. 
                                 MAISIE
                        Why would ya do that!? 

                                 ZEKE
                        I was tryna protect us! You’re 
                        gonna understand it when ya older--

                                 MAISIE
                        I’m plenty old!

           Maisie STALKS back toward Skinny. Zeke dons an earnest tone: 

                                 ZEKE
                        C’mon Maisie, we goin’ ta Mobile 
                        now, we’ll be with our Daddy--

                                 MAISIE
                        I don’t wanna see Daddy, I hate 
                        Daddy! 

                                 ZEKE
                        Well, you’ll be with me. 

                                 MAISIE
                        I don’t wanna be with you, ya 
                        killed our Mama! 

           It’s as if this punched Zeke in the gut. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        ‘N ya killed our sister! I don’t 
                        wanna see ya! Ever again! 

           He bubbles with tears before he turns and walks down the 
           road. 

                                 ZEKE
                             (warning)
                        I’m leavin’ without ya then--

                                 MAISIE
                        Fine! 

           Maisie smears tears away from her cheeks, rooted to her spot. 
           When she doesn’t follow, Zeke turns back to her. 

                                 ZEKE
                        C’mon!

           Maisie bellows with all of her might: 

                                 MAISIE
                        LEAVE! 
           Zeke broken. 

           Fallen Mama and Fallen Maisie start to head after Zeke, but 
           Dorothy holds them back gently by their shoulders. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Get in the truck, Maisie.

           Dorothy looks down at Maisie, who’s quivering with tears. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, now. We gonna fix it 
                        all.  

           Maisie nods at her. 

           Defeated, Zeke slowly turns and heads down the path.

           EXT. TRUCK BED - LATER

           Inside the truck cab, Dorothy and Fallen Mama Delilah sit 
           side-by-side. 

           In the back of the truck, amongst the cargo, both Maisies and 
           Skinny curl up against the sideboards. 

           Skinny and Fallen Maisie chatter nonstop in their language: 

                                 SKINNY
                        Wehka badah faz, wehka kepah sin 
                        faz--

                                 FALLEN MAISIE
                        Sin wehka badah, wehka kepah faz, 
                        wehka tadah pa weni vivi prozleh. 

                                 SKINNY
                        Vivi weh prozleh... sepa wehka eesa 
                        faz...

                                 FALLEN MAISIE
                        Weh uzad, weh uzad... 

           Maisie can’t tear her eyes away from her duplicate self. She 
           tilts her head as she inspects all of Fallen Maisie’s 
           features, her movements.  

           Maisie’s pulled out of her trance when the truck slows, and 
           Dorothy cranes her neck out of the window:

                                 DOROTHY
                             (shouting back at them)
                        We goin’ off road, hold tight! 
           EXT. OFF ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The truck bounces along a strip of land that can barely be 
           described as a road.

           Maisie, Skinny, and Fallen Maisie jostle in their seats, 
           peering out at passing thick forests and marshes. 

           The truck slows... and stops. 

           It idles loudly at a gaping opening in the trees. Dorothy 
           CREAKS open her door and hops out. 

                                 DOROTHY (O.S.)
                             (under breath)
                        Lord...

           Maisie wrinkles her nose, glancing at Skinny and Fallen 
           Maisie who cover their faces from a nasty smell. 

                                 MAISIE
                        What’s that smell? 

           Maisie leans over the sideboard of the truck bed toward 
           Dorothy--

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, what’s that--?

           Maisie stops short when she spots Dorothy: crumpled by a DEAD 
           BODY-- human (non-Fallen) and Black. 

           BLOOD pools around the gunshot wound in his head. FLIES 
           buzzing in the heat around its bloated belly. 

           And Dorothy is weeping. 

           Maisie GASPS and returns to the other side of the truck to 
           see what lies on that side--

           ANOTHER DEAD BODY. 

           This one a White human (non-Fallen)-- lain out and shot, 
           rotting in the sun. 

           Maisie can’t tear her eyes away from its shattered skull. 

           Dorothy collects herself and rises from the bloodied grass. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 
                                 DOROTHY
                        Looks like this sanctuary’s been 
                        found out... 

           Maisie concerned...

                                 MAISIE
                        What’s that mean?

           Dorothy doesn’t answer as she treads back to the truck. 

           Dorothy SLAMS her car door as she resumes her position in the 
           driver’s seat. 

           The truck bumps as it moves forward into the opening in the 
           forest. All three kids in the truck bed unable to remove 
           their eyes from the pair of dead bodies that once guarded it. 

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The truck carefully traverses this unbeaten path. 

           Low-hanging trees tickle the top of the cab and stretch their 
           branches toward Maisie, Fallen Maisie, and Skinny. 

           The kids seal their hands over their noses from the putrid 
           smell overtaking them. 

           None of them utter a word. 

           All struggle to keep their balance as the truck climbs what 
           seem like speed bumps. 

           Maisie peeks over the truck to see that the road ahead is 
           lined intermittently with DEAD PEOPLE. 

           Some in human clothes, some in Fallen clothes, some Black, 
           some White, one in KKK garb, his mask has slipped off his 
           head to reveal a WHITE TEENAGER beneath. 

           Tears collect in Maisie’s eyes.

           EXT. UNDERGROUND RAILROAD SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS

           Their truck BURSTS into a large clearing where lines and 
           lines of tents make up a REFUGEE CAMP. 

           But more of the same: DEAD BODIES and an eerie QUIET. 

           Dorothy cuts the engine and clamors out, now frantic: 
                                 DOROTHY
                        LILY! 

           Maisie, Skinny, and Fallen Maisie stand on tip-toes in the 
           truck bed to take in the full scene before them. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        LILY!

           Dorothy’s like a caged animal, stalking the trampled grass 
           before her. 

           Maisie WHIPS her head to catch some motion--

           A few FALLEN PEOPLE emerge cautiously from one tent. 

           And then from another tent--

           Two more FALLEN PEOPLE appear. 

           The camp stirs with a few SURVIVORS. 

           But Dorothy pays them no mind, her entire being in a full 
           panic-mode. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        LILY! 

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mama! 

           Dorothy’s face dawns with hope. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Lily? Come here baby! 

           A weary young woman, LILY (20s, black), round-faced with 
           innocence, crawls out from a tent and stumbles up to Dorothy. 

           Dorothy encases her in an embrace, weeping with relief. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank God! 

           Lily breaks down SOBBING. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           Lily severs the hug, attempting poorly to collect herself. 
                                 LILY
                        Big group-a men came ‘n attacked 
                        last night-- not just white men, 
                        black ones too. Went ‘round 
                        shootin’ ‘n cuttin’ people-- Fallen 
                        people and the folks workin’ the 
                        camp. Some-a us tried ta fight back 
                        but it-- it was a surprise. 

           Dorothy STUNNED by this news. Lily dissolves with every word. 

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        We tried ta clear up the dead 
                        bodies this mornin’ ‘fore it 
                        started reekin’ but then lotta the 
                        sanctuary leaders startin’ givin’ 
                        up ‘n headin’ home or over ta the 
                        Mobile sanctuary, since this one’s 
                        been compromised. Think I’m the 
                        only one-a us left here. ‘N Mama, 
                        they killed Isaiah--

           Lily sucks in a shaky breath.

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s okay, child, it’s okay--

           But Lily is beside herself.

                                 LILY
                        All the Fallen’s comin’ up ta me 
                        with they hurt family, like I gotta 
                        way ta fix ‘em! One-a ‘em’s got a 
                        lil baby with its face all cut up! 
                        ‘N I can’t do nothin’, Mama-- think 
                        if those men come back-- we best be 
                        gone when they do-- I was just 
                        waitin’ here for ya, prayin’ ya 
                        didn’t meet ‘em ‘fore ya got here--

           Dorothy smothers Lily in another hug to comfort her. But Lily 
           continues her breakdown: 

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        We gotta get home, Mama, I can’t do 
                        this no more, I’m done with this! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I know, honey, I know. But listen 
                        ta me, shhh-- listen--

           Lily quiets at Dorothy’s calming tones. 
                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I got some big news for ya, ‘s 
                        gonna change everythin’. See them 
                        girls over there? 

           Dorothy points over at Maisie, beckoning the three kids and 
           Fallen Mama over to where Dorothy and Lily converse. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        One-a them’s human, one-a them’s 
                        Fallen... they proof, ya 
                        understand? 

           Lily casts a fleeting glance over the two Maisies, but she’s 
           unimpressed, still deflated. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Lily? These Fallen ain’t some other 
                        world bein’s, they humans. Okay? 
                        They us. Like they been sayin’. If 
                        Congress votes ta kill ‘em all 
                        tomorrow, they’ll be killin’ off 
                        our brothers and sisters and-- and-- 
                        selves! 

           Lily continues to appear unenthused. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        This gonna change everythin’, this 
                        gonna sway the vote. Now we must 
                        get ‘em over ta the Mobile 
                        sanctuary ta see Dr.--

                                 LILY
                        Mama, ya don’t get it. 

           This halts Dorothy...

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        People don’t care what Fallen are. 
                        People just came in here and shot 
                        up bunch-a folks they knew for fact 
                        was people. Hell, people been 
                        stringin’ us up ‘n puttin’ us in 
                        chains when they knew full well we 
                        was humans too. People only care 
                        ‘bout theyselves, and it’s easier 
                        for many-a us if there just ain’t 
                        no Fallen. 

           Dorothy is shocked by Lily’s response. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        No... no, folks’ll care, you’ll 
                        see...

                                 LILY
                        No they ain’t gonna care, Mama--

                          DOROTHY
           They sure will, now c’mon we 
           gotta get ‘em ta the Mobile 
           sanctuary-- Lily--
                                                      LILY (CONT'D)
                                              People’re evil, why’s it so 
                                              hard for ya ta believe that? 
                                              Just ‘cause it’s a tough pill 
                                              ta swallow? 

           Dorothy SIGHS, doubt crossing her features. 

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        I’m goin’ home. Time ta worry ‘bout 
                        just us, ‘n Seymore ‘n Jeb. 

           Lily moves toward the truck. Maisie watches on nervously...

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        Ya comin’ with me, or what? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        We gotta get ‘em ta the sanctuary--

           Lily wrenches the driver’s door open and climbs in as Dorothy 
           approaches her at full speed. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                             (stern)
                        Hey! Lillian Regina Gunn--

           Dorothy holds the driver’s door open. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Look, okay, why don’t ya go take 
                        care-a ya brothers, I’ll meet up 
                        with ya after I get these two ta 
                        the sanctuary? 

                                 LILY
                        Mama, why ya gonna put yaself at 
                        risk when it ain’t gonna change 
                        nothin’? Gonna end up gettin’ 
                        yaself killed, ‘n for what? So me 
                        ‘n the boys ain’t got nobody? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        This’s bigger than our family, this 
                        for many families. 

           Lily’s eyes brim with tears. Dorothy softens her tone. 
                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I love ya, more than Noah loved the 
                        damned ark. Ya know that. But I 
                        also got a mind like a mule, ‘n 
                        it’s set on bein’ Superman. 

           Lily is miserable, tight-lipped, as she finishes SHUTTING the 
           truck door. She turns the ignition. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll come home once this vote’s 
                        over, okay? 

           Dorothy’s lip trembles. She watches Lily back the truck out. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                             (calling)
                        Mama loves ya!

           Lily waves half-heartedly back at her Mama. 

           Maisie looks to Dorothy expectantly as the truck vanishes in 
           the thicket of trees. 

           And for a moment, as Dorothy slumps her shoulders and gives 
           in to a single tear, it looks as though Dorothy has given up. 

           But then Dorothy SNIFFS, fights to contain her emotions when 
           she turns to Maisie. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, we gotta get ta the next 
                        sanctuary, lickety-split. 

           Maisie studies Dorothy’s passionate face with anxiety. 

                                 MAISIE
                        They ain’t gonna care ‘bout Fallen 
                        bein’ us? 

           Dorothy crouches down to Maisie, boring her eyes into 
           Maisie’s. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        There’s a very important man there, 
                        gonna give a big speech ‘fore the 
                        vote tomorrow. Whole world needs ta 
                        see you two so they know what’s at 
                        stake. Then we’ll see if they care.

                                 MAISIE
                        How we gonna get there? 

           Dorothy’s face grows dark. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        We gotta get through Mobile 
                        tonight. 

           INT. CAMP TENT - DUSK

           Dorothy PULLS A SHOE off of a corpse’s stiff foot. 

           With wrinkled nose, she hands it to Fallen Mama. 

           Fallen Mama and Fallen Maisie finish donning human clothes.  
           Now it is difficult to tell the two Maisie’s apart. 

           Maisie’s eyes are glued to her double. 

           Dorothy surveys her handiwork, nodding approvingly. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        There we are. Now ya human. 

           EXT. MOBILE CITY LIMITS - DUSK

           Maisie trails behind Dorothy, Skinny, Fallen Mama, and Fallen 
           Maisie. They march along an under-developed road that hugs 
           the coastline. 

           The sun is beginning to set in the distance. 

           Their caravan passes a large sign one-by-one, slowing to a 
           stop beside it: A MOBILE CITY LIMITS SIGN. 

           Maisie squints out at the forboding city as another FALLEN 
           CAPSULE plummets down in the distance over the city and 
           SMASHES to the ground with a distant BOOM. 

           Dorothy isn’t encouraged by this. She pulls Maisie in close--

                                 DOROTHY
                        How much ya know ya way ‘round 
                        Mobile? 

           Maisie shrugs. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Only ever been with Mama ta see 
                        Daddy off ta Vietnam. 

           Dorothy SIGHS impatiently, glancing out over the city. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        Alright then, listen close. 
                        Sanctuary’s on the other side, 
                        fastest way’s straight through the 
                        middle. 

           She illustrates by tracing lines over the city beyond. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        We gonna take this road up through 
                        ‘til it comes ta a T, then we gonna 
                        keep goin’ straight inta the 
                        alleyway-- ya listenin’?

                                 MAISIE
                        I can’t ‘member all this! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ya have to, Maisie, pay attention. 
                        Ya smart, aren’t ya?  

           Maisie gingerly nods...

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. Now ya gotta learn 
                        this case we get separated. No 
                        matter what, you ‘n the other 
                        Maisie gotta get ta this sanctuary, 
                        even if it means ya gotta leave the 
                        rest-a us behind. Ya understand 
                        that, don’t ya? 

           Maisie nods once more. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now like I said, we take this 
                        road, straight through the T into 
                        the alley, through the main square, 
                        ‘n straight back until the city 
                        disappears, ‘n it’s just country. 
                        Ya gonna see an old burnt church, 
                        ya go back behind it on the trail, 
                        that’s how ya gonna find the 
                        sanctuary.

           Maisie musses her face in concentration, but doesn’t look 
           secure in her knowledge. Dorothy SIGHS. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I’ll repeat it ‘til ya face 
                        turn blue. Just ‘member this: if ya 
                        get there without me, ask for Dr. 
                        King. Can ya ‘member that? Say it 
                        back ta me now. 
                                 MAISIE
                             (surely)
                        Dr. King. 

           Dorothy smiles faintly. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        That’s it. Now c’mon. 

           Dorothy glances over her shoulder at Maisie, Skinny, Fallen 
           Mama, Fallen Maisie, gesturing for them all to hold hands. 

           Maisie links hands with Skinny and Fallen Maisie--

           They all look to each other in anticipation before--

           EXT. MOBILE ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           Maisie JOGS to keep up in the dark, following Skinny as 
           closely as she can. 

           Skinny PANTS shallowly, glances behind his shoulder 
           intermittently to check on Maisie. 

           Fallen Maisie and Fallen Mama rush ahead, Dorothy leading the 
           way down a thin, bleak city alleyway. 

           The group hustles as quietly as they can through the darkened 
           alley before stopping short and pressing against the brick 
           wall where the alley intersects the main street. 

           In the distance, they can hear the ROAR of a large crowd, the 
           CRACKLE of a fire burning. 

           But the alley is still far enough away that they can also 
           hear their collective belabored BREATHING. 

           The tension in everyone’s mannerisms, the bullet pockmarks in 
           the walls, the lack of street lamps and distant GUNFIRE all 
           give an atmosphere of a WAR ZONE. 

           SHARP footfalls catch their attention, coming from behind 
           them in the dark. 

           The all look back, gathering together into a clump in fear--

           And from the darkness: A RUNNING SOLDIER in an American Army 
           Uniform and toting a GUN sprints by. 

           He doesn’t even look at them as he passes, doesn’t even slow 
           as he continues down the alley. 
           Maisie’s PANTING, frightened. She peers down to see-- Skinny 
           is holding her hand.  

           Maisie steadies her breathing-- in and out, in and out. 

           Everyone in their crew holding hands again as Dorothy hisses 
           back at them from the front:

                                 DOROTHY
                        Stay close! 

           And they go darting into the--

           EXT. MOBILE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Their hands linking them together, the group DASHES down the 
           sidewalks, passing smashed storefront windows, bullet-ridden 
           walls, and boarded up doorways. 

           A FALLEN CAPSULE is encased in the asphalt where it crash-
           landed in the middle of a street. 

           Maisie and Skinny can’t tear their eyes away from  the pool 
           of BLOOD that remains underneath the capsule’s open doorway. 

           The sounds of RIOTS increase in volume, they are rushing 
           RIGHT TOWARD THEM-- toward another intersection--

           EXT. MOBILE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy skids them to a stop at the threshold of the major 
           street with a GASP. 

                                 DOROTHY
                             (mutter)
                        Good Lord...

           Here: 

           - RIOTERS breaking things in the street

           - PEOPLE with protests signs CHANTING at the top of their 
           lungs -- some in favor of Fallen, some against, some simply 
           questioning God in all of this

           - SOLDIERS with RIOT GEAR holding people at bay 

           - A FAMILY clutching their belongings in bags, snaking 
           between the crowd to escape town

           - FIRES burning in the streets
           - LOOTERS emerging from broken storefronts with food in their 
           arms  

           PANDEMONIUM. 

           Maisie’s eyes shine with fear as she takes everything in 
           before her. 

           Something catches her eye--

           Someone is hanging an EFFIGY high above the crowd, its 
           stuffed body waving from a rope. 

           Maisie is transfixed by it-- can’t rip her pupils away-- the 
           body’s swaying resembling what she saw last of her Mama--

           Tears prick her eyes. 

           A MEGAPHONE blares out orders from somewhere along the 
           perimeter:

                                 MEGAPHONE (O.S.)
                        IT IS PAST CURFEW, CITIZENS IN THE 
                        STREET WILL BE ARRESTED! RETURN TO 
                        YOUR HOMES! CITIZENS IN THE STREET 
                        WILL BE ARRESTED! 

           Dorothy takes in the horrific scene before her, 
           calculating... She sucks in the deepest breath possible 
           before giving orders: 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well we come too far to head back 
                        now! Let’s go!

           And the whole lot of them-- Dorothy, Maisie, Skinny, Fallen 
           Maisie, Fallen Mama -- launch into the mayhem at full speed. 

           Skinny struggles to keep up, but Maisie CLAMPS her hand onto 
           his. They weave between protesters, get jostled and shoved at 
           every turn while trying to keep hands locked. 

           GUNSHOTS ring out nearby, coupled with a blood-curdling 
           SHRIEK. Skinny, Maisie, and Fallen Maisie COWER from the 
           shots, all brimming with tears. 

           Maisie’s vision blurs from the hot tears, and she stumbles 
           over her feet. 

           Maisie TRIPS and FALLS to the ground, scraping her knee.   

                                 MAISIE
                        AHH!
           Fallen Mama kneels by Maisie’s side, inspecting her wound. 
           She circles a protective arm around Maisie. 

           Dorothy HALTS and looks back at Maisie and Fallen Mama--

                                 DOROTHY
                        GET UP! Maisie, stand up! 

           BUT--

           Another few gunshots SNAP into the crowd-- BAM! BAM! BAM! -- 
           and blood SPIKES from Dorothy’s chest as she is hit from 
           behind by a bullet. 

           Her face slacks in shock. Her blood speckles the rest of 
           their faces. 

           And she THUDS to the pavement. 

           Maisie SCREAMS! 

           She drags herself up to Dorothy lain out on the street, but 
           it’s no use. 

           Dorothy is completely MOTIONLESS. 

           Maisie SOBS, looking around at all of the CHAOS from her seat 
           on the ground. 

           A SOLDIER nearby RINGS out a few more shots, hollering:

                                 SOLDIER #1 
                             (Southern accent)
                        GET THE FUCK BACK INSIDE! 

           A stampede of feet all around Maisie. 

           And tearful Skinny, Fallen Maisie, Fallen Mama all look 
           expectantly to Maisie for what to do next... 

           Maisie stares back at their anticipative faces... realizing 
           they are counting on her... 

           She surveys her surroundings dizzyingly... 

           Setting her jaw firmly. 

           And Maisie PULLS herself up. She LOCKS hands with Skinny and 
           Fallen Maisie again. 

                                 MAISIE
                        COME ON!

           Maisie pushes them all forward. 
           EXT. MOBILE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           As they reach the other side of the block, they face: 

           A LINE OF SOLDIERS IN RIOT GEAR. 

           They’re walling off the side streets, along the entire length 
           of the main thoroughfare. 

           Maisie and the group trapped on this hellish street. 

           Maisie YELLS in despair upon realizing this. She spins 
           around, clocks the utter mayhem behind them, and now they’re 
           trapped like a school of fish. 

           Maisie not sure where to go...

           We move up, up, up, high over the crowd--

           From above: they are lost in a giant writhing mass of people. 

           The SOLDIERS use a loudspeaker to BARK at the crowd: 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        FINAL WARNING! Past curfew! 
                        Citizens will be arrested! 

           And then, from behind the line of soldiers, they UNLEASH 
           powerful jets of water from fire hoses into the spiraling 
           crowd--

           PUSH back down to--

           EXT. MOBILE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Smack dab in the middle of the crowd: Maisie, Fallen Maisie, 
           Skinny are huddled behind Fallen Mama Delilah, jets of water 
           TACKLING people around them.  

           The SPRAY from the hoses soaks them, obscures their vision. 

           Maisie motions for everyone to follow her as she forges a 
           path parallel to the line of soldiers. 

           A FLASH and BANG-- a smoke grenade causes the kids to SCREAM!

           The air blooms with thick SMOKE. 

           Maisie, Fallen Maisie, Skinny CLING to each other, stick 
           close to Fallen Mama. 

           Fallen Mama struggles to pull them through the crowd. 
           Then, a rising THUNDER of STOMPING--

           A chorus of SCREAMS! Rising RABBLE. 

           And through the fog, the riot soldiers emerge, charging into 
           the crowd with shields and batons. 

           Maisie watches with horror as a SOLDIER begins viciously 
           BEATING a young BLACK MAN (20s) on the ground, the fog 
           swirling about them. 

           Maisie turns her head and catches another SOLDIER holding a 
           crying WHITE COUPLE with suitcases at gunpoint. 

           When Maisie turns her attention back forward, she hears the 
           CRACK of gunshots exploding nearby. And--

                                 SKINNY
                        AHHH! 

           Two SOLDIERS corner Skinny, Fallen Maisie, Fallen Mama--

                                 SOLDIER #3 
                        SPEAK!!! 

           Their guns raised, AIMED at Skinny, Fallen Mama. 

                                 SOLDIER #4 
                        SAY SOMETHIN’! 

           Soldier #4 JABS his gun at Fallen Mama, who YELPS! 

                                 MAISIE
                        Stop! 

           Maisie rushes up to the SOLDIERS, HANGING on one’s GUN. 

                                 FALLEN MAMA
                             (to Maisie)
                        Dak! Fasi Vahs!  

                                 SOLDIER #3
                        They Fallen! Round ‘em up! 

                                 MAISIE
                        NO!

           The Soldiers SHOVE Skinny, Fallen Maisie, Fallen Mama toward 
           an idling truck, one that would normally hold livestock in 
           the bed. 

           More soldiers round up Fallen people in the back of the 
           truck, but the Fallen SQUIRM and WRESTLE in an attempt to 
           escape the truck bed. 
           A SOLDIER by the gate of the truck FIRES his gun into it-- a 
           few FALLEN collapsing dead in the center. 

           The remaining Fallen scared, backing into the truck. 

           Maisie attempts to follow after Skinny, Fallen Maisie, Fallen 
           Mama, but the Soldier shepherding them BATS her back to the 
           ground. 

           Maisie watches helplessly as they get herded into the truck, 
           her mouth AGAPE as she cries, all alone.

           The world around her MUTING as she SCREECHES: 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        MAMA! 

           Watching Fallen Mama being TAKEN AWAY from her-- 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                             (sobbing)
                        Mama...

           Maisie curling up in defeat...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Maisie! 

           Maisie raises her head at hearing her name. Circles her gaze 
           around to seek out--

           ZEKE. 

           Kneeling by her side. Holding a protest sign by his side, 
           blood spattered across his face from a nasty beating. 

                                 MAISIE
                        ZEKE!

           Maisie THROWS herself at Zeke, CLINGS onto him, SOBBING. Zeke 
           breaks down too-- holds her tightly to his broad chest. 

           Maisie pulls herself away hastily, JABBING a finger at the 
           truck where Skinny, Fallen Mama, Fallen Maisie have been 
           detained. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Help! 

           Zeke calculates the situation, Maisie TUGGING on his 
           shoulder. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Zeke! Please, help ‘em! Save ‘em! 
           Zeke’s eyes filling with tears, but the rest of his 
           expression remaining stoic. 

           Zeke grits his teeth. Abandons his protest sign on the ground 
           beside Maisie as he rises up. 

           Zeke sucks in a MAJOR breath before he CHARGES at the soldier 
           guarding the back of the truck. 

           Zeke crouches low before TACKLING the soldier to the ground.  

           The soldier collapses to the asphalt, but twists immediately 
           to wrestle with Zeke. They LOCK into a battle, both gripping 
           the soldier’s gun wedged between their two bodies.  

           A handful of the Fallen in the truck, including Skinny, 
           Fallen Maisie, Fallen Mama, take advantage-- JUMP out of the 
           back and into the crowd. 

           Maisie watching Zeke’s fight with the soldier in terror. 

           Finally, Zeke gains control of the gun from the soldier, and--

           Zeke SHOOTS the soldier in the chest. 

           The soldier’s head slacks, greets the pavement. 

           Zeke’s shaking... leans back... stunned by what he has just 
           done. 

           He glances back at Maisie, huddled with Skinny, Fallen Mama, 
           Fallen Maisie. 

           His lips slowly parting before he BELLOWS: 

                                 ZEKE
                        GO! 

           CRACK! A bullet pierces Zeke’s head--

           He crumples to the ground. 

           Maisie SHRIEKS! 

           Maisie, Fallen Mama, Fallen Maisie, all break down at the 
           sight of Zeke’s corpse. 

           But Skinny stands. 

           He reaches down, links hands with the Maisies and yanks them 
           up from the ground. 

           Fallen Mama follows suit, trembling with weeping. 
           And SKINNY forges them all forward. 

           Maisie catches a last glimpse of Zeke before turning to 
           follow Skinny. 

           BANG! BANG! 

           Maisie, Skinny, Fallen Mama, Fallen Maisie, all crouch to the 
           ground at another round of gunshots. 

           And they all scuttle through the swarm of people, crawling 
           amongst running legs and dropped bodies. 

           EXT. MOBILE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Maisie JOGS down the city streets toward where the line of 
           soldiers had burst forth. 

           Everyone PANTS to keep up, all linking hands to stick 
           together in the masses. 

           And as they sprint, Maisie glares back at the mass of people, 
           the intermittent individuals who break free, and the cloud of 
           smoke looming about it all. 

           Tears stream down her face, but the CHAOS seems to be behind 
           them. 

           And when Maisie returns her gaze ahead of them, she can see 
           the streets have cleared up ahead. 

           Skinny, right in front of her, turns and catches her 
           sorrowful expression. 

           He GRIPS her hand tighter. NODS at her. 

           Before turning his head back to the path ahead. 

           EXT. MOBILE CITY LIMITS - NIGHT

           The three kids TRUDGE after Fallen Mama Delilah as they exit 
           the city. 

           The kids SNIVELING with abandon, their tears still leaking 
           onto their cheeks. 

           Maisie pauses to look back at the city. Behind them, the city 
           is dark, dotted with a few fires. 

           Fallen Maisie tugs on her shoulder. 

           The two Maisies face each other. 
           Fallen Maisie offers the hunk of hair wrapped in blue yarn. 
           Maisie inspects it, recognition dawning. 

                                 MAISIE
                        This ya Zeke’s hair? 

           She plucks it from Fallen Maisie’s palm. Strokes it with her 
           finger affectionately. 

           Then offers it back to Fallen Maisie. 

           But Fallen Maisie shakes her head no, insists that Maisie 
           keep it. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        For me? Ya sure? 

           Maisie points to herself to demonstrate. Fallen Maisie nods 
           definitively. 

           Maisie is touched. She hugs the hair to her chest. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           Fallen Maisie replies with a soft smile. 

           Fallen Mama wraps her arms around the Maisies, pulling Skinny 
           into the huddle as well. 

           Fallen Mama comforts all of the children in her chest. 

           She HUMS the same tune Mama Delilah had HUMMED to Maisie 
           earlier when she was stitching in the living room. 

           Maisie closes her eyes, absorbing the song fully. 

           And when she opens her eyes again, she turns her face to the 
           left, to look out at the glittering, moonlit ocean. 

           A breeze picks up Maisie’s buoyant hair. 

           EXT. BURNT DOWN CHURCH - NIGHT 

           Maisie leads the way down the pitch-black gravel path. 

           She pauses at the ominous silhouette of the skeleton of a 
           burnt down church. 

                                 MAISIE
                             (whispered)
                        Here!
           She waves Fallen Maisie, Skinny, and Fallen Mama along to 
           skirt behind the demolished church. 

           EXT. WOODED PATH - NIGHT

           The crew stumbles blindly down a dark wooded pathway, roots 
           and shrubs threatening to trip them at every step. 

           Skinny and Fallen Maisie support each other through the 
           obstacle course of a trail. 

           EXT. FALLEN SANCTUARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           The sound of two metal GUNS clanking as they are raised--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who’s there? 

           Maisie, Fallen Maisie, Fallen Mama, and Skinny approach a 
           large gate, guarded by two BLACK MEN holding rifles.  

           Upon seeing the kids, they lower their guns. 

           They smile reassuringly at them. 

                                 BLACK MAN #1 
                        Alright, now, ya come ta the right 
                        place. Any y’all speak English? 

           Maisie raises her hand as she steps forward.  

                                 MAISIE
                        Sir, I gotta speak ta Dr. King. 

           The guard squats to Maisie’s level with a bemused grin. 

                                 BLACK MAN #1
                        And why ya gotta talk ta Dr. King? 

                                 MAISIE
                        ‘Cause I’m human. 

           Maisie points to Fallen Maisie. 

                                 MAISIE (CONT’D)
                        ‘N she’s Fallen. 

           The guard doesn’t understand at first, but soon recognition 
           ignites on his features. 

           Then AWE. 
           He reaches a shaking hand to the walkie talkie on his 
           shoulder.

           BZZT--

           EXT. FALLEN SANCTUARY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The kids and Fallen Mama trek down a makeshift road carved in 
           the foliage, similar to the last Fallen Sanctuary they had 
           visited, escorted by the two guards. 

           The guards can’t fight their fascination, their eyes flitting 
           between the two Maisies. 

           When they reach the threshold of the camp, they come upon 
           rows and rows of tents stretched out in long lines. 

           Maisie scans the area: 

           People with Fallen clothing and people with human clothing 
           mill about. Campfires bring people together, happy chatter 
           babbles, even some singing accents the festivities. 

           The warm atmosphere washes over the crew, encouraging slight 
           smiles from their lips. 

           INT. SANCTUARY ENCAMPMENT - LATER

           The two guards lead the kids and Fallen Mama into a dingy 
           barracks where they are met by a beleaguered TEAM: both black 
           and white folks in respectable clothes.  

           And in the middle of them all: A BLACK REVEREND. 

           A natural charisma, a neatly trimmed mustache, presently 
           sporting a kind smile. 

           REV. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR (36, Black). 

                                 GUARD #1
                             (hushed to Maisie)
                        Dr. King been told ‘bout ya, go on. 

           Maisie is in AWE of Dr. King, remembering him from the news 
           on their old TV set.

           Dr. King approaches Maisie, calmly observing her and Fallen 
           Maisie lined up before him.  

           Finally, Dr. King speaks: 
                                 DR. KING
                        I heard you came a long way to get 
                        here. I heard about your losses and 
                        your sacrifices, and I sure am 
                        sorry to hear them. 

           Maisie looks to Fallen Maisie, then back to Dr. King. Her 
           tone like a challenge: 

                                 MAISIE
                        We wanna help. 

           Maisie retains fierce eye contact with Dr. King. 

           Dr. King smiles, bemused. 

                                 DR. KING
                        Miss, you say it like you’re 
                        picking a fight. 

           Maisie opens her mouth... wrestling with her trembling lip as 
           she speaks through threatening tears. 

                                 MAISIE
                        Dr. King, they’s been people 
                        tellin’ us that we gonna change 
                        everythin’, like we some sort of 
                        magic trick. 
                             (gestures to herself and 
                              Fallen Maisie)
                        Then they’s other people tellin’ us 
                        we ain’t gonna make a lick-a 
                        difference. Sayin’ no matter what 
                        we do, ain’t nobody gonna care. 
                        They just gonna hate ‘em anyway. ‘N 
                        losin’ my family and leavin’ my 
                        home’s all been for nothin’. And if 
                        I’m honest, I’m ‘fraid those folks 
                        might be right. 

           Dr. King nods subtly as he reviews Maisie’s concerns. 

           He bends to meet Maisie at eye-level, this action not 
           patronizing, but equalizing. 

                                 DR. KING
                        I am sorry you’ve had to learn this 
                        lesson so young, and so harshly. 
                        That there has always been, and 
                        will always be, people who give in 
                        to fear and hatred. But similarly, 
                        there has always been, and will 
                        always be, people who resist it. 
           Maisie absorbs his words. 

                                 DR. KING (CONT’D)
                        In my eyes, it is clear to which 
                        class of people you belong. 

           Maisie’s eyes search his face. She nods. 

           EXT. MOBILE RALLY - DAY 

           As far as the eye can see, masses upon masses of PEOPLE 
           gather in the streets to listen to Dr. King speak at the pro-
           Fallen rally. 

           Tears in people’s eyes, absolutely RAPT attention. 

           Dr. King’s voice BOOMS as it is doubled from a microphone and 
           speakers. 

                                 DR. KING 
                        If I were standing at the beginning 
                        of time, with the possibility of 
                        general and panoramic view of the 
                        whole human history up to now, and 
                        the Almighty said to me, "Martin 
                        Luther King, which age would you 
                        like to live in?"— Strangely 
                        enough, I would turn to the 
                        Almighty, and say, "If you allow me 
                        to live just a few years in the 
                        second half of the twentieth 
                        century, I will be happy." Now 
                        that's a strange statement to make, 
                        because the world is all messed up. 
                        The nation is sick. Trouble is in 
                        the land. Confusion all around. 
                        That's a strange statement. But I 
                        know, somehow, that only when it is 
                        dark enough, can you see the stars. 
                        And I see God working in this 
                        period of the twentieth century in 
                        a way that men, in some strange 
                        way, are responding-- something is 
                        happening in our world. The masses 
                        of people are rising up.

           And next to Dr. King at the podium: 

           Maisie, in human clothes, Fallen Maisie, in clean Fallen 
           clothes, side-by-side. 

           Both sporting a look of resolute determination. 
           HOLDING HANDS. 

           CROWD MEMBERS point up to them, cover their mouths in 
           disbelief. 

           People hoisting each other up on their shoulders to get a 
           better look at the two Maisies. 

                                 DR. KING (CONT’D)
                        Some of us who have already begun 
                        to break the silence of the night 
                        have found that the calling to 
                        speak is often a vocation of agony, 
                        but we must speak. We must speak 
                        with all the humility that is 
                        appropriate to our limited vision, 
                        but we must speak. We are called to 
                        speak for the weak, for the 
                        voiceless, for the victims of our 
                        nation, for those it calls "enemy," 
                        for no document from human hands 
                        can make these humans any less our 
                        brothers.

           Maisie surveys the massive crowd with awe. And as they begin 
           to APPLAUD passionately, she hazards a slight SMILE. 

           And now the image fades to BLACK AND WHITE as--

           EXT. MOBILE RALLY - TELEVISION 

           The image of the two Maisie’s transposed onto a television 
           screen-- their connection broadcast to the world. 

                                 DR. KING (V.O.)
                        I refuse to accept the idea that 
                        man is mere flotsom and jetsom in 
                        the river of life unable to 
                        influence the unfolding events 
                        which surround him. 

           Then the news footage swaps to show images of newscasters 
           speculating on the outcome, of Congress casting their votes. 

           Pull out to reveal--

           INT. SANCTUARY ENCAMPMENT - DAY 

           FALLEN and HUMANS together intently watch this footage on a 
           TV in the encampment. 
           Maisie, Skinny, Fallen Maisie, and Fallen Mama in a cluster 
           on the sidelines, peering between people to catch a glimpse 
           of the TV news. 

                                 DR. KING (V.O.)
                        I refuse to accept the view that 
                        mankind is so tragically bound to 
                        the starless midnight of racism and 
                        war that the bright daybreak of 
                        peace and brotherhood can never 
                        become a reality. Let us develop a 
                        kind of dangerous unselfishness. We 
                        are caught in an inescapable 
                        network of mutuality, tied in a 
                        single garment of destiny. Whatever 
                        affects one directly, affects all 
                        indirectly. 

           People clasp hands. 

           People glance at each other in anticipation. 

           One person, head bowed in prayer. 

           Everyone waiting with baited breath as the Newscaster is 
           ready to announce: 

                                 NEWSCASTER VOICE
                        We now have it confirmed: The 
                        Fallen Readjustment Bill has been 
                        voted down with 270 opposed and 265 
                        in favor.

           CHEERS all around! WHOOPING, jumping up and down!

           Tears mingle with the happiness on everyone’s faces; the 
           sacrifices inescapable in this moment of victory. 

           Maisie GRINNING widely at this news before being consumed by 
           a group hug. 

           EXT. FALLEN SANCTUARY - DAWN 

           Maisie curls up against Fallen Mama, both sleeping on a mat. 
           That same sleepy blue hue light as the beginning. 

                                 DR. KING (V.O.)
                        Well, I don't know what will happen 
                        now. We've got some difficult days 
                        ahead. But it doesn't matter with 
                        me now. Because I've been to the 
                        mountaintop. 
           Skinny SHAKES Maisie awake. He and Fallen Maisie coax Maisie 
           to follow them--

           EXT. BEACH - DAWN 

           Skinny scoops up one of the many jellyfish washed up on the 
           shore. He INSTRUCTS Fallen Maisie what to do in their 
           language. 

                                 DR. KING (V.O.)
                        Like anybody, I would like to live 
                        a long life. Longevity has its 
                        place. But I'm not concerned about 
                        that now. He's allowed me to go up 
                        to the mountain. And I've looked 
                        over. And I've seen the promised 
                        land. I may not get there with you. 
                        But I want you to know, that we, as 
                        a people will get there. 

           Maisie watches with a faint smile as Skinny and Fallen Maisie 
           DASH into the ocean with a jellyfish each. 

           Maisie stoops down and plucks her own jellyfish up. Follows 
           after them. 

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           The three kids swim out as far as they can until just their 
           tip toes reach the sand below. 

                                 DR. KING  (V.O.)
                        I still believe that we shall 
                        overcome. 

           Fallen Maisie copies Skinny as he explains to her in their 
           language: they rear their arms back and THROW their jellyfish 
           as far as they can. 

           Maisie chucks hers closely after. 

                                 DR. KING (V.O.)
                        For when people get caught up with 
                        that which is right and they are 
                        willing to sacrifice for it, there 
                        is no stopping point short of 
                        victory.

           All three watch the jellyfish arc into the ocean, the sun 
           beyond just cresting the earth. 
           Skinny and both Maisies, bobbing in the water side-by-side, 
           looking out to the horizon. 

           And on Maisie’s features, a trace of TRIUMPH. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
