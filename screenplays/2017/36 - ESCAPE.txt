          OVER BLACK -- the sound of WAVES crashing and ROPES CREAKING. 
          WRITTEN WORDS crawl across the screen:

          Between 1788 and 1868, the British Empire shipped more than 
          150,000 convicts to penal colonies in Australia and its wild, 
          uncivilized neighbor -- the notoriously brutal TASMANIA. 

          No distinction was made between first-time and repeat offenders. 
          Petty larcenists commonly served with thieves, rapists, murderers. 

          This process was not called imprisonment. 

          It was called TRANSPORTATION.

                                                               MAIN TITLES:

                                    ESCAPE
                                                               FADE IN:

           A SEAGULL pecks at an apple core. PECK. PECK-PECK. The 
           garbage around it STIRS, a sleeping DRUNKARD rolling over--

           EXT. SEEDY PORT CITY - DAWN

           --And our gull TAKES FLIGHT, over this VICTORIAN-ERA PORT 
           CITY. Quiet. Still. Shrouded in morning fog. In the harbor, 
           tall-masted ships CREAK.

           The gull lands on a sign, hanging from a RAMSHACKLE INN. The 
           sign sways a little in the wind. Hinges squeaking. SQUEAKK...

           --TINK. A BAYONET steadies the sign. We TRACK DOWN the blade 
           to a rifle, held by a hard-lived BRITISH SOLDIER. 

           And he has friends. WIDEN to reveal... On roofs, in alleys, 
           aiming rifles, SURROUNDING THE INN -- 40 SOLDIERS. Preparing 
           for a RAID. And whoever, or whatever is inside has the fear 
           of God in every last one of these men. A SUPER appears:

                                  Harbortown, Tasmania. 
                                       June, 1824.

           A pocket-watch OPENS. COMMANDANT JOHN CUTHBERT (50s), scarlet 
           officer’s uniform, stares at it with raw eyes. The glass is 
           cracked. Hands frozen. But Cuthbert holds it like it’s the 
           most precious object he owns. Gently wipes away a RED SMUDGE--  

                                 WHISPERING SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        There’s no escape, sir.
                            (Cuthbert’s eyes flick up)
                        Awaiting your order.

           Cuthbert... gives a SMALL NOD. Three VETERAN SOLDIERS creep 
           towards the inn, silent as ballet dancers. A board CREAKS...

           They RUSH INSIDE. Cuthbert’s eyes fixed now on the inn. A 
           horsefly lands on his cheek. He ignores it. Unblinking. Man, 
           we wish he’d swat that fly. But just as it becomes unbearable--

           SHOUTS from within. GUNSHOTS. SCREAMS. One of the veterans 
           STAGGERS OUT, ON FIRE, and collapses in the street. 

           Soldiers murmur, exchanging glances. But Cuthbert’s unfazed.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Try not to hit any of the whores.

           Guns erupt as 37 soldiers SANDBLAST the inn with musketballs.

           Our seagull flees, squawking, HANGING SIGN splintering until 
           it snaps loose, clattering to the ground.
           INT. INN - MOMENTS LATER

           Glass crunches as Cuthbert leads his men in. Dust clouds the 
           air. A pudgy INNKEEPER cowers under a table. Cuthbert finds a 
           broken gas-lamp at the foot of the stairs; looks up-- 

           To discover the TORN BODIES of his troops. They look mauled. 

           Cuthbert’s gaze hardens, seeing, at the top of the stairs -- 
           A DOOR. Firelight seeps from around its edges.

           INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door CREAKS OPEN, revealing -- a REDHEADED MAN, seated on 
           the bed, his back to us. Compact, sturdy frame. Shirtless. 
           Powerful shoulders covered in tattoos and old flogging scars.

           But oddly, Cuthbert’s eyes dart around the rest of the room.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Where is he? The other.

                                 REDHEADED MAN
                            (head tilts, not turning)
                        So you need me alive for questioning.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Nobody has ever needed you. 

           Cuthbert waves his soldiers forward, when--

                                 REDHEADED MAN
                        --Since you’ve spoken so kindly, 
                        I’ll allow any lad who wishes it to 
                        leave the room now, with a face his 
                        sweetheart will still recognize.

           The soldiers exchange glances. Cuthbert prods them forward, 
           redheaded man not resisting as they work manacles around ONE 
           CHAFED WRIST, reaching for the other, which is when-- 

           THE MAN RISES. 

           And now everything happens very fast:

           A tattooed arm WHIPS AROUND, manacles swinging, BLINDING ONE 
           SOLDIER-- chain encircling another’s throat; a rifle DROPS; 
           the redheaded man’s free hand catches, spins, and FIRES IT-- 
           BLASTING APART a third soldier’s JAW--

           And we still haven’t seen the redheaded man’s FACE as--

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           --He SMASHES through a window, falling TWO STORIES--
           And SLAMS to the cobblestones below, back on his feet with 
           barely a limp, racing around a corner--

           To find NINE MORE SOLDIERS waiting.

           Rifles BURST, a shot carving out a piece of the man’s bicep 
           as he BARRELS into the soldiers like a wild animal, BITING an 
           ear; BOOT-STOMPING a leg; WRENCHING an elbow a way God never 
           meant it to bend, its owner spittle-gasping:

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        --Gahh--

           But MORE SOLDIERS lunge in. Struggling to cuff the man, 
           hiking up pant-legs to reveal ankles ringed in OLD LEG-IRON 
           SCARS, clapping manacles over them. 

           They drag him up, giving us our first good look at his face:

           Mutton-chop sideburns. Cheshire-cat grin. Meet ALEXANDER 
           PEARCE (38). History paints him as a monstrous man, but 
           boisterous and quick to laugh, and some of that spirit should 
           show, even as he breathes hard, smiling with bloody teeth at--

           CUTHBERT, staring down at him through the smashed window.

           INT. GRIM CELL - LATER

           WHAM! Fists pound flesh as a huge soldier tenderizes Pearce, 
           wrists chained to the ceiling, teeth missing, eyes blacked. 

           This has been going on for some time. 

           Cuthbert grabs Pearce by the hair, pulling him close. Softly:

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Where is he? Where is Greenhill?

                                 PEARCE
                        John. I told you. He is inside us. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Answer plainly. Or it goes on.

                                 PEARCE
                        I have. Greenhill is inside you. You 
                        put him there. The moment that pocket-
                        watch stopped. Want him out, you’ll 
                        have to carve out your own heart... 
                        Or spill open my guts -- because 
                        that’s where the rest of him is.

           Cuthbert’s eyes cinch, reading Pearce’s face.

                                 PEARCE
                        I done it before. You know I have.
                                 BRITISH SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        --Sir. We found something. In the 
                        swamps, outside town.

           A soldier displays TORN, BLOODY CLOTHING. Cuthbert finds a 
           grimy WOVEN BRACELET among the rags. Stares at it, boiling--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        No. He’s alive. Greenhill is alive. 
                        And you’re going to give him to me.

           Cuthbert pulls a HOT POKER from a cast-iron furnace. Pearce’s 
           eyes follow the glowing tip as Cuthbert brings it closer...

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Now. Where. Is. Greenhill.

           Cuthbert presses the HOT POKER to PEARCE’S ARMPIT, as we--

                                                               SLAM TO:

           A SHRIEKING STEAM WHISTLE. A white-haired MINE OWNER (60) 
           pulling the cord, frantic eyes darting to-- 

           INT. COAL MINE - MORNING

           A COLLAPSING MINE TUNNEL. Earth and stone crumbles down as 
           soot-faced MINERS scramble for the exit. A beam CRASHES DOWN, 
           pinning a BOY MINER (14). He SQUIRMS, terrified-- 

                                 BOY MINER
                        Someone -- please -- 

           A TALL MINER halts, his back to us. Lean frame, shoulders 
           slick with sweat. On his wrist, a familiar WOVEN BRACELET, 
           now new and clean. He tries to lift the beam. It won’t budge. 
           He grabs a passing miner, BOLGER (30s, buttons straining): 

                        TALL MINER
                                                         BOLGER
           Help me. 
                                                (eyes dart, terrified)
                                              ...To hell with you.

           Bolger stagger-runs off. Our tall miner tries to lift the 
           beam alone, STRAINING-- it faintly INCHES UPWARD--

           EXT. COAL MINE - SAME

           --When the entire mine COLLAPSES. Miners stare, faces ashen.

                                 MINE OWNER
                        Sweet ’Jasus.
                            (removes his cap, eyes wet)
                        Somebody better go tell Sarah.
                                 BOLGER
                        ...I-- I tried to help him, but 
                        there was nothing to be done. 

           Debris stirs, a TALL SILHOUETTE emerging through the dust: 
           Coughing, limping, soot-covered, face streaked in blood, the 
           boy in his arms. Meet ROBERT GREENHILL (30s). Workers swarm:

                                                        GREENHILL
                           MINER
           It’s Greenhill! Water-- get 
           him water!
                                              --No; the boy-- 

           Bolger reddens, meeting Greenhill’s gaze a moment... And 
           grabs the boy, carrying him off. 

                                 BOLGER
                        I got him -- make way, make way.

           Greenhill falls to his knees. LOOKS UP. It’s an honest face; 
           strong, capable. A face you’d trust -- but despite the 
           rainfall, it’s a face that never quite seems to get clean.

           WIDE SHOT: Greenhill sits apart, just a speck, dwarfed by 
           mountains and dark valleys shrouded in mist. SUPER:

                                 County Wicklow, Ireland.
                                   Three Years Earlier.

           INT. ONE-ROOM STONE COTTAGE - DAY

           Teeth clench as Greenhill winces, his FOOT BADLY BRUISED.

                        GREENHILL
           That’s an ankle you’re 
           mending, not a fence post--
                                                          SARAH
                                              --Oh, would you listen to the 
                                              mouth on him. Hold still. 

           SARAH GREENHILL (30) pins a bandage with one hand, INFANT 
           squirming in the other. A stubborn beauty, her hands delicate 
           but worn. Used to hard work.

                                 SARAH
                        If your father could milk a cow 
                        half so well as he milks an injury, 
                        we’d all be swimming in cream.

           COLIN (9) smirks, cutting mold away from a crust of bread.

                                 COLIN
                        You could’ve just kept running. 
                        Nobody would’ve known.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I would have known.

                                 COLIN
                        But what if you’d died?
                                 GREENHILL
                        And if I’d kept running. And lived. 
                        How would I be able to look you in 
                        the eyes when I got home?

           Colin stares at his father. Admires him.

                                 SARAH
                        Ach, Maggie! Down!

           MAGGIE (4) startles, reaching for sunlight in a window. She 
           eyes her mother, carefully climbing down... 

           ...But Greenhill LIFTS her back up into the light. She grins, 
           trying to catch DUST MOTES swirling all around her.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Know what those are, Maggie? 
                        They’re stars. Tiny little ones.

                                 MAGGIE
                        They aren’t really.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ‘Course they are. Be a waste, if 
                        God made a thing so pretty as 
                        stars, then kept them all out of 
                        reach in the sky. They’re all 
                        around us. Whole world’s made up of 
                        them. Even you and me.

                          MAGGIE
           What about Colin?
                                                          COLIN
                                              Ugh. No. I’m made of rocks. 
                                              And fire.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Colin is made of rocks and fire. 
                        But also stars.

           Sarah allows a careworn smile, setting down the baby, as--

                                 SARAH
                        A’right, out, the both of you. 
                        First to scrounge 3 good potatoes 
                        gets an extra spoonful of pie.

           Maggie squeals, running out, Colin chasing her, shouting. 
           Greenhill and Sarah draw closer to each other. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Begging your pardon, miss, but I’ll 
                        be wanting some of that pie too.

                                 SARAH
                        Will you now? How do you take it?
           It’s worth noting here that there are two types of married 
           couples: those who lose their sexual chemistry, and those who 
           do not. These two fall squarely into the latter group.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Soft crust. Firm potatoes.

                                 SARAH
                        Not as firm as they used to be.

                                 GREENHILL
                        It’s a dirty lie. I won’t have you 
                        slandering my wife’s pie.

           And as she smirks and PUSHES HIM out of FRAME we-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A fire smolders. Late night. We drift through the cottage. 
           Children sleep, sharing a cot. In a sagging bed, voices low:

                                 SARAH
                        ...We’re back three months on rent. 
                        One more, we’ll be on the street in 
                        the dead of winter-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m not going to let that happen.

                                 SARAH
                        There’s not a job in the whole of 
                        Ireland. And that mine just put 90 
                        more men out of work-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        It wasn’t the mine. It was me.
                            (Sarah frowns)
                        We’d reached the end of the seam. 
                        The foreman said it was unstable. 
                        But all I could see was you, and 
                        the children, with empty bowls and 
                        empty stomachs. I would’ve dug ‘til 
                        my pick melted in the fires of hell 
                        before I let that happen.

                                 SARAH
                        ...You take too much on yourself. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You know how I lived as a child. I 
                        won’t see this family back there. 

           She studies his face. And believes him, as -- WE HEAR:

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        O ye of little faith. Take heed.
           EXT. WICKLOW, MAIN STREET - DAY (BEGIN MONTAGE)

           Snow falls. Homeless FORMER MINERS look for work on every 
           corner. Greenhill hauls a cart through the slush, wearing an 
           apron with a dry goods merchant insignia. He looks thinner. 

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST  (V.O.)
                        A man's life is not found in the 
                        abundance of things he possesses.

           Greenhill slows, recognizing the miner BOLGER, now in the 
           blue coat of a CONSTABLE, arresting a beggar. 

           INT. WEALTHY MANOR - NIGHT

           Greenhill hauls groceries back and forth into a pantry.

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        A man’s life is more than food; his 
                        body, more than clothing.

           Standing in a doorway, a WEALTHY WOMAN (50s) eyes Greenhill’s 
           patched clothing, his ragged shoes, the wet and grimy 
           footprints in his wake. Her nose wrinkles.

           EXT. DRY-GOODS MERCHANT SHOP, STOREROOM - MORNING

           Greenhill refills his cart. A MERCHANT (60s, hair in his 
           ears) stops him. Gestures to Greenhill’s clothes; shoes--

                                 MERCHANT
                        Forgive me. But our patrons expect 
                        a certain standard of dress. Leave 
                        your cart in the back. 

           He walks off. Greenhill’s face floods with shame. And anger.

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Consider the lilies of the field. 
                        They labour not -- yet even King 
                        Solomon, in all his mighty glory, 
                        was never clothed in such finery.

           The merchant grabs a “FOR HIRE” sign, marching to a window 
           where UNEMPLOYED WORKERS eagerly peer in, the BOY MINER whose 
           life Greenhill saved in front-- 

           --But Greenhill blocks the merchant’s way. Startles him. Rips 
           the sign from his hand. Something almost violent in the act.

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. I’ll come back with proper 
                        attire. By Wednesday next. 
                                 MERCHANT
                        ...Come back with it tomorrow. Or 
                        don’t come back a’tall.

           INT. OLD STONE CHURCH - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON: The lined face of an OLD IRISH PRIEST (60s), in a 
           country church, reading the very SERMON we’ve been hearing:

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST
                        “Consider the sparrows; they 
                        neither sow nor reap, and yet God 
                        feeds them. Does He not love you, 
                        His children, more than sparrows?”

           Greenhill kneels in a pew, hands tightly knit. In turmoil.

           INT. STONE COTTAGE - EVENING

           Sarah ladles out potato stew. Mostly broth. Maggie peers into 
           the pot for more. Empty. Sinks back in her chair. Greenhill 
           stares at her, his heart boiling over with frustration.

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        So reserve no thought for what you 
                        shall eat; neither for your body, 
                        what you shall put on.

           Colin watches his father grab a threadbare coat, walking out.

           EXT. WICKLOW, MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           Greenhill stares into a gas-lit SHOP WINDOW, filled with rows 
           of leather boots. His reflection in the glass, super-imposed 
           over a set of sturdy workman’s clothes.

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Your Father knows you have need of 
                        these things. Endure well this trial, 
                        and you shall receive a treasure in 
                        heaven, which time can never corrupt--

           Greenhill eyes the price tags; looks down at a meager handful 
           of coins. He turns to go -- but STOPS. 

           WIDE SHOT: the street is empty. Greenhill frowns. Alone. 

                                                              BLACKOUT.

                                 OLD IRISH PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Nor thieves break through and steal.

           We hear the sound of GLASS SHATTERING.
           I/E. STONE COTTAGE - NIGHT

           A POUNDING KNOCK. Sarah looks up from nursing the infant. She 
           frowns, pulling open the door to find--

           THREE CONSTABLES outside. Bolger and two officers. He scans 
           Sarah’s thin nightgown. She pulls a shawl around herself. 

                                 BOLGER
                        Your husband in, ma’am?

                                 SARAH
                        In bed, sir. Like any sensible 
                        fellow ought be. I’ll thank you to 
                        be coming back in the morn--

           She tries to shut the door, but Bolger BLOCKS IT WITH HIS 
           TRUNCHEON. Her eyes dart. Greenhill appears behind her. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Sarah. It’s alright. What’s the 
                        trouble, lads?

           The constables part, revealing a figure behind them:

           The BOY MINER whose life Greenhill saved. The boy swallows, 
           meeting Greenhill’s stricken gaze; looks down. Unable even to 
           speak the condemning word.

                                 BOLGER
                        The night is cold, boy. Is it himself 
                        you saw stealing the goods, or no?

                                 BOY MINER
                        It-- it was dark.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Perhaps you have the wrong house.

                                 BOLGER
                        Just to be certain-- search it.

           Sarah blinks as the constables storm past her into the 
           cottage -- but COLIN blocks their way. 

                                 COLIN
                        My father’s no thief. Get out. 

           The constable SHOVES Colin aside; he FALLS--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (steps forward)
                        Easy now, there’s no need to-- 

           WHAM! Bolger’s truncheon DROPS Greenhill to his knees. 
           Bloodying his nose. Maggie SCREAMS.
                                 BOLGER
                        Not so high and mighty now, are we?

           Sarah restrains Greenhill, who watches, seething, as they 
           ransack the cottage, until--

           They find the STOLEN BOOTS AND CLOTHES under Greenhill’s bed.

           Sarah’s eyes close, realizing what’s happened. Colin stares 
           at his father, something seeming to die in his young eyes. 
           Greenhill can’t even look at him. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        It’s just a terrible mistake. I’ll 
                        speak to the shop owner; return the 
                        goods. Pay for the window. You know 
                        me; know my family.

           The other constables exchange glances, softening, but-- 

                                 BOLGER
                            (straightens his uniform)
                        ...Note for the report, the accused 
                        resisted the search. And attempted 
                        to assault an officer of the crown. 

           The constables grab Greenhill, leading him away. He looks 
           back at Sarah, their WORLD CRUMBLING as--

                                 MAGISTRATE (PRE-LAP)
                        You have painted a vivid picture, 
                        Mr. Greenhill, of the hardships your 
                        family has endured these months.

           INT. STONE COURTROOM - MORNING

           PAN OVER a cramped gallery, finding Sarah juggling Maggie and 
           the baby, fighting for a view. Colin stands apart, jaw tight.

           On the dock, unshaven, in prison garb, stands Greenhill.

                                 MAGISTRATE (O.S.)
                        The court should therefore wish to 
                        oblige your request for leniency.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thank you, mi’Lord--

           The MAGISTRATE (70, yellowing wig), folds his bony hands.

                                 MAGISTRATE
                        However.
                            (Greenhill’s heart stops)
                        There are men and women in difficult 
                        circumstances across Ireland. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Should the court fail to make 
                        example of those who disregard the 
                        King’s laws, the whole country could 
                        fall prey to the criminal class.

           Sarah can’t breathe. Already knows what’s coming. 

                                 MAGISTRATE
                        It is therefore ordered by this 
                        court that you, Robert Greenhill, 
                        be transported across the seas, 
                        beyond the seas, to MacQuarie 
                        Harbor Penal Installation of 
                        Tasmania. For the term of 5 years.

           The gavel BANGS. Greenhill’s mind goes down a chasm. Sarah’s 
           eyes close. Onlookers murmur, shocked. Even the boy miner is 
           ashen, in his NEW DRY-GOODS APRON. Bolger appears satisfied.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s five? How many is five?

                                 COLIN
                        ...Longer than you’ve been alive.

           But Greenhill won’t accept it. He edges toward the judge.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I beg mercy; my family will starve. 
                        Will you destroy four innocent 
                        lives over one set of boots?

                                 MAGISTRATE
                        Should destruction be their fate, 
                        the responsible party -- is you.

           Bailiffs grab Greenhill, but something in him seems to SNAP. 
           He makes a WILD LUNGE for his family, REACHING OUT-- a 
           TRUNCHEON swings, BREAKING Greenhill’s arm. Sarah SHRIEKS--

                                                         MAGGIE
                                                (reaching for him)
                           SARAH
           --Don’t hurt him-- please-- 
           Oh God--
                                              Daddy, no-- don’t leave--

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’ll come back-- I’ll find a way; 
                        on my very soul, I’LL COME BACK--

           Greenhill struggles wildly, fingers straining to touch 
           Maggie’s tiny hand-- almost there, when--

           A TRUNCHEON hits Greenhill’s head. His head hits the floor.

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           The sound of WAVES crashing and ROPES CREAKING.
           INT. COLONY TRANSPORT SHIP - NIGHT

           LANTERN LIGHT flickers as we dip in and out of consciousness 
           with Greenhill, deep in the bowels of a FETID SHIP. Grim, 
           BRUTAL FACES loom around us. Cruel eyes. Scarred bodies.

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           LIGHTNING FLASHES. A storm rages. SHOUTS above deck. 
           Greenhill pours sweat; cradles his broken arm, looking down, 
           finding it a swollen, purple mass. The ship PITCHES--

           SLAMMING his arm into a beam. His eyes POP, sucking breaths 
           through his teeth. He tries to stabilize himself; turns--

           --A prisoner with no teeth THROWS UP on him.

                                                              BLACKOUT.

           The sound of prisoners COUGHING. Greenhill’s eyes flutter 
           open, surprised to see his bad arm now in a makeshift SPLINT. 

                                 BILLINGS (O.S.)
                        Miracle, innit? 

           Greenhill turns to find THOM BILLINGS (late 20s) beside him. 
           Shining eyes, wild hair. A buoyant spirit, even in this hell.

                                 BILLINGS
                        You been courting death two weeks, 
                        mate. Was me, got some food down you; 
                        set that boomerang you call an arm.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I... I don’t-- why?

                                 BILLINGS
                        Old habits. Regimental surgeon, in my 
                        former life. Tried to send my unit to 
                        India; told them I took an oath to 
                        protect King-and-Country, not put 
                        down an uprising in someone else’s. 
                            (holds up his manacles)
                        Transportation, 12 years. Left a girl 
                        back home. Molly. Think she’ll wait?

                                 GREENHILL
                        If she has any sense.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Could be a problem. She’s dumb as a 
                        lump of salt. But pretty as a 
                        sunrise so-- comes out on balance.

           A grin. Billings has immediately become Greenhill’s favorite 
           person ever. They exchange nods:
                                 GREENHILL
                        Robert Greenhill. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Thom Billings. What you in for?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Being poor.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Only crime you can commit, just by 
                        being born. Wife, I wager? Wee’uns?

           Greenhill just touches his WOVEN BRACELET. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Want to see ‘em again, we got to 
                        look out for each other. We’re 
                        pickled in with lifers. Bludgers, 
                        rapers. We aren’t careful, we’ll 
                        end up their next victims-- or end 
                        up just like them. They say once 
                        you go to Tasmania, you never go 
                        home again. Not really. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m going home.

           And off Greenhill’s QUIET DETERMINATION--

           EXT. COLONY TRANSPORT SHIP - MORNING (WEEKS LATER)

           A BELL CLANGS as prisoners are marched on-deck. Greenhill, 
           scraggly beard, flinches from the sun. SPLASH. A couple 
           convicts who didn’t survive the voyage are tossed overboard. 

                                 LIP-SCAR SOLDIER
                        ‘At’s what we call an early pardon.

           Soldiers laugh, leading the new arrivals down a gangplank--

           EXT. HARBORTOWN, TASMANIA - CONTINUOUS

           --Into the PORT CITY from our opening. Wharf now teeming with 
           merchants, beggars, slavers, whores. Pigs and rats scurry at 
           Greenhill’s feet as they’re escorted toward a set of WAGONS.

                                 GREENHILL
                        How far to the prison?

                                 BILLINGS
                        Two weeks, I heard. Opposite end of 
                        the whole bloody island.   
                                 GREENHILL
                        ...I expect that’s by desig--

           --CHAINS wrap around Greenhill’s throat! A WILD-EYED CONVICT 
           wrenches him out of line, using him as a human shield!

                                 WILD-EYED CONVICT
                        No! You can’t make me go back! I’ll 
                        pop his feckin’ head off! 

           All around, LONG-RIFLES SNAP UP:

                     LIP SCAR SOLDIER
                                                        GREENHILL
           Just shoot ‘em both.
                                                (gasps, struggling)
                                              -- no -- wait --!

                                 SOLDIER
                        On my mark: 3-- 2-- 

           Blood showers Greenhill as a SWORD sprouts from his captor’s 
           neck. The convict blinks. Lets go. And FALLS facedown, 
           OFFICER’S SABRE between his shoulders. The crowd STARES...

           ...and all ACTIVITY RESUMES as before. Greenhill breathes 
           hard as a WHITE-GLOVED HAND retrieves the sabre-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Th-- thank y--

           --And PRESSES it to Greenhill’s chin. Tilting back his head. 

           Greenhill blinks up at his ‘savior’: Spotless uniform, the 
           sleeves too big. Pale face not yet able to shave. ABEL (19).

                                 ABEL
                        Weren’t for your sake I done it. 
                        Speak to me again without I speak 
                        to you first, I’ll cut you fine as 
                        I did your man over there. Clear?
                            (Greenhill just breathes)
                        You a mumbler? Speak up.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I understood you. You don’t need to 
                        threaten me.

           Abel BLINKS. All around, soldiers GO QUIET, looking over--

                                 ABEL
                        What did you say? Y-- you trying to 
                        tell me how to do my job, mumbler?

                                 GREENHILL
                        I don’t even know what your job is. 
                        You can lower the sword. You won’t 
                        have any trouble from me. 
           All around, soldiers stifle SNICKERS. Abel’s jaw works, 
           deciding his response. Then -- a twinkle in his eyes:

                                 ABEL
                        We’ll just see about that, won’t we?

           The soldiers haul Greenhill up; cram him in a wagon beside:

                                 BILLINGS
                        Look at you. First day, and already 
                        making friends.

           Abel snatches a canteen from a soldier; mounts up, leading 
           the caravan out. Greenhill kneads his throat, eyes locked on 
           THE WHARF receding behind them; SHIPS casting off to sea... 

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        Banish from your minds, all fancy 
                        of escape.

           As the caravan winds out of the city-- WE RISE UPWARD-- 

           EXT. TASMANIAN WILDERNESS - VARIOUS (BEGIN MONTAGE)

           AND RACE AHEAD, getting a bird’s-eye-view of the 300 MILES of 
           INHOSPITABLE TERRAIN that will soon separate Greenhill from 
           civilization: DESERTS. SWAMPS. WHITE MOUNTAINS. RIVER RAPIDS. 

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        For survival is impossible, beyond 
                        these walls. 

           EXT. WAGON/PENAL COLONY - NIGHT (DAYS LATER)

           Rain thunders, wagons rattling past a weatherbeaten sign: 

           “MACQUARIE HARBOR PENAL INSTALLATION.” The haggard prisoners 
           murmur, Greenhill peering ahead as RUSTED GATES GROAN OPEN...

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        Judgment Day will come for us all. 
                        But upon you men, it has come early. 

           They ride into a medieval-looking PENAL COMPLEX, built into 
           coastal cliffs. At the mouth of a white-water bay below, TWIN 
           BASALT TOWERS give this colony its nickname: “HELL’S GATES.” 

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        The world is full of sheep. 

           They ride past a mud-pit. Greenhill watches as two SHIRTLESS 
           CONVICTS viciously fight. Soldiers CHEER, placing bets.
                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        But each of you has been judged to 
                        be a wolf.

           HANOVER (40) a pockmarked brute, SLAMS his opponent’s skull 
           into a ROCK again and again until something gives-- then 
           looks up, meeting Greenhill’s eyes. Smiles. Welcoming him. 

           INT. COMMANDANT’S OFFICE - SAME

           A figure clutches a rosary before a small shrine. Candles and 
           religious icons surround a portrait of a COMELY BEAUTY. 

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        From you, the sheep have no defense. 
                        Except me. I am the shepherd. 

           The figure turns, revealing: CUTHBERT. He hears approaching 
           shouts, MARCHING FEET; opens a familiar POCKET-WATCH. Only 
           now, the glass is intact. Hands ticking.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           On a platform in the rain, Cuthbert completes his speech:

                                 CUTHBERT
                        The life you knew is over. This 
                        place is your home. These men, your 
                        family. Accept that, and your time 
                        here shall pass swiftly. Accept it 
                        not -- and you shall never leave.  

           In the prison yard, 30 NEW ARRIVALS look up at Cuthbert-- all 
           but Greenhill, who eyes the STONE WALLS; the METAL GATES... 

                                 ABEL
                        Alright you filth, fall-in for 
                        grooming and marking. MOVE, MOVE!

           EXT. STABLES - MOMENTS LATER

           NAKED PRISONERS shiver in line as a BRANDING IRON HISSES off 
           Billings’ neck, leaving “M.H.” He’s dragged off whimpering. 

           Greenhill’s next. FELTON (50s), former guard, current inmate, 
           his nose partly chewed-off, re-heats the iron in a furnace.

                                 FELTON
                        Call it, “The MacQuarie Kiss.” 
                            (whispers, to Greenhill)
                        Used to be a guard here; for a 
                        haypenny, I can get you salve to 
                        put on it. Can get you just about 
                        anything. Tobacco. Girly pictures--
           Greenhill shakes his head; stares at his clenched fist. Felton 
           shrugs. The brand comes down. TSSS... Greenhill reddens. Agony. 

                                 ABEL
                        You there. Open that fist.

           Guards force open Greenhill’s hand; find his WOVEN BRACELET.

                                 ABEL
                        Very pretty, mumbler. You steal it?

                                 GREENHILL
                        My wife... made it.

                                 ABEL
                        I see. Is that-- her hair? May I?

           Abel bends, eyes never leaving Greenhill’s as his nostrils 
           INHALE DEEPLY, SMELLING the bracelet.

                                 ABEL
                        Mmmmm... Still smells of her. 
                        Smells like -- pie. 
                            (Greenhill is sickened)
                        Place it on the ground.

           Greenhill clenches his jaw, forcing himself to comply. 

                                 ABEL
                        Know what your problem is? You 
                        still think you don’t belong here. 

           The sound of LIQUID SPATTERING. Abel urinating on the 
           bracelet. Greenhill’s muscles are taut, exercising every atom 
           of self-restraint he possesses not to tear Abel apart.

                                 ABEL
                        Enjoy her smell. 

           Abel chuckles, cinches up his pants; turning -- to find 
           CUTHBERT behind him. Abel’s bravado melts away. 

                                 ABEL
                        He-- this prisoner had contraband.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...Have a wife, do you?

                                 ABEL
                        Answer the Commandant when he asks 
                        you a question.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Yes. And three children. 
                                 CUTHBERT
                        Serve your time here uprightly, and 
                        I promise, you shall see them again. 
                        Go on. Go to your bunk assignment.

           Greenhill PICKS UP the bracelet. Abel SCOWLS after him...

                                 ABEL
                        The man is a born trouble-maker--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        So by spoiling the memory of the 
                        only thing he has to live for, you 
                        reasoned you’d make him obedient? 

                                 ABEL
                        Father. Men obey persons they fear.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        They obey persons they respect. 
                            (steps closer, voice low)
                        One day, Abel, the administration of 
                        this facility will be your duty. It’s 
                        time you started acting worthy of it. 

           Cuthbert turns on his heel, marching off. Abel stands there, 
           turning red. Then he notices some prisoners watching him.

                                 ABEL
                        Get back to work or I’ll have your 
                        arses flogged off!

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The line of NAKED PRISONERS streams toward the bunkhouse. 
           Greenhill is handed coarse grey clothing; yellowing 
           bedsheets. He continues inside, where--

           A 7-FOOT ABORIGINE CONVICT blocks his way, mopping the floor. 
           This is WHYLIE (40). Rail-thin. Covered in tribal marks.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Excuse me--

           But Whylie GRABS GREENHILL’S WRIST. Stripping off his GRIMY 
           BRACELET. Plunging it into his bucket of SOAPY WATER. 
           Wringing it out. Returning it clean.

           Greenhill blinks at the Aborigine, surprised, grateful--

                                 KENNELLY (O.S.)
                        --Hey! Claw off ‘im, darkee!

           KENNELLY (30), a cynical, fast-talking lifer, leads Greenhill 
           away from Whylie, shaking his hand vigorously.
                                 KENNELLY
                        Mick Kennelly. Careful around Old 
                        Abo. His type’ll spear you, soon as 
                        look at you.

                                 GREENHILL
                        He was-- kind to me.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Kind to you. Uh-huh. ‘Me ask you a 
                        question: How long you in for?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Five years.

           LAUGHTER all around him. Kennelly washes his face and hands 
           in a basin of grey water. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        The magistrate gave me five y--

                                 KENNELLY
                        Your magistrate forgot about you the 
                        moment you was out his door. His job 
                        was to send you here. Cuthbert’s job 
                        is to keep you here. Watch. Fast as 
                        a dog’ll lick a dish them five years 
                        turn into ten; ten into twenty--
                            (Greenhill frowns--)
                        Put it this way: When you was 
                        coming off that boat-- how many men 
                        you see going the other way?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Just one. You coming with me?

                                 KENNELLY
                        Sure thing, mate. But only if we 
                        travel first class.
                            (claps Greenhill’s BRAND)
                        Welcome to MacQuarie. 

           Kennelly chuckles, joining a dice game. Greenhill peers back 
           at Whylie, who quietly lifts his mop, moving on.

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           A distant CLANG. Greenhill’s eyes open, waking up in a narrow 
           bunk. Across the bunkhouse, convicts murmur:

                     SCRAWNY PRISONER
           Look. They’re midnighting 
           someone.
                                                         FELTON
                                              --Haven’t had a midnight in a 
                                              long time.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Wager a quid it’s him. Back again.
           Everyone presses to the windows, Greenhill peering OUTSIDE--

           GREENHILL’S POV:

           A WHEELED CAGE is brought in. Cuthbert gives a nod. Soldiers 
           unlock the cage; push LONG POLES inside-- 

           Pulling out a COMPACT, POWERFULLY BUILT MAN. Naked. Covered 
           in blood. Someone else’s. IRON BOXES cover his hands and 
           feet. Head in an IRON GRILLE MASK, poles hooked into it, 
           soldiers guiding him along like a velociraptor...

                                                               BACK TO:

                                                    SCRAWNY PRISONER
                         KENNELLY
           Third attempt this year; gone 
           9 weeks this time--
                                              Rumor was he got clear to 
                                              Harbortown. 300 miles.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Who is he?

                                 FELTON
                        Polite society don’t have words for 
                        what he’s called. But his Christian 
                        name -- be Alexander Pearce.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - MORNING

           ALEXANDER PEARCE cracks his neck, getting comfortable, as a 
           PIMPLY SOLDIER (20) nervously binds his hands to a pillar. 

                                 FELTON (V.O.)
                        Said to have spent his life in 
                        prisons across God’s green globe.

           The soldier drops a FLOGGING WHIP. Looks at it; at Pearce-- 

           But Pearce just bends down. Handing the whip back to the 
           soldier, oddly smiling, never breaking his gaze. 

                                 FELTON (V.O.)
                        Some lands didn’t even have names 
                        for his crimes. No one but ‘im had 
                        ever thought to commit them before. 

           WHIP-CRACKS echo across the yard, where Felton, Greenhill, 
           and a line of prisoners are being marched to the MESS HALL. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        What did he do to end up in here?

           I/E. PRISON - VARIOUS (MONTAGE)

           In the mess hall, the bunkhouse, the laundry, PRISONERS tell 
           Greenhill various versions of Pearce’s origins:
                     SCOTTISH PRISONER
                                                    FRIENDLY PRISONER
           Way I heard it, ‘spent his 
           youth on the Dutch East ships 
           riding the winds. Finest 
           whaler, ever pulled a rope--
                                              --Fought with Wellington’s 
                                              grenadiers at Waterloo. 
                                              Buried more frogs that day 
                                              than the bloody black plague.

                                                  OTHER PRISONER (O.S.)
                     ERUDITE PRISONER
           --From there, ‘e was part of 
           a sheep-stealing ring down in 
           Hobart--
                                              --Queenstown, I heard.
                 (frowns)
           ...No, no, it was Hobart.

                                 PRISON CHAPLAIN
                        He’d taken Benedictine orders, and 
                        was three years a priest, when...

           INTERCUT: Again and again, the WHIP CRACKS, loud as a gunshot. 
           But Pearce doesn’t even flinch. This is routine for him. 

                     SCOTTISH PRISONER
                                                     PRISON CHAPLAIN
                                                (crosses himself)
           ...One day, he turned his 
           harpoon on his captain. 
           Slaughtered his whole crew. 
           Said he done it for sport.
                                              They found the girls below 
                                              the monastery, hung upside 
                                              down. Violated in the most 
                                              appalling ways--

                                 HOARSE OLD PRISONER (PRE-LAP)
                        I’ll tell’ya bout Alexander Pearce.

           INT. COASTAL FOREST - MORNING

           PICKS CLANG as prisoners clear rocks. Greenhill and Billings 
           work alongside a HOARSE OLD PRISONER (60, sun-damaged skin). 

                                 HOARSE OLD PRISONER
                        Few winters back, his regiment got 
                        snowbound on the Khyber Pass. By 
                        time search party found them, Pearce 
                        was the only survivor. Found him 
                        feasting on his superior officer. 
                        Called his flesh delicious. Far 
                        better than fish or pork.
                            (spits)
                        Direct quote, ‘at is. Believe me. 
                        You don’t wanna be his friend. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Still... He’s the only man who ever 
                        made it across the island...

                                 BILLINGS
                        I don’t care if he sprouts wings. I 
                        wouldn’t get near Pearce for all 
                        the apples in the King’s orchard. 
           Greenhill glances at Billings, considering it, as -- a SHADOW 
           passes over them. Abel patrolling past on his horse. 

                                 ABEL
                        Keep up the pace, boys! Slothabouts 
                        get the double shift tomorrow.

                                 SOLDIER
                        How far they going today?

                                 ABEL
                        Not far.
                            (nods into the DISTANCE)
                        Just ‘til we make that ridge. 

           Billings’ face drops; Greenhill’s chest heaving, as we go--

                                                      ANGLE FROM ABOVE:

           In a series of DISSOLVES, the prisoners slowly inch toward 
           the distant ridge. Their shadows shrink as the sun PEAKS.

                                                             RETURN TO:

           Greenhill, shirt soaked through, struggles to swing his pick 
           with his SPLINTED ARM, when-- Billings PASSES OUT beside him. 
           Greenhill catches him, SLAPS his face-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thom. Thom--

                                 OTHER PRISONER
                        ‘E’s coming.

           Down the line, Abel wheels his horse around, patrolling back.   

                        GREENHILL
                                                        BILLINGS
           Pick it up. Pick it up--
                                                (almost delirious)
                                              --I c-can’t-- please-- 

           Abel gets closer and CLOSER, Greenhill forcing the pick into 
           Billings’ blister-covered hands, when-- 

                                 ABEL
                        Water break! 
                            (Greenhill can’t believe it)
                        Next thirty minutes, any man who 
                        wishes can jump in that river.

           Billings drops his pick, staggering numbly down toward--

           EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

           CLEAR WATER glides along. Billings and others splash their 
           necks; gulp water, about to leap in. But Greenhill is wary.
                        GREENHILL
                                                        BILLINGS
           Wait.
                                              What? Why--?

                                 GREENHILL
                        How come only the new prisoners are 
                        going in?

           Behind them, the other prisoners are JUST WATCHING in dread. 
           Billings frowns, when-- from the water, a BLUR of movement--

           CROCODILE JAWS SNAP UP, inches from Billings’ face! Greenhill 
           wrenches him back from the waterline as RIOTOUS LAUGHTER 
           ERUPTS from the soldiers. Abel grins ear-to-ear.

                                 ABEL
                        Tasmanian saltwater crocodiles. 
                        Island’s overrun with ‘em. Abo’s call 
                        them kurdaitcha. “Executioner.” Snap 
                        your spine in one bite. Or just drag 
                        you to the bottom. Wait you out. 
                            (nods to the river)
                        Tell you what. I’ll offer you a 
                        deal. If you can make it to the far 
                        shore... you’re free. What’ya say?

           Greenhill stares at the crocodile. At the far shore, fifty 
           yards away. And turns back. His PICK lands at his feet. 

                                 ABEL
                        Day’s not over, mumbler.

           INT. MESS HALL - NIGHT

           ENVELOPES flutter down as a SOLDIER dumps MAIL on a table. 
           Prisoners excitedly grab letters as Greenhill limps over, 
           sunburnt, exhausted. He rakes through the envelopes, finding--

           Nothing. 

           Greenhill’s face sags.

                                 FELTON (O.S.)
                        Oy. Greenhill, weren’t it? Snagged 
                        a letter from your old lady.

           Felton hands Greenhill a WORN ENVELOPE. His face lights up. 
           He immediately tears it open, almost shaking with excitement:

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        My dear Robert. I am sorry it has 
                        taken so long to write; acquiring 
                        the money for postage was difficult. 
                        I wish I could say fate has dealt 
                        with us kindly in your absence, but 
                        I have only sorrowful news to--
           --The letter is SNATCHED from Greenhill. His eyes dart up to:

                                 ABEL
                        The reading of personal material is 
                        restricted to the bunkhouse. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (reaches for the letter)
                        ...I had forgotten; please--

                                 ABEL
                        Maybe this will help you remember.

           Abel TOSSES the letter into a FIREPLACE. Greenhill lunges, 
           hand darting into the flames, desperate to recover the BURNING 
           PAGES. But he’s too late. Greenhill clutches at cinders.

                                 ABEL
                        Chin up. There’ll be other letters. 
                        You’ll be here a long time. 

           Abel walks away, wearing a satisfied grin, when-- 

           --GREENHILL TACKLES ABEL FROM BEHIND; hurls him to the floor, 
           absolutely wild, pounding his face like a speed-bag. WHAM, 
           WHAM-- prisoners SWARM, HOLLERING and CHEERING--

                         BILLINGS
                                                         HANOVER
                                              Yes! Bleed him! Yes! 
           No-- Robert, don’t--! It’s 
           what he wants--

           Soldiers finally PRY Greenhill off Abel. Restraining his arms 
           as Abel RISES, his bloodied face twisting into a smile.

                                 ABEL
                        Sorry, mumbler... but you should 
                        have listened to your friend.

           Off Greenhill, chest heaving, realizing HE JUST FUCKED UP--

           INT. STONE-WALLED PIT - DAY

           A HATCH OPENS. Abel peers in; gestures to his men, who lower 
           Greenhill by chains into this CONVERTED TIDAL WELL. His eyes 
           pop and wince, bad arm getting STRETCHED, touching down--

           --into ICY SEAWATER, rising and falling with the swell of the 
           ocean. Greenhill gasps, plunged waist-deep, breaths clouding-- 

                                 ABEL
                        No food. No water. Three days.  

           The HATCH SHUTS, plunging Greenhill into DARKNESS. A wave 
           CRASHES IN, tossing him like a rag doll. He SHIVERS, arm 
           twisting, eyes filling with tears of rage -- but just when 
           Greenhill’s SPIRIT seems about to BREAK...
           He sees a tiny shaft of SUNLIGHT overhead. Swirling with DUST 
           MOTES. He steels himself, muttering an OLD MINER’S SONG:

                                 GREENHILL
                        Down the mines, no sunlight shines; 
                        those pits they’re--
                            (CRASH; he grits his teeth)
                        --Bl-black as hell. In mud and 
                        slime, they do their time; 
                        It’s Paddy’s prison cell...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Greenhill FLINCHES AWAKE, realizing: THE TIDE’S IN. A wave 
           POUNDS OVER HIM, mouth filling with ocean, as he’s pulled--

           UNDERWATER.

           Greenhill struggles, feet pawing for the well bottom. His 
           toes brush a STONE BLOCK. YES. He perches atop it, face-- 

           SURFACING.

           He GULPS AIR DESPERATELY -- when the BLOCK WOBBLES and he’s 
           swept under again. Has to use his splinted arm to PULL 
           HIMSELF UP. The pain excruciating. He dangles. 

           Then Greenhill GETS AN IDEA. He peers down at the BLOCK...

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           DAYLIGHT. Cuthbert storms across the yard toward THE PIT. 

                                                          ABEL
                                                (hurries after him)
                         CUTHBERT
           Three days?! The pit is to be 
           used for hours--
                                              --You told me to teach them 
                                              respect, I don’t--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Open it. Bring him up. Gently. His 
                        arms will be weak.

           The soldiers open the hatch. Reeling up the chains, link upon 
           link. Cuthbert leans, peering in... and FLINCHES back, as--

           Greenhill emerges. Shivering. Salt-cured. So weak he can’t 
           even crawl. Just a bag of bones landing at Cuthbert’s feet. 

                                 ABEL
                            (nudges him with a boot)
                        Get up.

           Greenhill can’t move. But his eyes SNAP UP. BLAZING. DEFIANT. 
                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...Bring this man to the infirmary. 
                        When he’s capable of understanding 
                        it... inform him that three years 
                        have been added to his sentence.

           The soldiers drag Greenhill away. But not even those words 
           can dim the NEW FIRE kindling behind his eyes.

                                 ABEL
                        See? Your wolf is just another dog.  
                        We’ll have no more trouble from hi--

           Cuthbert WHIRLS -- BACKHANDING ABEL. He drops like a brick. 
           Abel probes his cheek, speechless, mouth working--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Do you wish to spark an uprising?!

                                 ABEL
                        I gave him what he d-deserved--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        And what will God give you in 
                        return? What do you deserve? 
                            (Abel recoils)
                        It was a blessing your mother never 
                        lived to see you grown.

           Cuthbert storms away. Abel stares after him, lip quivering.

                                 ABEL
                        Was an animal like him what took 
                        her, wasn’t it?

           INT. PRISON, INFIRMARY - LATE NIGHT

                                 ABEL (V.O.)
                        --WASN’T IT?!

           Greenhill lies in a heap, chained to a cot. Eyes shut. 
           Billings sets a bowl of soup on a table, turning to leave--

           GREENHILL GRABS BILLINGS’ WRIST. Billings startles.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Guess I won the bet. Couple the 
                        other wags didn’t think you’d ever 
                        wake up again.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (a whispered rasp)
                        Tell Felton I need a chisel.

                                 BILLINGS
                        What? What are you talking about?
           But as Greenhill pulls Billings closer, WE RISE UP-- 

           --TRACKING past partitions between SICK PRISONERS. Finding 
           one on his belly, back RAW with WHIPPING LACERATIONS. PEARCE.

                                 GREENHILL (O.S.)
                        ...I found a way out of here.

           Pearce’s eyes SNAP OPEN. Head turning slowly toward Greenhill. 

           INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Steam fills the air as Greenhill works a laundry shift, 
           dropping LYE into boiling vats with Kennelly and Billings. 

                                                        GREENHILL
                         BILLINGS
           There’s two low tides: morn 
           at six, or eventide at seven. 
           We go under cover of darkn--
                                              --No. We go during breakfast. 
                                              They won’t expect it then. 
                                              What about the map?

                                 KENNELLY
                            (taps his skull)
                        Up here. Took years, but I filled 
                        my head with it to the last detai-- 

           Greenhill suddenly quiets him as a SOLDIER patrols past... 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Move along. I’ll finish up. 

           Billings and Kennelly move off. Greenhill is alone. He pulls a 
           LAUNDRY HOOK up from a vat, SHEETS surfacing. Greenhill looks 
           around; RIPS a long FABRIC STRIP from the sheets, when-- 

           The distant CLANG of a door shutting. The click of a LOCK. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (frowns, looking around)
                        ...Billings? 

           One by one, window shutters CLOSE, leaving Greenhill in near 
           darkness. A feeling of DREAD rises in him as -- FOOTSTEPS 
           approach. Greenhill grabs the LAUNDRY HOOK, backs away, when--

           AN ARM

           Darts out of the darkness. Grabbing Greenhill by the collar, 
           pinning him to a wall. Hook CLANGING to the floor, as--

           The face of ALEXANDER PEARCE comes into the light.

                                 PEARCE
                        Quit your squirming. I’m just 
                        having a look at you.
                                 GREENHILL
                        What do you want?

           Behind Pearce, Greenhill’s fingers strain to grab a clump of 
           LYE. Right at his fingertips, as--

                                 PEARCE
                        Question isn’t what I want. It’s 
                        what you want. And what you’re 
                        willing to do to get it.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 PEARCE
                        --Have you reached the lye yet?
                            (Greenhill blinks--)
                        Jam it in my face, you’ll burn out 
                        my eyes. Nasty business, but it’ll 
                        make good your escape. Maybe you do 
                        have what it takes.

           Greenhill’s hand hesitates... moving away from the lye.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What it takes -- to do what?

                                 PEARCE
                        To get home. 
                            (Greenhill frowns--)
                        You’re planning an escape. But for 
                        your sake, I’m here to warn you -- 
                        it’s not going to work.

           Without a word, Pearce LETS GO. Greenhill slides to the floor; 
           breathes hard, kneading his throat, watching Pearce walk away.

           INT. MESS HALL - DAY

           Pearce scoops gruel from his tin. Other prisoners give him a 
           wide berth. Greenhill approaches. Sits a few seats away.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...What am I missing?
                            (Pearce just keeps eating)
                        I’ve got a couple partners; a clean 
                        way out of the prison--

                                 PEARCE
                        This whole island’s a prison. 

           Across the room, Billings notices them talking. Frowns.
                                 PEARCE
                        Rivers. Mountains. Aboriginals. 
                        Swamps, a’light with insects 
                        that’ll bore into your fingernails 
                        and eat you from the inside out. 

           Pearce notes a WEEVIL, slithering on the bottom of his bowl. 
           Picks it up with two fingers, watching it squirm. 

                                 PEARCE
                        And then -- there’s the hunger. Any 
                        route you take, you got days upon 
                        days of desolate terrain. Men have 
                        gone insane seeking to quench it. 
                        Seen men eat their own belts. Even 
                        drink sand thinking it was water. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You made it all the way to 
                        Harbortown. Tell me how.

                                 PEARCE
                        God told men how he made the Earth. 
                        In 6,000 years, no one’s yet been 
                        able to replicate it. I can’t tell 
                        you how to get across this island.
                            (looks in Greenhill’s eyes)
                        But I can show you.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...I’m not interested.

           Greenhill stands, turning to leave--

                                 PEARCE
                        I was never at Waterloo. 
                            (Greenhill hesitates)
                        Didn’t steal no sheep, neither. 
                        What else they say I done, got you 
                        so frightened about me?

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m not the one who’s frightened. 
                        They are. Whole damn prison. 

                                 PEARCE
                        I done my share of things, ought 
                        not be spoken of. Every man in here 
                        has. But there’s a difference 
                        between them and me.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What?

                                 PEARCE
                        I’m the one who can get you home.
                                 GREENHILL
                        Why me? What do you need me for?

                                 PEARCE
                        Cowards here won’t even eat near 
                        me. Much less cross an island. But 
                        you, they might trust. You could 
                        get me exactly what I need -- to go 
                        all the way this time.

                                 GREENHILL
                        And what is that.

                                 PEARCE
                            (a smile forming)
                        ...I need five men.

           Greenhill frowns... And keeps walking. But we STAY WITH 
           PEARCE as he watches the weevil SQUIRM. And EATS IT ALIVE.

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           A soldier hands out LETTERS. No mail for Greenhill. He stares 
           at the empty mail sack. Mind going to dark places.

                                 BILLINGS (V.O.)
                        Are you out of your bloody gourd?!

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           In a corner, whisper-shouting:

                                 BILLINGS
                        I’m not partnering with Alexander 
                        Pearce. And neither are you. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You think I want to partner with 
                        any of these people? Rapers, 
                        killers? Kennelly’s just a pick-
                        pocket, I don’t even trust him.

                                 BILLINGS
                        What good’s getting home, if you 
                        sell your soul along the way? 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I can handle Pearce. Come with me. 
                        I’ll get you back to Molly. 
                        Remember Molly? Thom--

                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s not just Pearce I’m worried 
                        about. What about him?
           Billings nods to the window, where Greenhill can see, walking 
           the prison walls, SILHOUETTED against the stars -- CUTHBERT.

                                 BILLINGS
                        You think he chose this job? It 
                        chose him. Know how he got here?
                            (Greenhill frowns)
                        I heard Cuthbert was off at war in 
                        the colonies, when some bludger 
                        broke into his home in London. Three 
                        days, his poor wife suffered. Abel 
                        was in a crib through it all, saw 
                        everything. Turns out, the man that 
                        did it was an escaped convict...

                                 GREENHILL
                            (doing the math)
                        So Cuthbert devoted his life to the 
                        prison system.

                                 BILLINGS
                        In his eyes, the minute we walk out 
                        those gates? We’re no different 
                        from the man who killed his wife. 

           And off Greenhill, the ante having just been RAISED, we--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Morning sun shines on the TWIN BASALT TOWERS. Waves crash. 

           INT. MESS HALL - MORNING

           Gruel slops into bowls. Prisoners plod in parallel lines. 
           Greenhill eyes patrolling SOLDIERS; bad arm falling to his 
           side, now in a bandage, hand OPENING as--

           Billings SLIPS HIM a CHISEL as he passes. 

           EXT. PRISON YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Greenhill walks outside, head down, approaching the latrines. 
           A group of soldiers pass him by... 

           ...Greenhill TURNS a corner. Heads for THE PIT. Looks both ways.

           INT. MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Soldiers patrol past tables, prisoners eating silently. 
           Billings and Kennelly exchange a glance, when-- 

           A COMMOTION at the far end of the table. Convicts SCATTER as 
           Whylie violently RETCHES. A soldier comes over, grimaces:
                                 LIP-SCAR SOLDIER
                        Ughhhh. You there. Billings. Take 
                        old Abo to the infirmary.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Me? Alone? With that savage? 

           Kennelly wipes his mouth, getting up--

                                 KENNELLY
                        --I’ll go with him. Always wanted 
                        to see the inside of a bush-monkey.

           They pull the moaning Whylie up; drag him out and--

           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           --into the INFIRMARY, finding: Felton and Hanover, grinning 
           through bloody faces, a soldier chaining them up to beds.

                                 PIMPLY SOLDIER
                        These two got into a dust-up in the 
                        laundry. Have them stitched up.

           The soldier bumps into Kennelly on his way out. Kennelly 
           holds his hands up, apologizing. But as soon as the soldier 
           is out of sight, we reveal--

           Kennelly got his KEYS. Moving to unlock Felton’s manacles. 
           Everyone moving quickly, knowing they’re IN IT now, as--

                                 FELTON
                        Any word from Greenhill?

           INT. STONE-WALLED PIT - SAME

           A makeshift ROPE, painstakingly woven from torn FABRIC 
           STRIPS, hangs down the wall to the pit-bottom, where--

           Greenhill scrambles to CHISEL OUT a familiar LOOSE BLOCK from 
           the wall. Prying away bits of crumbling masonry, dislodging 
           other rocks around it, slowly revealing:

           A FLOOD TUNNEL. 3 feet X 3 feet. And 30 yards out: DAYLIGHT.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...God help me.  

           Greenhill CRAWLS INTO the TUNNEL.

           INT. MESS HALL - SAME

           A sack of LETTERS swings at ABEL’S side as he pushes in the 
           door to the MESS HALL:
                                 ABEL
                        Post came early this week. Line up. 
                        I said LINE UP, you worms! 

           WE FOLLOW ABEL’S HAND as he fishes around in the sack. His 
           hand passes by an envelope addressed to ‘ROBERT GREENHILL.’

           INT. STONE-WALLED PIT - MOMENTS LATER

           FIVE MEN climb into the hatch: Billings, Kennelly, Whylie, 
           Felton, and Hanover, climbing down into the pit, finding:

                                 GREENHILL
                            (crawls out of the tunnel)
                        We’ve got a problem. Part of the 
                        passage collapsed. We won’t fit. 

                                 HANOVER
                        Daft prig. You said it was clear. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Rough tide last month must have 
                        jostled the rocks loose.

           Whylie just eyerolls. Billings starting to climb out.

                         BILLINGS
                                                        KENNELLY
           Good enough for me, gents--
                                              --You don’t go anywhere 
                                              without we tell you first. 

                                 FELTON
                        I say ‘e’s right. Go back now, 
                        there’s a chance we wasn’t missed. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        What if they catch us when we’re 
                        climbing out? We’ll never get 
                        another shot at this. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        We’re fast-talking our way to the 
                        flogging post. What’s the call?

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        We clear the blockage. 

           Everyone looks up, seeing Pearce climb into the pit. He coils 
           the makeshift rope, pulling it down behind him as-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        If we’re still in there when the 
                        tide comes in, we’ll all drown.

                                 PEARCE
                        Your concern is touching. Now dig.
           INT. MESS HALL - SAME

           CLOSE ON: Abel’s hand roots around in the mail sack. Passes 
           Greenhill’s envelope... then RETURNS TO IT, pulling it out. 

                                 ABEL
                        Greenhill... GREENHILL... 

           No hands rise. Prisoners exchange looks. Abel’s eyes narrow.

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Crammed in the tunnel, Greenhill and the men clear rocks, 
           passing them back, hand-over-hand, like a bucket brigade.

           INT. MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Abel pulls a soldier aside, conferring:

                                 LIP-SCAR SOLDIER
                        Bunkhouse is empty. So’s the 
                        infirmary. That makes six missing. 
                        Plus the Old Abo-- 

                                 ABEL
                        Not a word to my father about this. 
                        Search the complex. Find them. 

           EXT. PRISON YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Soldiers FAN OUT over the prison, scouring every inch of the 
           place. Abel’s gaze strays over the buildings...

           ...And notices, on THE PIT -- THE HATCH IS UNLATCHED. 

                                 ABEL
                        Why is the pit open?

           INT. TUNNEL - SAME

           Inside the pit, Greenhill and the others RACE to clear the 
           blockage. The water is now WAIST-HIGH around them.

                                                         PEARCE
                        GREENHILL
           The water’s rising!
                                              Move faster.

           Billings tries to squeeze through the HOLE they’ve made--

                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s still too tight, I can’t fit!
           EXT. PRISON YARD - SAME

           Abel, now flanked by THREE SOLDIERS, walks toward the pit. 

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The men work frantically now, surf POUNDING back and forth 
           all around them, up to their CHESTS now--

                                                        KENNELLY
                                                (eyes darting)
                         BILLINGS
           We’ll all be buried in this 
           hole!
                                              --He’s right, we’re buggered!

                                 GREENHILL
                        Keep digging, we’re almost through!

           UNDERWATER, the men’s hands clear rocks, blockage widening 
           until -- Whylie waves them off, contorts his wiry frame--

           --and SQUEEZES THROUGH the hole! 

                                 GREENHILL
                        That’s it! All of you, go-go-go--

                                 PEARCE
                        Wait. One at a time. 
                            (stops Hanover)
                        You last.

           EXT. PIT - MOMENTS LATER

           The hatch opens and Abel peers down into the pit. EMPTY. 

                                 LIP-SCAR SOLDIER
                        Just like I said, nothing out of 
                        the ordinary. Checked it me’self.

                                 ABEL
                            (removing his coat)
                        Lower me down.

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Waves RUSH THROUGH as Greenhill and Hanover wait their turn, 
           faces pressed to the ceiling, grabbing precious breaths.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (looks back, alarmed)
                        Someone’s climbing dow--

                                 HANOVER
                        Move, damn you!
           Greenhill TURNS-- but ANOTHER WAVE catches him unprepared. He 
           chokes on seawater as it fills the tunnel, trapping him--

           UNDERWATER. Greenhill constricts his chest, trying to cram 
           himself through the hole. Wriggling through the blockage like 
           a cork in a bottle, a centimeter at a time, until-- 

           --his BANDAGED ARM gets stuck. Greenhill frantically tugs on 
           his arm, WINCING, eyes BULGING--

           INT. PIT - SAME

           Abel descends on a chain, the soldiers lowering him down, as--

           INT. TUNNEL (UNDERWATER) - SAME

           Greenhill struggles, twisting his arm; bandage finally 
           ripping off, as-- he shoots ahead, frantically swimming for a 
           DISTANT LIGHT at the tunnel’s end--

           --When he’s JERKED backward. It’s Hanover, CLINGING to his 
           FOOT, eyes wild, thrashing, STUCK! 

           Greenhill grabs Hanover’s wrist, fighting to pull him through, 
           but HE’S TOO BIG-- Greenhill’s EYES BULGE, LUNGS BURNING, as--

           INT. PIT - MOMENTS LATER

           Abel shivers as he plunges waist-deep at the pit bottom; he 
           takes a breath, going-- 

           UNDERWATER, seeing the LOOSE BLOCK; THE OPEN TUNNEL. His eyes 
           narrow as he elbows his way INSIDE, finding... 

           ...HANOVER’S DROWNED BODY. Abel SCREAMS.

           EXT. HELL’S GATES - SAME

           Greenhill SURFACES, GASPING, swimming after Pearce:

                                 GREENHILL
                        Hanover’s still back there! 

                                 PEARCE
                            (crawling ashore)
                        Don’t be stupid. I used him to plug 
                        up the tunnel behind us. 

           Pearce reaches back to offer Greenhill a hand up. But 
           Greenhill just stares up at him, breathing hard, horrified--
                                 PEARCE
                        The man was a degenerate. Better 
                        this way. Now they have to go the 
                        long way ‘round. Come on.

           Greenhill stares at Pearce’s hand. The hand of a madman. 

                                 PEARCE
                            (a distant BELL CLANGS--)
                        They’re coming. Take my hand.

           Greenhill sets his jaw-- and reaches up, taking Pearce’s hand.

           EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - SAME

           AN ALARM BELL CLANGS as soldiers distribute rifles and 
           ammunition; Cuthbert leading a group of men to the stables--

                                 ABEL (O.S.)
                        Father, wait--

           Abel blocks his path, looking driven, uniform soaked--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Move aside, boy.

                                 ABEL
                        No. It were on my watch they 
                        escaped. Let me bring them back-- 

           Cuthbert tries to push Abel aside, but--

                                 ABEL
                        You’re right about me.
                            (Cuthbert hesitates)
                        It’s time I started acting worthy 
                        of my duty. Let me put this right.

           Cuthbert glares at his son. Slowly nods, making a decision, 
           reaching into his coat, pulling out -- his POCKET-WATCH. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Your mother gave me this. Ever has 
                        it been a reminder of what they took 
                        from me. Come back honoring it--
                            (puts it in Abel’s hand)
                        --Or don’t come back at all.

           OFF ABEL, realizing just how much is riding on this now--

           EXT. OLD-GROWTH FOREST - SAME

           Six sets of legs RACE over the underbrush as the escapees 
           scramble through the forest. Greenhill huffing at the rear.  
           EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Gates OPEN, as Abel rides out at the head of 20 CAVALRYMEN. 
           These are His Majesty’s DRAGOONS. Hooves POUNDING EARTH, as--

           EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

           The prisoners fan out, searching the brush for something. 
           Greenhill and Billings stand apart, voices low: 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Pearce did what?
                            (Greenhill quiets him--)
                        If that’s what he had planned for 
                        Hanover -- what’s he got planned 
                        for the rest of us?

                                 GREENHILL
                        All we know is, he needs five men. 
                        Long as we control the group, we 
                        maintain the upper hand on him.

                                 FELTON (O.S.)
                        Over ‘ere!

           Felton clears branches, finding-- a HIDDEN ROWBOAT. Greenhill 
           grabs a BURLAP SACK from inside. Moldy rags spill out. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Where’s the rest? 

                                 KENNELLY
                        There was s’posed to be guns. Food. 
                        This is just a bunch of fusty rags!

                                 FELTON
                        I traded in favors for weeks to get 
                        those clothes. Put ‘em on. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        --Do as he says. Sink your greys in 
                        the river. Quickly. 

           The men listen to Greenhill. Pearce finally following suit. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You two, get the boat in the water.

           Billings and Whylie lift the boat, sliding it into the river. 
           Kennelly steps aboard, and--

           --CRUNCH. His shoe instantly PUNCHES through the rotten hull. 
                         KENNELLY
           Come on. You had one job!
                                                         FELTON
                                              And what’s your job? Talking 
                                              shite til they drag us back 
                                              by the short and curlies?
           --Better that ‘n starving!

                                 GREENHILL
                        Stop it, the both of you; they 
                        could be here any moment--

           Felton SHOVES Kennelly, Greenhill getting between them; but 
           just when it looks like it’s about to come to blows--

                                 FEENEY (O.S.)
                        Trouble with your boat?

           Everyone freezes; turning to see -- a fisherman passing in a 
           KEELBOAT. Call him FEENEY (50s, hair in his ears, kind eyes).

                                 KENNELLY
                            (seeing an angle)
                        ...Yeah. Yeah, merchant swindled 
                        us. Shame. Had a big day planned.

                                 FEENEY
                        Rough country to get stuck in.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Yes, but we’ll manage, I’m sure. 
                        Good day to y--

                                 PEARCE
                        --Could we trouble you for a ride? 
                        It’s just a few miles downstream. 
                            (arm around Greenhill)
                        This one here’s got a little girl 
                        waiting back home. Not five years 
                        old. Cute as a thimble, she is.

                                 FEENEY
                        ...Really. Got two myself. Seven 
                        and nine. What’s her name?

           ON GREENHILL. Deciding whether to put this man at risk with 
           this rogues gallery; he glances at Pearce; at the woods--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Maggie. After my wife’s mum.

           Feeney smiles; tosses Greenhill a ROPE-- 

           --but Pearce catches it, muscular arms reeling it in like a 
           spider. Greenhill grabs the line; leans to Pearce, quiet: 

                                 GREENHILL
                        We accept the ride and leave this 
                        man. Unharmed. Understood? 
                                 PEARCE
                        Never harm anyone I don’t have to. 

           Pearce smiles. Greenhill is not terribly reassured.

           EXT. KEELBOAT - AFTERNOON

           The tiller CREAKS as Feeney steers. Eyeing the SIX STRANGERS 
           in his boat. Whylie glances back at the treeline. Nothing yet.

                                 FEENEY
                        Did your Black forget something?

                                 BILLINGS
                        He’s just-- enjoying the view. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Steady ride. How fast can you get 
                        her up to?

                                 FEENEY
                        Oh, she’ll move. Just prefer not to 
                        work her boiler too hard. 
                            (glances around)
                        But if you fellows are in a rush...?

           Pearce just stares at the man. 

                                 FEENEY
                        Well. I don’t want to hold you up. 
                            (moving towards the boiler)
                        Who’s the no-good anyhow, sold you 
                        the rotten boat?

                                 KENNELLY
                        Fellow in Brighton.

           Feeney reaches past Greenhill to grab a couple of fire logs.

           Greenhill pivots, adjusting his collar to cover the PRISON 
           BRAND on his neck; glancing to Feeney... did he see?

                                 FEENEY
                        This fellow. He have a name?

                                 KENNELLY
                        We wasn’t exactly best mates. Get it?

                                 FEENEY
                        All the same, if you describe him, 
                        maybe I could help put it right. 
                            (tosses logs in a boiler)
                        I know all the boat-men in 
                        Tasmania. And a fellow’s only as 
                        good as his reputation.
                                 PEARCE
                        And you? What sort of reputation do 
                        you have?

           Almost imperceptibly, Greenhill notices Pearce, Kennelly, and 
           Felton getting in position to surround Feeney...

                                 FEENEY
                        I like to believe people think of 
                        me as honest.

                                 PEARCE
                        Doesn’t matter what people think. 
                        Only matters what they do.

                                 FEENEY
                            (shuts the boiler)
                        I couldn’t agree more.

           Feeney spins. Now pointing a FLINTLOCK PISTOL at Pearce. 
           Greenhill’s hands go up--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Wait-- You don’t want to do that.

                                 FEENEY
                        Don’t threaten me, son. Too long, 
                        I’ve watched your type pollute this 
                        pretty country. I’m taking you 
                        right back where you belong. Right 
                        back where you got that brand.

                                 PEARCE
                        We’re six. Only two shots in that 
                        toy. The math don’t add.

                                 FEENEY
                        For you it does. 

                                 PEARCE
                        It may. It may not. 

           Pearce smiles. And LUNGES-- THE GUN GOING OFF, as-- 

           EXT. OLD-GROWTH FOREST - SAME

           HOOVES slide to a HALT, a GUNSHOT echoing in the distance.  
           Abel wheels his horse around--

                                 ABEL
                        The river. GO--

           Abel and his men gallop off the trail. 
           EXT. KEELBOAT - SAME

           Pearce rips away Feeney’s pistol and SMASHES HIS FACE with 
           it. His nose spurts blood, legs going out from under him.

                         BILLINGS
                                                        GREENHILL
           Jesus!
                                              Pearce! I told you not to 
                                              hurt him. Give me that gun--

                                 PEARCE
                            (holds it away from him)
                        I didn’t hurt him. You did, when you 
                        gave yourself away. And now that 
                        you’ve told him my name, I’m going 
                        to have to hurt him... even more.

           Feeney crab-walks backward, eyes darting between the men--

                                 FEENEY
                        Take the boat. It’s yours. I know 
                        how to keep my lip buttoned.
                            (pleading, to Greenhill)
                        Tell them. Tell them--

           Pearce finds Feeney’s pouch of shot and powder, reloading. 
           Whylie mutters in disapproval. Greenhill’s mind races--

                                 GREENHILL
                        We kill this man, by crown law, 
                        they can shoot us on sight. Catch 
                        us alive, they can hang us.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Wait. Is ‘at true?

                                 FELTON
                            (loosens his collar)
                        Yeah. Yeah, ‘tis.

           Pearce sees he’s outnumbered. Flashes Greenhill a smile. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Very well, Robert. What is it you’d 
                        prefer to do?

           EXT. MUDDY INLET - MOMENTS LATER

           BOOTS hit mud, as Greenhill hurries to help Feeney ashore--

                                 FEENEY
                        That bit about a family. They real?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Real as you or me.
                                 FEENEY
                            (wipes his nose, softening)
                        Better to turn yourself in now, 
                        son. While you still can. Go back 
                        home with a clear conscien-- 

           --CLANG! Pearce suddenly BASHES Feeney in the back of the 
           neck with a shovel. He drops. Greenhill is HORRIFIED.

                         BILLINGS
           Oh my-- Christ! 
                                                        KENNELLY
                                              --Now, we’re all murderers!!

                                 PEARCE
                        I was already a murderer. Now, the 
                        rest of you are, too.

                                 FELTON
                        Told you he was bad. Told you we 
                        should have nothing to do with ‘im--

           Whylie lunges for Pearce, but he SPINS, pistol aimed--

                                 PEARCE
                        Easy, nightshade. Need five men to 
                        make it across this island. Be a 
                        pity to lose another so soon. And 
                        I’d prefer not waste the shot. 

                                 WHYLIE
                        [...Seethes, grinding his jaw...]

                                 BILLINGS
                        Oh my Christ. Oh my Christ. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Greenhill. Get back in the boat.

           But Greenhill can’t even move, kneeling beside Feeney, who 
           twitches. Gurgling. Not quite dead. A halo of blood spreading 
           from his hairline. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Oh... oh, I see, Robert. You’ve 
                        never seen a man kilt before. 

                                 FELTON
                        We got to move. Every tick we waste 
                        here, they get closer--

           But Pearce holds up a hand, giving Greenhill a moment.

                                 PEARCE
                        I was nine, first I saw someone 
                        kilt. Passed her in the gutter. 
                        Night woman. So scared she was. 
                        Knew it was happening. Asking me, 
                        hold her hand awhile. So I does.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                            (close to Greenhill, quiet)
                        That’s when she pulls down her 
                        blouse. Shows me the babe, little 
                        mouth working at her teat. Please, 
                        she says. Have mercy on him. So I 
                        tells her sure. Soon I realizes -- 
                        my breath is still misting. And 
                        hers ain’t no longer. So I gathered 
                        up the little one. Bundled him. And 
                        took him straight to London Bridge.
                            (pause)
                        It was Christmas time.

           Greenhill stares, jaw trembling, unable to tear his eyes away 
           from the dying man, as -- Feeney shudders. And goes still. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Now get back in the fucking boat.

           Everyone stares at Greenhill, who rises. Face to face with 
           Pearce, eyes filled with righteous indignation. For a moment, 
           it looks like he might TEAR PEARCE APART-- 

           But Greenhill just climbs aboard. Heading for the tiller.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Shove off. Full ahead.

           EXT. RIVERBANK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Dragoons fish out a bundle of sunken PRISON GARB.

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        No way they swam it across. Whole 
                        river’s full up with crocs. 

                                 ABEL
                            (notes a FURROW in the mud)
                        ...There was a second boat here.

           EXT. KEELBOAT - SAME

           Greenhill hurls logs in the boiler as Felton and Kennelly 
           ransack the hold, tossing out on-deck: ROPE. A FLASK. FISHING 
           GEAR. A KNIFE, MATCHES. A GREEN COAT. A PORTRAIT--

                                 KENNELLY
                        Lookee, gents. The missus was quite 
                        a flower, in her day.

           He tosses the painting aside. It lands near Greenhill. The 
           woman’s eyes on it seem to stare up at him.
           Greenhill turns the painting facedown-- seeing, written on 
           back: “Catch another prize one, luv.” Greenhill finds himself 
           touching the bracelet on his wrist, when, from behind him--

                                 BILLINGS
                        Why did you get back aboard? We 
                        could’ve left them. We could’ve--

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m going home. 
                            (pause)
                        You’re going back to your girl. 
                        That’s the end of it. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        ...Right.

           Greenhill reaches for more logs. Leaning down, close to 
           Billings’ ear, whispering:

                                 GREENHILL
                        First chance we get, one of us has 
                        to get ahold of that gun. Don’t 
                        look at me. Just nod if you agree.

           Billings hesitates, expression blank. Nods.

                                 KENNELLY (O.S.)
                        The hell’s that? Some kind of 
                        darkie sacr’ment?

           Nearby, Whylie touches the BLOODY SHOVEL; paints a line down 
           Pearce’s forehead in blood, muttering in his eerie language. 

                                 PEARCE
                        It is a mark, so that in the end 
                        times, his gods will know that  
                        man’s blood is on my head.

                                 KENNELLY
                        You let him do that? I don’t need 
                        no dusky curse on my bones.

                                 PEARCE
                        I welcome it. If his gods be true, 
                        can’t hide from them anyway.

           Whylie reaches for Felton, who just swats his hand away.

                                 FELTON
                        Sacrilegious, you ask me.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...I’ll take one. 

                                 FELTON
                        Why? Weren’t you that killed him. 
                                 GREENHILL
                        Doesn’t matter. I let it happen. 

           Pearce gives Greenhill a nod, respecting that. Whylie extends 
           a RED INDEX FINGER toward Greenhill’s forehead, when--

                                 BILLINGS
                            (jolts around suddenly)
                        Everybody down--!!

           GUNFIRE suddenly EXPLODES all over the boat, as-- 

           EXT. RIVER - SAME

           --THE DRAGOONS come THUNDERING out of the forest, galloping 
           towards them, RIFLES FIRING!!

           EXT. KEELBOAT (MOVING) - SAME

           The escapees hit the deck, bullets whizzing, splinters flying 
           everywhere. Pearce jams the throttle--

                                 PEARCE
                        Steer for the far shore--!

           GREENHILL

           Reaches up, managing to give the tiller a SHOVE, before-- 
           BLAM -- he quickly retracts his hand, seeing-- 

           The meat of his palm’s been SHOT OFF. Eyes darting, he wraps 
           his shirt around the wound with his shaking other hand. White 
           shirt instantly DYED CRIMSON, as--

           BILLINGS

           Flattens himself, flinching at each gunshot. He looks over at 
           Pearce reloading THE PISTOL, just inches away, as-- 

           Pearce pops up from behind a gunwale, FIRES-- 

           EXT. RIVERBANK - SAME

           A dragoon’s BLASTED off his horse. The man crashes down; sits 
           up, trying to roll clear, just as--

                                 ABEL (O.S.)
                        Make way. 

           --Abel TRAMPLES over him. Doesn’t even look back. Relentless. 
           Jumping his horse from bank to river and back again, aiming 
           his rifle over the crook of his elbow-- BLAM--
           EXT. KEELBOAT (MOVING) - SAME

           --the shot catches Felton in the shoulder! Red mist explodes 
           out of him as he’s SPUN over the SIDE and-- 

           INTO THE WATER. Felton SURFACES, bloodied, frantically 
           clambering for the passing hull. Greenhill reaches down--

                        GREENHILL
                                                         FELTON
                                              Don’t let me go. Oh, Jesus!
           Grab my hand-- grab it!
                 (catches his wrist)
           I got you, I got you!

           Greenhill starts PULLING HIM UP, when--

           A FUCKING CROCODILE roars up like the wrath of God, ripping 
           Felton from his grasp. Greenhill stumbles back in horror as 
           crocodiles swarm, tearing into Felton like a chew toy.

           Greenhill watches, chest heaving. We don’t see what he sees, 
           but that’s small consolation. The sound is worse. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        WHITEWATER AHEAD -- WHITEWATER!!

           And things somehow JUST GOT WORSE as Greenhill TURNS TO SEE--

           EXT. RIVERBANK - SAME

           A RUMBLING. Abel rounds a bend, pulling back on the reins.

                                 ABEL
                        Whoa-- 

           Up ahead, Greenhill’s keelboat is SWEPT OUT OF FRAME, as if 
           it fell off the Earth. Swallowed by a WHITEWATER CASCADE. 
           Like a double-black diamond, with teeth.

                                 ABEL
                        Prepare to go around. We’ll cut 
                        them off at river’s end.

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        That’ll take days! We’ll never 
                        retrieve the bodies. 

                                 ABEL
                        Perhaps you’d prefer to swim it. 

           EXT. KEELBOAT (MOVING) - SAME

           Our five surviving escapees struggle to hang on, hurtling 
           down the roaring cataract. White foam pounds over Greenhill 
           as he staggers for the FISHING GEAR, balanced on a railing-- 
                                 BILLINGS
                        [...inaudible yelling...!]

           Greenhill cups an ear, turning, as--

           --WHAM. He’s knocked off his feet by a FALLEN TREE. Its 
           jagged branches RAKE OVER THE DECK like CLAWS, sweeping the 
           fishing gear into the vortex, scraping over Pearce’s body--

           Pearce’s eyes dart over the boat, patting himself down--

                                 PEARCE
                        The pistol! Where’s the pistol!?

                                 WHYLIE
                            (points frantically)
                        [...JABBERING, YELLING...]

           Greenhill’s squinting eyes follow Whylie’s jabbing finger, 
           peering through the haze, as-- 

           A COLOSSAL ROCK FORMATION slams into focus. Dead ahead. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Fuck me. 

           Greenhill throws himself at the tiller-- SHOVING-- Pearce and 
           Whylie joining him, all STRAINING TOGETHER, boat threatening 
           to tip over as it adjusts course-- NOSE INCHING OVER--

           --KARUNNNNCH. Everyone JOLTS FORWARD as THE ROCK SCRAPES the 
           hull. Boards buckle and splinter all down the boat until--

           They’re SPUN CLEAR. Everything slowly QUIETS. Waters calming. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        We’re out. We made it. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Right! Miserable stream -- get 
                        buggered! Ha, ha!

           Instantly, all along the hull, WATER begins to spray in.

                                 PEARCE
                        Bollocks. We lost the pistol.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Lost Felton too. Or hadn’t you 
                        noticed?

                                 PEARCE
                        Always figured we’d lose someone on 
                        the river. I’m just grateful it 
                        wasn’t you, Robert. 
                                 GREENHILL
                            (tosses Pearce a BUCKET)
                        Start bailing.

           Off Pearce, half-smiling, watching Greenhill like a hawk, we--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FAR DOWNRIVER - EVENING

           Bat silhouettes fill the air as stars slowly become visible. 

                                 BILLINGS (O.S.)
                        In the service, we called those 
                        blighty wounds.

           In the stern of the keelboat, Billings dresses Greenhill’s 
           wounded hand -- animated, wry. Almost his old self again. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Bad enough to get you home without 
                        getting you in a grave. ‘Sposed to 
                        report when men done it themselves, 
                        but I never had the heart.
                            (nudges him a little)
                        But you caught it honestly. Right 
                        in the meat, ay, Robert? Robert.

           Billings nudges him, eyes flickering down; Greenhill follows 
           his gaze, seeing, hidden among the bandages -- THE PISTOL. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Thank you, Thom. This is feeling 
                        better already.

           Greenhill furtively reaches down, grabbing the pistol, as-- 
           Billings stands up, sloshing through TEN INCHES OF WATER to 
           help Whylie bail out the tilting boat. Calls up to Pearce:

                                 BILLINGS
                        You blokes get tired up there, let 
                        us know, right? Don’t want to be 
                        neglecting the important work.

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        This is the important work.

           In the prow, a nervous Kennelly tries to keep still as Pearce 
           stands over him, using the fishing knife to SHAVE HIS HEAD. 

                                 KENNELLY
                            (sips Feeney’s flask)
                        I pray your hands don’t shake. 
                                 BILLINGS
                        While you’re at it, pray the river 
                        out of our hull. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        He’s right. We’re sinking. We have 
                        to get off this boat. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Best we find out where exactly we 
                        are before doing that. 

           Greenhill scans their surroundings. The river almost still 
           now as they drift through an eerily silent gorge. An ancient 
           place, walls covered in Aboriginal ROCK PAINTINGS. 

           Whylie mutters reverentially, bowing to a painted spiral. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        What’s that one he’s bowing at?

                                 PEARCE
                        Means the dreamtime.
                            (as he shaves Kennelly)
                        Abos believe the world’s got two 
                        parts. The part we see. And 
                        another. Parallel to this one. Full 
                        of loved ones, long gone. Children, 
                        not yet born. A place men only 
                        visit when they dream. Or they die.

           Greenhill eyes the spiral as it recedes...

                                 KENNELLY
                        Bloody stupid, you ask me. 

                                 PEARCE
                            (wipes the knife clean)
                        Explains your lack of curiosity. 
                        Your head’s already full.

                                 BILLINGS
                        You got to be joking. 

           Greenhill frowns, seeing -- with his hair gone, Kennelly’s 
           scalp is covered in tattoos: A MAP of the ENTIRE ISLAND. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        When you told me you’d filled your 
                        head with a map of the island, I 
                        thought that meant memorized it--

                                 KENNELLY
                        Would’ve hurt a lot less. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        With your brains? Not likely. 
                                 KENNELLY
                        Getting real tired of your mouth.

                                 BILLINGS
                        That’s rich, coming from you.

                                 PEARCE
                            (as Kennelly tenses--)
                        Hold still.

           Pearce traces a finger over Kennelly’s skull, plotting their 
           location. He frowns. Squints up at -- SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS. 

                                 PEARCE
                        We’re south of the Western Tiers. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        No. No. We was supposed to get off 
                        this river long ago, head inland. 
                        We have to go back--

                                 BILLINGS
                        With Cuthbert’s boy on us? We ought 
                        just drown ourselves here and spare 
                        him the ammunition. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (stares at the mountains)
                        What if we cut over them?

           Silence. Everyone thinking that one over, until--

                                 BILLINGS
                        I prefer the plan where we drown 
                        ourselves. Same result; less painful.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m not saying it’d be easy. But it 
                        puts a wall between us and Abel. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Shove your wall. We get stranded up 
                        there at night, we’ll freeze.

           Whylie grunts, seconding that. But Pearce’s eyes kindle. 

                                 PEARCE
                        No... No, we’d have to complete the 
                        crossing by day.
                            (taking to the idea)
                        Once we’re up there, there’ll be no 
                        stopping. We climb ‘til our lungs 
                        turn to flame, our legs to cold 
                        jam. But if we make it to the far 
                        side by sunset, we’re home free. 
                                 KENNELLY
                        And if we don’t?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...If we don’t, we die.

           That lands. The five surviving escapees stare at the distant 
           mountains. Whylie pulls on Feeney’s GREEN COAT, buttoning it 
           up. Then, almost afraid to ask:

                                 BILLINGS
                        Is there anything to eat up there?

           The men exchange glances. No idea, as we--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Rain spatters over the portrait of Feeney’s wife, as--

           EXT. RIVER’S END - DAY

           --A BOOT stomps through her face. A dragoon kicks the torn 
           canvas away as Abel and his men pore over the grounded 
           keelboat, now abandoned, far downriver. 

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        Near as we can tell, they struck 
                        out that-away. Two days ago.

           Abel looks up: Towering in the distance -- The Western Tiers. 

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        They’s as good as dead up there. Cold 
                        don’t take them, starvation will. 

                                 ABEL
                        Justice can’t be meted out on a 
                        corpse. My father wants them alive.

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        We can’t follow them up the 
                        mountain. The shale up there’s too 
                        loose. Horses will never make it. 

           Abel studies a map, a thin smile spreading--

                                 ABEL
                        Funny thing about kurdaitcha, 
                        Captain. He can’t outrun his prey. 
                        So he relies on patience. Can go 
                        months without eating. He finds a 
                        spot, feels promising, settles in -- 
                        and waits for prey to come to him.
                            (folds up his map)
                        Send word to my father. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABEL (CONT'D)
                        Tell him to meet us at Mole Creek 
                        Canyon. Tell him -- I have them.

           Abel spurs his horse, leading them toward the WESTERN TIERS--

           EXT. WESTERN TIERS - CONTINUOUS

           --As we begin a LONG, SLOW ZOOM into the mountains. The great 
           rock face slowly gaining definition, as we start to hear:

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        “By the light of a candle,
                             I happened to spy--
                        A pretty young couple
                             together did lie...”

           FIVE ANT-LIKE FIGURES come into focus, making their way up a 
           narrow ridge, Pearce climbing in front, singing a BAWDY SONG.

           Far behind them, Greenhill spiders from ledge to tree to 
           ledge. The climb increasingly arduous, narrow trail twisting, 
           steepening. He pauses to knead his BAD ANKLE.

                                 PEARCE
                        “Said Nelly to Pearce:
                             ‘If you’ll pull up my smock,
                        You’ll find a young hen
                             full as good as your--’”

                                 KENNELLY
                        Enough already. If I fall to my 
                        death, the last image I want in me’ 
                        head is your cock. No offense. 

                                 PEARCE
                        At this height, you’d survive a 
                        fall. Unfortunate for you. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Why unfortunate?

           Without looking, Pearce points to the sky. Vultures circling. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Rats with wings. I’d fight ‘em off.

                                 PEARCE
                        If you hadn’t broke too many parts 
                        on the way down -- maybe. But in 
                        time, you’d weaken. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        See you’ve given this some thought.
                                 PEARCE
                        First law of nature. It governs 
                        beasts, lovers, nations, the very 
                        stars above: That which is weaker is 
                        consumed by that which is stronger. 
                        So shall it be with us all.

           Further back, Greenhill CLOCKS THAT... Billings muttering-- 

                                 BILLINGS
                        I’d give gold bullion to plug his 
                        mouth up with horse manure.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I was just thinking about what you 
                        said earlier. About Pearce’s plan. 
                            (off Billings’ frown)
                        We lost one man in the escape. Lost 
                        another on the river. That’s two. 
                        Pearce said he needed five. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        ...Had a term for that in the 
                        service, too. Cannon fodder.

           Greenhill peers up at Pearce, who has RESUMED SINGING, as--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Question is, who’s nex--

           --THE LEDGE BREAKS OFF UNDER GREENHILL! His cheekbone SLAMS 
           into rock as he slides down the mountain, scrabbling for a 
           grip, tumbling into an ABYSS, when-- 

           WHYLIE snags his wrist. Greenhill dangles, watching pebbles 
           shrink away toward the ground far below.

           UP ABOVE

           PEARCE shouts down to Greenhill and Whylie: 

                                 PEARCE
                        When you ladies is done resting, I 
                        suggest you quicken your pace. It’s 
                        already half-noon!

           Pearce chuckles, watching Whylie pull Greenhill up, when-- he 
           squints, noticing -- THE PISTOL protruding from the back of 
           Greenhill’s waistband. And Pearce stops laughing. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           Whylie finally manages to get Greenhill back on firm ground.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thanks... Thank-you. How do I say--
                                 WHYLIE
                        [...Nods; mutters his language...]

                                 GREENHILL
                        In your language-- your words, is 
                        there a-- ‘friend?’ ‘Friend’?

           Whylie stares, long and hard. Mutters something. Sounds like:

                                 WHYLIE
                        Gamarada.
                            (subtitle:)
                        [Friend.]

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Game-redda.
                            (subtitle:)
                        [I am the shit spirit.]

           Whylie stares. BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Claps Greenhill’s back.

                                 WHYLIE
                        Game-redda. Game-redda.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (laughs along, confused)
                        Yes. Good. Friend.

           Whylie wipes his eyes, still laughing, helping Greenhill up. 
           Overhead, the sun has begun its descent.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           YELLOW BERRIES sprout from a shrub. Kennelly stuffs some in 
           his mouth. Chewing ravenously. He forces them down, then--

           --RETCHES. Billings shakes his head as he trudges past.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Yew Berries. Next time, listen when 
                        I tell you not to eat something.   

           Kennelly scowls, watches him walk on as -- Pearce sidles up.

                                 PEARCE
                        You know, you shouldn’t let them 
                        disrespect you like they do. You’re 
                        the one with the map on his head. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        What’s it to you?
                                 PEARCE
                            (a smile)
                        Does memory serve correctly that 
                        one of the crimes you were put away 
                        for -- was pick-pocketing?

                                 KENNELLY
                        ...What about it?

           EXT. OUTCROPPING - LATE AFTERNOON

           Greenhill, Whylie, and Billings drag one another over an 
           outcropping, squinting up at the summit, still far above them. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        This is no climb. It’s a bloody 
                        endurance test. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Alright let’s rest a moment--!

           Everyone sags to the ground. For a moment we just listen to 
           their LABORED BREATHING. Pearce remains standing, but even he 
           shows signs of exhaustion, mopping his brow. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Sun’s dropping. Need to go faster. 

                                 KENNELLY
                            (points at Greenhill)
                        It’s that ankle of his. If not for 
                        him holding us back, we’d be part-
                        way down the far side!

                                 BILLINGS
                        We haven’t eaten in two days. We’re 
                        all slower than we should be.

           Greenhill watches Whylie use the knife to sharpen a stick. 
           Hefting it onto his shoulder. Aiming it at a VULTURE. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Crazy Abo. Have to be quicker than 
                        Cain to spear one of them.

           Whylie HURLS the spear -- CLIPPING the vulture’s wing. It 
           squawks, scattering feathers. 

           The men exchange glances. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SCRUB TREE, growing out of the mountainside. Kennelly 
           descends upon it, ripping it out by the roots. A mass of 
           STONES CRUMBLING from its base, as--
           Kennelly SNAPS off branches. Everyone whittling with RAVENOUS 
           FURY, forming JAGGED POINTS--

                                                        BILLINGS
                                                (looks around)
                        GREENHILL
           Whittle fast, before they fly 
           away--
                                              Anyone eaten vulture before?

                                 PEARCE
                        The meat is gamey. Flavored by the 
                        blood of every beast it’s eaten--

           Good enough for Billings, who hurls his spear; the others do 
           the same, vultures SQUAWKING, SCATTERING as-- 

           Greenhill whittles another stick, when -- a PEBBLE pings off 
           his shoulder. Then another. He frowns, glancing upward to see 
           MORE STONES sliding down from above.

           THUD. A vulture lands at Pearce’s feet, spear in its side.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Fuck me, he got one!

           Everyone eagerly surrounds Pearce, who crouches over the 
           twitching bird, SNAPPING its neck, when-- 

           A distant DEEP RUMBLING reaches their ears. Getting louder. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        That’s not cannon fire is it?

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. It isn’t. 

           Pearce follows Greenhill’s gaze UP THE MOUNTAIN. From here, 
           it looks like the mountaintop is MELTING. SLOUGHING OFF.

                                 KENNELLY
                            (color leaving his face)
                        Is-- is that a--

                                 PEARCE
                        AVALANCHE! Move, now--

           The men SCATTER, ground now beginning to SHAKE-- 

           And if any of us has ever wondered in our nightmares what 
           it’s like to be INSIDE A ROCK-SLIDE, wonder no more. 

           The world SHAKES to a BLUR as a TIDAL WAVE of boulders and 
           rocks pound over, around, into the men, the sound of it an 
           EAR-SPLITTING ROAR, like an army of stone gods in battle.

           GREENHILL 

           Chokes on dust, managing to squeeze into a crevice, squinting 
           through the haze to see, racing toward him-- 
           WHYLIE

           Dodging rock-slabs, leaping nimbly from foot to foot--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (coughing)
                        OVER HERE-- OVE-- 

           A BOULDER slams into Whylie. Blasting him out of frame so 
           fast, Greenhill wonders if he imagined it. Ducking down, as--

           EXT. WESTERN TIERS - MOMENTS LATER

           WIDE: A cloud of dust billows, blanketing the mountaintop. 
           The avalanche slows... and finally, stops. SILENCE, then--

           COUGHING, as a filthy Greenhill crawls from his crevice. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Billings? WHYLIE!

                                 KENNELLY
                            (climbs down from a tree)
                        Damn fool. Keep your voice down. 
                        You wanna trigger another one?

           Greenhill catches his breath -- when he notices something. 
           Patting his waistband, realizing: The pistol is gone. 
           Greenhill’s eyes sweep the area, when-- 

           He spots WHYLIE pinned under rocks. Straining to get out. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Whylie. 

                                 WHYLIE
                        [...Jabbering and grunting...]

                                 GREENHILL
                            (scrambling over)
                        We’ll dig you out. Everybody--

           A dust-covered Billings hurries over, clearing rocks, Whylie 
           helping dig with a battered free hand. Greenhill tries to pry 
           up a HUGE SLAB with a tree-branch. It SNAPS--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Kennelly, find me another--

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        Don’t bother.

           Pearce appears. Unscathed. Silhouetted by the SETTING SUN.
                                 PEARCE
                        There isn’t time. Temperature’s 
                        dropping too fast.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What are you--

                                 PEARCE
                        Every moment you waste digging him 
                        out, you’re digging your own grave. 
                        In half-an-hour it’ll be below 
                        freezing up here. Your breath is 
                        already betraying you, brother. 

           Greenhill looks down -- his BREATH is beginning to MIST.

                                 GREENHILL
                        We need Whylie. He gets us passage 
                        through Aboriginal territory.

                                 PEARCE
                        Ain’t nobody going through Abo 
                        territory if we freeze on this 
                        fucking mountain. Leave him. 

           Greenhill’s gaze shoots to Billings -- but he’s stopped 
           digging as well. Seeing the logic in Pearce’s words.

                                 KENNELLY
                            (spits)
                        He’s just a darkie. 

           Whylie reaches for Greenhill, eyes desperate. Plaintive.

                                 WHYLIE
                        Game-redda? Game-redda?

                                 GREENHILL
                        No.
                            (making a decision)
                        As long as this man’s alive, we’re 
                        making every effort to dig him out. 
                        I’ll do it alone if I have to. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Unacceptable. We’re already down 
                        three men. I can’t lose another.

           Greenhill turns back to Whylie, resumes digging--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Then it seems you’ve got no choice 
                        but to help us bot-- 

           --BLAM. PEARCE SHOOTS WHYLIE THROUGH THE HEAD. Presses 
           FEENEY’S PISTOL to the shocked Greenhill’s temple. Cocks it.
                                 PEARCE
                        There. I helped. 

           Kennelly backs away, hands up, face white. Billings swallows, 
           legs weakening. Has to steady himself. 

           Greenhill’s eyes BURN, shaking with adrenaline, hissing 
           visible breaths through clenched teeth. Pearce just smiles, 
           poking Greenhill’s cheek with the muzzle. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Feel that? Pounding in your ribs?  
                        Taste that burning at the back of 
                        your throat? It’s called hate. Use 
                        it proper, it’ll carry you clean 
                        over this mountain. My gift to you. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m going to kill you.

                                 PEARCE
                        Are you now? The man you sought 
                        out. The only man on this whole 
                        island who can carry you back to 
                        your family hearth? You really 
                        think you can do it without me?
                            (lowers the gun)
                        That’s a question only you can 
                        answer. But this, I promise: the 
                        next bullet you make me waste will 
                        be the one going into you. 

           Pearce stuffs the gun in his belt. Stalking off. Kennelly 
           trails after him. As if in a daze, Billings follows too.

           LIGHT SNOW begins to fall. Greenhill is alone. He turns back 
           to Whylie. Reaches down. Fingers coming back red. He traces a 
           line down his own forehead in Whylie’s blood. Starts walking. 

           Snow dusts the motionless Aborigine like angel tears.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ICY RIDGE - NIGHT

           SNOW SWIRLS as the men trudge upward, a line of wretched 
           souls, tied together now with Feeney’s rope, Pearce in front, 
           then Greenhill, their threadbare rags giving no quarter. 

                         KENNELLY
                                                        GREENHILL
           [...Inaudible shouting...]
                                              --What?!

                                 KENNELLY
                        MY LEGS! I CAN’T FEEL THEM!
                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s exposure! Our muscles are 
                        shutting down! We have to rest, or 
                        we’ll die!

           Greenhill scans the mountainside. The clouds are beneath them 
           now. Flashes of lightning flickering inside them. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Where?! There’s nowhere. No rest. 
                        We keep-- moving!

                                 KENNELLY
                        I can’t. 

                                 PEARCE
                        We’re near the top. Taste the air. 
                        Unsullied by the lungs of men. We 
                        may be the first ever to breathe it.
                            (takes a STEP FORWARD)
                        It will get easier from here--

           --A loud CRACKING NOISE. The men halt. Gazes all turning to 
           ground under their feet, as--

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Nobody move. 

           Greenhill gingerly crouches, brushing snow off the ground. 
           And his FACE WHITENS, realizing they’re standing on-- 

           A SHEET OF ICE. Cracks already spiderwebbing through it. 

                                                        GREENHILL
                         KENNELLY
           Go-back, go-back-- 
                                              --No wait!

           Kennelly tries to BACKPEDAL-- and the ICE GIVES WAY! He 
           FALLS, rope pulling taut, YANKING the rest of them down too! 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - SAME

           WHAM, WHAM-- Billings, Kennelly, and Greenhill SLAM DOWN on a 
           lower cliff. Greenhill blinks up, stunned, only to see--

           PEARCE falling wide, OVERSHOOTING THE CLIFF, rope pulling 
           TAUT again, and-- 

           --JERKING the rest of them TOWARD THE EDGE! Greenhill manages 
           to brace himself at the last second, Kennelly and Billings 
           clinging to the icy rocks behind him, all breathing hard-- 

                                 KENNELLY
                            (glancing back)
                        Pearce -- Pearce?!
                                 BILLINGS
                        Can you see him?! Where is he?!

           Greenhill’s eyes trace his rope to the CLIFF’S JAGGED EDGE, 
           where it rubs and twists back and forth, as if Pearce is 
           STRUGGLING below, dangling just out of sight.

           Greenhill’s free hand reaches for the rope-- when it starts 
           to FRAY. WINNOWING. Sawing along the cliff’s edge. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Can you pull him up?!

           ON GREENHILL. Making a decision. His hand falls to his side. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (just staring at the rope)
                        ...I’m trying.

           The rope suddenly SNAPS. Relieved of a tremendous burden on 
           the other end. Greenhill waits for a THUD. But it never comes.

                                 KENNELLY
                        What happened?!

                                 GREENHILL
                        He’s gone.

                                 BILLINGS
                        He fell?! Should we go back?

                                 GREENHILL
                        No.
                            (rising to his feet)
                        We keep moving.

           Billings stares at Greenhill, who just STARTS WALKING as we-- 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           The snow has turned to SLEET. Wind HOWLING, stinging their 
           eyes as the men inch up an ICY, STEEPENING TRAIL-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I swear I can almost see it-- just 
                        a few more yards--

           The crest the trail, only to find -- THEIR OWN TRACKS in 
           front of them. Now partially filled with snow. The peak seems 
           farther away than ever. Billings falls to his knees.

                                 KENNELLY
                        I told you we went the wrong way at 
                        that last switch-back! I told you!

                                 BILLINGS
                        I’m finished.
                                 GREENHILL
                        No. NO--
                            (tries to pull him up)
                        MOLLY. Think about Molly.

                                 BILLINGS
                        There was never a Molly, you idiot.
                            (Greenhill scowls)
                        I’m not even a deserter. A Colonel 
                        died on my operating table. Wasn’t 
                        even hurt bad. I was just drunk. 
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I thought 
                        it would make you feel better.

           Greenhill’s gaze slackens. A light in his eyes seems to dim.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Someone’s coming.

           A FIGURE in the storm. Stalking toward them, spectral. The 
           men can’t even move. Greenhill clutches the knife, when-- 

                                 HUSKY VOICE (O.S.)
                        “By the light of a candle,
                             I happened to spy--
                        A pretty young couple
                             together did lie...”

           --PEARCE appears out of the storm. In Whylie’s GREEN COAT.

                                 PEARCE
                        Follow me. 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           A TINY FLAME flickers, Pearce cupping his hands around it like 
           a newborn, flames catching tinder as he nudges kindling around 
           it. Greenhill and Kennelly warm themselves desperately. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Not too fast. Gotta warm the blood 
                        slowly, or you’ll lose your toes--

           Greenhill blows on his fists, eyeing Pearce’s GREEN COAT.

                                 KENNELLY
                        W-where were you? After the rope 
                        gave way, we thought--

                                 PEARCE
                        “Gave way.” 
                            (looks at Greenhill)
                        That what happened?

                                 GREENHILL
                        It tore on the rocks. 
                                 PEARCE
                        Mmm. 

           Pearce just stares at Greenhill. But he stares right back. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Whylie was wearing that coat. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Keen eye you’ve got. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You doubled back for it?

                                 PEARCE
                        After the rope... gave way-- didn’t 
                        have much choice, did I? Besides, I 
                        needed sustenance. We all do.

                                 BILLINGS
                            (frowns)
                        Sustenance? What sustenance?

                                 PEARCE
                        Should have dug it out before. 
                        Carried it with us. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Dug what out?

           They watch in morbid fascination as Pearce crosses the cave, 
           reaches behind a rock, dragging from behind it...

           ...The DEAD VULTURE.

                                 PEARCE
                            (tosses it to Greenhill)
                        Dress it. I’ll gather more wood.

           Pearce stalks out into the howling wind. Greenhill looks to 
           Billings, who chuckles to himself-- 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Altitude must be getting to me. A 
                        second there, almost thought he was 
                        about to pull out the old Abo.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Don’t be ridiculous. 
                            (grabs the bird)
                        Was hardly any meat on him.

           Kennelly cackles, PLUCKING FEATHERS from the mangy bird. But 
           an unsettling feeling has been stirred in Greenhill, as we--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           CLOSE ON: Teeth chewing. Mouths sucking bones clean. Picking 
           scraps from fingernails. Pearce nurses FEENEY’S FLASK.

                                 PEARCE
                        Toast, gents. We’re halfway. 
                        Tomorrow, we enter Abo territory. 
                        Then the desert. Then Harbortown.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Where is it you think you’ll go 
                        if we get there?

                                 PEARCE
                        Dozen ships come and go every day. 
                        Can go anywhere you like.

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. I asked -- where will you go?

           Pearce looks at him, as if considering it for the first time.

                                 PEARCE
                        Nowhere. Remember, mate? You’re 
                        going to kill me.

           SILENCE. Billings and Kennelly exchange glances. Pearce claps 
           Greenhill on the back, grinning--

                                 PEARCE
                        That’s just how he said it, right? 
                        “I’m going to kill you.”

                                 KENNELLY
                            (laughing now)
                        “I’m going to kill you.” Ha, ha!

                                 BILLINGS
                        Thought he’s gonna burst a vessel.

                                 PEARCE
                            (sips the flask, singing)
                        Down the mines, no sunlight shines 
                        Those pits they’re black as hell--

           Greenhill looks at Pearce, surprised. He’s been a miner, too? 

                                 PEARCE
                        In mud and slime they do their time 
                        It’s Paddy’s prison cell...

           Pearce offers him the flask. Greenhill looks at it. At 
           Pearce. And takes it. Sips. Quietly starts singing along.

                                 GREENHILL & PEARCE
                        Backs will break and muscles ache
                        In hell there’s no time to dream--
                            (singing louder now)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREENHILL & PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Of fields and farms, a woman’s arms
                        Just -- dig -- that -- bloody seam!

           Kennelly snickers. Even Billings can’t repress a smile, as-- 
           WE PULL AWAY from the singing men, from the cave, and--

                                                                CUT TO:

           UNKNOWN SPYGLASS POV: Looking up at the distant snow-swept 
           slopes. Totally dark... save for a single dot of orange 
           flickering inside the cave, smoke rising up, as we-

           EXT. MOLE CREEK CANYON - DAY

           JOHN CUTHBERT, in full uniform, rides at the head of fresh 
           soldiers, hauling EMPTY WHEELED CAGES as they enter a CAMP at 
           the canyon’s mouth. All around, dragoons rise, saluting. 

           Abel emerges from a tent, caught off guard.

                                 ABEL
                        Father. I only sent word a week 
                        ago. You must have rode all night.

                                 CUTHBERT
                            (dismounts, curt)
                        I was told you’d re-acquired the 
                        prisoners. Where are they?

                                 ABEL
                        I-- here. See for yourself.

           Abel leads his father over to a table with a TOPOGRAPHIC MAP.

                                 ABEL
                        They camped here, in the storm; 
                        just this morning, I spied them 
                        here, on the descent-- 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Then -- you don’t have them.

                                 ABEL
                        They should be along any minute. 
                        Every path off that mountain 
                        converges at this canyon.
                            (pointing up)
                        Right there. I’ve posted riflemen at 
                        every ridge. There’s no escape. 

           Cuthbert frowns, stares into the canyon. Back at the map.
                                 CUTHBERT
                        So you stopped chasing them.
                            (Abel hesitates--)
                        And instead, decided to camp here. 
                        And wait for them to come to you.

                                 ABEL
                        ...Yes, sir.

           Abel stares at him, eager for approval. Cuthbert looks up. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Not a bad bit of soldiering. Well 
                        done, boy.

           Relief floods Abel’s face. For the first time in our story, 
           Cuthbert regards him with something like paternal affection. 

                                 ABEL
                        Thank you, father. 
                            (turns to go, eagerly)
                        I-- I posted a watchman. At the top 
                        of the ridge; I’ll go check if he’s 
                        seen hide or hair of ‘em yet--

           Abel pulls out his father’s POCKETWATCH to return it, but--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Keep it. Your mother would be 
                        pleased. Yes. I think she would. 

           Abel smiles with his whole face. He slides the watch back 
           into his vest, when-- 

           --He DROPS IT. But Cuthbert catches it. Returns it to Abel. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Be careful. 

                                 ABEL
                            (a warm smile)
                        Don’t worry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON: A uniformed WATCHMAN... as his THROAT IS SLIT OPEN. 

           EXT. TOP OF THE RIDGE - SAME

           The watchman sags over like a sack of grain. Blood pooling. 
           Pearce tilts his head, wiping the fishing knife on his leg.

                                 KENNELLY
                        He fell funny.
                                 PEARCE
                            (grabs the soldier’s rifle)
                        Seen one land holding his pecker 
                        once. Me mate thought the corpse 
                        was getting saucy with him.

           Greenhill stares at the body, eyes goggling up at him, as if 
           in accusation. Greenhill reaches down and gently closes them. 
           MUTED FOOTSTEPS. Billings hurries toward them, keeping low--

                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s no good. There’s no other way 
                        down. Not without more rope. Only way 
                        off this mountain, is through them.

           They peer over the ridge: Far below, CUTHBERT orders more 
           soldiers into position. They fan out. Rifles up. Eyes sharp. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Could go back up. Wait them out.  

                                 KENNELLY
                        Shove that. My balls only just thawed. 
                        Down there, they got guns, rations-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Horses. 

           They follow Greenhill’s determined gaze to the HORSE PADDOCK.

                                 PEARCE
                            (nods, gears turning)
                        ...A’right. One of us stays here, 
                        draws their fire. Other three makes 
                        a run for that paddock. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Draws their fire -- how?

                                 PEARCE
                        By shooting Cuthbert. 

           Said it like he’s describing the weather. Greenhill frowns, 
           watching Pearce prep the rifle--

                                 BILLINGS
                        You shoot a Commandant, you’ll 
                        never leave this canyon alive. The 
                        whole army will come after you-- 

                                 PEARCE
                        Who says I’m gonna shoot him? 

           Pearce smiles. The men exchange glances.

                                                                CUT TO:
           THE KNIFE SPINS on a stone. Men in a circle around it, 
           waiting for it to STOP. It slows, pointing at Greenhill...

           ...Then wobbles another half-inch -- pointed at BILLINGS.

                                 BILLINGS
                        I can’t do it. I’m a doctor. I took 
                        an oath to do no harm. 

                                 PEARCE
                            (extends the rifle butt)
                        Aim for the shine of his buttons. 
                        Even if it goes wide, you’ll catch 
                        a piece of him. Liver. Groin. So 
                        long as Cuthbert goes down.

                                 BILLINGS
                        I never even fired at a man before. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Same as firing at a rabbit. Just 
                        bigger. And a bit more blood.

                                 BILLINGS
                        What if I say no?

           Pearce, picking up the knife.

                                 PEARCE
                        You don’t.

           Billings’ eyes dart between the rifle and the knife. He 
           swallows; reaches for the rifle, hand trembling, when-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Wait.
                            (heads turn)
                        I’ll do it. I’ll shoot him. 

           But Pearce holds onto the rifle, studying Greenhill, curious--

                         BILLINGS
           Robert, what are you--?
                                                        KENNELLY
                                              --Give him the gun. Let ‘im 
                                              stick his pecker in the wasp 
                                              nest, that’s what he wants.

                                 PEARCE
                        Ten days ago you turned green at 
                        the sight of blood. Expect me to 
                        believe now you’d kill a man?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Tried to kill you. Last night. 

           Pearce’s eyes narrow, mind working... Billings and Kennelly 
           exchange an uncertain glance, when -- Pearce smiles.
                                 PEARCE
                        It’s a’right. I didn’t take it 
                        personal. 
                            (hands him the rifle)
                        Consider this your penance. 

           Greenhill accepts the rifle. Pearce leads Kennelly off. But 
           Billings waits a moment, staring at Greenhill, perplexed-- 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Hell you think you’re doing?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Mouth of the canyon. See that tree?
                            (Billings squints)
                        Soon as you hear the shot, grab the 
                        horses and I’ll meet you there. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        You’ll never make it--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thom. I’ll make it.
                            (Billings frowns; turns--)
                        ...But if I don’t. You get off this 
                        island. You go to County Wicklow, 
                        Ireland. Find Sarah Greenhill. Make 
                        sure she’s taken care of. Tell her--

                                 BILLINGS
                        Tell her what?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Tell her I never stopped digging.

           EXT. LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Greenhill crawls to the end of a rocky ledge. The camp now 
           100 YARDS BELOW HIM. He spots Cuthbert. Reaches for the 
           rifle. Squinting down the barrel.

           RIFLE POV: The gun-sights line up. Hovering over Cuthbert’s 
           chest, as he feeds his horse. Patting the animal’s side. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           Greenhill’s squinting eye opens. He glances to the FAR RIDGE, 
           where -- Pearce and the others keep low, ready to make a run 
           for the horses. Pearce GIVES A SIGNAL--

           Greenhill AIMS; finger hovering over the trigger, when--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (eyes open, hesitates)
                        ...I would have known.
           And Greenhill ADJUSTS HIS AIM. TILTING the gun-sights DOWN. 
           Aiming instead at CUTHBERT’S LEG. About to FIRE, when--  

           ANOTHER HAMMER COCKS. A PISTOL appearing behind his ear: 

                                 ABEL
                        Pegged you for a troublemaker from 
                        the start, mumbler. Never allowed 
                        you could be this much trouble.
                            (a grin; eyes flashing--)
                        Where are the others?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Dead. 

                                 ABEL
                        Not much of a liar, though.

           Abel reaches for Greenhill’s rifle...

           ...But he freezes, eyes tracing Greenhill’s aim down into the 
           camp to -- HIS FATHER. Abel’s face twists with outrage. 

                                 ABEL
                        You-- you miserable swine--

           WHAM-- Abel PISTOL-WHIPS Greenhill’s ear. And that had to 
           hurt, Greenhill swallowing a pained cry, Abel CALLING OUT:  

                                 ABEL
                        Up here! I FOUN--

           --Greenhill SPRINGS UP, TACKLING ABEL! 

           EXT. DOWN BELOW - SAME

           A DRAGOON looks up -- just as Greenhill and Abel ROLL out of 
           VIEW a 100 yards above him. He frowns, trying to decide 
           whether or not he imagined it...

           EXT. LEDGE - SAME

           Greenhill and Abel wrestle for control of the pistol. Brutal. 
           Up close, personal. Abel trying to SHOUT AGAIN:

                                 ABEL
                        UP H-- 

           Greenhill’s HAND CLAMPS around ABEL’S NECK. Trapping the 
           words in his throat. Abel CHOKING. Greenhill SQUEEZING; all 
           of a sudden he looks frightening, every muscle taut. Abel’s 
           eyes BULGING UP at him when--

           The bracelet of Sarah’s hair slides down Greenhill’s wrist, 
           catching his eye. He BLINKS...
           And pulls back from the brink. Grip slackening-- 

                                 ABEL
                        Arrrhggh--!

           Abel makes a FIERCE LUNGE and the two go rolling over rocks, 
           each taking a turn on top, struggling wildly for the pistol-- 

           Greenhill ends up underneath Abel, who presses his advantage, 
           spittle stringing down as he turns the muzzle toward 
           Greenhill’s chest, inch by inch...  

                        GREENHILL
                                                          ABEL
           No-nono--
                                              --Shh-- shhh--

           Abel’s FINGER claws for the trigger... Greenhill’s arms 
           shaking as he struggles desperately to push away the gun... 

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           --BLAM. A distant gunshot ECHOES from far above the camp. 

           Cuthbert’s head SNAPS UP toward the sound. He rises, starts 
           walking; JOGGING now, soldiers following him, as--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Everyone on me!

           EXT. ACROSS THE CANYON - SAME

           Pearce, Kennelly and Billings watch from their hiding spot as  
           down below, THE CAMP EMPTIES. Pearce gestures to the others; 
           they follow him, creeping towards THE HORSE PADDOCK, as-- 

           EXT. LEDGE - SAME

           Greenhill and Abel LOCK EYES, faces INCHES APART... 

           ...And Abel rolls off him. Eyes wide as a child’s as he tears 
           open his uniform, finding A HOLE BLOWN THROUGH HIS CHEST. 

                                 ABEL
                        You -- you bled me.

           Greenhill’s eyes dart from Abel to the PISTOL IN HIS OWN 
           HAND, instantly disgusted with what he’s done. He drops the 
           gun like it’s on fire. Reaches for Abel to help him--

                                 ABEL
                            (recoils, astonished)
                        You bled me. You k-kilt me.
                                 GREENHILL
                        I-- I was just trying to-- 

                                 ABEL
                        Murderer. MURDERER.

           Abel begins to shake and foam. Greenhill pressing his hands 
           to the wound, slippery with blood. Tossing his gaze wildly:

                                 GREENHILL
                        Don’t speak. Save your strength--

           Hands GRAB GREENHILL, ripping him away from Abel as Cuthbert 
           kneels, taking the boy in his arms. Assessing the injury. 
           Instantly knowing his son has mere moments.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        It’s alright, boy. I’ve got you. 
                        I’m not letting go. 

           Greenhill looks on helplessly, the soldiers holding him.

                                 ABEL
                            (sucking ragged breaths)
                        Told you-- they’d come-- this way--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        You did good, son. You did good.

                                 ABEL
                        My uniform’s-- all tore up--

           The boy utters a soft sob, Cuthbert cradling him gently.

                                 ABEL
                        My uniform--

           The sentence remains unfinished. Forever perched on the lips 
           that will never utter another.

           Cuthbert gently lays his boy down. A moment passes. Then he 
           slowly RISES. Commandeers one of his men’s rifles; checks it; 
           COCKS THE HAMMER... And raises it to Greenhill’s head. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Robert Greenhill. In the name of 
                        the Crown and King of England, you 
                        are hereby sentenced to summary 
                        execution, on charges of escape, 
                        and murdering an officer. If you 
                        have final words, speak them now.

           Greenhill’s mind races. This is it. This is really it. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Forgive me. God forgive m--
           --BANG. Greenhill FLINCHES -- then realizes the shot came 
           from the camp below. IT’S PEARCE, stealing the horses! 
           Cuthbert and his men whirl, FIRING DOWN AT THEM--

           Greenhill doesn’t think. Just acts. Uses the momentary 
           distraction to make a DIVING LEAP OFF THE LEDGE-- 

           And now everything SLOWS TO A CRAWL, as--

           CUTHBERT

           WHEELS BACK AROUND -- a shot EXPLODING from his rifle, 
           catching the very edge of Greenhill’s shoulder in mid-air, in 
           the split-second before he DROPS OUT OF SIGHT, and-- 

           EXT. CANYON - CONTINUOUS

           WE SPEED RAMP BACK UP as Greenhill’s body SLAMS DOWN on the 
           steep, shale-rock slope, a sound escaping from him like:

                                 GREENHILL
                        --Ungh--

           WITH GREENHILL as he falls. BOUNCING, ROLLING, TUMBLING, a 
           hundred yards down. Boulders. Brambles. Every twist and crack 
           of his body making us flinch in our seats, mothers in the 
           audience looking away, can’t take it anymore, until--

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS

           --CRUNCH. Greenhill SLAMS into a TREE-TRUNK, all the breath 
           getting blown out of him. He wheezes, gasping-- 

           A HORSEBOUND FIGURE with a RIFLE appears over him, silhouetted 
           by the sun. Greenhill holds up a weak hand, a pitiful defense, 
           more instinct than anything else. Figure GRABBING HIM: 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Hell of a short-cut. What happened 
                        up there?!

           HOOFBEATS. Pearce and Kennelly ride up with an empty horse-- 
           And GUNFIRE is raining down from the ledge-- Pearce popping 
           off a SHOT, a dragoon howling as he FALLS--

                                 PEARCE
                        GET ON, NOW--! RIDE--!

           Pearce GALLOPS AWAY; Kennelly and Billings follow -- but 
           Greenhill can barely stand, trying to mount his horse MID-
           RIDE, half-hanging from the saddle, hooves clipping his legs-- 

           GREENHILL FALLS! He coughs in the dust, horse DRAGGING HIM, 
           bullets impacting all around him, as--
           BILLINGS

           Looks back, seeing the fallen Greenhill-- 

           --and makes a SNAP DECISION, wheeling his horse around INTO 
           ENEMY FIRE, leaning down to GRAB GREENHILL, physically 
           dragging him up onto the empty SADDLE, as-- 

           EXT. LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           WIDE SHOT: Four prisoners RIDE AWAY on FOUR HORSES as-- 

                                 CUTHBERT (O.S.)
                        I’ve got you. I’m not letting go.

           WE PULL BACK to find Cuthbert, buttoning up Abel’s shredded 
           uniform. Trying to make his boy presentable. His hand stops. 
           Feeling something. He reaches into Abel’s vest, pulls out... 

           THE POCKET-WATCH. Glass now cracked. Hands frozen at the 
           moment of his son’s death, as in our story’s OPENING SCENE.

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                            (races up, shaken)
                        Sir-- 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Empty the paddock. I want every 
                        horse we’ve got left on their trail.

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        That’s just it, sir-- There are no 
                        more horses. 
                            (Cuthbert turns-- What?)
                        They -- Pearce killed the rest. He 
                        cut their throats. They’re all 
                        dead! All of them!

           And off Cuthbert, his eyes SIMMERING with RAGE, we--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           TWO ROBERT GREENHILLS. The one below reaching up to touch the 
           hand of the one above, as--

           EXT. CREEKSIDE - AFTERNOON

           --RIPPLES form in a creek, Greenhill’s reflection 
           disappearing as he tries to scrub Abel’s blood off his hands. 
           He finds more up his arms; down his elbows--

           Greenhill starts to break down. Trying to hold it back. He 
           tears off his shirt, staggering into the water, and--
           EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME

           Greenhill SUBMERGES HIMSELF, body going limp. Floating. 

           His eyes flutter open. All around him, in the water, grains 
           of sand glitter -- almost like DUST MOTES in sunlight.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE SWAMP - SAME

           Kennelly stands in tall grass, his back to us. Pissing. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Well... I think we can safely say -- 
                        the hard part’s over.

           The horses drink as Pearce rifles through the saddlebags. He 
           nods toward a tangled SWAMPLAND up ahead, shrouded in fog. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Temper your expectations. Soon as 
                        we cross over into them trees, 
                        we’re in Abo Territory.

                                 KENNELLY
                            (re: saddlebags)
                        Find anything good?

                                 PEARCE
                        Bit of hardtack. Few of the late 
                        Abel Cuthbert’s personal effects: 
                        pomade, dirty pictures...

           Pearce roots around in a bag, pulls out a wrinkled ENVELOPE, 
           addressed to “ROBERT GREENHILL.” He tucks it in his pocket.  

                                 PEARCE
                        ...Nothing he’ll miss.

                                 KENNELLY
                        Gimme one of them molar-breakers. 

           Pearce tosses Kennelly a wafer of hardtack--

                                 PEARCE
                        Make it last. We’ll need it for the 
                        desert. Keep an eye on Billings; 
                        think his bowels has turned on him. 

                                 KENNELLY
                            (calls toward a bush)
                        Best to just get it all out! Use 
                        both ends, you like. No shame in it.

           Billings groans in a bush nearby, clutching his belly.
           EXT. CREEKSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Water is wrung from a cloth as a somber Greenhill dries his 
           clothes on the shoreline. His shoulder is bandaged now.  

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        You did well.

           Greenhill turns to see Pearce walking up. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I feel sick. 

                                 PEARCE
                        That’ll pass. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Maybe it shouldn’t. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Was him, or it was you. Ask me, you 
                        did right. Ask anybody. Ask God.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I don’t think God would agree. 

                                 PEARCE
                        You don’t think so? You think about 
                        all the suffering that boy 
                        inflicted. All the suffering he was 
                        yet to inflict. And when you’re 
                        back in Sarah’s arms, children at 
                        your feet, you’re gonna tell me God 
                        would rather you was dead, and Abel 
                        Cuthbert alive? 
                            (Greenhill frowns)
                        No. He’d have you do just like you 
                        done. And if you had it to do over 
                        again -- so would you.

           Pearce turns to go. Greenhill looks up--

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...How’d you know her name’s Sarah?

           Pearce hesitates, hand moving to his pocket, where we saw him 
           tuck the letter... but he decides to keep it.

                                 PEARCE
                        We shouldn’t dally any longer.  

           EXT. EDGE OF THE SWAMP - DUSK

           The four surviving escapees stare into the dark heart of the 
           swamp. Insects whirl. SAVAGE CRIES of beasts echo from within.
                                 GREENHILL
                        How many days to the far side?

                                 PEARCE
                            (re: Kennelly’s map-tattoo)
                        Four. Three, we move a good clip.

           Kennelly reaches for a RIFLE -- but Pearce shakes his head.

                                 PEARCE
                        No munitions. Can’t risk attracting 
                        the attention of the Abos.

                                 KENNELLY
                        What happens if they find us?

                                 PEARCE
                        Either they kill us for the horses, 
                        or they turn us over to Cuthbert.
                            (off Kennelly’s frown--)
                        For each escaped prisoner they turn 
                        in, they get enough reward money to 
                        feed their tribe for a year.  

           Kennelly puts down the rifle, sliding it in his saddlebag. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        So we keep quiet, and we don’t 
                        stop. Until we’re safely through. 

           They start forward, the fog swallowing them up...

           ...But we hang back with BILLINGS, who’s pale, sweating. He 
           pulls a hand from his jacket, revealing -- A GUNSHOT WOUND. 

                                 GREENHILL (O.S.)
                        Billings, you alright?

                                 BILLINGS
                        Fine... right as rain--

           He winces; buttons his jacket tight, riding in after them.

           EXT. GRASSY FIELD - NIGHT

           TORCHES split the darkness as Cuthbert stalks through tall 
           grass, TWENTY SOLDIERS fanning out behind him. On the hunt.

           Cuthbert crouches. Picks up a BLOODY BANDAGE. Smiles faintly. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        One of them’s wounded. 
           EXT. SWAMPLANDS - DAY

           --WHAM. Billings FALLS from his horse. Face clammy, pale.

           Greenhill hurries to his side; opens his jacket -- and 
           recoils from what he sees. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Ugh. And here I was thinking that 
                        smell was just the swamp.

                                 BILLINGS
                        It’s just a thru-and-thru-- I’ve 
                        seen a hundred men survive worse--

                                 PEARCE
                        Was any of them riding through a 
                        fetid swamp? Or was they in a field 
                        hospital? Under your loving care?

           Billings looks to Greenhill, eyes pleading, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           Greenhill and the others stand apart, arguing quietly:

                        GREENHILL
                                                        KENNELLY
           No, no--
                                              --He’s suffering. It’s not 
                                              right, letting him suffer--
           I’ll carry him on my saddle. 
           Once we reach Harbortown--
                                              --Harbortown? We can’t even 
                                              find our way out this swamp! 

                                 PEARCE
                        Keep your voices down. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        We’re not killing him.

                                 PEARCE
                        He died the moment he caught that 
                        bullet. We’re just making it 
                        official. We wait, he’ll take us 
                        with him. Matter of hours he’ll be 
                        delirious. Hollering, screaming... 
                            (glances around the swamp)
                        Bring us all to a bad end.

                                 KENNELLY
                        What’s say we vote. Who’s for doing 
                        him quick and easy?

           Kennelly raises his hand. So does Pearce. Greenhill seethes. 
           They turn toward Billings, who tries to back away, crawling.
                                 PEARCE
                            (pulls his KNIFE)
                        If you don’t squirm none, I can 
                        make it so the pain is less.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Robert? ROBERT--

           Greenhill’s eyes dart, searching for a way out of this; he 
           spots the RIFLE on Kennelly’s saddlebag, tied with a strap-- 
           his fingers scrambling to UNTIE IT, as--

                                 BILLINGS (O.S.)
                        --No-- Nnno! Noooo! 

                       PEARCE (O.S.)
                                                     KENNELLY (O.S.)
           Hold ‘im, dammit!
                                              --I am!

           Greenhill finally rips the rifle from the saddle, wheeling 
           around with it--

           --To find himself FACE TO FACE WITH AN ABORIGINE WARRIOR. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (flinches back)
                        ...Pearce. Kennelly--

           The others freeze, as -- all around them, the trees seem to 
           COME ALIVE. ABORIGINALS emerging from the mist. Wraith-like, 
           nearly naked, bodies painted to match their surroundings--

           WHITEBEARD, 60s, claw-marks on his chest, steps closer--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (rifle up)
                        Easy. We’re just passing through. 

           All around, SPEARS SNAP UP. Billings puts his hands up, not 
           sure whether his situation has improved. Now it’s a STANDOFF--

                                 KENNELLY
                        I say shoot. All they got’s a bunch 
                        of darkie-sticks. 

                                 PEARCE
                        They been using those spears since 
                        before the pyramids was laid. 
                        Moment he fires a shot, they’ll 
                        skewer us clean as caught-fish.

                                 WHITEBEARD
                        [...Speaks quiet, eyes simmering...]

                                 KENNELLY
                        Sorry. I don’t speak savage.

           And that gives Greenhill AN IDEA; he frowns, remembering--
                                 GREENHILL
                        Game-redda.
                            (subtitle:)
                        [I am the shit spirit.]

                                 WHITEBEARD
                        [...Just blinks at Greenhill...]

                                 GREENHILL
                        Game-redda. All of us. Game-redda. 

           Slowly at first, the Aboriginals begin to laugh. SUBTITLES:

                   WHITEBEARD (SUBTITLE)
           I think he’s got the runs--
                                                OTHER ABORIGINE (SUBTITLE)
                                              --Quick, cut open his guts, 
                                              help him relieve himself.

           And now the Aborigines are BELLY-LAUGHING. Greenhill managing 
           an uneasy chuckle along with them as-- he TURNS, rolling down 
           his collar to EXPOSE the PRISON BRAND-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Prisoners. All of us.

                                 KENNELLY
                        The hell are you doing?

                                 PEARCE
                        --Wait. I see where he’s going.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Let us pass through--
                            (points at Billings)
                        ...And you can take him. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        W-what? 

           Greenhill jerks down Billings’ collar, exposing the brand. 
           The Aboriginals react, murmuring to one another.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Prisoner, you see? Deal? 

                                 BILLINGS
                        R-Robert? What are you d--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (quietly to Billings)
                        Cuthbert takes you back to prison, 
                        a doctor treats your wound.

                                 BILLINGS
                        What? Cuthbert will hang me--
                                 GREENHILL
                        I’m the one he wants. I’m the one 
                        who killed his son. Cooperate with 
                        him, you’ve at least got a chance. 
                        Out here, you die for sure.

           Billings just stares at Greenhill:

                                 BILLINGS
                        I rode back for you.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thom--

                                 BILLINGS
                        I got shot doing it -- And you’re 
                        trading me for your freedom?!

           All around, spears TENSE, still pointed at the escapees-- 

                                                         PEARCE
                         KENNELLY
           --Easy now, easy--
                                              Billings, shut your mouth--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thom. You’re wrong.

                                 BILLINGS
                        Enjoy home, Robert. Hope it was 
                        worth it. Hope it was--

           GREENHILL PUTS THE GUN TO BILLINGS’ HEAD. To the Aborigines:

                                 GREENHILL
                        Do we have a deal?

           Whitebeard’s EYES NARROW; the situation looking like it could 
           EXPLODE ANY SECOND as we go to--

           EXT. EDGE OF THE SWAMP - NIGHT

           FOOTPRINTS. Cuthbert’s eyes trace them into the GREAT SWAMP. 

                                 DRAGOON CAPTAIN
                        Better to wait for them on the far 
                        side. They make it out alive, we 
                        can take them then.

           Cuthbert just unslings his rifle, starting toward the swamp-- 

           When up ahead, the MIST PARTS, three ABORIGINE WARRIORS 
           approaching. Dragging an almost-dead man. Soldiers back away. 
           But Cuthbert stands his ground, rifle in hand, until-- 

                                 ABORIGINE
                        Escaped man.
           They throw him at Cuthbert’s feet. Cuthbert grabs him by the 
           hair, tilts his head up to reveal -- a bleary-eyed BILLINGS.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...This isn’t the one I want. But 
                        there was another.

           And we begin to hear a RHYTHMIC POUNDING as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN ABORIGINAL FIRE-DANCE. Warriors pound RHYTHM STICKS, 
           twisting their bodies, smoke and flames swirling. We’re in--

           EXT. ABORIGINAL VILLAGE - NIGHT

           And Pearce is right in the middle of it, stripped to the 
           waist, totally at home. All around, WOMEN wave burning 
           bundles of sacred leaves, filling the air with colored smoke.

           WHITEBEARD whispers to a pair of NATIVE GIRLS, pointing at-- 
           Greenhill and Kennelly. Kennelly eats roasted meat. 

                                 KENNELLY
                        If I was you, I’d eat. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I don’t see how he can dance when 
                        every second we sit here, Cuthbert 
                        is out there, getting closer--

                                 KENNELLY
                        You want to march into the swamp at 
                        night without a guide? Go ahead.
                            (chewing meat)
                        Besides. It’s not Pearce that’s 
                        doing the dance -- it’s the dance 
                        that’s doing him.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What?

                                 KENNELLY
                        Part of that dream-time he was on 
                        about. Pearce told me the dance has 
                        existed forever. It will exist 
                        forever. He’s just another vessel 
                        it’s passing through.
                            (spits out a bone)
                        Least, that’s what the Abo’s think.

           Greenhill watches Pearce dance, smoke billowing around him, 
           lost in the tumult of motion and rhythm, when--

           A delicate hand on Greenhill’s shoulder. A NATIVE GIRL (19), 
           lithe and all-but-naked. Another pulls Kennelly to his feet.
                                 KENNELLY
                        Well well--
                            (wipes his mouth)
                        Looks like the rumors are true.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What rumors?

                                 KENNELLY
                        That it’s dusky custom to give 
                        guests access to their wives.

           The girl takes Greenhill’s hand; gently kisses his knuckles.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (pulls his hand away)
                        No-- you don’t have to-- 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Hey. We don’t play cricket, they 
                        might think it an insult.

           Kennelly pulls off his shoes; follows his girl to a dwelling. 

           Greenhill sees WHITEBEARD glaring at him from across the 
           fire. Greenhill looks at the native girl. 

           INT. SHAG-BARK DWELLING - MOMENTS LATER

           The girl gently peels off Greenhill’s ragged shirt--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Stop. I don’t-- no--

                                 NATIVE GIRL
                        [...Soft words, incomprehensible...]

           She grabs a steaming cloth, gingerly cleaning his wounds, 
           dressing them with herbs from a pot. His brow breaks.

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. You don’t understand. I don’t 
                        deserve it-- I-- 
                            (something jarring loose)
                        I killed a boy, barely a man. I 
                        betrayed a friend. I sought the 
                        company of murderers. I helped 
                        them. I stole. I did those things.

           He looks in her eyes, this least likely of confessors.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Cuthbert said we were all wolves. I 
                        didn’t even listen. I thought I 
                        wasn’t like the others. But maybe-- 
                            (sets his jaw)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREENHILL (CONT'D)
                        How can I go home again? How can I 
                        look my son in the eyes? How can I--

           She KISSES his forehead, taking him in her arms. Gently 
           rocking him, laying him down, whispering an EERIE LULLABY in 
           his ear-- long wild hair spilling over his face, as we-- 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           GREENHILL’S DREAMTIME. We move through a DARKENED COAL MINE 
           as a WATER-GIRL (16) ladles out WATER to the miners. A grime-
           covered, younger Greenhill waits his turn as we reveal-- 

           --It’s SARAH. As she fills Greenhill’s tin cup, their hands 
           brush, a smudge of grime getting on her. She smiles. Just a 
           little. And as we realize THIS is how they MET--

           Greenhill brings the cup to his lips. But frowns, looking 
           down. His cup is filled with DEAD FLIES. 

           Greenhill looks up again -- but Sarah is GONE, replaced by 
           PEARCE. He tips the cup into Greenhill’s mouth. Forcing him 
           to DRINK. Greenhill CHOKING, when--

           At the cup’s bottom, a SPARROW emerges; takes flight toward a 
           FAINT LIGHT outside the mine. Getting brighter, BLINDING US--

                                                              SMASH TO:

           HANDS GRAB GREENHILL, Aboriginal warriors dragging him up,  
           BINDING his hands; SHOVING a STICK through his bent elbows--

                                 GREENHILL
                            (frowns at his BARE WRIST)
                        No-- wait-- where is it--

           His eyes dart, looking for something-- they DRAG HIM OUTSIDE--

           BUT WE HOLD A MOMENT on the dwelling, finding, in a heap in a 
           corner-- Greenhill’s TORN, BLOODY CLOTHING. And his BRACELET. 

           EXT. ABORIGINAL VILLAGE - MORNING

           Whitebeard hands out TREASURES -- PELTS, GAME, BAYONETS. The 
           NATIVE GIRL drapes a gold necklace over her shoulders, 
           locking eyes with Greenhill as he’s dragged off.

                                 KENNELLY (O.S.)
                        Golliwog in-breed! Get off’a me--

           Greenhill is prodded at spear-point toward Kennelly, who’s 
           fighting mad, wearing nothing but long underwear now.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (looking around)
                        What happened? Where’s Pearce?
                                 KENNELLY
                        Gone. Probably halfway to 
                        Harbortown by now--

           As they’re marched out of the village, WE RISE UP, finding--

           --Pearce, hiding on the village outskirts. He watches as 
           they’re led off... turns away, disappearing into the swamp. 

           EXT. SWAMPLAND - MORNING

           SPEAR-TIPS prod Greenhill and Kennelly forward-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Where are they taking us? 

                                 KENNELLY
                        Where do you think? Tar-skin boony 
                        bastards must have used Billings to 
                        negotiate up and get a better 
                        bargain, for us-- 

           ON GREENHILL. Not ready to give up yet. His eyes dart, 
           looking for something, anything, when-- 

           Greenhill shoots Kennelly a look. And suddenly TRIPS. 

                                                        GREENHILL
                        ABORIGINE
           Up and walking! Up!
                                              My ankle; it’s hurt-- 
                                                (they KICK HIM--)
                                              Okay, okay-- I’m getting up. 
                                              I’m standing-- easy--

           --Kennelly SNAPS into action, SHOVING a warrior into a MUD 
           PIT. Quicksand! The warrior flails, DROWNING; Greenhill 
           lunges for the man’s fallen spear--

           But another warrior snatches it from under his fingers and--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Look-out, look-out!

           --RUNS KENNELLY THROUGH. He falls to his knees. Clutches the 
           spear in him; trying to extract it. Greenhill can’t watch.

           The spear lands on the ground, steeped in gore. 

           Kennelly lands beside it. Dead. 

           Greenhill looks up as the two surviving ABORIGINE WARRIORS 
           surround him, weapons at his throat, ARGUING, SUBTITLED:  

                     OTHER ABORIGINE 
           You can’t kill him; he’s 
           already been paid for--
                                                      ANGRY WARRIOR
                                              That was my cousin he tossed 
                                              in the drink. It’s my right.
                                 OTHER ABORIGINE
                        You’re always complaining about 
                        your right, Gulpilli. 
                            (points at Greenhill)
                        Fine. One eye. But that’s it. 

           The angry warrior (GULPILLI, apparently) grudgingly shrugs, 
           unslinging a STONE HATCHET, its jagged edge gleaming as he 
           grabs Greenhill by the HAIR-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Wait a minute-- wait-wait-wait--

           Greenhill STRUGGLES WILDLY as the hatchet blade presses into 
           the corner of his EYEBALL, and--

           --BLAM! GULPILLI’S BLOWN OUT OF FRAME, Greenhill flinching as 
           blood showers his face, getting in his MOUTH as--

           PEARCE appears. WHAM, clubs the other warrior with his rifle. 

           EXT. CUTHBERT’S CAMP - SAME

           Cuthbert’s head SNAPS UP from a map, hearing the GUNSHOT, 
           birds scattering from deep within the swamp.

           INT. SWAMPLAND - SAME

           Pearce KICKS OUT the pole binding Greenhill’s elbows.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Why did you come back? 

                                 PEARCE
                        They will have heard those shots. 
                        Can you run?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...What about Kennelly?

                                 PEARCE
                        Got Abos coming one way, Cuthbert 
                        the other -- and you’re on about a 
                        Christian burial? 

                                 GREENHILL
                        I meant the map. Tattooed on his--

           Greenhill nods to Kennelly’s head. Pearce’s eyebrows go up. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Oh. Well, you got a point there. 

           Greenhill frowns, picks up Gulpulli’s STONE HATCHET; tilts 
           his head, looking at Kennelly. He looks at Pearce.
                                 PEARCE
                            (holds up his hands)
                        Don’t look at me, mate. This one’s 
                        your idea. 

           Greenhill kneels beside Kennelly, trying to find a grip on 
           his stubbly SHAVED HEAD. Grabs hold of an ear--

                                 PEARCE
                        No-- start at the hairline and peel 
                        back. Just like an orange. 
                            (scratches his neck)
                        Choctaw squaw taught me. Shacked up 
                        with her one winter. Couldn’t cook 
                        worth a damn, but she was murder in 
                        the sack.

           ON GREENHILL’S FACE as he starts cutting. He begins to gag.

           EXT. SWAMPLAND, OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           --SCHRIPP. FABRIC TEARS, hands ripping apart a cloth, as-- 

           Pearce wraps the cloth around his head to shade himself, 
           Greenhill following him up a hill, as--

                                 GREENHILL
                        How many days is the crossing?

                                 PEARCE
                        Don’t know. Took twelve last time. 
                        And I only made it part-way.

                                 GREENHILL
                        What happened?

           They crest the hill, now looking out over...

           EXT. PINNACLES DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           ...A WHITE DESERT, dotted with limestone formations, towering 
           up like the ribs of some skeletal giant, buried long ago.

                                 PEARCE
                        Ran out of food. 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (checking a bag)
                        Down to three pieces of hardtack, 
                        and some kangaroo meat. We should 
                        go back. Forage for more.
                                 PEARCE
                        And give the Abos another run at 
                        your eyes? No. We’ll travel light. 
                        Forage out there. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        For what?

                                 PEARCE
                            (looks at Greenhill, then:)
                        ...Moses had manna. We’ll see what 
                        the heavens provide us.

           Pearce starts forward. Greenhill following after him, as--

           WIDE SHOT: The two men slowly shrink into MERE SPECKS, in an 
           endless DUNE SEA that stretches from horizon to horizon.

           EXT. CUTHBERT’S CAMP - NIGHT

           Cuthbert sharpens a KNIFE. Behind him, a dragoon reports:

                                 SOLDIER
                        We followed the shots; found three 
                        dead natives, and one white man. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Was it Greenhill?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Well sir, it’s -- hard to say.

           Cuthbert follows the man to a wheelbarrow; he LIFTS A SHEET. 
           Cuthbert’s eyes TWITCH at the sight of whatever’s under it.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Looks like whoever done it seemed 
                        to have a-- a difficult time. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...Or never scalped a man before.

           TENT FLAPS open nearby. A doctor in a bloody smock emerging.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Fever’s set in. Likely won’t see 
                        another morning.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Can he speak?

           INT. MEDICAL TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Billings is laid out on a cot, pouring sweat, shirtless. 
                                 CUTHBERT (O.S.)
                        I understand you were in the service.

           At a table, Cuthbert stands with his back to Billings, 
           sifting through various medicinal tubes and bottles. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Nine years in infantry myself. Was 
                        two weeks from shipping home when I 
                        received word. About Eliza.

           Billings watches Cuthbert pour amber liquid into a JAR... 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Inspector told me the motive was 
                        burglary. But all he got was two 
                        candlesticks off the mantle.
                            (adding POWDER to the jar)
                        Weren’t even real silver. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        Just, listen to me--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Leaves something unfinished in you, 
                        never having a chance to look in 
                        the eyes of the one who did it. Had 
                        to leave the infantry. I’d come to 
                        take too much pleasure in killing. 
                        Fancying every man was him. 

           Cuthbert sets down the bottle he poured the liquid from, 
           Billings glimpsing the label: WHISKEY; the powder: SALT. 

                                 BILLINGS
                        ...Please-- I already told the 
                        others, I don’t know anything-- 

                                 CUTHBERT
                            (nods to the doctor)
                        Note for the report that you had to 
                        use whiskey and salt to cleanse the 
                        departed’s wounds. 

           In a corner, the doctor’s eyes widen; nods, eyes downcast. 
           Cuthbert swirls the jar around, carrying it toward Billings--

                                 BILLINGS
                        I swear to you, on my mother’s 
                        immortal soul-- I do not know where 
                        Pearce and Greenhill are--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Oh, I’m not interested in where 
                        they are. That’s all over now. 
                            (tilts the jar)
                        I’m asking -- where they’re going.
                                 BILLINGS
                        Please don’t-- I’ll tell you. I’ll--

           EXT. MEDICAL TENT - SAME

           --SCREAMS erupt from within the tent, the SILHOUETTES of 
           Cuthbert and a writhing Billings visible inside. Soldiers 
           standing guard exchange frightened looks.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE SUN. WHITE ON BLUE. BURNING A HOLE THROUGH THE SCREEN.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           Pearce and Greenhill huddle under tumbleweed, the only dot of 
           shade in the rippling heat. Both now visibly scrawnier, all 
           joints and sinew, sunburnt skin peeling off their bones. 

           Pearce squeezes a few precious drops from a water bladder, 
           now creased, flattening. Greenhill divides a tiny meat-scrap. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        That’s the last of it. 

                                 PEARCE
                        You take it. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        We’ve been on quarter-rations for 
                        days. Eat it. 

                                 PEARCE
                        I’m more compact of frame; don’t 
                        need as much as you. Go on.

           Greenhill hesitates... and sets upon the scrap of meat, half-
           crazed with hunger. Licking his fingers. 

           Pearce just stares at him.

                                 PEARCE
                        Give me the map.

           Greenhill unfolds a leathery, stubbled parchment, revealing a 
           familiar TATTOOED MAP, as we realize -- that’s not parchment. 

                                 PEARCE
                        If this is scaled right, we still 
                        got six days walk to the oasis. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You said we could forage. I haven’t 
                        seen so much as a cricket yet.
           Pearce touches his own forehead. Examines a sweat-bead. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Long as we’re sweating, we’re still 
                        alive. Last thing to go’s the sweat.

                                 GREENHILL
                        We’re starving. 

           Pearce chuckles. Lays back. Closes his eyes, conserving 
           energy. Then he pries one eye open, studying Greenhill.

                                 PEARCE
                        Which story did you believe? About 
                        me; what I done to get how I am.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Didn’t believe any of them. If I 
                        had, I wouldn’t be here. 

           Pearce looks off over the wasteland, almost wistful.

                                 PEARCE
                        Greatest storyteller I ever known 
                        was my old Papi. Spun ‘em like a 
                        weaver, he did. If he’d done near 
                        half the things he put his name to, 
                        he’d have a spot in Webster’s  
                        Encyclopedic. Prob’ly there anyway.
                            (a faint smile, then--)
                        Had a lot of people believing his 
                        stories, too. Thinking him a goodly 
                        parent. A man of property, morals. 
                        All the while at home, he had a 
                        drawer of debts, a rack of starving 
                        children, and me mum with her tits 
                        dry from terror at his rages. 

           Greenhill stares at him. The only sound now the wind, faintly 
           whispering through the brush over their heads. 

                                 PEARCE
                        This one time, I’s maybe 11, 12, he 
                        disappears a week. And like always, 
                        when he shows up, me mum’s asking 
                        where he been; her crying, him 
                        putting the boot to her. Her 
                        pleading with him to stop, God help 
                        her, she’ll do anything; him 
                        carrying on like always--

           Pearce smiles, suddenly looking very young. Almost childlike.

                                 PEARCE
                        Only this time, I sticks a knife 
                        ‘tween two of his ribs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        You know, you jam a knife in a 
                        man’s lung, you get that little 
                        pop, that little hiss. That bit of 
                        breath, escapes. I remember I could 
                        smell the whisky on it. Only sound 
                        ever came out of his body, wasn’t a 
                        lie. 
                            (itches his stubble)
                        Anyway, he falls, knife goes in 
                        worse, and he doesn’t get back up. 
                        And mum goes a bit of irate. 
                        Screaming, hollering, cursing me 
                        for ever crawling out her guts like 
                        I done. Turned me in to the Royal 
                        Constabulary herself. Tossed me in 
                        Newgate that very night, shut away 
                        with all the garbage. Pickled in 
                        sin. She never came to see me, not 
                        once. But in her heart, I knew...
                            (pause)
                        I knew she was grateful for what I 
                        done. To this day, that’s the last 
                        good thing I ever done for anyone.

           Greenhill just stares. For a moment this seems to be the 
           explanation for Pearce’s entire life.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Any of that true?

                                 PEARCE
                        No, I’m having you on. He got 
                        kicked by a mule. But tell me, did 
                        my story best the others? 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Yes. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Then believe it, you want. Believe 
                        whatever you like. What about your 
                        old man?

                                 GREENHILL
                            (shrugs)
                        Never knew him. 

                                 PEARCE
                        He run out on you?

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. Hanged.

           Greenhill stands; cracks his neck, stretching his legs--

                                 GREENHILL
                        Sun will be sinking soon. We should 
                        start walking.
           Pearce watches Greenhill start off. Then glances down to his 
           pocket. The LETTER is still inside. He smiles. Getting up. 

                                 CUTHBERT (PRE-LAP)
                        The reward is 200 pounds. 

           EXT. CUTHBERT’S CAMP - DUSK

           PAN OVER a sordid-looking group of TRACKERS, ABORIGINES, BUSH-
           RANGERS. Hardened, scarred men. BOUNTY HUNTERS. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                            (pacing)
                        It is the money I had thought to 
                        give my boy upon his marriage. Now, 
                        it is the sum I lay upon his grave, 
                        that his soul might find rest. Here 
                        is what I have ascertained...

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

           Laying in a heap, looking ever THINNER, Greenhill SLEEPS.

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        ...If they survive the desert, there 
                        is a man in Harbortown who will help 
                        them secure passage on a ship. 

           Across a flickering fire, Pearce stokes the flames. STARING 
           at Greenhill. Something inscrutable in his gaze.

                                 CUTHBERT (V.O.)
                        We do not know who this man is. Use 
                        any means at your disposal to find 
                        out, but I want Greenhill alive.

           EXT. DESERT - AFTERNOON

           A ROCKY PLATEAU wavers on the horizon, a few trees sprouting. 

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        ...This-- this is it. The oasis. 

           Greenhill staggers towards the apparition, limping, legs like 
           rubber. Pearce at his side, haggard face lighting up--

                                 PEARCE
                        The farthest I ever made it. Up 
                        there’s where I made camp. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        You said that yesterday.
                                 PEARCE
                        I swear to you, this is it. 

           Pearce’s pace quickens, Greenhill forcing himself onward--

           EXT. ROCKY PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

           Hands claw rock as the two men drag themselves atop the 
           plateau. They roll onto their backs, breathing hard. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Skin’s dry. No more sweat.

                                 PEARCE
                        There’s a freshwater creek. 
                        Somewhere past those trees.

           Greenhill nods. Summoning the strength to get back up--

                                 PEARCE
                        Rest. I got something for you. 

           Pearce pulls out the LETTER, tattered and yellowing. 
           Greenhill’s breath catching in his chest--

                                 GREENHILL
                        That’s-- is that-- 

                                 PEARCE
                        Found it in Abel’s saddlebags. Was 
                        saving it, case your motivation 
                        gave out. Now-- you’ve earned it.

           Greenhill reaches for it, pulling out a page -- the pages, 
           YES -- hands almost trembling as he unfolds them:

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Dearest Robert. It’s only nineteen 
                        months since our parting, and yet--

           Greenhill clutches it to his chest. Almost about to weep.  

                                 GREENHILL
                        Thank you. Thank-- 

                                 PEARCE
                        Relish every word. 
                            (standing)
                        I’ll go see about that creek.

           Pearce takes a few steps away... STOPS. Looks back. Greenhill 
           is devouring the letter. HIS BACK TURNED. 

           WITH GREENHILL as he reads, eyes snapping back and forth:
                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        ...and yet each day seems eternal.
                        We have suffered great hardship in 
                        your absence, but we are still under 
                        one roof, us four...
                            (his eyes LIGHT UP)
                        Though I cannot be there to comfort 
                        you through the cruelty of these 
                        bitter days, I promise to make each 
                        moment after you return twice as 
                        sweet. Until then, be strong, and--

           A twig SNAPS behind him. Greenhill turns, seeing-- 

           --Nothing. No sign of Pearce. Greenhill frowns, standing, 
           looking around, pocketing the letter-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Pearce?

           Silence. A slight wind. Greenhill starts forward. Wandering 
           into a maze of trees and rock forms, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           PEARCE, keeping low behind a boulder. STONE HATCHET in his 
           hands. Greenhill walks past, doesn’t see him... 

                                 GREENHILL
                        Pearce! 
                            (peers ahead)
                        Found your camp.

           Greenhill pads forward, finding an abandoned FIRE PIT, 
           covered in charred logs. He pokes at the ashes with a foot-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                        PEARC--

           --Greenhill STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. Reaches down, fishing a 
           DUSTY OBJECT from the ashes. Turning it around to face him:

           A smashed-in HUMAN SKULL.

           Greenhill’s lip twitches, finding MORE and MORE HUMAN 
           BONES... a CHILL running down his spine as REMEMBERED VOICES 
           from across our story fill his head: 

                       PEARCE (V.O.)
           I need five men.
                                                     BILLINGS (V.O.)
                                              ...What’s he got planned for 
                                              the rest of us?

                       PEARCE (V.O.)
                                                    GREENHILL (V.O.)
           That which is weaker is 
           consumed by that which is 
           stronger.
                                              --Why me? What do you need me 
                                              for? 
                                 PEARCE (V.O.)
                        Only made it part-way, the last 
                        time... Ran out of food. 

           Greenhill’s chest heaves, a HORRIFYING REALIZATION DAWNING--

                                 PEARCE (V.O.)
                        Which story did you believe?

                                 HOARSE OLD PRISONER (V.O.)
                        Pearce was the only survivor. Found 
                        him feasting on his superior 
                        officer. Called his flesh delicious. 

           Greenhill sees a SHADOW slide over the ground at his feet; 
           whirling around just in time to see--

           PEARCE SWING THE STONE HATCHET TOWARD HIS HEAD. 

           Greenhill DUCKS, hatchet SMASHING into a boulder inches from 
           his ear, cracks forming at the point of impact--

                                 GREENHILL
                        No-- 

                                 PEARCE
                        Yes. 

           And it’s happening. Greenhill vs. Pearce. Each man starving, 
           weakened, fighting for his life. The HATCHET SWINGS-- 

           --but Greenhill TACKLES HIM-- WHAM-- they SLAM DOWN, TUSSLING 
           tooth-and-nail along the PLATEAU’S EDGE, pages of Sarah’s 
           letter SCATTERING around them--

                                 PEARCE
                            (jamming Greenhill’s chin)
                        This doesn’t -- have to be painful. 
                        It is -- the order of things.

           And quickly Pearce is OVERPOWERING HIM, TWISTING the hatchet 
           toward Greenhill, forcing the blade into his neck-- a 
           beheading happening in excruciating slow motion-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (sucks in his neck)
                        Wait-- stop--

           A page of the letter blows by Greenhill’s eyes. And with a 
           last BURST OF STRENGTH, he makes a desperate move--

           --AND ROLLS THEM BOTH OFF THE PLATEAU. 
           EXT. DESERT POND - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM-- BAM-- knuckles and knees scrape rock, hatchet 
           CLATTERING FREE as--

           --SPLASH! They crash down into a shallow FRESHWATER POND, the 
           two men struggling now in three feet of water, Pearce 
           immersing Greenhill’s face--

           UNDERWATER.

           Greenhill’s eyes dart up in a panic, Pearce’s watery 
           silhouette hovering over him like the angel of death. 
           Darkness gathering around him, Greenhill involuntarily taking 
           water up his nasal cavity, eyes stinging from the inside, as--

           PEARCE

           Just holds him down. Shoulders bulging, giving no quarter. 
           Soothing him, almost like a baby:

                                 PEARCE
                        You’ve done your part, Robert. I’ll 
                        take you home, now. Your strength 
                        in me. Mine-- in you--

           Greenhill CLAWS WILDLY at Pearce’s neck, face, jaw; KICKING, 
           SPLASHING, FRENZIED, not giving in.

                                 PEARCE
                        Shh. Shh. Almost done. Almost--

           Greenhill starts to falter. Arms slackening. And for a moment, 
           we think -- this is it. This is how Robert Greenhill dies. 

           But then, we perceive, out of focus, at the far edge of the 
           frame -- something MOVES. Sliding softly into the water-- 
           SPLISH, and now Pearce realizes it too, realizes they’re not 
           alone, his head slowly rotating, as--

           A FUCKING CROCODILE 

           Launches up from the water, JAWS SNAPPING!

           Pearce INSTANTLY ABANDONS Greenhill-- FEINTING, crocodile 
           teeth shredding his shirt as Pearce THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND 
           ITS JAWS, using all his strength to clamp its mouth shut; 
           wrestling, howling, spitting-- 

                                 PEARCE
                        YOU WANT ME?! YOU WANT-- MEEEE--

           And now the crocodile begins to WRITHE and WRIGGLE as--

           GREENHILL
           Suddenly SITS UP FROM THE WATER! Choking, gasping, crawling 
           from the pond, coughing water, the imprints of Pearce’s 
           knuckles VISIBLE all over his throat-- 

           And now Greenhill turns to the THRASHING HORROR occurring 
           behind him, Pearce struggling to hang on, the monstrous 
           reptile snapping its neck BACK and FORTH like a dog shaking 
           off water, hurling him about like a rag doll as--

                                 PEARCE
                        YOU WAAAAAHHAA-- MMMMM--

           Greenhill scuttles backward, palm bumping into something on 
           the rocks -- THE STONE HATCHET, as we--

           PUSH IN ON GREENHILL. And all we hear are the screams, the 
           splashing, the THRASHING of huge packs of reptilian muscle, 
           Pearce’s GARBLED, WATERY CRIES of DESPERATION-- 

                                 PEARCE (O.S.)
                        GAAHH--! ARRGH---

           And we go into EXTREME SLOW MOTION, as-- 

           PEARCE

           Fights to HANG ON, veins about to burst, face REDDENING, eyes 
           BLOODSHOT -- but despite it all the CROCODILE JAWS are starting 
           to INCH OPEN, teeth scraping the very flesh from his arms. 

           And suddenly Alexander Pearce’s eyes are filling with 
           something we’ve never seen in them before. COLD NAKED FEAR.

           GREENHILL

           Turns away from Pearce. Bending down and slurping up water. 
           SLURP-- SLURP-- Pearce in his peripheral, a thrashing storm 
           of misery. Greenhill glances back--

           And STOPS. He squints. Maybe it’s the dehydration. A hunger-
           born hallucination. But all around Pearce, Greenhill sees 
           them -- FLOATING DUST MOTES. Greenhill shakes his head.

                                 GREENHILL
                        No. No-- 

           But the dust motes remain. Spiraling around Pearce and the 
           crocodile, locked in their immortal dance.

           INSERT: Pearce dancing in the firelight with the aborigines.

           And slowly, Greenhill’s hand closes around THE STONE-
           HATCHET’S HANDLE. Camera RISING WITH HIM NOW as he stands to 
           his feet, summoning all his strength, and--

           WITH A WAR SCREAM GREENHILL LEAPS ONTO THE CROCODILE! 
           It’s hard to say who’s more surprised by this development, 
           Pearce or the crocodile. 

           --THWACK, THWACK-- Greenhill brings the hatchet down AGAIN 
           and AGAIN on the monstrous reptile’s HEAD, NECK, SPINE. But 
           the blows seem to do nothing, blade

           BOUNCING

           OFF

           Its hardened scales, the crocodile’s TAIL WHIPPING AROUND, 
           smashing broadside into-- 

           GREENHILL

           Who goes flying TEN FEET like he was hit by a TRAIN. Slams 
           into the side of the crevasse, wind knocked-out--

           But Greenhill THROWS HIMSELF right back into the fray; 
           THWACK, THWACK, SCHLUNK-- axe SPLITTING THE BEAST’S EYE, a 
           guttural WAIL erupting from somewhere deep within it. 

                          PEARCE
                                                        GREENHILL
           I’M GOING TO LET GO--
                                              --NO--

                                 PEARCE
                            (like a shot:)
                        ITS KILL SPOT IS UNDER THE TONGUE. 
                        DROWN IT IN ITS OWN BLOOD. 

           Pearce RELEASES his arms-- crocodile jaws SPRINGING OPEN-- 
           Greenhill SWINGING THE HATCHET with all he’s got--

           TING-- The blade DEFLECTS off its teeth, jaws SNAPPING back 
           down like a sprung trap, about to bite through both of 
           Greenhill’s arms-- 

           --but Pearce CATCHES its snout and chin with his BARE HANDS, 
           fingers locked in its NOSTRILS, PRYING THE JAWS OPEN, its 
           meaty tongue FLAILING like a suffocating snake--

                                 PEARCE
                        Drown it in its own blood. 

           --SCHLUNK-- Greenhill sinks the axe in deep. Right under the 
           tongue. Blood frothing and hissing as the crocodile goes into 
           a panicked frenzy, making a WILD LUNGE at Greenhill, and-- 

           It KNOCKS GREENHILL DOWN, four legs scrabbling up his body, 
           red jaws OPENING, Greenhill flinching from what comes next, 
           which is--

           A GURGLE. As those great jaws at last... tremble shut. Tail 
           still going -- until it finally spasms and falls limp.
                                 GREENHILL
                        Ahuh-- ahuhuh-- 

           And Greenhill SWINGS the HATCHET AGAIN, a PRIMAL SCREAM 
           coming from deep in his gut, voice cracking, eyes spilling 
           hot tears as the axe slashes wildly AGAIN and AGAIN until--

           PEARCE catches Greenhill’s wrist. Prying the hatchet from 
           between his shaking, white-knuckled fingers. 

           The bloody hatchet hits the ground. 

           And so do the two men. 

           We slowly RISE UP, moving to an ANGLE FROM ABOVE. The pond, 
           marbled with blood. The demolished crocodile. Two bedraggled 
           human forms, barely conscious beside it. SILENCE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON: CROCODILE MEAT, roasting, smoldering on a spit.

           EXT. PLATEAU, CAMP - SUNSET

           Pearce and Greenhill sit on either side of a fire. Eating. 
           Gulping down water. Neither man taking his eyes off the 
           other. Mistrust between them still palpable. 

                                 PEARCE
                            (chewing)
                        Well, Robert -- I do believe this 
                        proves me right, after all. Maybe 
                        you do have what it takes.

           Greenhill just chews his meat. Spits out a bone.

                                 PEARCE
                        Just one thing I can’t figure. 
                            (off Greenhill’s look)
                        She had me. Had me hard and bloody. 
                        I was set to decorate those teeth. 
                        By all rights, I should be in this 
                        croc’s belly. Not the other way 
                        ‘round. What I wanna know -- why? 

           Greenhill thinks for a long time.

                                 GREENHILL
                        I wanted to be able to look my son 
                        in the eyes again.

                                 PEARCE
                        ...Well, when you see him-- 
                            (tosses him a CURVED CLAW)
                        Give him this. 
                                 GREENHILL
                        We’re not home yet. 

                                 PEARCE
                        ...You sound tired. 

           Greenhill stares hard at Pearce. Desperately exhausted, but 
           still unwilling to let his guard down in this man’s presence.

                                 PEARCE
                        You can go to sleep, Robert. I 
                        won’t do you no harm. 
                            (alligator grin)
                        ‘Least-ways, not tonight.

           And that’s good enough for Greenhill. It’s got to be, because 
           he’s asleep before his head even hits the sand. Pearce 
           watches Greenhill sleep a moment... 

           ...And lays back. Wide awake. Just looking up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE NIGHT SKY, distant stars glimmering in the darkness, as--

           EXT. HARBORTOWN - NIGHT

           --A WHEEL splatters through them, reflection in a puddle 
           dissipating as a TOOTHLESS OLD DRIVER steers a MANURE WAGON 
           into Harbortown. SOLDIERS patrol everywhere. 

           INT. RAMSHACKLE INN - NIGHT

           A KNOCK at a door. The pudgy INNKEEPER we glimpsed in our 
           story’s opening, BOYLE (50s, well-fed) opens it a crack--

           Greenhill and Pearce slip inside, covered in manure. Greenhill 
           shuts the door behind them. Exhaling with relief, when-- 

           Boyle pulls out a FLINTLOCK PISTOL. Greenhill’s heart sinks--

                                 BOYLE
                        Turn around. Hands on the wall.

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...We’re friends of Felton’s. He--

                                 BOYLE
                            (cocks the pistol)
                        I never cared much for Felton. 
                        Hands on the wall.

           Pearce and Greenhill exchange glances. Slowly turning, doing 
           as he says. Boyle pats them each up and down--
                                 GREENHILL
                        We’re unarmed.

           Boyle rips Greenhill’s collar, scraping away the filth on his 
           neck -- revealing the M.H. PRISON BRAND.

           Boyle grunts, satisfied. Un-cocks the pistol.

                                 BOYLE
                        Follow me.

           INT. GRIMY BACK KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Boyle leads them into a messy kitchen, reaching in back of a 
           pipe stove, producing two ratty MERCHANT SHIP TICKETS.

                                 BOYLE
                        Won’t be first-class 
                        accommodations. But it’s a short 
                        trip. Two weeks to Manila. After 
                        that, you’re on your own.
                            (offers them the tickets)
                        Ship departs tomorrow at 3:05. 

                                 GREENHILL
                        How do we know we can trust you?

                                 BOYLE
                        Word is, you killed Abel Cuthbert. 
                        That true?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Yes.

           Boyle lowers his collar, revealing -- an old M.H. brand.

                                 BOYLE
                        I just want to know: what was it like 
                        to hear that little turd squeal?

           ON GREENHILL. No idea how to begin to answer that question.

                                 PEARCE
                        It was delicious.

                                 BOYLE
                            (fixes Greenhill’s collar)
                        You’re welcome to whatever you 
                        please. Food. Drink. Ladies is 
                        working, you like.

                                 PEARCE
                        Oh? How old’s your youngest?
                                 BOYLE
                        Fifteen. Me daughter, Rose. Knows a 
                        way to use her--

           Greenhill grabs the tickets, cutting in--

                                 GREENHILL
                        --No thank you. No unnecessary eyes 
                        need to know we’re here.
                            (Pearce shrugs: oh, well)
                        But there is one thing we’d like, 
                        if it can be arranged quietly. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           STEAM RISES. Greenhill and Pearce soak in metal tubs. 
           Greenhill’s clean-shaven now. But somehow, he still looks 
           like a different man. He massages the wound on his palm. 

                                 PEARCE
                        What’s the first thing you’ll do 
                        when you get home?

                                 GREENHILL
                        ...Gather Sarah and the children in 
                        my arms. Just breathe them in. 
                            (rubs his shoulder wound)
                        Then -- suppose we’ll have to start 
                        fresh somewhere. Maybe America. 
                        What about you? 

                                 PEARCE
                        You’ve decided to let me live?

                                 GREENHILL
                        Well. ‘Least-ways, for tonight. 

                                 PEARCE
                        ‘Been escaping so long, have to 
                        confess, don’t rightly know anymore 
                        what I started out intending to get 
                        back to. Probably some fool girl.

           Pearce chuckles, but there’s something sad in it. Greenhill 
           just waits. Pearce, allowing his mind to wander--

                                 PEARCE
                        Might like to see China or India. 
                        There’s villages in the Himalayas, 
                        that have never seen a white man. 
                        They say a man can become something 
                        more than he is in those places. 
                        Escape himself. I’d like that.

                                 GREENHILL
                        You’re going to become a king then?
                                 PEARCE
                        Have my sights set on a god.

           And there it is, that alligator smile. Greenhill stares at 
           Pearce, a man who’s both his enemy and his ally. And allows 
           himself to laugh. Pearce starts laughing along with him.

           For a moment, they almost seem like friends.

           As they laugh, WE DRIFT with the steam toward the window...

           EXT. RAMSHACKLE INN - CONTINUOUS

           ...Following it OUTSIDE. Finding, on the road behind the inn-- 
           a SCARRED TRACKER. We recognize him as one of the bounty 
           hunters from Cuthbert’s camp. Handing some COINS to--

           TOOTHLESS OLD DRIVER, who points at the INN; tips a hat, 
           climbing back onto a familiar MANURE WAGON.

           INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - DAWN

           Greenhill’s eyes open. He sits up in bed. 

           In the next bed over, Pearce sleeps in the arms of a STUNNING 
           WOMAN, red hair flowing over him. Something almost maternal 
           in the way she holds him. Pearce looks content as a child.

           Greenhill just shakes his head. Starts pulling on pants.

           EXT. BEHIND THE INN - MOMENTS LATER

           Greenhill peers out a back door. Looks around. All clear. He 
           hurries to an OUTHOUSE in bare feet.

           INT. OUTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside, Greenhill takes care of some personal business.

                                 GREENHILL
                            (chuckles quiet to himself)
                        ...Game-redda...

           A shadow darts past the outhouse. Then another. Greenhill 
           frowns; peers out a crack between the boards, seeing -- a 
           BRITISH SOLDIER creeps past. Then another. 

           Greenhill blinks. Mind racing. He cinches up his pants, a 
           board CREAKING under him. He WINCES; waits--
           EXT. BEHIND THE INN - MOMENTS LATER

           TINK-- a BOARD is carefully removed from the back of the 
           outhouse, Greenhill slipping out. He stands flat against the 
           wall, waits for ANOTHER SOLDIER to pass... 

           ...Then hurries across the street. Keeping low, moving along 
           a fence beside the INN. He glances to an UPSTAIRS WINDOW-- 

                                 GREENHILL
                            (a whisper shout)
                        Pearce. Pearce--

           Silence. Greenhill reaches for a PEBBLE. Tosses it. PLINK-- 
           hits the glass. The window doesn’t move. Greenhill waits--

                                 HULKING SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        --Hear what he did to Abel? Love to 
                        see ‘im try ‘at with me-- 

           Greenhill DUCKS, two more soldiers approaching on the far 
           side of the fence. They pass Greenhill by. He reaches for 
           another pebble, when-- 

           A FOG BELL tolls in the harbor. Greenhill peers over the 
           fence, seeing, in the distance -- THE HARBOR.

           Greenhill looks up at the window.

           At the harbor...

           The window...

           And Greenhill makes a decision. He WALKS AWAY from the inn.

           EXT. GRIMY ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Greenhill races along a garbage-filled alley. Greenhill slows 
           at the end, peering out to see--

           The harbor is TEEMING with SOLDIERS. The entire British army 
           may as well be between him and his ride out of here. And even 
           worse -- SIX SOLDIERS are headed straight in his direction. 

           Greenhill ducks into the alley. His eyes dart left, right--

           EXT. HARBORTOWN, STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The SIX SOLDIERS turn into the alley, to see-- 

           Nothing. They walk on, when-- one nearly trips over a DRUNKARD, 
           half-buried among the garbage. A soldier flips him a coin. 
                                 SOLDIER
                        Sleep it off somewhere else, old 
                        man. This spot’s ‘bout to be a 
                        bullet farm.

           The drunkard just groans a little. Soldiers moving on.

           A SEAGULL lands in the alley. Pecking at an apple core. PECK. 
           PECK-PECK. Our film’s OPENING IMAGE, as-- the garbage around 
           it stirs, our drunkard rolling over to reveal-- 

           It’s Greenhill. The gull TAKES FLIGHT-- 

           Greenhill scampers to the alley’s end, peering out at the 
           HARBOR BUSTLING WITH SOLDIERS. No idea what he’s going to do. 
           Overhead, the seagull CIRCLES...

           EXT. RAMSHACKLE INN - MOMENTS LATER

           ...And lands on the hanging sign outside the inn, as our 
           story at last comes FULL CIRCLE. All around, in alleys and on 
           rooftops, FORTY SOLDIERS aim rifles, surrounding the inn. 

                                 WHISPERING SOLDIER
                        There’s no escape, sir. Awaiting 
                        your orders.

           CUTHBERT stares down at the pocket-watch. Cracked glass. 
           Frozen hands. He wipes away a RED SMUDGE-- 

           Cuthbert gives a nod. THREE SOLDIERS start toward the inn.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           THE THREE SOLDIERS, now DEAD, heaped in a CART outside the 
           inn. In the background, we notice soldiers MANACLING PEARCE 
           while CUTHBERT stares down at him from a smashed window.

           One DEAD BODY suddenly MOVES, getting dragged into an alcove--

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - LATER

           Where Greenhill hurriedly changes into the soldier’s clothes! 
           Pulling on a cap; squeezing into the jacket; shoving his feet 
           into the BOOTS -- but they’re WAY TOO SMALL. Won’t fit.

           Greenhill creeps back toward the cart, reaching for another 
           pair, when-- a WHIP cracks, cart suddenly TRUNDLING AWAY. 

           Greenhill frowns. Looks down at his feet... as we CUT TO--
           EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           GREENHILL’S BARE FEET. We TRACK UP his ILL-FITTING UNIFORM to 
           his nervous face, eyes darting as he moves past DOZENS OF 
           SOLDIERS, headed for a MERCHANT SHIP, when--

                                 CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        You there, soldier!
                            (Greenhill freezes)
                        Give us a hand with these posters.

           The captain shoves a stack of WANTED POSTERS into Greenhill’s 
           hands -- each one bearing Greenhill’s own portrait!

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Cuthbert wants these placed on 
                        every dock in the harbor. 

           Greenhill nods, trying to tilt his cap low-- starting off-- 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Soldier!
                            (Greenhill’s eyes close--)
                        ...Button that jacket. This is the 
                        King’s service. Not some colonial 
                        bush-regiment.

                                 GREENHILL
                        Yessir. 

           Greenhill forces the buttons together, getting out of there. 
           Hurries around a corner, glancing behind him, when--

           EXT. HARBOR STREET - CONTINUOUS

           --BAM. Greenhill bumps into someone. It’s Cuthbert. But 
           Cuthbert doesn’t even see him, too busy glaring at a chained-
           up Pearce at his side, literally blinded by vengeance.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Where is he? Where?

           Cuthbert SHOVES GREENHILL ASIDE. Greenhill keeping his head 
           down as the other soldiers pass by--

           But Pearce turns, LOOKING BACK at Greenhill. Just long enough 
           to make eye contact.

           Greenhill stares.

           Pearce stares.

           And smiles.
                                 PEARCE
                        By the way, John--
                            (Cuthbert pauses)
                        ...Portrait in these posters ain’t 
                        much of a likeness for Greenhill. 
                        He’s far uglier in real life.

           Cuthbert yanks on Pearce’s chains, pulling him onward -- as 
           Pearce begins to LOUDLY SING the OLD MINER’S SONG:

                                 PEARCE
                        Down the mines, no sunlight shines 
                        Those pits they’re black as hell...

           Greenhill forces himself not to look back. Moving on, 
           DISAPPEARING into the harbor thrum.

           INT. GRIM CELL - AFTERNOON

           Pearce hangs from the ceiling, bloodied, flesh smoldering. 
           Most other men would be dead from sheer exhaustion by now.

           CLANG, the hot poker clatters to the floor. An unsatisfied 
           Cuthbert nods to his men. They cut Pearce down. He lands in a 
           heap. Cuthbert stalks past him, peering out a BARRED WINDOW.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        You hear that sound?

           A SQUEAK; a THUNK. Pearce pries open a swollen eye. Sees a 
           GALLOWS outside. Soldiers test the trap door. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Word’s spreading that we’ve caught 
                        you. That at dusk the Cannibal of 
                        Tasmania will hang by the neck 
                        until dead. Right there.

                                 PEARCE
                            (a defiant rasp)
                        Tell the truth, John, I’m rather 
                        looking forward to it. Nice to know 
                        where I’m headed for once.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        I’ll call it off. 

           Pearce frowns. Cuthbert grabs a parchment from a table, 
           opening it for Pearce. We glimpse a stamp; a signature--

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Town magistrate was Abel’s 
                        godfather. I had him issue a full 
                        pardon. If you give up Greenhill, 
                        you’ll be forgiven for all crimes 
                        committed under His Majesty’s law. 
           Soldiers exchange glances -- what? Pearce eyes the gallows.

                                 PEARCE
                        Saw a hanging once in Liverpool. 
                        Had too much rope for the boy’s 
                        neck. Had to loop it ‘round twice. 
                        When he dropped, his head come off, 
                        like an olive off a toothpick. Most 
                        memorable thing the lad ever did. 
                            (cracks his neck)
                        Hope I put on a proper show for the 
                        locals. After all I done, be a pity 
                        if all they get’s another short-
                        drop and sudden-stop. No, I’d like 
                        to bless them all with a good, 
                        rollicking dance on air. 

           Cuthbert throws a PURSE to the floor. Coins spill out. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        That’s thirty guineas in gold. 
                        They’re yours. Enough to go anywhere 
                        you’ll be. Anywhere in the world. 

           Pearce glances at the gold. At the pardon. At Cuthbert. 
           Outside, a church-bell rings THREE TIMES.

                                 PEARCE
                        I’ll make you a counterproposal. 
                            (Cuthbert waits)
                        I’ll take your fancy paper, and 
                        your thirty guineas, and I’ll add 
                        an additional condition. I’m afraid 
                        it’s non-negotiable -- but once 
                        fulfilled, it gets you Greenhill. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        What. 

           Pearce waves him closer. Closer. WHISPERS in his ear. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...That’s what you want? 

           Pearce nods, sober. Cuthbert looks around. His soldiers 
           trying to remain at attention, trying to avoid his gaze. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        And you’ll give me Greenhill?

                                 PEARCE
                        I’ve been called many things John, 
                        but never a liar. 
                                 CUTHBERT
                        If you don’t give me Greenhill you 
                        will hang, Alexander Pearce. Do you 
                        understand me? You will hang. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Better hurry John. He’s leaving us.

           Cuthbert straightens his jacket. Brushes himself off. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Fine. Very well...
                            (clears his throat)
                        I’d like to say, out loud, for all 
                        creation to hear -- that to satisfy 
                        my thirst for vengeance, I hereby 
                        loose upon the world, the notorious 
                        malefactor, murderer, and cannibal 
                        Alexander Pearce. May whatever 
                        crimes he commits henceforth be on 
                        my soul forever. There.

           This, now, is as close to heaven as Pearce will ever get.

                                 PEARCE
                        Say it again. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        ...To satisfy my need for veng--

                                 PEARCE
                        Say it louder. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        --I HEREBY LOOSE, UPON THE WORLD, 
                        NOTORIOUS MURDERER, CANNIBAL-- 
                        ALEXA-- Alexander--
                            (choking up)
                        May-- may--

                                 PEARCE
                        It’s alright, John. You can do it.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        May -- whatever crimes he commits -- 
                        be on my soul -- forever.

           Almost shaking, Cuthbert wipes his mouth. Pearce stares up at 
           him; from the angle he is looking, Cuthbert’s neck lines up 
           perfectly with the hanging noose, in the window behind him. 

                                 PEARCE
                        Dock 9. Cargo hold. Best be quick.
           EXT. WHARF - SAME

           A MERCHANT SHIP inches away from a dock labeled “9.”

           INT. UNDER THE CARGO HOLD - SAME

           We are in a dark place. Dusty light filters down through 
           FLOORBOARDS as we reveal GREENHILL, hidden deep in a ship’s 
           hull, crammed into an alcove, ALMOST FREE, when-- 

                                 CUTHBERT (O.S.)
                        Stop that ship! Stop it!

           Greenhill’s eyes shut. No. No, not when I’m this close. 

           EXT. WHARF - SAME

           Chains rattle as the ANCHOR DROPS. Deckhands throw out ropes.  
           A gangplank descends. Cuthbert and 15 SOLDIERS storm aboard.

           INT. UNDER THE CARGO HOLD - SAME

           Greenhill’s eyes flash about. Looking for a way out. 
           Something. Anything. Still trying to escape. A DISTANT VOICE:

                                 CUTHBERT (O.S.)
                        We have reason to believe this 
                        vessel is harboring a fugitive. 
                        Show us to the cargo hold.  

           The sound of boots on stairs. Oh no. 

           INT. CARGO HOLD - MOMENTS LATER

           Cuthbert and his men turn over barrels, rip open crates, tear 
           through hay-bales, scouring every inch of the ship’s hold. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        No sign of him, sir.

           Cuthbert grinds his jaw, when -- he freezes. Eyes tilting 
           DOWNWARD. Staring down at the floorboards.

           INT. UNDER THE CARGO HOLD - SAME

           Greenhill pours sweat, straining to see up through the cracks 
           in the floor. DUST filters down, getting in his eye.
           INT. CARGO HOLD - SAME

           Cuthbert pulls his OFFICER’S SABRE. Motions to his men to do 
           the same with their bayonets. Aiming the blades down. 

                                 CUTHBERT
                        Greenhill. Commend yourself into 
                        our hands, or be run through. 
                            (silence)
                        REVEAL YOURSELF. 

           Nothing. Cuthbert nods. Their blades all STAB into the floor.

           INT. UNDER THE CARGO HOLD - SAME

           But oddly -- Greenhill doesn’t see any blades stabbing 
           through. Not near him, not anywhere around him.

           He’s suddenly JOLTED. The ship around him beginning to MOVE. 
           Greenhill frowns, surprised, as--

           INT. CARGO HOLD - SAME

           Cuthbert’s men adjust position, STABBING DOWN in new spots.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You’re tearing up our bloody under-
                        deck, sir. You simply can’t--

                                 CUTHBERT
                            (wheels around in a rage)
                        If the Captain utters one more word, 
                        arrest him. Start prying up these 
                        boards. Every one. Nobody gets on or 
                        off this ship until I return.

           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

           The bloodied Alexander Pearce bears just the hint of a grin 
           as Cuthbert shoves him up the gangplank onto the ship.

                                 CUTHBERT
                        --You will go down into this hold 
                        and show me precisely where he is, 
                        or you will hang. Do you understand?

                                 PEARCE
                        Wait a tick. Did I say dock 9?

           Cuthbert’s eyes burn as Pearce squints down the wharf, ships 
           coming and going all along it, his eyes locking onto to an 
           EMPTY PIER, where boys are sweeping up the area. 
                                 PEARCE
                        ...It’s a shame, you know? 
                            (looks to the horizon)
                        I would have made an excellent god.

           Cuthbert follows Pearce’s gaze out to the horizon, where-- 

           We see ANOTHER SHIP. GREENHILL’S SHIP. Silhouetted by the 
           sun. Already miles away. And Cuthbert just stares at it. 

           Knowing he’s been beaten. 

           EXT. SHIP - SUNSET

           Greenhill emerges from the hold, stretching his neck. Sailors 
           sharing puzzled looks as this haggard figure moves past them 
           to the prow. Sea-spray hitting his face.

           Greenhill inhales deeply, enjoying his first breaths in more 
           than two years as a FREE MAN. And off the SETTING SUN ahead...  

                                                     MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

           A HANGING NOOSE. A ROWDY CROWD gathered around the gallows as--

           EXT. HARBORTOWN SQUARE - SUNSET

           --Pearce emerges from a wagon, a sign around his neck: “THE 
           CANNIBAL OF TASMANIA.” Onlookers cast hateful looks as this 
           haggard figure is led past them. Pelting him with garbage.

           SPITTLE hits Pearce’s face. He squints, seeing -- Billings. 
           Wounds patched. Color back in his cheeks. A pair of soldiers 
           yank him back, as--

           Pearce begins to HUM the OLD MINER’S SONG. Bare feet stepping 
           up the stairs to the gallows. The song CONTINUING OVER-- 

           EXT. WICKLOW, IRELAND - SUNSET (MONTHS LATER)

           Boots, stepping down from a carriage. A TALL MAN in new 
           clothes steps onto a familiar street. The man’s head turns, 
           gaze sweeping around like a lifetime has passed.

           On a corner, we find BOLGER, holes in his shoes, waving a tin 
           cup. A coin rattles into it. Bolger looks up. A tall figure 
           walking past him. Bolger frowns. Could it be?

           EXT. STONE COTTAGE - DUSK

           A hand with a scarred palm knocks on the door. It opens-- 
           To reveal SARAH GREENHILL. Her expression drops. Hands 
           falling to her sides. A tempest of emotions on her face. 

           Robert Greenhill stands before her. Clearly having expended 
           some unknown effort to look well for his return. But his eyes 
           tell a different story. The eyes of a man who has reached the 
           limits of physical and spiritual endurance to return home.

           EXT. GALLOWS - DUSK

           The grimy noose descends, hovering over Pearce like a halo. 

           The soldiers slip it down over his head. Pearce giving no 
           struggle, continuing to HUM THE OLD MINER’S SONG, over--

           INT. STONE COTTAGE - DUSK

           Greenhill, entering his home. It appears much the same, 
           though most of the furniture is gone. Likely sold off, at 
           some point. He picks up little Robert Jr., now 3; turns to 
           Sarah -- man and wife not even knowing where to begin, as--

           Colin appears from the kitchen, now a young man of 13. Wiping 
           his well-worked hands. Stopping when he sees Greenhill.

           Greenhill looks down in his son’s eyes.

           And Colin looks right back. Neither of them speaking. Father 
           and son just staring at each other, as--

           EXT. GALLOWS - DUSK

           The noose is cinched down around Pearce’s neck. Soldiers 
           position his feet over the trap door; step back. 

           Pearce looks to the darkening sky. A night wind coming in, 
           sweeping through the crowd. Women tighten shawls. Pearce 
           closes his eyes, the wind in his face, hair blown back. He 
           inhales deeply, enjoying every last breath.

           A MASKED EXECUTIONER reaches for the TRAP-DOOR LEVER. But 
           just before he pulls it-- 

           Pearce gives a WARM, GENUINE SMILE. A far cry from his old 
           alligator grin. STILL HUMMING, nearing the song’s end, OVER--

           INT. STONE COTTAGE - DUSK

           Sarah EMBRACES GREENHILL. Tears in her eyes. Holding him 
           tight. Greenhill’s haunted face rests on his wife’s shoulder. 
           His eyes slowly closing, ALMOST at peace, when--
                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Mother. Who is that man?

           Greenhill looks up, seeing Maggie, now 8. Staring at the 
           strange man in her house. Greenhill extends a calloused, 
           scarred hand, almost trembling, reaching out for her. 

           Maggie frowns, tilting her head. Her arm slowly beginning to 
           lift up from her side. But just before their hands touch...

           Pearce’s HUMMED TUNE is abruptly CUT OFF at the SOURCE.

                                                              BLACKOUT.

                                                CREDITS ROLL IN SILENCE.
