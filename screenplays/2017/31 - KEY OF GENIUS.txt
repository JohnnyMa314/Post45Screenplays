           In the Key of Genius: The Extraordinary Life of Derek Paravicini

                                  by Adam Ockelford
           CLOSE ON:

           A PIANIST’S HANDS.  Strong, nimble fingers.  Swiftly dancing 
           across black and white keys, performing the lyrical Sonatina 
           Romantica Nocturne by Benjamin Britten.

           The PIANIST flips the page of a thick, worn music binder.  
           Working through a vast collection of solo piano works.

           A WAITER glides past the Pianist, revealing:

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - ASCOT, ENGLAND - NIGHT

           The Waiter carries a chilled bottle of champagne through a 
           fine dining room packed with the upper crust of British 
           society.

           POP!  The Waiter is about to pour for MARY ANN PARAVICINI 
           (mid 30s), elegant and glowing, but she covers her glass.  

                                 MARY ANN
                        None for me, thank you.

                                 WAITER
                        Very good, madam. 

           Turning to the other side of the table, the Waiter pours for 
           NIC PARAVICINI (early 40s), a refined English gentleman.

           The Waiter leaves the bottle in a shiny ice bucket and lets 
           them enjoy their dinner.

           CAPTION: JULY 1979

                                 NIC
                        Think Libbet would like to see the 
                        match?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Please, Nic.  You already have a 
                        son who loves polo.

                                 NIC
                        And what would be so wrong with our 
                        daughter cheering on her bold and 
                        dashing father?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Bold and dashing, hmmm?

                                 NIC
                        My darling, I’m so glad you agree.
           Nic jovially raises his glass and sips his champagne.

           As Mary Ann bites into her salmon, something doesn’t feel 
           right.  CLANG - her fork drops.

                                 NIC (CONT’D)
                        Mary Ann?

           Mary Ann doubles over in pain, and for the first time we see 
           that she’s 6 MONTHS PREGNANT.

           As Nic rushes to her side, Mary Ann looks at him with 
           terrified eyes, gripping her aching belly...

           INT. ROYAL BERKSHIRE HOSPITAL - READING, ENGLAND - NIGHT

           The RATTLING of gurney wheels.

           Mary Ann flies down a fluorescent-lit corridor on the gurney, 
           GROANING from horrific discomfort, her face pale and sweaty.  
           Nic runs beside her, clutching her shaking hand.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Nic, this place...  It isn’t 
                        right...

                                 NIC
                        My darling, it was the closest 
                        option.  But I spoke to the staff - 
                        they’re going to do all they can.

           Mary Ann’s body convulses with contractions.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Not again, not again...  I can’t 
                        bear to lose another two.

           Tears well in her eyes as she’s wheeled away from Nic into:

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

           A pair of NURSES lift Mary Ann onto a bed. 

           Mary Ann writhes with pain, the contractions growing in 
           frequency and intensity.

           A sparse DELIVERY TEAM trickles in - the staff is thin at 
           this late hour.  A young DOCTOR rushes through the door, 
           trying to maintain her composure, despite it being one of her 
           first nights in charge.

           Mary Ann’s eyes land on TWO INCUBATORS.
                                 MARY ANN
                        Please...  It’s too soon...  

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’re going to do everything 
                        possible, Mrs. Paravicini.  I 
                        promise.

                                 MARY ANN
                        But I have another three months... 

           As her pain intensifies to an excruciating level, the room 
           swims around Mary Ann.  Through blurry vision, she catches 
           glimpses of:

           Nurses lifting her legs into stirrups...

           The Doctor wheeling in a stand of instruments...

           Her belly bulging in a long, sustained contraction...

           The Doctor reaches between her thighs and carefully withdraws 
           something small and limp.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Quick, clear her airway!  See if 
                        she’ll breathe!

           Mary Ann looks to the side as a tiny, motionless BABY GIRL is 
           placed in the first incubator.  The Girl is surrounded in a 
           swarm of activity.  

           Through all the chaos, Mary Ann listens.  Praying for any 
           sign of life...  

           Not a cry.  Not a murmur.

           The room grows silent.  The mournful looks exchanged by the 
           Nurses tell Mary Ann everything she needs to know.

           Mary Ann sinks into her pillow, wishing an end to this 
           nightmare. 

           Suddenly, a second wave of contractions floods her body.

           Quickly, the Doctor rushes forward, helped by the surrounding 
           Nurses.  The Doctor reaches in and pulls out a pitifully 
           small BABY BOY.  Flabby and unmoving.  The Doctor places him 
           into the second incubator.  

           Mary Ann holds her breath, waiting for the verdict...

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry.
           Mary Ann closes her eyes.  Too weak and devastated to 
           respond.  The worst moment of her life.

           The Doctor slowly slips off her gloves.  Nurses quietly work 
           together, tidying up.  And then there it is:

           The FAINTEST OF WHIMPERS.  

           Mary Ann holds her breath.  Aware that everyone else has gone 
           silent too.  Everyone turns towards the two babies.  
           Miraculously, the baby boy’s matchstick ribs rise and fall.  

           A Nurse spins towards the Doctor, urgency in her eyes.

                                 NURSE
                        What...  Shall we do?

           Before the Doctor can answer, Mary Ann gathers all the 
           strength she has left:

                                 MARY ANN
                        Go with it...

           In a flash, the Nurses and Doctor spring into a furious 
           battle to save the infant.

           As they wheel the baby and the incubator out of the room, an 
           exhausted Mary Ann closes her eyes and passes out.

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           A hand gently shakes Mary Ann, waking her up.  It’s Nic.

                                 NIC
                        My love...  Everyone’s ready.

                                 MARY ANN
                            (still groggy)
                        For what?

           INT. NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE - NIGHT

           Nic pushes Mary Ann in a wheelchair as a Nurse brings them 
           before their son.

           Mary Ann looks through the clear plastic of the rudimentary 
           incubator.  Lying face down on a small blue mattress is her 
           baby boy, dwarfed by a tiny diaper.  An alarming tangle of 
           tubes and wires connect machines to his teeny arms and nose.

           The energetic SISTER WALKER gently consoles Mary Ann.
                                 SISTER WALKER
                        And what do you think of your new 
                        son?

           Mary Ann barely smiles as she fixates on the boy’s two little 
           pink feet, which are no bigger than the tips of her fingers.

                                 SISTER WALKER (CONT’D)
                        He’s a record breaker!  The 
                        smallest we’ve ever had - just over 
                        700 grams.  He keeps us on our 
                        toes, doesn’t he?   Every now and 
                        then he forgets to breathe, so I 
                        have to remind him!

                                 NIC
                        Darling, may I introduce...

           Mary Ann barely glances up at the CHAPLAIN, too focused on 
           her boy.  His tiny shut eyes.  His thin, translucent skin. 

                                 CHAPLAIN
                        Christ claims you for his own.  
                        Receive the sign of the cross.

           The Chaplain dips his finger in oil and draws a cross on the 
           incubator.  

           As the Chaplain gives his christening SPEECH, Mary Ann 
           listens only to her son, drowning out all other sounds:

           The tube of oxygen HISSING into his nose.

           Liquid PUMPING into his thread-like veins.

           The erratic BEEP BEEP of his heart monitor.

                                 NIC
                        Mary Ann...  The names we 
                        discussed?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Yes.  Fine.

           Nic nods at the Chaplain:

                                 CHAPLAIN
                        We welcome Derek Nicolas Somerset 
                        Paravicini into the house of the 
                        lord.

           Nic grips Mary Ann tightly but she can’t do anything but 
           stare at DEREK.  His little wisps of curly blond hair.
           As the sympathetic Chaplain offers a few comforting words to 
           Nic, Mary Ann notices that Derek’s ribs have stopped moving.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Pardon me...

           The heart monitor ALARM goes off.  Derek is FLATLINING.

           The room explodes with activity as Nic quickly wheels out 
           Mary Ann.

           INT. ICU HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Nic wheels Mary Ann away as Nurses and the Doctor burst in 
           and out of the ICU.  Through the rapidly opening and closing 
           swinging door, Mary Ann catches glimpses of medical activity: 

           The Doctor repeatedly compressing Derek’s tiny chest.

           Nurses rapidly adjusting Derek’s oxygen levels.

           Nurses darting out of the way as the Doctor readies the 
           defibrillator...

           The door stops swinging.  All is still.

           Mary Ann and Nic freeze.  Expecting the worst.

           After a few moments, the Doctor steps out of the room.  Mary 
           Ann and Nic hold their breaths as she lowers her mask.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It appears your little Derek is 
                        rather determined to survive.

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - EVENING

           A MERCEDES 450SEL navigates a long, private driveway, passing 
           a fenced field full of grazing polo ponies and finely bred 
           racehorses.

           The big Mercedes pulls up in front of an old, stately, stone 
           manor.

           The front door flies open, revealing a tough, 5’0” 
           firecracker of an Englishwoman in her 60s.  With perceptive 
           eyes peering through thick-rimmed glasses and a lifelong 
           Virgin Mary pendant hanging around her neck, this is Winifred 
           Daly, better known as NANNY.

           Nanny rushes to the Paravicinis before they can even step out 
           of the car.
                                 NANNY
                        For goodness sake, Mary Ann - you 
                        can’t let him outside with only 
                        that.  He’ll catch his death!

           Before Mary Ann can interject, Nanny snatches baby Derek out 
           of her hands and bundles him up in a thick blanket.  Derek is 
           slightly bigger and healthier now, although he’s still well 
           below the size of a normal infant.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Yes, yes, Derek.  We’re going to 
                        have a wonderful time together, 
                        aren’t we. 

                                 MARY ANN
                        Thank you, Nanny.

           Nanny turns to the manor, where two well-dressed CHILDREN 
           wait anxiously in the doorway.

                                 NANNY
                        Come now Libbet and Charles, don’t 
                        be shy!  Your baby brother awaits!

           LIBBET (9) and CHARLES (11) hurry forward.  Excited to meet 
           their brother but too nervous to hold his tiny body, they 
           softly kiss him on the forehead.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Holding Derek in one arm, Nanny pokes her head in and out of 
           bedrooms, a relentless taskmaster.

                                 NANNY
                        Time for bed, children!

                                 LIBBET/CHARLES (O.S.)
                        But Nan...

                                 NANNY
                        Not another peep!  We’ve all had a 
                        long day.  Haven’t we, Derek.

           She carries the quiet baby into:

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

           Nanny gently places Derek in a CRIB right next to a regular 
           bed: Nanny’s bed.
           She holds up a bottle before Derek, who is incredibly calm 
           and relaxed.

                                 NANNY
                        You’re such a quiet little one, 
                        aren’t you.

           She lowers the bottle.  Derek lies still, only reacting when 
           the nipple touches his mouth.  He eagerly feeds.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t your new home lovely, Derek?  
                        I’m sure you’ll like it very much.  
                        Especially once you’re a big boy.

           Nanny covers Derek with a blanket and sings her favorite 
           tune, the Irish folk song Molly Malone.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        In Dublin’s fair city, where the 
                        girls are so pretty, I first set my 
                        eyes on sweet Molly Malone...

           She flips off the light, then settles into bed, HUMMING the 
           tune in the darkness.

           CLICK.  The light flips on.

                                 LIBBET
                        Nanny, could you read us one more?  
                        Please?

                                 NANNY
                        No no!  Back to bed!

           She glances at Derek, who stares straight up at the light, 
           his eyes wide open.

           Nanny instinctively holds her hand over Derek, blocking the 
           bright light.  Derek remains still, not reacting one bit.

           Nanny moves her hand in front of his face.  Derek doesn’t 
           even blink.

           Nanny flips off the light.  Then on again.  Derek still 
           stares straight up at the bright bulb, his eyes frozen.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Mary Ann!
           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DRAWING ROOM - NEXT MORNING 

           The Doctor that delivered Derek sits across from Mary Ann and 
           Nic, who look like they’ve been hit by a truck.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Pardon - retro what?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Retrolental Fibroplasia.  Likely a 
                        consequence of the uncontrolled 
                        levels of oxygen in his blood.

                                 NIC
                        Oxygen levels?  What do you mean?

                                 DOCTOR
                        The life support systems.  The 
                        optic nerve is extremely sensitive 
                        to fluctuations in...

                                 NIC
                        How long will it take to heal?

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s not that simple, I’m afraid.  
                        Derek’s retinas suffered permanent 
                        damage.

                                 NIC
                        There must have been another way.  
                        Perhaps a more seasoned doctor...

                                 DOCTOR
                        With all due respect, given the 
                        severe premature nature of his 
                        birth, we had no choice.  It’s a 
                        miracle he is with us at all.

                                 NIC
                        So nothing can be done?  This is 
                        unacceptable!

                                 MARY ANN
                        Nic...

                                 NIC
                        Please, doctor!

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m very sorry, Mr. Paravicini.  
                        I’ll add Derek to the registry for 
                        the blind as soon as I return to 
                        the office.
           Nic paces back and forth, unable to meet eyes with Mary Ann.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Doctor, thank you for everything.  
                        Truly.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Of course.  And do continue to 
                        monitor him.  There’s very little 
                        precedent for a case like Derek’s, 
                        so please ring me if you notice 
                        anything else out of the ordinary.

           As the Doctor leaves, Derek just lies quietly in his crib, 
           content and oblivious to the stunned stares of his parents.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:

           Morning sounds, audible through an open window.  Birds 
           CHIRPING.  Wind RUSTLING.

           CLICK.  A door opens.

           FOOTSTEPS.  Moving from left to right.

                                 NANNY (O.S.)
                        Time to wake up, Derek!  It’s a 
                        cheery, sunny day today.

           THWAP!  The sound of curtains flying open...

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DEREK’S ROOM - MORNING

           Blinding sunlight strikes the flowing blond locks and face of 
           a FIVE-YEAR-OLD-DEREK, lying in his bed.  His striking blue 
           eyes are wide open, unblinking in the bright light.

           CAPTION: SEVERAL YEARS LATER

           Derek GIGGLES mischievously as he buries himself under a 
           handmade, TEXTURED QUILT.  Nanny quickly yanks it off the 
           bed.

                                 NANNY
                        Time to get dressed.

           Nanny raises Derek’s arms to remove his pajamas.  Derek 
           lowers his arms in defiance and clumsily rolls off the bed.  
           SQUEAK SQUEAK!  He accidentally steps onto a stuffed rabbit.  
           Derek grabs the noisy toy, squeezing it repeatedly. 
                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        This simply will not do, young man.  
                        Come come!  

           Nanny pulls away the toy and plops it onto a neatly organized 
           toy shelf.  She raises Derek’s arms, not giving him another 
           chance to resist.  Derek GROANS but relents.

           Nanny quickly slips off his pajamas and holds up a crisp, 
           ironed polo, touching it to Derek’s hand.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        And here we have a polo shirt just 
                        like your daddy’s.  How do you feel 
                        about that?

           Derek gives the polo a long SNIFF, then nods his head 
           enthusiastically.  Nanny dresses him.

           As soon as the polo is on, Derek tries to escape but 
           accidentally bumps into his nightstand.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Careful, Bumpy.  That night stand 
                        is even more stubborn than you are.  

           Frustrated, Derek SCREAMS, then clenches his fists and rubs 
           them into his eyes.  Nanny pulls his fists away.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        No need to hurt yourself now.  
                        Let’s get you to breakfast.

           Nanny HUMS Molly Malone.  Derek forgets his fists as he 
           listens to the music, loving every last note.  He rocks to 
           and fro, his head weaving from side to side.

           Nanny gently takes Derek’s hand and leads him out of the 
           room.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - KITCHEN - DAY

           Nanny brings Derek into a noisy kitchen, his head jerking 
           back and forth as he hears all the different sounds:

           The HISS of a gas burner.  A tea kettle WHISTLING.  Mary Ann 
           CRINKLING the pages of a newspaper.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Good morning, Derek.

                                 NANNY
                        What do you say, Bumpy?
           Derek MUTTERS a slight greeting.

           Nanny pulls out a chair for Derek, purposely DRAGGING it so 
           he can hear exactly where it is.  He plops down.  

           Nanny grabs the kettle and POURS a steaming cup of tea for 
           Mary Ann.

           Derek perks up as he hears approaching CHAOTIC FOOTSTEPS:

           Libbet and Charles, who are now teenagers, stumble into the 
           kitchen, struggling with heavy SUITCASES.  They BANG several 
           walls before Nanny grabs the suitcases and sets them down.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Come now children, Alice and Ester 
                        will take care of those for you.  
                        Are we excited for the new term?

                                 LIBBET
                        Yes, Nanny.

                                 CHARLES
                        Very much so.

           Libbet playfully tickles Derek and Charles rustles his hair.

           Two maids, ALICE and ESTER, quickly grab the suitcases.  
           Derek listens as they CREAK open the front door.

           Nanny sets cups of orange juice in front of the children.  
           She taps Derek’s glass - CLINK - Derek reaches precisely for 
           its location and sips the juice.  

           Nic hurries to the table, CLICKS his briefcase shut, then 
           grabs JINGLING keys.

                                 NIC
                        Off we go, troops.

                                 LIBBET
                        Daddy, when will Derek be ready for 
                        school?

                                 NIC
                        In good time, darling. 

                                 NANNY
                        He’ll be ready when he’s ready.  

           Rushing out the door, Mary Ann and Libbet kiss Derek on the 
           cheek.  Charles rustles his blond hair one last time.  Nic 
           pats him on the back.
           The doors SLAMS shut.

           Derek hears the Mercedes REV and drive off, leaving him and 
           Nanny in relative silence.

           The house is quiet.  Derek quickly grows lonely and bored.  
           He sticks both thumbs in his mouth and extends his 
           forefingers upwards, poking at his eyelids.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s not start that again.  Why 
                        don’t we spend today learning about 
                        shapes.

           She sets a basket WOODEN SHAPES in front of Derek and places 
           a TRIANGLE in his hand.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Here we have a triangle.  Feel the 
                        sides?  One, two, three.

           Derek HURLS the triangle across the room.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        No need for dramatics, young man!

           She wheels a TOY FIRE ENGINE across the table, hoping the 
           sound of spinning tires will entertain Derek.  The boy steps 
           away from the table, his mind elsewhere.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        What is it, Derek?  What is it that 
                        you want?

           Derek feels around the kitchen, TAPPING on pots and pans.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        You know, you’re just as restless 
                        as your namesake.  Your grandfather 
                        Derek could never sit still, even 
                        into his later years.  Except when 
                        it came to his electric organ.  Oh 
                        how he loved his music...

           Derek BANGS away at the pots and pans, enamored by all the 
           CLANGING sounds.

           Nanny listens to the racket and an idea forms...
           INT. ATTIC - DAY

           The CREAK of old, warped floorboards.  Nanny pushes aside ski 
           gear, hatboxes and a croquet set, searching the dark, cramped 
           attic.  Her eyes land on a MASSIVE STORAGE CHEST.

           She CREAKS open the antique chest and dust flies everywhere, 
           nearly blinding her.  As the particles settle, she inspects 
           the unseen object before her.

                                 NANNY
                        Ester!  A hand please!

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - DAY

           Nanny and Ester carefully carry in a SMALL ELECTRIC ORGAN.  
           It’s an old, wooden box model from the early 1970s, and 
           features a music rack and a short row of dials.

           Nanny wipes down the several octaves worth of keys - it’s far 
           smaller than a standard piano.  She cautiously plugs it in 
           and steps back, half expecting the ancient device to go up in 
           flames.  The organ WHIRS to life.

           Nanny tries the notes one at a time.  A few keys stick and 
           several don’t sound at all but most of the keyboard is in 
           fine working condition.  

           SCRAMBLING FOOTSTEPS...

           Derek fumbles his way into the room, curious about the 
           unfamiliar sound.  Nanny sits him down in front of the organ.

                                 NANNY
                        This is your grandfather’s organ, 
                        Derek.

           Nanny plunks several NOTES.  Before she can finish, Derek 
           SHRIEKS with delight and reaches out both hands, urgently 
           trying to locate the source of this bewitching sound.  

           He pushes down keys with his palms, producing a chord 
           cacophony that only energizes him more.  He SLAPS at the 
           keyboard harder and harder, beside himself with excitement.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Derek!

           But Derek is too enthralled with this magical device.  He 
           drops his fists, pounding the keyboard repeatedly, 
           exhilarated by all the new sounds.  
           He raises his fists once again, brings them down and... 
           Nothing.  The organ remains silent.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s enough!

           Nanny holds the power cable in her hand.  Unplugged.

           Nothing can prepare her for the resulting meltdown: Derek’s 
           face flushes bright red and he erupts with a fiery rage.  He 
           SCREAMS violently, kicking and hitting everything in sight, a 
           fury unimaginable for a kid so small.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Young man, this simply will not do!

           She grabs Derek forcefully and drags him out of the room.

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DAY

           A serene cloudless day outside the stately manor.  Swans 
           calmly swim through the tranquil waters of a picturesque lake 
           located on the grounds.

           It’s a stark contrast to the violent tug-of-war being played 
           between Nanny and Derek.  Nanny drags Derek by the wrist, 
           hellbent on getting him to submit and walk with her.  

           Derek stubbornly digs his nails into her skin, kicking 
           against the ground, fighting desperately to escape.  The more 
           he struggles, the more Nanny tightens her grip, a force to be 
           reckoned with.

           Derek finally wears himself out and gives up.  Submitting to 
           Nanny’s iron will.  They walk slowly past the peaceful lake. 

                                 NANNY
                        Lovely day out isn’t it, Bumpy.

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - DAY

           The moment Nanny opens the door, Derek pushes his way inside 
           and frantically feels for the organ.

                                 NANNY
                        Wait!

           Derek freezes, obeying her instruction.  Nanny plugs in the 
           organ.  Derek recognizes the WHIRRING sound and rocks back 
           and forth with excitement.
                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Now.  Gently.  

           Derek leans forward and feels for the keys.  The music brings 
           pure joy to his face as his little fingers try out different 
           notes.

           Nanny relaxes.  Derek is finally learning.

           BANG!  Derek pounds violent chords left and right, unable to 
           restrain himself!

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DAY

           Another walk around the lake.

           It’s a battle of wills between Nanny and Derek.

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - DAY

           Derek sits at the organ, his hands at his sides, patiently 
           waiting for Nanny’s permission.

           CLICK.  She plugs it in.  WHIR.  The organ sparks to life.

                                 NANNY
                        Gentle...

           Derek pauses, then reaches for the keys.  More respectfully 
           this time.  His hands explore the keyboard, clumsily moving 
           higher then lower.

           Nanny nods.  Satisfied.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBBET’S ROOM - SIX WEEKS LATER

           Libbet’s suitcase from school lies open on the floor.  It’s 
           filled to the brim with textbooks.

           Libbet sits at her immaculately organized desk, fixated on 
           her reading assignment for the half-term holiday: 
           Shakespeare’s King Lear.

           PLINK.  PLINK.  

           Libbet leans closer to the page, trying to focus.

           PLINK.  PLINK.  Keyboard sounds from next door.
           She SLAMS the book shut.

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Libbet finds Derek PLINKING away at his electric organ.  

                                 LIBBET
                        Could you please keep it down?

           PLINK PLINK.

           Frustrated, Libbet turns down the volume dial herself.  Plink 
           plink - Derek keeps playing, unfazed by the volume change.  

           Libbet notices that Derek is playing the same sequence of 
           chords.  Systematically.

           She shrugs it off and rushes back to her room, annoyed.

           INT. MERCEDES - SUNDAY

           Charles and Libbet help Derek into the backseat as Nic and 
           Mary Ann slide into the front.  With Nic at the wheel, they 
           drive away from a centuries-old, stone church.

           Together, they sing All Things Bright and Beautiful, a jolly 
           CHURCH HYMN:

                                 FAMILY
                        All things bright and beautiful, 
                        All creatures great and small,   
                        All things wise and wonderful,   
                        The lord God made them all...

           Derek happily sways along to the music.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LATER

           As the family returns home, Derek shoves past everybody and 
           hurriedly feels his way to his room, clumsily bouncing off 
           walls and objects along the way.

                                 NANNY
                        Careful now, Bumpy!

           Several moments later: PLINK PLINK.

           INT. LIBBET’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Libbet scribbles with a pen, writing an extensive paper.
           PLINK PLINK.  

           She glares at the wall.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DEREK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Libbet is about to barge into Derek’s room when she stops.  
           And listens.  

           She hears a rudimentary version of All Things Bright and 
           Beautiful...

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Libbet slowly steps in and studies her brother.

           Despite his blindness and lack of technique, Derek is somehow 
           using a jumble of fists, palms, knuckles and fingers to 
           systematically play the organ’s black and white keys.  His 
           head rhythmically weaves back and forth.

           Without a doubt, he’s playing the church hymn!

                                 LIBBET
                        Mummy!  Daddy!  Quick!

           As Nic and Mary Ann rush into the room, Derek finishes the 
           hymn.

                                 NIC
                        Libbet, what’s the matter?

                                 LIBBET
                        Go on, Derek.  Play it again.

           Derek pulls Libbet’s hair, thinking it’s a joke.

                                 LIBBET (CONT’D)
                        No, Derek - the hymn from church!

           But Derek doesn’t understand.  Nic and Mary Ann shrug at each 
           other and walk away.

           Thinking quick, Libbet HUMS the tune.  Instantly, Derek’s 
           hands shoot back to the keys and he plays along.

           Nic and Mary Ann freeze in place, mesmerized.  Shocked to see 
           their son so skillfully playing this instrument.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Derek...  That’s lovely.
                                 NIC
                        How remarkable...

           Nanny rushes into the room, followed by Charles.

                                 NANNY
                        What’s all the fuss about?

           Hearing her voice, Derek breaks into a rudimentary 
           arrangement of Molly Malone.

           Nic, Mary Ann, Libbet, Charles and Nanny listen with wide 
           eyes, amazed at what they’re seeing and hearing.  Derek has 
           somehow taught himself how to play the organ.

           As the music crescendoes, Nanny can’t help but join in:

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Crying cockles and mussels, alive, 
                        alive oh!

           Nanny and Derek finish the song together and everyone breaks 
           into tremendous APPLAUSE.  

           Derek’s face erupts into a massive smile and he APPLAUDS 
           along with them!

                                                                CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS - DEREK FLYING THROUGH PIANO REPERTOIRE:

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Nanny places a NEEDLE onto a RECORD.  Derek tilts his head, 
           the CRACKLE OF STATIC catching his attention.

           He listens intently to a recording of I Can Sing a Rainbow, a 
           sweet and simple song.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - HALLWAY - DAY

           The recording resounds from the library.

           WHIP PAN to Derek’s door: we hear Derek PLINKING away at his 
           electric organ, repeating the same song. 

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Derek eagerly climbs onto the couch, ready for more.  Nanny 
           loads another record, playing the peppy, energetic song In an 
           English Country Garden.
           Derek can’t contain himself and feels his way to the record 
           player, listening to every SCRATCH of the needle as the 
           record spins round and round.  The music notes soaking into 
           his memory.

           As the same song ECHOES on the electric organ, the stack of 
           RECORDS grows.  The record player spins faster and faster...

           INT. BRITISH ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY

           Nic brings in their BROKEN RECORD PLAYER and shows it to a 
           MANAGER.  The Manager enthusiastically leads Nic to an aisle 
           with brand new CASSETTE PLAYERS.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Nanny turns a CASSETTE different ways, unsure how to load it 
           into the new player.  She pulls out a long stretch of 
           magnetic tape, struggling to play the damn thing.

           Derek reaches out, grabs the cassette and yanks out more and 
           more tape, surrounding them in a twisted mess.

           INT. BRITISH ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY

           A defeated Nic brings in the cassette player and receipt.  
           All he can do is shrug at the Manager.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           SCRAAAATCH.  The needle of a NEW RECORD PLAYER hits a vinyl 
           surface.  Derek leans in, listening closely.

           The SOUNDS OF RECORDS SPINNING...

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - DAY

           Derek bangs away at his electric organ, using different parts 
           of his body (hands, arms, elbows) to play in an incredibly 
           unorthodox manner.  But he’s somehow playing the lush, 
           lyrical Don’t Cry for Me, Argentina by Andrew Lloyd-Weber.

           Mary Ann, Nic and Nanny stand in the doorway, completely 
           transfixed.  As Derek finishes the piece, Mary Ann has tears 
           in her eyes.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Bravo.
           Derek stops, looks in the direction of his mother’s voice.

                                 DEREK
                            (perfect imitation)
                        Bravo.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - WINTER - DAY

           A BOX TRUCK rumbles along the snowy driveway, tires kicking 
           up fluffy powder, sliding to a stop in front of the manor.

           Two DELIVERY MEN hop out.  RATTLE RATTLE - they fling open 
           the rear gate, revealing a LARGE OBJECT HIDDEN BENEATH A 
           BLANKET.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           The family gathers around a decorated Christmas tree as the 
           Delivery Men carry in the blanketed object, straining under 
           its considerable weight. 

           Nanny brings in Derek, who listens intently as the Movers SET 
           DOWN the hefty object.

           The Movers slide off the blanket, unveiling a WELMAR UPRIGHT 
           PIANO.

                                 PIANO MOVER 
                        It might take a bit ‘o time to 
                        settle in.  The tuner’ll be along 
                        in a few days.

           As they gather the blankets...

           Nanny helps Derek run his hand over the piano’s smooth wooden 
           surface.

                                 NIC
                        Merry Christmas, Derek.

                                 DEREK
                        Merry Christmas, Derek.

                                 NANNY
                        No, Derek.
                            (annunciating clearly)
                        Merry Christmas, Daddy.
                                 DEREK
                            (perfect imitation)
                        Merry Christmas, Daddy.

           Nanny sits Derek down on the piano bench.  He’s so small that 
           his feet don’t even reach the pedals, dangling in the air. 

           Nanny carefully lifts open the cover, revealing 88 glistening 
           keys - a full size keyboard.

                                 NANNY
                        Alright, Bumpy.  Gently now.

                                 DEREK
                        Gently now.

           Nanny PLUNKS a note.  Derek cocks his head, responding to the 
           rich, yet unfamiliar sound of a real piano.  

           He reaches out, his little hands feeling for the keys.  He 
           pushes down, making contact with the piano - HIS piano - for 
           the first time.

           As he explores the new instrument, a beaming smile spreads 
           across his face.  He can hardly contain his excitement as he 
           familiarizes himself with the new instrument.

                                 NANNY
                        Why don’t you play us the Turkish 
                        March.

           Derek instantly snaps into gear, his limbs flailing in an 
           exploratory performance of Mozart’s whimsical masterwork.  
           It’s a complex, intricate piece, but Derek is somehow getting 
           through it, hitting nearly all the notes.

           The more Derek plays, the more excited he gets.  His hands 
           push down harder and harder, exploring the pressure-sensitive 
           keys.  Within moments, he’s using his fists to bang away at 
           the piano, playing way too loudly.

           Libbet and Charles cover their ears.  Mary Ann steps back.  
           Even Nanny flinches.  The volume is excruciating.

           Derek repeatedly hits one particular white note two-thirds of 
           the way up the keyboard.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Gentle, Derek!  Like we 
                        practiced...

           But Derek can only hear the piano now.  He fixates on that 
           one note, banging with increasing force.
           Even the piano movers stop in their tracks, witnesses to this 
           train wreck.

                                 NIC
                        What in the world’s got into him?

                                 PIANO MOVER
                        Sir?  Your son seems to have found 
                        an out of tune note...

           Derek obsesses over the note, pounding the poor piano.

                                 NANNY
                        DEREK SOMERSET PARAVI...

           SNAP!  TWANG!  A horrific sound rumbles within the piano. 

           Derek repeatedly pushes down on the now useless note, only 
           getting a DULL THUD.  

           Nic flings open the piano’s top panel and peers inside.  He 
           looks helplessly at the Piano Movers.

                                 PIANO MOVER
                        I reckon the tuner can help with 
                        that too...

           INT. LIBRARY - SEVERAL DAYS LATER

           MR. SUTTON, the piano tuner, performs surgery on the poor 
           piano.  The entire back cabinet has been opened up, revealing 
           a sea of felt hammers, strings and tuning pins.  

           Mr. Sutton spools out the BROKEN STRING and replaces it with 
           a brand new one.

           INT. DEREK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Derek sits at the edge of his bed, extremely tense.  

           He can hear the PLINKS of Mr. Sutton pressing individual 
           notes on the piano.  HIS piano.

           Nanny restrains Derek, holding him back.

           INT. LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           The PLINK PLINK of piano tuning.

           The door CREAKS open.
           Nanny leads Derek into the room, holding him tightly by the 
           wrist.  He squirms but can do nothing in her iron grasp.

                                 NANNY
                        Good morning, Mr. Sutton.

           She squeezes Derek’s hand.

                                 DEREK
                        Good morning, Mr. Sutton.

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        Ah, this must be our eager little 
                        performer.

                                 NANNY
                        Indeed.

           She sits Derek down several feet away from the piano.  Still 
           holding him back. 

           Derek rocks back and forth, anxious as Mr. Sutton PLINKS keys 
           and tunes the piano.  Derek hears every last note and 
           mechanism - the TAP of the keys, the felt hammers PINGING the 
           strings, even the tuning lever CREAKING the pins.

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        That should do it.

                                 NANNY
                        Derek, would you like to play for 
                        Mr. Sutton?  Gently?

                                 DEREK
                        Gently.

           Nanny leads him to the bench.  Sits him down.  Making sure 
           the kid behaves.

                                 NANNY
                        How about The Swan.

           Derek’s hands reach for the piano.  Struggling to contain his 
           excitement.  

           He launches into The Swan from Carnival of the Animals by 
           Saint-Saëns.  It’s a beautiful, expressive melody.  Even when 
           played by a strange combination of hands, arms and elbows.

           Mr. Sutton is visibly moved by the performance, floored by 
           this blind little pianist.  And more than amused by his 
           unorthodox technique.
           Reunited with his precious piano, Derek leans in, his 
           excitement growing.  Swimming in the music, he presses down 
           firmly, the volume increasing...

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Derek...

           Derek settles down.  And with a few gentle notes, he finishes 
           the piece.

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        Tremendous.  How long have you been 
                        practicing that piece, Derek?

                                 NANNY
                        Well he heard it for the first time 
                        on the radio last Thursday.  It was 
                        the original cello version, but 
                        he’s somehow figured it out.

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        I...  I see.  But surely he’s 
                        covered it with his music teacher?

                                 NANNY
                        I’m afraid not.  He’s never had any 
                        lessons.

           It takes Mr. Sutton a moment to swallow this insane fact.

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        Hmmmm.  I suppose that explains his 
                        rather unusual technique...  Derek, 
                        if I may.  Why don’t we try placing 
                        our thumbs on middle C and E.

           Mr. Sutton reaches out and taps those notes.  Derek violently 
           shoves him to the side, protective of his precious piano.

                                 NANNY
                        Derek!

                                 MR. SUTTON
                        It’s quite alright.  Perhaps we can 
                        try a different approach.  Derek, 
                        let’s start by relaxing your hands.  
                        Elbows at your sides.

           He tries to adjust Derek’s hands.  SLAP!  Derek violently 
           whacks him away.  A startled Mr. Sutton jumps back, avoiding 
           a tirade of punches and kicks...
                                 NANNY
                        That’s enough young man!  Mr. 
                        Sutton, I do apologize.  I don’t 
                        know what’s got into Derek.

           She closes the piano cover and pulls Derek away.

           INT. NIC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nic works at his stately wooden desk when Mary Ann enters, 
           looking exasperated.  She’s holding a recently opened LETTER.

                                 NIC
                        What is it, my darling?

                                 MARY ANN
                        The education authority...  They’re 
                        requesting a meeting to discuss 
                        Derek’s school placement.

                                 NIC
                        I am sure we can decide what is 
                        best for our son.

                                 MARY ANN
                        It appears we don’t have a choice 
                        in the matter.

           She hands the letter to Nic.  As he reads it, his frustration 
           builds.

                                 NIC
                        What’s this about an assessment?  
                        They know he’s blind, don’t they?

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Nanny ushers in a neatly attired PSYCHOLOGIST, who carries an 
           ominous black leather briefcase.

                                 NANNY
                        Come come, don’t be shy.  Miss 
                        Edwards, I’d like to introduce you 
                        to Mrs. Paravicini.

           Mary Ann stands tensely by the fireplace, uncomfortable with 
           this meeting.  She extends her hand.

                                 MARY ANN
                        How do you do.  Please - sit down.
           She gestures to a seat next to an immaculately dressed Derek.  
           Sensing the anxiety in the air, he fidgets, his fingers 
           twisting awkwardly over and under each other.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Hello there.

           She tries to shake Derek’s hand.  He SNIFFS her hand instead.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        And what’s your name?

           Derek remains silent.

                                 NANNY
                        Derek.

           The Psychologist casts a questioning glance at Nanny.  Then 
           at Mary Ann.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Would you care for some tea?

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        That would be lovely.

                                 NANNY
                        Of course.  Right away.

           Once Nanny leaves the room, the Psychologist takes out her 
           clipboard.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        And who’s she exactly?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Nanny.

                                 DEREK
                        Nanny...

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Does Nanny have, er...  a 
                        particular name?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Yes.  Nanny.

           The embarrassed Psychologist looks back at her form.  She’s 
           unsure where to put the name Nanny: title, first name or 
           family name?  She leaves the line blank.
                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Derek, it must be wonderful living 
                        on a farm.  All those real animals.  
                        Do you know any of their names?

           Derek rocks back and forth.

                                 NANNY (O.S.)
                        How about Sefton?

           She reenters the room, carrying a tray of tea.  The 
           Psychologist stares at Nanny, processing what she just said.

           Nanny sets down the tray, picks up a framed PHOTO from the 
           mantel and shows it to the Psychologist: the photo shows 
           Derek sitting astride a majestic horse, a joyous grin on his 
           face.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Isn’t that...

                                 NANNY
                        The cavalry horse famously injured 
                        by the IRA?  Why yes.  Derek’s 
                        uncle is the regimental commander 
                        of the Household Cavalry.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        How...  Lovely.  Moving on - why 
                        don’t we try some activities.

           From a cloth bag in her briefcase, she withdraws two SHAKERS - 
           one small and one large.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Here you are, Derek.  

           She places the shakers in Derek’s hands.  He SHAKES them 
           vigorously.   Nanny CLEARS HER THROAT.  The shaking stops.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Now Derek.  Can you give me the big 
                        one?

                                 DEREK
                        The big one...

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Yes, that’s right.

           Derek throws the shakers on the floor.  Mary Ann stares at 
           the fire, trying to hide her embarrassment.
                                 NANNY
                        Derek!

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        How about we try something easier.  
                        Derek, can you please raise your 
                        left hand for me?

           Derek fidgets.

                                 NANNY
                        Bumpy, go on, raise your left hand 
                        for Miss Edwards.

           Derek cocks his head, trying to understand.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Can you raise your hand?  Your left 
                        one?

           Slowly, Derek raises his right hand.  But not even to answer 
           the question - he’s reaching for the Psychologist’s hair...

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                            (quickly corralling Derek)
                        He may not know his left from his 
                        right but you should hear him play 
                        the piano!

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        I’m sorry, come again?

           OVER THE SOUNDS of Derek playing the smooth, more 
           contemporary song Streets of London...

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LATER

           The Psychologist stumbles out of the manor, her eyes wide 
           with disbelief.  As she hurries to her car, she casts a 
           frazzled look at the stately home, trying to make sense of 
           the strange juxtaposition she just witnessed.

           INT. EDUCATION AUTHORITY OFFICE - SEVERAL DAYS LATER

           Nic and Mary Ann sit across an imposing table from the 
           Psychologist, a SOCIAL WORKER and an EDUCATION OFFICER.  A 
           high tension hangs in the air.
                                 EDUCATION OFFICER
                        Bearing in mind all we’ve heard, 
                        we’ve been thinking about which 
                        school would be best suited for 
                        Derek.  Do you know Westmead?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Is that a music school?

                                 EDUCATION OFFICER
                        It’s a special school - for 
                        children with a wide range of 
                        disabilities.

                                 NIC
                        That doesn’t sound right for our 
                        son.

                                 EDUCATION OFFICER
                        Respectfully, we disagree.  It’s 
                        our duty to place him correctly.

                                 NIC
                        Surely a school for the blind will 
                        suffice?

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        If I may.  Derek’s condition is a 
                        bit more... Complex.  

                                 MARY ANN
                        Complex how, Miss Edwards?

                                 NIC
                        The boy needs to learn Braille.  
                        There’s nothing complex about that.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Nic...

           Nic takes a deep breath.

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Mr. Paravicini, we need to make 
                        sure all Derek’s special needs are 
                        met...

                                 NIC
                        Yes, and being with other blind 
                        children will guarantee that. 

           The authority members exchange looks.  They aren’t accustomed 
           to dealing with an upper class family like this.  And Nic 
           clearly isn’t hearing them.
                                 EDUCATION OFFICER
                        I suppose we could explore some 
                        other options...

                                 NIC
                        Outstanding.  Are there any such 
                        schools for the blind near us in 
                        Berkshire?

           The defeated Education Officer nods at the Social Worker, who 
           pages through a thick document.

                                 SOCIAL WORKER
                        Well there are a few possibilities 
                        closer to London...

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND - DAY

           On a quiet, tree-lined street in the upscale, suburban 
           neighborhood of WIMBLEDON... 

           The Paravicini Mercedes glides over pavement, then makes a 
           turn into a driveway and RUMBLES over cobblestones.  

           The car slowly pulls up to an impressive brick Tudor style 
           building.  They’ve arrived at:

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - DAY

           Derek holds his parents’ hands as they wind through the 
           school, following HEADMISTRESS BRUMM, who gives them a tour.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Linden Lodge was established in 
                        1902 as a school for blind boys.  
                        After the war, we took in a class 
                        of girls from Elm Court, which was 
                        damaged during the Blitz, and we 
                        became a coeducational institution.

           They pass numerous BLIND STUDENTS.  Derek jerks his head left 
           and right, soaking in all the strange sounds, trying to make 
           sense of his surroundings.  He quickly becomes overwhelmed 
           and pokes at his eyes.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM (CONT’D)
                        We pride ourselves in being at the 
                        forefront of education.  In fact, 
                        we were one of the first schools to 
                        integrate Braille throughout our 
                        curriculum.
           Derek perks up as he hears a familiar PLINKING: the 
           unmistakable sound of a PIANO.   Without hesitating, he 
           wriggles free of his parents...

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           KELLY (6), small, cute and blind, sits at a piano, attempting 
           to play ABBA’s Super Trouper. 

           Sitting next to her on the piano bench is her teacher, a 
           patient man with kind yet sharp eyes, and a beard that 
           despite its bushiness, can never conceal a welcoming 
           expression.  This is ADAM OCKELFORD (30s). 

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, very good Kelly.  Can you try 
                        that scale again for me?

           As Kelly starts again, the door behind them CLICKS open.  
           Kelly stops.  Adam turns and sees a small blond boy standing 
           in the doorway.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Kelly, I believe we have an 
                        audience.  Would you like to play 
                        for our visitor?

           Kelly reaches for the piano and plays once again, focusing 
           extra hard for this impromptu performance.

           Adam hears SCRAMBLING FOOTSTEPS, then a SQUEAL - almost a 
           shriek - and feels something WHACK him in the back.

           He turns right into a mop of blond hair flying into his face.  
           A bundle of daemonic energy, Derek tries to push Adam away 
           from the piano.

                                 MARY ANN (O.S.)
                        Pardon the interruption...

           Mary Ann and Nic hurry into the room, followed by an 
           irritated Headmistress Brumm.

           Hearing another voice, Kelly starts playing again.  Derek 
           zeroes in on this piano intruder and shoves her off the 
           bench.  Adam catches Kelly - just barely - and puts himself 
           between her and the little blond menace.

                                 NIC
                        Derek!
                                 ADAM
                        Don’t worry.  Are you all right, 
                        Kelly?  Good good.  It appears we 
                        have a visitor.  Up you come, 
                        Derek.

           Adam lifts the wriggling Derek in the air and plunks him down 
           on the piano bench between himself and Kelly, who scoots as 
           far away as possible.

           Immediately, like someone possessed, Derek attacks the 
           keyboard, a frenzy of fingers, knuckles, thumbs, karate chops 
           and elbows.  

                                 NIC
                        Our apologies.  He’s already broken 
                        our piano at home once...

           But Adam isn’t paying attention to Nic.  He can’t tear his 
           eyes away from Derek and his insane technique.  Through all 
           the banging notes, he listens to the unmistakable strains of 
           Don’t Cry for Me, Argentina.

           And just as quickly, the music morphs into Mozart.  Then In 
           an English Country Garden.  Then Saint-Saëns.  A dizzying yet 
           incredibly coherent kaleidoscope of different music.

           Adam can’t believe what he’s seeing and hearing.  Even Kelly 
           listens with astonishment, her face lighting up.

           Instinctively, Adam tries to join Derek with a bass line.  
           Derek redirects a left elbow his direction, cutting him off.

           Adam tries playing a note an octave lower.  THWAP!  He gets 
           karate chopped.

           Adam can’t help but LAUGH out loud.

                                 ADAM
                        How many pieces does he knew?

                                 NIC
                        We lost track after the first few 
                        dozen.  The boy hears a piece once 
                        and he knows it.

                                 ADAM
                        And who is his teacher?

                                 NIC
                        Well...  No one, actually.  We 
                        don’t think he is ready yet.
                                 ADAM
                        It’s never too soon to start.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Thank you so much for your time, 
                        Adam.  Let’s resume the tour and 
                        give Kelly her piano back, shall 
                        we?  

           As Nic lifts Derek away from the piano, Derek SCREAMS and 
           kicks at the air, nearly hitting Adam in the face.

           Adam stares at the boy, fascinated, as his parents carry him 
           out of the room.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - OFFICE - EVENING

           Adam tracks down Headmistress Brumm at her desk.

                                 ADAM
                        Miss Brumm, could I trouble you for 
                        the information of that couple 
                        whose boy played the piano?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Certainly.  Should be right here in 
                        my intray...

           She glances at a black hole of papers, notes and messages.  
           She riffles through and finds nothing helpful.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM (CONT’D)
                        If I recall...  The surname - it 
                        was “Para” something or other.  
                        Sounded rather Italian.

                                 ADAM
                        Any idea where they live?

           Headmistress Brumm racks her brain, struggling to remember.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Anything else at all?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Tanks.  That’s it - tanks.

                                 ADAM
                        Tanks?  They live near tanks? 

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        No no.  The father’s company is 
                        named after some sort of tank...
                                 ADAM
                        Water tanks perhaps?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        No, the armoured vehicle variety.  
                        Begins with the letter “S.”  
                        Somewhere in London.  

           Adam scribbles down all the hazy details.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM (CONT’D)
                        But if I were you, I wouldn’t 
                        bother.

                                 ADAM
                        Why not?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        They’re looking at a number of 
                        schools.  And ours is quite out of 
                        their way.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - LIBRARY - DAY

           Adam passes STUDENTS running their fingers over blank pages - 
           they’re reading Braille.

           He navigates past stacks filled with BRAILLE BOOKS.

           When Adam arrives at a much smaller section of regular books,  
           he searches and finds an ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA (if 
           Americans read that, does that mean Brits read the 
           Encyclopedia Americana?).  He plucks out the “T” volume.

           He flips open the heavy book and finds an entry about TANKS 
           AND ARMOURED VEHICLES.  He finds a list of vehicle names and 
           scribbles down those that start with “S”: Saladin armoured 
           car, Saracen personnel carrier, Sherman tank.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE FACULTY HOUSING - ADAM’S FLAT - DAY

           Adam lives in a small studio on the Linden Lodge campus.  The 
           cramped space is littered with scattered piano parts and 
           piled up sheet music.

           Adam sits on the edge of a floppy twin sized mattress, 
           several feet away from an old upright piano that was somehow 
           squeezed into this tiny space.

           He pages through a YELLOW PAGES, scanning through businesses 
           named Saladin, Saracen and Sherman.
           The first one is “Saladin Securities.”  He grabs an 
           antiquated rotary phone and dials the number.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, hello.  This may be a bit of 
                        an odd request but is there a 
                        gentleman there whose last name 
                        begins with “Para”?  No?  Thank you 
                        so much for your time.

           He SLAMS the phone.  Crosses out the listing.

           He finds the next business.  Dials the next number.

           The phone SLAMS over and over again.  Adam crosses out more 
           listings.  Within moments, no more possibilities remain.

           As he gazes at the crossed out listings, his eyes shift to 
           one other company: Sarasin Investment Management.  Sarasin, 
           Saracen...  Same pronunciation, different spelling.

           He shrugs and dials, expecting another dead end when a 
           SECRETARY answers:

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Nic Paravicini’s office - may I 
                        help you?

           Adam’s eyes light up.

           INT. TRIUMPH VITESSE - WINTER DAY

           Adam shivers behind the wheel of his Triumph Vitesse, an old 
           putrid green saloon from 1970.

           He can see his breath as ice cold wind blows inside through 
           the car’s ill-fitting window seals.

           His wipers are no match for the snow that swirls outside.

           He glances at the passenger seat, at a note with hastily 
           scribbled directions.  He peers outside, struggling to locate 
           street signs in the wintery British countryside.

           Finally, he comes across FOREST ROAD, double checks his 
           directions and makes a quick turn, his car’s worn tires 
           sliding through slush.

           He passes several large country estates before arriving at 
           NORTH LODGE FARM.  The stately manor awaits.

           CAPTION: FEBRUARY 1985
           Adam consults his directions one last time and turns up the 
           driveway.

           The Vitesse CLUNKS over a cattle grid and shakes up the long 
           gravel drive.  Poor car.

           Adam struggles to figure out where to park: near the stable 
           yard?  Between two luxury cars near the manor entrance?

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - MOTOR COURT - SAME

           The Vitesse edges between Nic’s Mercedes and a Jaguar.

           Adam steps outside and SLAMS his driver’s door.  A large 
           flake of rust falls into the fresh snow.

           Adam approaches the grand house entrance, passing Georgian-
           style columns, two imposing stone dogs and a more down-to-
           earth hedgehog boot cleaner.

           Adam RINGS the bell.  Huddling to stay warm in the cold.

           The door flies open.  Nanny materializes and gives Adam a 
           quick once over, scrutinizing him through her thick glasses.  

                                 NANNY
                        Mr. Ockelford?  Good afternoon.  Do 
                        come in.  I’m Nanny.  Bumpy’s 
                        waiting for you.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - HALLWAY - DAY

           Adam enters and nearly runs into Alice.

                                 NANNY
                        Alice will take your coat.

           Adam hands her his coat, feeling a bit out of place.

           Nanny ushers Adam through a hallway dominated by an ornate 
           wooden staircase.  Old paintings of champion race horses line 
           the walls.

           They pass the sitting room.  The door is ajar, and Adam 
           catches a glimpse of Mary Ann and Nic inside.  Adam raises 
           his hand, about to greet them when Nanny gently shuts the 
           door.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Right this way.

           She leads Adam into:
           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - DAY

           Sitting on a couch is Derek, smartly dressed in white 
           trousers and a blue sweater.  He rocks in place and fiddles 
           with his hands, nervous but excited. 

                                 NANNY
                        Bumpy!  You remember Mr. Ockelford, 
                        don’t you?

                                 ADAM
                        Please, call me Adam.

                                 NANNY
                            (annunciating for Derek)
                        Good afternoon, Adam.

                                 DEREK
                            (perfect imitation)
                        Good afternoon, Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        Hello, Derek.  Shall we play the 
                        piano?

                                 DEREK
                        Play the piano.

           Nanny shows Adam to a dining room chair, prepared just for 
           him a few feet away from the piano.  Adam takes a seat, 
           trying to ignore the staring gazes of all the Paravicini 
           ancestor paintings that line the walls.

           Nanny lifts Derek onto the piano bench.

                                 NANNY
                        Now, I expect Adam would like to 
                        hear some Beethoven, wouldn’t you, 
                        Adam?  How about the Cantabile?

                                 ADAM
                        The Cantabile?

           Derek’s hands reach out.  Somehow knowing precisely where the 
           keys are (and the key of the piece), he launches into the 
           tranquil slow movement from Beethoven’s Pathétique sonata.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Ah, the Pathétique...

                                 NANNY
                        We call it the Cantabile.
           Adam marvels at Derek’s ability to play the difficult piece 
           with his unique combination of thumbs, knuckles and elbows.  
           As Adam listens closer, he catches a bizarre detail.

                                 ADAM
                        One moment...  Why is he playing in 
                        E flat?

                                 NANNY
                        I’m not sure what you mean.

                                 ADAM
                        This movement is written in A flat.

                                 NANNY
                        Hmmm.  I suppose Bumpy just plays 
                        it like he hears it.  Tea?

                                 ADAM
                        Thank you.

           Nanny leaves the room.  Puzzled by this mystery, Adam studies 
           Derek, then notices the record player, which holds a 
           recording of the Beethoven.  He hits PLAY.  Derek perfectly 
           follows the recording.

           But something still doesn’t sound right to Adam.  He checks 
           the settings: the record speed is 45RPM.  Aha!  Adam adjusts 
           the dial down to 33RPM.  The record slows and the MUSIC 
           SHIFTS from E flat major into A flat.  The correct key. 

           Adam can’t believe what happens next: Derek quickly adjusts 
           both hands and continues playing the piece in this different, 
           correct key.  Seamlessly changing to A flat on the fly!

           Adam shakes his head - amazed.

           The mystery solved, Adam decides to take charge of this 
           lesson.  He sneaks next to Derek and tries to join in with a 
           bass line.  Derek’s left hand swats away Adam’s fingers.

           Adam steps to the other side of the piano and tries to echo 
           the melody, playing notes high up and as far away from Derek 
           as possible.  In a flash, Derek pushes him out of the way.

           Seeing an opening in the middle of the keyboard, Adam quickly 
           leans over Derek’s shoulder and adds in a quick note.  WHAM!  
           Derek hits him away with the back of his head.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Won’t you allow me to join in, 
                        Derek?
           But before he can make another attempt, Nanny reenters with 
           two fresh cups of tea.

                                 NANNY
                        How are we getting on?

           Derek smiles at the sound of her voice and concludes the 
           Beethoven with a few whimsical chords of his own.

                                 ADAM
                        Interesting ending there, Derek...

                                 NANNY
                        Wasn’t it lovely?  What shall we 
                        have next?  How about A Nightingale 
                        in Berkeley Square?

           Before Adam can interject, Derek dives into the more poppy 
           British song.  All Adam can do is sip his tea and munch on a 
           biscuit.

           Under Nanny’s watchful gaze, Adam makes several more attempts 
           to play with Derek but he gets WHACKED away every time.  
           Nanny just smiles, enjoying the music.

           The theme repeats and Adam notices Derek playfully adding a 
           few improvisations, making the piece his own.

           As Derek reaches the final chorus, Nanny joins in, belting at 
           the top of her lungs.  

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Aaaaaand like an echo far 
                        awaaaaaay, a nightingale sang in 
                        Berkeley Square!

           Derek leads her along, even changing keys to accommodate her 
           inability to hit higher notes.

           They finish the song.  Nanny APPLAUDS, gesturing Adam to do 
           the same.  Derek APPLAUDS back.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        How about another...

           As she suggests another piece to Derek, Adam sits in silence, 
           unable to get a word in.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - HALLWAY - LATER

           Walking hand in hand with Derek, Nanny escorts Adam out.
                                 NANNY
                        What a lovely lesson.
                            (to Derek)
                        “Thank you, Adam.”

                                 DEREK
                        Thank you, Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        You’re very welcome, Derek.

           They step in silence to the front door.  Nanny assumes this 
           means they won’t be meeting again.

                                 NANNY
                        We very much appreciate your time, 
                        Adam.  Best of luck with all your 
                        endeavors.

           She opens the front door.  Adam’s mind races.

                                 ADAM
                        Next Saturday at eleven if that 
                        suits?

           Pleasantly surprised, Nanny’s face brightens.

                                 NANNY
                        Very well then.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE FACULTY HOUSING - ADAM’S FLAT - NIGHT

           It’s the middle of the night.  Adam’s bed is vacant, the 
           comforter tossed aside haphazardly.

           Unable to sleep, Adam sips tea in his small kitchenette (if 
           one counter with half a refrigerator and a tiny cooktop can 
           even be called that).  His eyes fixed on his old piano.

           He sets down the tea and digs through his numerous piles of 
           music.  After much searching, he finds the sheet music for 
           Beethoven’s Pathétique sonata.

           He sits at the piano and flips open to the second movement - 
           the Adagio Cantabile.  The same piece Derek played for him.

           Adam extends his hands and plays the piece, quietly, trying 
           not to wake the neighbors.  His fingers move fluidly over the 
           keys, playing beautifully in the correct key of A flat major.

           After a moment, he stops and adjusts his hands.  Trying to 
           modulate to a different position and play in E flat major.  
           He slowly trudges through the first few notes and chords and 
           then fumbles the harmonies, unable to fully play in this 
           unnatural feeling key.  After a few attempts, he gives up.

           He glances at his hands and can’t help but smirk.

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - ONE WEEK LATER - MORNING

           Adam’s clunker of a car GRINDS to a stop.

           He approaches the manor entrance.  Before he can even knock, 
           Nanny flings open the door.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh.  Hello.  Good timing.

                                 NANNY
                        Derek heard you pull up.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Derek hears FOOTSTEPS and looks up just as Nanny brings in 
           Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        Good morning, Derek.

           Derek rocks back and forth, anxious and excited.  Adam places 
           his hand on Derek’s shoulder, reassuringly calming him down.

                                 NANNY
                        Up you go, Bumpy.

           She reaches for Derek, about to lift him onto the piano 
           bench, when Adam CLEARS his throat.

                                 ADAM
                        Nanny, if I may...

                                 NANNY
                        Yes?

           Derek wriggles, desperate to get to his piano.

                                 ADAM
                        Derek has tremendous musical 
                        potential.  More than I’ve ever 
                        seen - in anyone.  But unless he’ll 
                        allow me to help sort out his 
                        technique, his playing will always 
                        be limited.
                                 NANNY
                        That’s why we’re having lessons, 
                        aren’t we?

           She plops Derek onto the piano bench.

                                 ADAM
                        What I mean, actually, is...

           Nanny turns, displeased, unused to being challenged.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Derek needs to learn to relate to 
                        me.  To trust me completely.

                                 NANNY
                        Meaning?

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll need to work with him on my 
                        own.

           Nanny processes.

                                 NANNY
                        I see.
                            (moving on)
                        Bumpy, how about we play some 
                        Debussy for Adam.

           Before Adam can interject again, Derek dives into Debussy’s 
           impressionistic Reverie. 

           Adam sits back, listening patiently.  But he’s not watching 
           Derek - he’s watching Nanny.  She studies Derek’s bizarre 
           elbow and karate chop technique that, while impressive, is 
           clearly hindering the flow of the tranquil song.

           Derek finishes the piece.  He spins around, expecting 
           applause, but receives none.  Adam remains silent.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Right, Bumpy.  I have some sorting 
                        to do upstairs.  Play nicely and 
                        I’ll see you later.

           She gives Derek a big kiss and leaves.  Adam nods in 
           appreciation, surprised by Nanny’s decisiveness.  The moment 
           the door shuts...

                                 ADAM
                        Right.
           He sits down next to Derek on the piano stool, feeling the 
           little boy tense up.  Adam plays a quick middle C, rapidly 
           retreating his hand before SMACK!  Derek’s hand crashes down 
           on the keys, just missing him.  Derek then plays the same C.

           Adam grips Derek’s wrists.  Derek wriggles to no avail as 
           Adam wedges both of his little wrists into his left hand, 
           then plays a quick C major chord with his right.  

           Derek SCREAMS, somehow frees his little hands and pushes Adam 
           away.  And then plays the same C major chord perfectly.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Ok, Derek.  How about we play a 
                        little game.

           Without warning, he lifts the child into the air, carries him 
           to the far end of the room and sets him down.  Adam quietly 
           steps back to the piano, leaving a very confused Derek.

           Returning to the piano, Adam plays a one-handed five-finger 
           exercise: one white key per finger and the thumb - C D E F G.

           PITTER PATTER PITTER PATTER.  Derek scrambles back to the 
           piano, crashing into lamps and chairs along the way.  Within 
           seconds, he pushes Adam away from his precious instrument.

           Adam whips around to see what Derek will do next: the boy 
           quickly presses down on the keyboard, playing the five notes 
           simultaneously.

           Adam can’t help but LAUGH at his antics.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You like this game, don’t you?

           As he lifts Derek and carries him to the other side of the 
           room again...

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DEREK’S ROOM - SAME

           Nanny sorts clean clothes into Derek’s dresser, neatly 
           organizing shirts, pants and socks.  She softly hums Molly 
           Malone to herself.

           Suddenly, she hears YELLING.  Back and forth STAMPEDING 
           FOOTSTEPS.  The BANGING of piano keys.

           Off her shocked face...
           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Nanny bursts in on a bizarre sight:

           Adam sets Derek down on the far end of the room and the two 
           of them race back to the piano.  Derek lags a split second as 
           he listens to the direction of Adam’s footsteps, then takes 
           off in hot pursuit, chaotically BUMPING things along the way.

           Because of that split second and his longer legs, Adam 
           reaches the piano first, with just enough time to PLAY the 
           five-finger exercise before a chasing Derek shoves him away.

           An out-of-breath Adam watches as Derek imitates him, this 
           time playing one note at a time: C D E F G.

           An appalled Nanny CLEARS her throat, grinding the lesson to a 
           screeching halt.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Adam sits across from Nanny, sheepishly sipping tea.

           Nanny stirs her tea rhythmically, a tight grip on her spoon.

                                 NANNY
                        Tell me, Adam.  Are such unusual 
                        methods tolerated at your school?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes - when that is what an unusual 
                        child requires.

           Nanny stirs her tea a bit more aggressively.

                                 NANNY
                        How long have you been teaching at 
                        Linden Lodge?

                                 ADAM
                        Well my full-time appointment as 
                        Head of Music only started recently 
                        but...

                                 NANNY
                        Recently.  I see.  And before that?

                                 ADAM
                        I volunteered in the evenings.

                                 NANNY
                        So no other teaching experience...
                                 ADAM
                        No - I was too busy with my piano 
                        and composition studies.  At the 
                        Royal Academy...

           He sips his tea, letting that fact sink in.

                                 NANNY
                        Ah.  I see.  You wanted to be a 
                        professional musician.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, exclusively.  That is, until 
                        my first visit to Linden Lodge.

                                 NANNY
                        Oh?

                                 ADAM
                        It was quite the humbling 
                        experience, actually...

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER - DAY

           A younger Adam follows his friend PAUL down a long, narrow 
           and dimly lit corridor - many of the bulbs have burned out.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        It was a complete chance encounter 
                        as these things so often are.  My 
                        landlady’s son Paul happened to be 
                        a musician.  Or so he claimed.  So 
                        you can imagine my skepticism when 
                        he told me about these incredible, 
                        blind children.

           As they pass several doors leading to practice rooms, Adam 
           hears a PIANO...  Someone is playing highly technical 
           passages with remarkable finesse.

           Paul CREAKS open a door, revealing:

           A PITCH BLACK PRACTICE ROOM.  Barely illuminated by the 
           gloomy hallway light.

           Through the darkness, Adam sees a child’s hands dancing 
           across a keyboard, playing the chilling Prelude & Fugue in c 
           minor by Bach.  An impressive feat for any music student.

           Paul flips on the light, revealing TOBY, an 11-YEAR-OLD BLIND 
           BOY.  Adam is stunned.
                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        I had never seen anything like it.  
                        I quickly grew to understand that 
                        Toby wasn’t the only one.  

                                                             RETURN TO:

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - KITCHEN - DAY

           Nanny listens to Adam’s story with great interest.

                                 ADAM
                        Just like Derek, many of these 
                        blind children had perfect pitch. 
                        About forty percent.  Considerably 
                        more than my peers at the Academy.

                                 NANNY
                        So that’s why they gravitated 
                        towards music?

                                 ADAM
                        That’s right.  But these children 
                        didn’t just love the music - they 
                        needed it.  It was their form of 
                        expression and communication.  
                        After that, I couldn’t stay away.

                                 NANNY
                        What happened to Toby?

                                 ADAM
                        He was quite a bit older than Derek 
                        when I met him.  No one really knew 
                        how to handle all his disabilities 
                        back then, so he was never treated 
                        like a serious music student.

           Adam takes a long sip of tea.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I tried all that I could.  Evolving 
                        his technique, putting him in 
                        ensembles...  But it was too late.  
                        He was too set in his ways.  If 
                        only I had met him earlier...

           Adam finishes his tea, contemplative.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        But you should have heard him.  He 
                        was a remarkable talent.
                                 NANNY
                        And you see that same potential in 
                        Derek?

                                 ADAM
                        If not more.  The thing with Derek 
                        is that he doesn’t just mimic what 
                        he hears.  The way he modifies and 
                        combines pieces - it’s genuinely 
                        creative.  And how he guards that 
                        piano!

                                 NANNY
                        Bumpy’s quite possessive, isn’t he.

                                 ADAM
                        Positively obsessed!  But that’s 
                        just his way of showing his 
                        passion.  I see that as a 
                        tremendous asset.  At least it will 
                        be, once I get him to let me in.

           Nanny process all this.  She finishes her tea.

                                 NANNY
                        Very well.  Next Saturday then?

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - DRAWING ROOM - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

           The door CREAKS open.  Nanny shows Derek into the room.  He 
           SNIFFS the air.

                                 NANNY
                        That’s right, Bumpy.  We’re in the 
                        drawing room.

           She allows him to feel his way across the room.

           At the far end stands Derek’s piano.  Moved here from the 
           library.  And waiting in silence is Adam, ready to do things 
           a little differently.

           Without a word, Adam PLAYS the five-note exercise.

           Derek SCREAMS, slips out of Nanny’s grasp and flails towards 
           the piano, BUMPING a table along the way.  He reaches the 
           instrument and tries to shove Adam out of the way.  But Adam 
           is long gone, having stood up a second earlier.

                                 ADAM
                        Good morning, Derek.
           Derek whips his head in Adam’s direction and simultaneously 
           imitates the five-finger exercise.

           Adam glances at Nanny, who nods and leaves.

           Adam sits down next to Derek, who pushes him right off the 
           bench again.

           Adam closes the piano cover, preventing Derek from playing.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        We can wait as long as you’d like.

           Derek SCREAMS and BANGS the piano cover, fighting to free the 
           keyboard.  Adam holds it down firmly and remains silent, 
           patiently waiting out Derek.

           Derek pokes at his eyes out of frustration, then settles 
           down.  Rewarding the calm behavior, Adam slowly lifts up the 
           cover and plays the five-finger exercise.  

           Derek SLAMS the piano cover right onto Adam’s hand!

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Nanny hands Adam an ICE PACK for his hurting hand.

                                 NANNY
                        He’s a rather determined one, isn’t 
                        he.  

                                 ADAM
                        Not as determined as I.

           Derek eats biscuits at a small table nearby.

           CREAK.  He hears Nanny open the fridge and POUR a glass of 
           milk.  Derek sits up straight and waits patiently.  Nanny 
           sets down the milk and CLINKS the glass.  Derek reaches 
           directly for it and drinks.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        He seems to have no problem 
                        following your rules.

                                 NANNY
                        He knows better.  I’ve lived 
                        through two world wars and raised 
                        three generations of Parker-Bowles 
                        children.  I am not easily beaten.

                                 ADAM
                        They’re lucky to have you.
                                 NANNY
                        Helping to raise Derek brought me 
                        out of retirement.  It’s my duty.

                                 ADAM
                        Did you ever fancy children of your 
                        own?

                                 NANNY
                        These are my children.  Some are 
                        just a bit more stubborn than 
                        others.  Isn’t that right, Bumpy.

           Derek rocks back and forth, in his own world.

                                 ADAM
                        I wonder if he isn’t ready for a 
                        change of scenery.

                                 NANNY
                        How so?

                                 ADAM
                        You’ve created a terrific structure 
                        for Derek - here.  But what happens 
                        when he’s sent out into the world?

                                 NANNY
                        We’re quite some time away from 
                        that.  He isn’t ready.

                                 ADAM
                        The education authority may have a 
                        different opinion.  Is there any 
                        news on his school?

                                 NANNY
                        Mr. and Mrs. Paravicini are still 
                        exploring their options.

                                 ADAM
                        I’d be happy to speak to them about 
                        Linden Lodge.  

                                 NANNY
                        And I’d be happy to pass along your 
                        thoughts, Adam.

           Adam pauses.  Choosing his words carefully.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s a perfect place for a child 
                        like Derek.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Highly structured, yet filled with 
                        ample opportunities for growth.

                                 NANNY
                        I am sure it is lovely.  But Bumpy 
                        simply isn’t ready yet.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

           Nanny brings in Derek and leaves.

           The moment Nanny is gone, Derek hears a MINOR SCALE.  As his 
           little legs scramble in the direction of the piano, Adam 
           jumps up and quickly gets out of the way, determined to win 
           this battle once and for all.

           Derek feels for Adam, doesn’t find him, then imitates the 
           scale.  He listens carefully, ready to swat Adam away.  But 
           Adam isn’t anywhere near...

           Adam plays a MAJOR SCALE - on a PORTABLE ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD 
           positioned on the opposite side of the room. 

           Derek leaps up, then sits down again, unsure if he should 
           abandon his piano or not.

           Adam plays the scale again.  Derek SHRIEKS and hurries in the 
           direction of the sound.  As he feels his way across the room, 
           Adam heads the other way.  Derek reaches the electronic 
           keyboard.  Adam reaches the piano.

           Derek plays the major scale on the keyboard.  Adam plays a 
           MINOR ARPEGGIO on the piano.  Derek SHRIEKS LOUDER, his 
           frustration building.  He scurries back to the piano.  Adam 
           calmly steps back to the keyboard.

           Derek plops onto the piano bench, panting heavily. 

                                 ADAM
                        We can do this for our entire hour 
                        if you’d like. 

           He plays the minor arpeggio on the keyboard.  A defeated 
           Derek stays at the piano and repeats him.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        That’s more like it.

           Adam plays a MAJOR ARPEGGIO on the keyboard.  Derek imitates 
           on the piano.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Now we’re getting somewhere.
           Adam lifts the keyboard stand and brings it closer to the 
           piano.  He plays a HARMONIC SCALE.  Derek repeats.  A WHOLE 
           TONE SCALE.  Each time, Adam moves the keyboard closer.  

           Within several scales, the keyboard and piano are side by 
           side.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Can we play nicely, Derek?

                                 DEREK
                        Nicely, Derek...

           Adam sits on the piano bench next to Derek, who tenses up for 
           a moment, then relaxes.  Allowing Adam to stay.

           Adam plays a MAJOR CHORD, fully expecting to get shoved.  But 
           Derek leaves him alone and repeats the chord.  Finally, the 
           student is accepting the idea of having a teacher. 

           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - WEEKS LATER - DAY

           Nanny walks Adam outside to his rusty car, which really has 
           no right to still be drivable.

           Summer is fast approaching - colorful flowers bloom around 
           the estate.  The surrounding grounds flourish with the fresh 
           green of growing grass.

                                 NANNY
                        Have yourself a wonderful summer, 
                        Adam.  We very much look forward to 
                        continuing Derek’s studies after 
                        the holiday.

                                 ADAM
                        Nanny, has any decision been made 
                        about Derek’s schooling?

                                 NANNY
                        I...  Don’t believe so.

                                 ADAM
                        Are Mr. and Mrs. Paravicini in?

                                 NANNY
                        Unfortunately, they are not...

           She sees Adam eyeing the parked Mercedes and Jaguar.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...available at the moment.
                                 ADAM
                        I can wait.

                                 NANNY
                        It might be some time.

                                 ADAM
                        My day is clear.

           He plops down on a bench by the front door.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - FOYER - DAY

           Adam now waits patiently on a small stool inside.

           The door to the sitting room CREAKS open.  Nanny waves Adam 
           in.

                                 NANNY
                            (not pleased about this)
                        Do come in.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Adam enters quietly, sheepish in front of Nic and Mary Ann.

                                 NIC
                        Please, Adam.  Have a seat.

           Adam does as he is told.  Nanny remains by the door, 
           listening in.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Adam, we very much appreciate all 
                        the time you’ve put in with Derek.

                                 ADAM
                        The pleasure has truly been mine, 
                        Mrs. Paravicini.  

                                 MARY ANN
                        Please, call me Mary Ann.

                                 ADAM
                        Very good.  I assume Nanny has 
                        filled you in on our discussions?

                                 NIC
                        Why yes.  It seems that Derek’s 
                        playing is progressing rather 
                        finely, is it not?
                                 ADAM
                        Indeed.  But I was referring to his 
                        future education...

                                 MARY ANN
                        Oh?

           Adam glances at Nanny, who avoids his gaze.  Adam chooses his 
           words carefully.

                                 ADAM
                        This home has been an invaluable 
                        starting point for Derek.  But he’s 
                        old enough for school now.  He’s 
                        ready to be challenged by teachers 
                        that can meet all his special 
                        needs.

                                 NIC
                        You mean his blindness...

                                 ADAM
                        Of course.  Along with his other 
                        disabilities, which I believe are 
                        actually responsible for his 
                        remarkable memory, as well as his 
                        complete obsession with music.

           Nic and Mary Ann exchange a confused look.

                                 NIC
                        I’m sorry...  Other disabilities?

                                 ADAM
                        Well, yes.  Derek’s cognition is 
                        very much behind that of other 
                        blind students his age.  There’s a 
                        diagnosis that’s being used more 
                        commonly these days - autism.

           Nic and Mary Ann are rendered speechless.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Surely someone has mentioned this 
                        before?  His premature birth...  
                        The lagging brain development...

           Nic and Mary Ann just shake their heads.  They truly had no 
           idea.  Mary Ann reaches for Nic’s hand.  Nic rises and paces, 
           unable to hide his frustration.

                                 NIC
                        Well this certainly explains the 
                        damn rejections.
                                 MARY ANN
                        Nic...

                                 ADAM
                        Pardon?  Rejections?

                                 NIC
                        All of the schools.  Every last one 
                        of them.  Except yours - we haven’t 
                        heard from them yet.

                                 ADAM
                        But letters should’ve gone out 
                        weeks ago...

                                 NIC
                        Then perhaps they aren’t as keen on 
                        Derek as you are.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Adam paces in front of Headmistress Brumm and other TEACHERS, 
           in the midst of an intense staff meeting.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        We understand your frustration, 
                        Adam.  But we simply weren’t 
                        prepared to make a decision given 
                        the contradictory information.

                                 ADAM
                        What information?  Derek has a 
                        musical gift.  More than I’ve seen 
                        in anyone, disabled or not.  He 
                        deserves this opportunity.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Yes, but the report from the 
                        education authority is rather...  
                        Alarming.  It suggests a very 
                        different child from the one you’ve 
                        described to us.

                                 ADAM
                        They just don’t know how to handle 
                        him.  

           Headmistress Brumm reads from a lengthy report.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        “Derek won’t do as he’s told.  He’s 
                        disruptive.  Has a tendency to 
                        bite...”
                                 ADAM
                        When he’s with people he knows and 
                        has structure, he’s fine.  Surely 
                        we can provide an environment that 
                        minimizes his stress.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Undoubtedly.  But let’s remember 
                        that this is an institution for the 
                        blind.  We’re simply not equipped 
                        to handle someone with all of 
                        Derek’s disabilities.  We’ve tried 
                        before and it didn’t work out.

                                 ADAM
                        Then we need to evolve.  We’ve all 
                        read the reports.  Medical advances 
                        are helping children survive birth 
                        defects that would have been fatal 
                        just a few years ago.  

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        No one is debating the value of 
                        modern medicine, Adam.  We are all 
                        thankful that these children have 
                        been given a chance at life.

                                 ADAM
                        So what happens when they all come 
                        knocking on our door?  We ought to 
                        be able to help them.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        In good time, perhaps.

                                 ADAM
                        If not now, when?  Our future rests 
                        with children with complex needs 
                        like Derek.  This is an opportunity 
                        for Linden Lodge to lead the way.

           Several teachers nod their heads in agreement.  Headmistress 
           Brumm glances back at the report.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        There’s still the issue of his 
                        learning difficulties.  I 
                        understand you would take charge of 
                        his musical studies, Adam.  But 
                        what about everything else?

           The room is silent as Adam considers this.
           All heads turn as a tiny, seasoned Linden Lodge teacher 
           stands.  This is the Head of the Junior Department, MAUREEN 
           LINGARD.

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        I could take him in my class for a 
                        term and see how he does.  And then 
                        we could go from there.

           Everyone turns to Headmistress Brumm, awaiting the verdict.  
           She weighs the gravity of this massive choice.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:

           The steady HUM of a car motor.

           Tires SPINNING smoothly over pavement, then BUMP BUMP BUMP - 
           RUMBLING over cobblestones.

           The MUFFLED YELLS of playing children, audible through glass.

           The SQUEAL of a car braking to a stop.

           A car door CLICKS open.

                                 NANNY (O.S.)
                        Up we go, Bumpy.

           The sound of a seat belt UNFASTENING, then shoes standing up 
           on PAVEMENT.

           Then there’s the chaos of approaching FOOTSTEPS and VOICES.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Well good morning, Derek. 

                                 DEREK (O.S.)
                        Good morning, Adam.

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE - DAY

           Gripping Nanny’s hand, Derek steps away from his father’s 
           Mercedes (which has a DRIVER).  With a crisp haircut and a 
           tie visible beneath a V-neck navy jumper, Derek looks fresh.

           Adam and a small welcome party of TEACHERS, including Miss 
           Lingard, greet their newest student.
                                 TEACHERS
                        Hello, Derek...  Welcome to Linden 
                        Lodge...  We’re so happy to have 
                        you here...

           As each person greets Derek, he listens intently to their 
           voices and shakes their hands, making sure to SNIFF them too.

           Derek rocks back and forth with so much nervous excitement 
           that Nanny can barely hold him.

           Nanny studies the school, her eyes clouded with doubt.  She 
           shifts her gaze to Derek - a child that hasn’t been out of 
           her charge once since he first arrived at North Lodge Farm.

           Nanny shoves a paper bag in Adam’s hand.

                                 NANNY
                        He takes his lunch at noon.  Crisps 
                        and a crustless Marmite sandwich, 
                        just as he likes it. 

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, Nanny.

                                 NANNY
                        He needs his nap immediately after 
                        he eats.  You know how he gets 
                        without his nap.

                                 ADAM
                        Absolutely, Nanny.

                                 NANNY
                        And I’ll be back precisely at 4 to 
                        pick him up.  You haven’t forgotten 
                        our arrangement, have you?

                                 ADAM
                        Of course not.

           Nanny is having trouble releasing Derek.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s ok, Nanny.  He’s in good hands 
                        here.

           Nanny pauses, then finally lets go.  Without another word, 
           she quietly climbs back into the Mercedes and shuts the door.  
           The car drives off.
           INT. LINDEN LODGE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Derek holds the shoulder of ANDREW, a blind student who 
           follows a guiding handrail, leading them through the school.

           They pass a calendar that shows the date in print and in 
           BRAILLE: SEPTEMBER 1986

                                 ANDREW
                        I bet you’ll enjoy Braille class 
                        very much, Derek.

           Derek remains silent, unused to social interactions with 
           strangers.  He pokes at his eyes, uncomfortable.

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        I’ve learned 5 new signs just this 
                        week!

           Derek’s head swivels back and forth, taking in all the 
           strange new sounds of the school.

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        And is it true that you play the 
                        piano?  I wish I could play too.

           Adam and Miss Lingard follow a safe distance away, discreetly 
           listening to this one-sided conversation.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           Adam brings Derek into the music room.  Derek SNIFFS the air, 
           recognizing the scent.

                                 ADAM
                        Remember this place, Derek?  It’s 
                        where we first met.

           As Adam leads Derek to the piano, the little boy feels his 
           way around the room, touching things with nervous energy.  
           The walls.  THUMP THUMP - drums...  CRASH!  Cymbals...

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Up you go, Derek.

           Derek raises his arms instinctively, familiar with the drill.  
           Adam lifts him onto the bench and sits down beside him.

           Derek seems a little tense, but relaxes as he feels out the 
           piano.  He jumps into a SCALES routine.
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Very good, Derek.  But today, I’d 
                        like to try something different.

           Adam gently takes Derek’s hands.  Derek jerks his hands back.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Derek, how about we work on your 
                        technique?

                                 DEREK
                        Technique?

           Adam takes Derek’s hands again.  Derek swats him away.

                                 ADAM
                        I’d like you to learn some more 
                        challenging pieces, Derek.  But 
                        first, we’ll need to get your 
                        fingers sorted out.

           As Adam reaches for Derek’s hands once again, Derek SCREAMS 
           and sticks his fingers in his own eyes.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Ok, ok, let’s go back to the 
                        scales.

           Adam tries playing a simple SCALE but Derek just BANGS on the 
           piano and jumps off the bench, ending the lesson.

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE - AFTERNOON

           As the Mercedes pulls up, Adam waits on the curb, a firm grip 
           on an anxiously wriggling Derek.

           Nanny jumps out of the car and immediately smothers Derek.

                                 NANNY
                        My little Bumpy...
                            (to Adam)
                        How was he today?

                                 ADAM
                        Still settling in.

                                 NANNY
                        Perhaps it was too soon.

                                 ADAM
                        Nothing wrong with challenging the 
                        boy, Nanny.  Just like one would 
                        any child.  See you in the morning.
           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MISS LINGARD’S CLASS - DAYS LATER

           A disheveled-looking Adam leads a fidgety Derek into Miss 
           Lingard’s classroom, an orderly environment where other BLIND 
           STUDENTS take their places at group desks.  Given his autism, 
           Derek is by far the most disabled amongst his blind peers.

           Adam hands Derek off to Miss Lingard.

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        Another rough one?

                                 ADAM
                        You should see the piano.

           Miss Lingard walks Derek to a group desk he shares with 
           Andrew and Kelly (the blind piano girl whose lesson Derek 
           once interrupted).  

                                 ANDREW/KELLY
                        Hello Derek.

           Derek retreats, fidgeting with his hands.

                                 ADAM
                        I just can’t seem to get him to 
                        listen.  

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        Be patient.  Routine is everything 
                        with these children - he’ll adjust 
                        soon enough.

                                 ADAM
                        Half the time, I wonder if he even 
                        understands what I’m saying.

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        Sometimes the trick isn’t to get 
                        them to speak your language.  It’s 
                        to speak theirs.

           Adam considers this.

           As Nanny opens the Mercedes, Derek stumbles to her from a 
           frazzled Adam.

                                 NANNY
                        You know Adam, if you require my 
                        help, you just need to ask.
                                 ADAM
                        I’ll be sure to let you know if 
                        that’s ever the case, Nanny.

           As Nanny helps Derek into the Mercedes, she HUMS Molly 
           Malone.  Derek listens to the gentle melody, gradually 
           settling down.

           Adam carefully watches their interaction, his mind racing.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           As Adam enters with Derek, he closes the window shutters, 
           MUFFLING outside noises.

           He PLOPS Derek onto the bench.

           Adam studies his pupil for a moment.  A bold idea spinning in 
           his head.  Will it work?  He decides to find out.

           Adam plays a quick one-handed SCALE.  Derek imitates.

           Adam plays a quick one-handed ARPEGGIO.  Derek imitates.

           No words are exchanged.  Only music.

           Adam plays a complex two-handed CHROMATIC SCALE that requires 
           extremely precise finger placement and accuracy.

           Derek struggles to imitate, his karate chops and awkward hand 
           movements too cumbersome to smoothly play the scale.

           Adam plays the complex scale again.  Derek fails a second 
           time.  Frustrated, he BANGS the piano and pokes at his eyes.  
           Adam doesn’t react, waiting for Derek to calm down.

           After several seconds of quiet, Adam plays the complex scale 
           once again.  But this time, extremely slowly, his fingers 
           crawling past Derek.  His knuckles and joints purposely 
           exaggerated in their piston-like movement.

           Derek tries to butt in but Adam’s hands keep playing.  
           Continuing the scale past the child.  

           Derek feels Adam’s hands.  Touching his fingers.  Processing 
           their mechanical movement.

           Adam plays the last note.  Then stops.

           Derek attempts the scale using only his fingers.  His hand 
           movements jerky but attempting the new technique.  He gets it 
           50% right.
           Adam gently takes Derek’s fingers and demonstrates the 
           correct movement.  At first, Derek tenses up, unused to being 
           handled this way.  But then he slowly relaxes, allowing Adam 
           to sculpt his fingers.

           Adam plays the scale again.  This time, Derek immediately 
           puts his hands on top of Adam’s, following the movement.  His 
           mind rewiring the way he plays.

           The moment Adam finishes, Derek puts his fingers down and 
           plays a slow but technically accurate rendition of the scale, 
           using only his fingers.

           Adam smiles.  The WORDLESS LESSON a tremendous success.

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE - AFTERNOON

           Nanny looks out from the stopping Mercedes.  Adam is all 
           smiles.  Derek holds his hand patiently.

           Nanny opens the door.  Derek waits.  Adam calmly walks the 
           boy to Nanny, then hands her a HAND-WRITTEN LIST.

                                 NANNY
                        What’s this?

                                 ADAM
                        Derek’s new prescription.

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Rows upon rows of colorful records, the air thick with dust 
           and the nostalgic smell of vinyl.

           Nanny wanders different aisles, lost in a sea of recordings.

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        Anything I can help locate, madam?

                                 NANNY
                        The classical section would be a 
                        splendid start, thank you.

           She shows him the list of SPECIFIC RECORDINGS from Adam.

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        Quite the comprehensive list...  Is 
                        this for you?

                                 NANNY
                        No.  A student.  
                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        Ah, very good.  Must be the first 
                        year of conservatory. 

                                 NANNY
                        Oh no, dear.  He’s only six and a 
                        half.

           The Clerk’s eyes WIDEN with surprise.

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        I...  See.  

           He leads her away from the dusty records to a far more 
           expansive section filled with CASSETTES.  

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK (CONT’D)
                        I believe we have most of these 
                        recordings on cassette.

                                 NANNY
                        Oh no, cassettes won’t do.  Not one 
                        bit.

           Examining the list once again, the Clerk shakes his head.

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        I’m afraid our record selection may 
                        be too limited.

           Off Nanny’s horrified expression...

           INT. LONDON FLAT - EVENING

           Nanny’s flat overlooks the River Thames.  It’s comfortable 
           and quaint, without a dust spec in sight.  Every shelf is 
           packed with religious items, from icons to crosses to the 
           Virgin Mary herself.

           Nanny anxiously looks on as Adam unpacks and plugs in a shiny 
           silver CASSETTE BOOMBOX.

                                 ADAM
                        That should do it.  Nanny, care to 
                        do the honors?

           He offers Nanny the inaugural cassette tape. 

                                 NANNY
                        Heaven forbid.

           She stares at the damn cassette like it’s the devil’s work.
           Derek listens carefully as:

           Adam PUSHES EJECT, opening the cassette holder.  CLICK - in 
           goes the tape.  He PRESSES PLAY...

           The boombox crackles to life, a gentle piano duet flowing out 
           of the speakers and filling the room.

           Derek is all smiles as he listens to William Walton’s Duets 
           for Children, a collection of charming movements written for 
           2 pianos.  The first movement is appropriately titled “The 
           Music Lesson.”  

           A simple up and down scale of the first pianist is joined by 
           a graceful melody played by a second pianist...

           OVER THE SAME MUSIC:

           SERIES OF SHOTS - DEREK’S TECHNIQUE EVOLVING:

           MUSIC ROOM

           Derek’s little hands ride Adam’s, which play the up and down 
           scale of Walton’s duet.  Their hands fly together over the 
           glistening keys of the piano.

           NANNY’S FLAT

           Derek DRAGS a chair next to the boombox and listens intently 
           to the same Walton recording.

           MUSIC ROOM

           Derek plays the up and down scale with his customary karate 
           chops and elbows.  

           Adam gently lifts Derek’s hands, places them on his, and 
           plays with the correct technique - only using his fingers.

           Adam then takes Derek’s hands and puppeteers his fingers, 
           acting out the correct motion.

           Derek tries again, using only his fingers this time.  As 
           Derek’s hand successfully plays the up and down scale, Adam, 
           who sits to his right, joins in with the other part, the main 
           melody.

           THE FLAT

           Derek rests his head on the boombox, listening to the music 
           and feeling the vibrations.

           THE SOUND OF A CASSETTE REWINDING...
           MUSIC ROOM

           Derek now feels Adam’s hands playing the main melody.

           As we focus on Adam’s hands, gracefully dancing over the 
           keyboard...

           We’re now looking at Derek’s hands.  Playing the main melody, 
           with only his fingers.  Adam now sits to his left and plays 
           the supporting part’s up and down scale.

           They finish the short little gem of a piece.

           CLICK - A CASSETTE EJECTS...

           THE FLAT

           CLUNK: Adam looks on as Nanny awkwardly tries to load another 
           cassette into the boombox.  Adam nods his head, supportive.

           EJECT.  CLICK.  PLAY.

           Another Walton duet plays.  This one’s called The Silent Lake 
           and has a more melancholy tune.  Unlike the previous duet, 
           which had individual notes playable by single fingers, this 
           one is filled with chords that require multiple fingers...

           MUSIC ROOM

           Adam’s hand stretches out over the keys, playing a chord with 
           several fingers simultaneously, continuing The Silent Lake.

           Derek feels Adam’s hand.  Trying to comprehend how one hand 
           can play multiple notes at the same time.  When it’s Derek’s 
           turn to imitate, he plays the chords with two hands, unable 
           to correctly replicate the technique.

           Adam lifts Derek’s hands and gets him to feel the correct 
           technique again.  He then adjusts Derek’s fingers, 
           illustrating the motion. 

           Gradually, Derek’s fingers spread out, fanning out like a 
           flower, his hands able to cover more keys now.  He takes over 
           the piece, able to play chords with individual hands.

           MORE RECORDINGS.  EJECT - CLICK - PLAY - REWIND.  And repeat. 

           Nanny loads more and more cassettes into the boombox, growing 
           more comfortable with the technology.  Faster and faster, 
           accelerating to the tempo of one more Walton duet: Pony Trap.

           MUSIC ROOM
           As Adam plays the quick tune of Pony Trap, Derek’s hands try 
           imitating an octave higher, struggling to keep up with the 
           speed of the piece.

           Adam slows down the tempo a hair.  Derek can keep up this 
           time, his technique more precise.

           Establishing a starting point, Adam increases the tempo bit 
           by bit.  Derek concentrates and stays fully in sync, his new 
           technique allowing him to keep up.

           Adam’s hands.  Derek’s hands.  A blur of rapid finger 
           movements, moving like efficient clockwork.  Derek’s hands 
           starting to move increasingly like Adam’s, his technique 
           evolving into a perfect imitation.

           And with one final chord, the piece is done.

           INT. NANNY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           The cassette ENDS.

           Adam turns off the boombox.

                                 ADAM
                        Well I suppose that does it.

                                 NANNY
                        So it does.

                                 ADAM
                        Have yourselves a lovely summer.

                                 NANNY
                        Thank you.  And to you as well.  
                        What do you say, Bumpy?

                                 DEREK
                        To you as well, Adam.

           Adam nods kindly and turns to the door.

                                 NANNY
                        Oh Adam...

           She hands him an ORNATE ENVELOPE.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Mary Ann would very much like for 
                        you to join us.

           Adam opens the invitation...
           EXT. NORTH LODGE FARM - JULY - DAY

           WHACK!  A beach ball rolls across a lush green backyard.

           Libbet and Charles WHACK the beach ball across the thick 
           lawn, playing with Derek, who wears a BIRTHDAY CROWN.  He 
           listens carefully for the WHACKS of the ball, surprisingly 
           good at anticipating when to grab it.

           The sweltering summer sun glistens over a throng of GUESTS: 
           family and friends gathered to celebrate Derek’s 8th 
           birthday.

           Adam hides under a sunshade, enjoying a PEACH COCKTAIL.  He 
           notices Mary Ann and Nic on opposite ends of the party, apart 
           from each other, talking to different people.

           Mary Ann spots Adam and greets him warmly.

                                 MARY ANN
                        So glad you could join us, Adam. 
                        How ever have you managed to elude 
                        Nanny?

                                 ADAM
                        Just give her a bit more time.  No 
                        one is safe.

           Nanny grabs different guests, forcing them to participate in 
           the beach ball game, now with Derek in the middle. 

                                 MARY ANN
                        So how did our little Derek do this 
                        year?

                                 ADAM
                        His technique has come a very long 
                        way.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Wonderful.  I can’t thank you 
                        enough.

                                 ADAM
                        The pleasure is mine.  The boy has 
                        quite a gift.  In fact, I believe 
                        the next step is for him to 
                        perform.

                                 MARY ANN
                        You think he’s ready?
                                 ADAM
                        No one is ever truly ready for a 
                        first performance.  Typically, the 
                        way to find out is simply to try.  
                        But you’re right to ask - Derek 
                        likely isn’t ready yet.  He needs 
                        to grow a bit more socially.

                                 MARY ANN
                        How so?

                                 ADAM
                        It’s one thing to play in front of 
                        familiar people in a familiar 
                        setting.  A recital is an entirely 
                        different matter.

                                 MARY ANN
                        I see.  Then what would you 
                        suggest?

                                 ADAM
                        Spending more time around people he 
                        doesn’t know.  Strangers, his 
                        peers...  And not just in the 
                        classroom.

                                 NANNY (O.S.)
                        Don’t think you two are getting off 
                        that easy!

           All 5 feet of Nanny rushes in and pulls Adam and Mary Ann 
           into the midst of the beach ball game.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Adam here was just saying...

                                 ADAM
                        No no, it’s quite alright.  We can 
                        discuss another time.

                                 NANNY
                        Please, Adam.  Go ahead.

           WHACK.  She passes him the beach ball.  Adam is not getting 
           out of this one.  Adam TAPS it away.

                                 ADAM
                        Well...  I believe Derek could use 
                        some help with his social 
                        development.

                                 NANNY
                        Oh?
                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  So perhaps he ought to board 
                        at Linden Lodge.  Full time.

           WHACK.  He gets smacked by the ball - hard.  Thanks Nanny.

                                 MARY ANN
                        What do you think, Nanny?

                                 NANNY
                        It’s an interesting thought.  But 
                        I’m not sure Bumpy is ready...

           Adam BATS away the ball, a bit aggressively.

                                 ADAM
                        We all know that Derek requires 
                        special handling.  However, he’s 
                        grown immensely with every 
                        challenge we’ve thrown his way.  I 
                        genuinely believe he could handle 
                        the change.

                                 MARY ANN
                        That’s very kind.  Perhaps in due 
                        time.

           WHACK!  Adam reaches for the incoming ball but Nanny beats 
           him to it and SMACKS it away, cutting him out of the game.

           Alice and Ester bring out a massive BIRTHDAY CAKE WITH 8 
           CANDLES and set it on a table near Derek’s electric organ, 
           which has been moved outside for the grand finale. 

           Nanny walks Derek to the cake.  He rocks back and forth, 
           excited.  

                                 NANNY
                        Derek, can you thank everyone for 
                        attending your party?

                                 DEREK
                        Thank you everyone for attending 
                        your party!

           The Guests sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  Derek happily plays along on 
           the organ, repeating the song over and over again, even 
           improvising several verses in his own jazzy style.

           Mary Ann and Nanny watch Derek play for everyone.  He feeds 
           off the applause, relishing this performance.

                                 NANNY
                        He’s quite the performer, isn’t he.  
                                 MARY ANN
                        Why yes.  He certainly is.  Perhaps 
                        he could handle a recital.

                                 NANNY
                        What a wonderful idea, Mary Ann.

                                 ADAM
                        Everything here is known to Derek.  
                        What happens with an audience of 
                        unknown people?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Isn’t the way to find out simply to 
                        try?

           Adam has no argument against his own words.  All he can do is 
           watch Derek play Happy Birthday over and over again, unable 
           to stop...

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           An intimate RECITAL for faculty and students:

           Children and their teachers sit on the floor before a raised 
           stage, hidden behind a musty green velour curtain that has 
           seen better days.  

           Mary Ann and Nanny stand off to the side, the special guests 
           of the occasion.  Miss Lingard offers them two CREAKY, 
           foldable chairs.  They graciously sit and glance at each 
           other with anxious excitement.

           INT. BACK STAGE - DAY

           A LONE WORN UPRIGHT PIANO waits patiently behind the old 
           curtain.

           Derek and Adam huddle together in the tiny, cramped wing.

           Derek, dressed in a crisp new jacket, moves his head back and 
           forth, excited by the HUSHED VOICES emanating from beyond the 
           curtain.

           Wearing an old, tired suit, Adam gently taps Derek on the 
           shoulder.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  Ready?

                                 DEREK
                        Ready, Adam.
           Adam operates the rope controls and RAISES THE CURTAIN.

           Derek is taken aback by the initial APPLAUSE, unsure why that 
           is happening before his performance.

           Adam takes him by the hand and leads him onto:

           THE STAGE

           Derek shakes with anticipation, feeding off the applause and 
           the audience’s energy.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok Derek - let’s bow like we 
                        practiced.

           Derek bows lower and lower and holds the position.  And holds 
           it some more.  After a moment, Adam gently raises him back 
           up.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Time to play now.

           The applause dies down.  In the audience, Nanny crosses 
           herself.

           Adam steps to the piano bench but before he can sit down...

           Derek starts playing! 

           Adam quickly sits, getting out of Derek’s way as the boy 
           explodes into a rapid fire exchange of notes between the left 
           and right hands.  He’s performing Ragtime Parade by Erik 
           Satie, a fun, playful piece that hints at the more 
           contemporary styles Derek will explore in years to come.

           The music shoots out of the small tired piano, rocketing over 
           the enraptured audience.  The blind students sway to the 
           mesmerizing sounds flooding their ears.

           Mary Ann and Nanny listen with joy, proud of their little 
           Derek.

           Derek is all smiles, flying through the piece, more energized 
           than he’s ever been before.  His fingers dance over the 
           keyboard, his improved technique effortlessly allowing the 
           energetic melody to flow into the air.

           Adam even leans back and relaxes, letting his brilliant 
           student work his magic.

           Derek nears the ending, his hands a blur of activity over 
           black and white keys.  He reaches the last few chords...
           Mary Ann and Nanny raise their hands, ready to applaud...

           But Derek keeps going!  Unable to stop, he repeats the piece 
           once again, even adding a few improvisational flourishes of 
           his own.

           Adam quickly sits up, anxious and unsure how to control the 
           situation.

           Derek jumps back towards the end, close to finishing for a 
           second time...

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                            (whispering)
                        Let’s finish up now, hmmm?

           Several ending chords...  And then another spontaneous 
           repeat!

           Mary Ann and Nanny exchange an anxious look.

           Adam inches closer to Derek, making sure he can hear...

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                            (whispering)
                        Derek, you need to end it!

           But Derek is completely absorbed in the music.  Obsessively 
           focused on the sounds flowing out of the wooden box.  He 
           hears nothing else.

           Panicking about what to do, Adam presses the soft pedal, 
           DAMPENING the sound of the piano.  But Derek just HITS the 
           keys harder, unwilling to stop!

           Adam glances nervously at the audience, unsure what to do.  
           He studies Derek’s hands.  And an idea sparks...

           Adam reaches to the lower register of the keyboard.  He 
           listens to Derek carefully, watching his hands like a hawk, 
           and at the perfect moment...

           Adam JOINS IN THE PIECE - playing a supporting bass line.

           Derek jerks his head Adam’s direction but doesn’t seem to 
           mind the duet.  He flies towards the end once again...

           But this time, Adam forces the chord progression with his 
           bass line.  Purposely playing notes that Derek will have to 
           follow.  Derek senses the challenge and only plays faster.

           Adam is a pro and keeps up, but not without droplets of sweat 
           appearing on his brow.
           Adam reaches the last chord, playing it several times, 
           forcing Derek to do the same.  Finally, the little boy has no 
           choice but to play along, the bass line and melody merging 
           into one.

           And with one FINAL CHORD, Adam lifts his hands!  Derek plays 
           the chord one more time for effect, then lifts his hands!

           The audience of students and faculty bursts into APPLAUSE!  
           Derek nearly falls off his chair, then joins in the APPLAUSE, 
           unable to restrain himself!

           Mary Ann and Nanny EXHALE in relief, applauding wildly.

           Adam gently pushes Derek into a bow, then leads the boy off 
           the stage.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Outstanding, Derek.

                                 DEREK
                        Outstanding, Adam.

           BACKSTAGE: Adam hands Derek off to Miss Lingard, who waits in 
           the wings with Kelly.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  Miss Lingard will show 
                        you to your seat.

           Adam walks Kelly out onto the stage.

           Derek tenses up at the sound of the APPLAUSE...

           ON STAGE

           Adam and Kelly sit down on the piano bench.  Kelly gently 
           feels the keyboard, orienting her hand position.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, Kelly.  Whenever you are 
                        ready.

           Kelly takes a small, cute breath.  Then softly launches into 
           the adorable Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy from the 
           Nutcracker ballet.

           Miss Lingard tries to escort Derek into the audience but he 
           stops as he hears someone else playing the piano.  His piano.  
           He pokes at his eyes...

           Kelly’s fingers slowly crawl over the fingerboard, 
           tentatively playing for the first time in front of an 
           audience.
           The playing is pleasant and quaint and all but it’s nowhere 
           near the brilliance of Derek.

           SCRAMBLING FOOTSTEPS...

           Just like several years earlier, Adam and Kelly are pushed 
           off the bench by a charging Derek!

           GASPS from the audience - both from the seeing faculty and 
           the blind students that hear everything!  And no one is more 
           horrified than Mary Ann and Nanny, who can barely watch.

           Derek takes over the piano and improvises an insane version 
           of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.  The cute melody replaced 
           by virtuosic passages on steroids.  Derek is completely 
           schooling Kelly.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        This simply will not do, young man!

           He tries to lift Derek off the piano but Derek fights back, 
           pushing the piano so hard that the BRAKE on the wheel CRACKS! 

           Suddenly, the piano starts rolling down the stage!  Derek 
           hops off the bench and keeps playing, following the piano!

           Adam has no idea what to do - he hurries after the boy, then 
           waves to Miss Lingard, who waits in the wings, paralyzed with 
           confusion.  Adam gestures to lower the curtain!

           Miss Lingard frantically works the controls, unsure how the 
           hell to do it.  She hastily pulls different levers...  

           The curtain FALLS and hits the stage, finally hiding the 
           chaos from the audience!

           But Derek’s PLAYING continues to waft through the old dusty 
           velvet.  In the audience, Mary Ann and Nanny look completely 
           mortified.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - DORMITORY - DAY

           CLUNK.  A CARE ATTENDANT drops several suitcases in Derek’s 
           new room.

           Nanny sighs in resignation, examining the small simple space:

           Derek’s stuffed rabbit is lovingly tucked under his textured 
           quilt in the single bed.  A small desk is a shrine to the 
           precious boombox, flanked by neatly organized stacks of 
           Derek’s favorite cassette recordings.
           Derek clutches Adam’s hand, anxiously listening to all the 
           strange new sounds.

                                 ADAM
                        He’ll be well taken care of, Nanny.  
                        The staff are here around the 
                        clock, available for all of Derek’s 
                        needs.   

           Nanny doesn’t look too sure.  Staying silent for the first 
           time in her life.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        This is so important - for Derek 
                        and other children like him.  The 
                        school is taking on far more 
                        students with special needs.  
                        Giving them a real chance.

           Nanny glances in the HALLWAY.  She sees the STAFF walking 
           different STUDENTS to their rooms - not just BLIND KIDS but 
           more handicapped ones too, including a GIRL IN A WHEELCHAIR.  
           Linden Lodge is evolving into a more special needs school.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Of course, his weekends will still 
                        belong to you...

           He smiles politely, trying to make this easier for Nanny.  
           She simply pecks Derek on the cheek and quietly leaves.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - NEXT MORNING 

           Adam bursts into the room, frantically trying to balance a 
           stack of music books.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry I’m late, Derek...

           The room is vacant.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - DORMITORY - SAME

           The Care Attendant accompanies Andrew to Derek’s doorway.

                                 ANDREW
                        Let’s go, Derek!  We can walk to 
                        our classes together.

           Derek doesn’t budge from his bed, rocking back and forth.

           The Attendant puts his hand on Andrew’s shoulder, comforting.
                                 CARE ATTENDANT
                        Thank you for trying, Andrew.  Now 
                        Derek...

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           Adam waits on the piano bench, checking his watch.

           The door SLAMS open and the Care Attendant drags in a 
           kicking, SCREAMING Derek.

                                 ADAM
                        What happened?

                                 CARE ATTENDANT 
                        Readjustment...

           Derek tears away from the Attendant and scurries to Adam, 
           bumping into chairs along the way.

                                 ADAM
                        Derek, you need to be calm.  Linden 
                        Lodge is your home now.

           Derek shoves him aside and plops down on the piano bench.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Derek!

           Derek POUNDS the keyboard, creating a horrific cacophony of 
           sound.

           Adam lifts the flailing boy away from the piano, then sits 
           down and blocks Derek from touching the keys.  He’s hit with 
           a volley of violent PUNCHES and SLAPS.

           Immovable, Adam plays Chopin’s Raindrop Prelude.  Derek 
           instantly quiets down, his mood softening.  The gorgeous, 
           gentle music calming him down.

           The Attendant observes from the doorway.

           INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

           The Care Attendant relocates the boombox to Derek’s night 
           stand and connects a set of HEADPHONES.  He attempts to put 
           them on Derek, who initially freaks out, fighting against 
           this foreign object that’s touching his precious ears.  

           The Attendant CLICKS PLAY.  Hearing a recording of Chopin’s 
           Raindrop Prelude, Derek relaxes and eagerly allows the 
           Attendant to put the headphones on him.
           The boy falls asleep to the gentle music.

           INT. DORMITORY - MORNING

           Andrew feels his way down the corridor and arrives at Derek’s 
           room.

                                 ANDREW
                        Good morning, Derek...

           He waits respectfully, then turns to leave.

                                 DEREK
                        Good morning, Andrew!

           As they head to class, we see the headphones connected to the 
           boombox, the music still PLAYING.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Andrew and Derek both follow the handrail as they march to 
           class.

                                 ANDREW
                        Miss Lingard says she’s very happy 
                        to have you back this year.

                                 DEREK
                            (no idea what Andrew is 
                              talking about)
                        Yes, Andrew.

                                 ANDREW
                        And I heard that we’re having fish 
                        and chips for lunch today!

                                 DEREK
                        Yes, Andrew.

                                 ANDREW
                        I love fish and chips.  Did you 
                        know that in America, chips are 
                        called fries?  And crisps are 
                        called chips?  Or is it the other 
                        way around...

                                 DEREK
                        Yes, Andrew.

           VAL THE SCHOOL SECRETARY hurries past them into...
           INT. LINDEN LODGE - OFFICE - DAY

           Adam is in the middle of transcribing a song sheet into 
           Braille...

                                 VAL THE SCHOOL SECRETARY
                        Mister Ockelford, someone from the 
                        Local Authority here for you?

                                 ADAM
                        Come again?

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE - DAY

           A confused Adam circles a banged up LORRY that’s far too big 
           to be in the school’s parking lot.  

           The passenger hops out and greets Adam.  He’s a loud-mouthed 
           LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL who is about as jovial as Santa 
           Claus.

                                 LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL
                        Very good very good!  Where would 
                        you like them?

                                 ADAM
                        Where would I like what...

                                 LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL
                        Your students love music, don’t 
                        they?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, many do, but...  Do we know 
                        each other?

                                 LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL
                        How fortunate that my meeting with 
                        the headmistress was on the day of 
                        your recital.  What an exceptional 
                        young pianist!  What’s the lad’s 
                        name again?

                                 ADAM
                        Derek...

                                 LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL
                        Of course - Derek!  Simply 
                        marvelous.  What he did to that 
                        poor piano!  So naturally, when one 
                        of our schools closed and we had 
                        our redistribution issue, I 
                        immediately thought of you...
           He gestures to the BURLY DRIVER, who hops out and ROLLS UP 
           the rear gate.  What Adam sees makes his eyes BULGE.

                                 ADAM
                        We better go around back...

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The RATTLE OF SHAKY WHEELS.  Then quiet.

           Adam peers around the corner - the coast is clear.  He darts 
           out of view...

           RATTLE RATTLE...

           Adam pushes an UPRIGHT PIANO down the hall!

           Followed by the Burly Driver pushing another piano!

           Followed by the Local Authority Official pushing a third 
           piano!

           Teachers stick their heads out of classrooms, wondering what 
           the commotion is all about.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The third piano grinds to a halt next to the other two.  Adam 
           inspects the three barely used instruments, ecstatic about 
           this unexpected donation.

                                 LOCAL AUTHORITY OFFICIAL 
                        And what about the grand?

                                 ADAM
                        The what??

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - FACULTY LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Headmistress Brumm cuts into a shepherd’s pie, enjoying her 
           lunch.

           Behind her, visible through a window, Adam quickly waves to 
           his two accomplices.  The Burly Driver and the Local 
           Authority Official push a hulking BABY GRAND PIANO on a 
           dolly, wheeling the covered monstrosity as fast as they can.

           Headmistress Brumm takes a big bite, completely oblivious.
           INT. LINDEN LODGE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           CLICK CLACK: Headmistress Brumm marches to a classroom when 
           she hears...  PAINED GROANS?  She heads off to investigate.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           The three gentlemen strain with all their might, pushing the 
           gargantuan piano up a ramp onto the open stage.

           The moment the piano is up, a red-faced Adam quickly lowers 
           the curtain.

           Hidden behind the curtain, they hear the gymnasium doors 
           FLINGING OPEN.  Then the CLICK CLACK OF HEELS.  

           Adam turns to the Burly Driver and Local Authority Official 
           and zips his lips: SILENCE.

           Seconds pass.  Then the heels CLICK AWAY.

           INT. DORMITORY - MORNING

           Derek sits at the edge of his bed fully dressed, ready for 
           the day ahead.  KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 DEREK
                        Good morning, Andrew!

                                 ADAM
                        Actually, Derek, it’s me.  Good 
                        morning.

                                 DEREK
                        Good morning, Adam!

                                 ADAM
                        I have a little surprise for you 
                        today.  Care to come with me?

           Derek eagerly takes Adam by the arm.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Adam gently places Derek’s hand against the massive body of 
           the baby grand piano.  

                                 ADAM
                        You’re allowed to play it, Derek.  
                        But only if you’re extra careful.
                                 DEREK
                        Careful...

           Adam shows Derek to the fancy plush bench.  From the moment 
           he sits down, Derek can feel that something different is 
           happening.

           Adam lifts up the cover, revealing 88 perfectly polished 
           white and black keys.  The grand piano is in immaculate 
           shape.

                                 ADAM
                        Go ahead.  Gently.

           Derek reaches forward, his hands unsure about what they’re 
           about to find.  His fingers land on the glass-like, spring-
           loaded keys.   

           He plays a simple chord.  His face enlarges with surprise, 
           the vibrations of the massive piano shaking his entire body. 

           After the initial sound washes over him, Derek explores the 
           keyboard, his little fingers moving faster and faster, 
           fascinated by the sensitivity and grandeur of his new best 
           friend.

           Adam props up the lid, revealing the spectacular golden 
           innards of the mechanical beast.  The piano’s rich sound is 
           now free to escape into the world.

           GORGEOUS NOTES reverberate throughout the dark gymnasium, 
           filling the empty space with extraordinary sound.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MISS LINGARD’S CLASS - LATER

           Adam delivers Derek to Miss Lingard’s classroom.  In addition 
           to the blind students we’ve seen here before, the class is 
           populated with several NEW STUDENTS who are more disabled 
           like Derek.

           Derek calmly takes his place at the group desk with Andrew 
           and Kelly.

                                 ANDREW/KELLY
                        Hello Derek.

                                 DEREK
                        Hello Andrew.  Hello Kelly.

           Adam smiles to himself and leaves.  And gets cornered by:

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Adam, a word please.  
                                 ADAM
                        Of course...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        When were you going to inform me 
                        about our newest additions?

                                 ADAM
                            (getting nervous)
                        Additions...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Yes, your tuneful little trio.  You 
                        know my policy about clutter.

                                 ADAM
                            (relieved)
                        Ah.  Right.  We can certainly move 
                        the three pianos into classrooms 
                        that don’t currently have one. 

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        And what about the fourth?

           Busted.

                                 ADAM
                        Right...  The fourth...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Surely you didn’t think you could 
                        hide that monstrosity forever?

                                 ADAM
                        It’s a tremendous asset to the 
                        school...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Tremendous is one way to put it.

                                 ADAM
                        How about we put it to good use and 
                        hold a more formal concert?  We 
                        could showcase a number of our 
                        talented students and...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        After the last incident?  Mind your 
                        ambition, Adam.

           She departs before Adam can squeeze in another word.
           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           INSIDE THE GRAND PIANO

           It’s a beautiful symphony of pounding hammers and ringing 
           strings as Derek practices the middle section of Chopin’s 
           Raindrop Prelude on the monumental instrument. 

           Derek is visible at the end of the long strings, shifting on 
           the bench as he navigates the keyboard.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Gently now...

           The piano simmers down as Derek checks his playing.  He flows 
           through a serene phrase, then throws in a few of his own 
           playful embellishments.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        No twiddly bits please...

           Derek plays the piece as written.

                                 ADAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And finish the phrase...

           Derek gracefully ends the melody and stops.  The mechanical 
           monster silent for a brief moment.

           Adam pats Derek on the back.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Very good.  Now Derek, what would 
                        you like to play?

                                 DEREK
                        Like to play?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  Anything you like.  You can 
                        choose.

                                 DEREK
                        Choose...

           Derek remains still, puzzled by the concept of making a 
           choice.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s ok.  How about we play the 
                        Chopin again.

           Derek instantly jumps back into the Raindrop Prelude, the 
           hammers of the grand firing to life.
           Adam steps far into the gymnasium, admiring the sight and 
           sound of the little boy playing the giant instrument.  
           Studying his student and the piano, Adam gets an idea...

           IN BLACK AND WHITE:

           Derek sits at the grand piano.  Then launches into the 
           Chopin.

           PULL BACK, revealing that we’re watching through the black 
           and white viewfinder of a RCA VHS CAMCORDER.  The red record 
           light is on, a VHS tape turning inside.

           Adam stands next to the recording camcorder, patiently 
           watching Derek play...

           Adam stuffs numerous envelopes with VHS tapes, preparing to 
           send Derek recordings to mysterious recipients...

           Headmistress Brumm finds Adam on his lunch break, a rare 
           quiet moment in his day.  He enjoys a simple ham sandwich, 
           potato crisps and tea.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Adam, what did you do?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m not sure what you mean...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        For some reason, a number of 
                        organizations have suddenly 
                        expressed interest in sponsoring a 
                        charity concert for us.

                                 ADAM
                        You don’t say...

           He tries to hide his glee.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I mean, how wonderful!  Which one 
                        did you go with?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        I didn’t say I had.
                                 ADAM
                        Right...

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        Although I’m leaning towards the 
                        Rotary Club of Tooting.  

                                 ADAM
                        They’ve always been our most 
                        generous patrons.  Did they mention 
                        anything else?

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM
                        They had the odd idea of doing the 
                        event here at Linden.  Something 
                        about utilizing our grand piano? 

           Adam shrugs innocently.  The Headmistress is onto him, her 
           hawk-like eyes piercing.

                                 HEADMISTRESS BRUMM (CONT’D)
                        And Adam...  Let’s be sure to avoid 
                        mishaps like last time, shall we?

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - EVENING

           Royal blue and gold balloons adorn the stage - the colors of 
           Rotary International.

           The gymnasium is now filled with several dozen FAMILY MEMBERS 
           and FRIENDS, as well as ROTARIANS and GUESTS, sitting in rows 
           of creaky foldable chairs.  A sizeable enough audience for a 
           modest fundraising event.

           The lights dim.  Miss Lingard takes the stage.

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
                        We have a wonderful program tonight 
                        featuring many of our talented 
                        musicians.  First up, I would like 
                        to introduce Derek Paravicini, who 
                        is performing for the public for 
                        the first time tonight.  He’s going 
                        to play the Finale from Elgar’s 
                        Enigma Variations.

           APPLAUSE

           Derek and Adam take the stage.  As Derek bows low and long, 
           Adam meets eyes with Mary Ann and Nanny, who sit directly in 
           the middle of the audience with Libbet and Charles, all 
           watching with nervous anticipation. 
           Derek takes his seat on the bench of the grand piano.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  Wait for me please.

                                 DEREK
                        Yes, Adam.

           Adam steps OFF STAGE, then takes his place at an ELECTRIC 
           KEYBOARD hidden from the audience.

           Derek rocks slowly on the piano stool, his fingers fidgeting 
           in readiness for their forthcoming workout.  

           Backstage, Adam quietly plays the opening note of the Elgar - 
           just loud enough for Derek to hear.  Derek immediately 
           launches in, playing a magnificent yet effortless cascade of 
           melodies and harmonies.  The piece highly invigorating.

           Adam plays a few notes in the background, keeping Derek’s 
           tempo under control, asserting his authority.

           The audience is transfixed, marveling at the ability of this 
           tiny young boy.

           IN THE BACK ROW

           An ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN sneaks out of her seat and hurries 
           to the back of the gymnasium.  She searches the walls, then 
           quietly steps into the HALLWAY, where she finds what she’s 
           looking for:

           A WALL PHONE.  She frantically dials a number, then waits.  
           The moment a VOICE picks up...

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN
                        Neil, darling!  You absolutely need 
                        to hear this!

           She extends the phone as far as it’ll go, slipping through 
           the gymnasium door so the receiver can catch the sounds of 
           the performance...

           BACK STAGE

           Adam sits back, allowing Derek an opportunity to fly on his 
           own.  As Derek adds a few notes and flourishes of his own, 
           Adam plays a chord progression to bring him back down to 
           earth.  Derek follows along perfectly.

           Adam plays several notes a hair slower, just enough to signal 
           a return to the opening tempo.  Derek falls back into step, 
           then erupts into a series of expansive chords that lead to 
           the coda.
           Adam hits one chord after the next, herding Derek to the end, 
           preventing any unplanned repeats.

           Derek holds the last fortissimo cluster of notes, waiting for 
           Adam to lift his hands up first, then immediately PLONKS one 
           final note with his left hand!

           RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE!

           Derek beams at the audience and bows.  Adam joins him on 
           stage and then escorts him off.

           IN THE AUDIENCE

           Mary Ann, Nanny, Libbet and Charles applaud proudly.  Mary 
           Ann lowers her hands first, a bit nervous about what could 
           happen next.

           BACK STAGE

           The next performer, a BLIND VIOLINIST, is escorted out onto 
           the stage.  Adam monitors Derek, ready to pull him back if 
           necessary.  But Derek just listens patiently.

           The Violinist plays a short, easy piece like Over the 
           Rainbow.  APPLAUSE.

           Several other children perform, one playing a RECORDER and 
           the other SINGING.  APPLAUSE.

           When the stage is clear, Miss Lingard takes the stage one 
           last time.

                                 MISS LINGARD
                        How wonderful.  And now I’d like to 
                        invite our students back to perform 
                        together.

           Adam leads Derek to the piano.  The other students gather 
           around.  They perform a simple arrangement of Here Comes The 
           Sun by The Beatles.

           Backstage, Adam watches Derek like a hawk.  But the boy is 
           playing along splendidly with the other musicians.

           Derek is in the zone.  Focused on the peppy passages of the 
           piano.  His hands gliding across the keys.

           But his focus is interrupted by the VIOLIN, which seems to be 
           playing over him.  Followed by the RECORDER.  And then the 
           SINGER.  So many different NOISES, attacking from all sides, 
           overwhelming his senses.
           Adam helplessly notices Derek poking at his eyes with his 
           left hand while continuing to play with the right...

           Suddenly, Derek crescendoes, his hands aggressively pounding 
           the keyboard.

           The other musicians respond in kind, playing louder.

           For Derek, it’s a musical mutiny.  So he takes control by 
           playing the OTHER PARTS on the piano.   First the violin.  
           The Violinist struggles to play along but can’t fight the 
           power of the massive piano.  He quickly stops playing.

                                 SINGER
                        Here comes the sun, here comes the 
                        suuu...

           Derek takes over the Singer’s part, silencing her.  Before 
           Adam can even figure out what to do, Derek is playing the 
           whole song by himself, the other musicians giving up.  He’s 
           John, Paul, George and Ringo, all in one.

           Derek performs the rest of the cheerful song on his own.  The 
           other musicians stand helplessly, unsure what to do.

           And with one last chord, Derek finishes!  He jumps up, 
           waiting for the grand applause.

           Soft CLAPS from the confused audience.

           Mary Ann and Nanny sink in their seats.

           INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT

           Embarrassed PARENTS collect their musician children, avoiding 
           Adam and Derek like the plague.  Teacher and student stand in 
           awkward silence.

           A humiliated Mary Ann weaves through the crowd, her head hung 
           low, Nanny struggling to keep up.  

           Mary Ann reaches Adam and purposely avoids eye contact.  
           Without a single word, she grabs her son and whisks him away.

           Merely a moment passes...

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN
                        Mr. Ockelford!

                                 ADAM
                        Yes...
                                 ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN
                        It’s wonderful.  Most wonderful.  
                        Neil Richardson would like to 
                        feature Derek in an upcoming 
                        concert!

                                 ADAM
                        Neil Richardson?  Of the Royal 
                        Philharmonic Pops?  

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN
                        Indeed!

                                 ADAM
                        He was here?  Tonight?

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC ROTARIAN
                        Well not in person but he heard 
                        Derek’s first piece and loved it!

           As she babbles on more details, Adam searches the crowd for 
           Mary Ann...

           EXT. LINDEN LODGE - NIGHT

           Adam catches up to Mary Ann and Nanny just as they’re helping 
           Libbet and Charles load Derek into the back seat of the 
           Mercedes.

                                 ADAM
                        Mary Ann, if I may...

                                 NANNY
                        Come now, children.  Quickly.

                                 ADAM
                        I have tremendous news: Derek has 
                        been invited to play with the Royal 
                        Philharmonic Pops Orchestra!

           Confusion floods Mary Ann’s face.

                                 MARY ANN
                        After what happened tonight?  Why 
                        would they ever suggest that?

                                 ADAM
                        They see the same potential in 
                        Derek that we all do.  They even 
                        proposed the last movement from 
                        Gershwin’s Concerto in F, which I 
                        think is simply extraordinary...
                                 MARY ANN
                        Aren’t we getting a bit ahead of 
                        ourselves?  He couldn’t even play 
                        with other children in a simple 
                        social setting!

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t believe tonight was an 
                        issue of socialization.

                                 MARY ANN
                        No?  Then what was it?

                                 ADAM
                        All those other instruments - he 
                        was overwhelmed and it became too 
                        much.  So he drowned them all out. 

                                 MARY ANN
                        So what will he do when he’s on 
                        stage with a hundred professional 
                        musicians and an audience of 
                        thousands? 

                                 ADAM
                        Perhaps we can work him up to it.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Perhaps not.  Derek shouldn’t be 
                        subjected to any more public 
                        embarrassment.

                                 ADAM
                        But what if this opportunity is 
                        something he wants?

                                 MARY ANN
                        How can you know what he wants when 
                        he can’t even express it himself?

                                 ADAM
                        He lives for music.  We all know 
                        that.  He deserves this chance.

                                 MARY ANN
                        He does or you do, Adam?

           Adam is speechless.

                                 MARY ANN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t see this performance 
                        working out.  Now we must get 
                        going.  Enjoy your summer holiday.
           She SLAMS the door and the car drives away, leaving Adam 
           alone in the dark parking lot.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE FACULTY HOUSING - ADAM’S FLAT - EVENING

           Adam droops over his piano, using only his right hand to 
           plunk a few keys over and over again, repeating a bare bones 
           JAZZY THEME.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - EVENING

           An uninspired Derek also droops over his Welmar upright, 
           noodling through some random passages and tunes.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           Adam sits next to Kelly on the piano bench, in the middle of 
           a lesson.

           As Kelly plays, Adam stares into space, checked out.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - DAY

           Derek is in the same position, still noodling in a 
           dispassionate manner.

           Nanny stands in the doorway, studying him.  Noticing how 
           disengaged he is.

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Nanny peruses the classical section.  The Record Store Clerk 
           walks by and recognizes her.

                                 RECORD STORE CLERK
                        Ah, welcome back, ma’am.  Sadly, 
                        our record selection is even 
                        smaller than it used to be.

           Nanny selects a cassette from the display. 

                                 NANNY
                        Thank you - this will do just fine.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - LIBRARY - DAY

           Nanny checks the hallway to make sure Mary Ann is nowhere to 
           be seen.
           As Derek waits patiently at the piano, Nanny inserts the 
           cassette into Derek’s boombox, drapes headphones over the 
           boy’s ears and hits PLAY.  Derek listens intently to the new 
           music, his head swaying to the beat.

           Within seconds, Derek’s hands light up the keyboard, trying 
           to keep up with the recording with a speedy volley of notes.  
           His energy returning, he repeats the same JAZZY THEME Adam 
           was just plunking in his flat.

           Nanny sits on the couch, listening avidly.

           Mary Ann walks by, hears Derek playing, and walks on.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mary Ann carries a glass of water to her room when she hears 
           the piano.  Derek is playing the same JAZZY THEME as before.

           She passes the library and sees her son at the piano, 
           repeatedly playing the piece.  Why the obsession?

           Mary Ann enters the LIBRARY and notices the open cassette 
           case by the boombox.  

           The sleeve reads: GEORGE GERSHWIN - CONCERTO IN F.

           Mary Ann studies Derek.  He’s enraptured by this music.  
           Choosing to play it over and over again.

           INT. LINDEN LODGE FACULTY HOUSING - ADAM’S FLAT - MORNING

           Adam snoozes in his twin bed, surrounded by loose pages of 
           music and half read books.

           BUZZ, BUZZ.  His eyes peel open.  He gets his bearings, 
           slowly rolls out of bed and hits the DOOR INTERCOM.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes?

                                 MARY ANN (FILTERED)
                        Good morning - it’s Mary Ann.  May 
                        I come up?

           Adam’s eyes widen as he quickly scans his flat, which is a 
           total mess of dirty plates and glasses...

           INT. ADAM’S STUDIO FLAT - FRONT DOOR - MORNING

           A KNOCK on the door.
           Adam hastily buttons a shirt, scrambling to tuck it into his 
           pants as he ZIPS the zipper.

           Still sockless, he awkwardly steps into shoes as he flings 
           open the door, revealing a put together Mary Ann, wearing her 
           weekend finest.  She glances at Adam’s disheveled state.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Perhaps I can come back another 
                        time...

                                 ADAM
                        No no.  Please come in.  Could I 
                        get you anything?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Coffee would be fine, thank you.

           Adam disappears behind a freestanding zigzag partition, 
           ducking into his kitchenette. 

           Unsure where to sit, Mary Ann takes in the small flat.  The 
           piano is covered in stacks of disorganized music.  A blanket 
           has been hastily thrown over the tiny bed (books poking out 
           at the edges).

           Adam maneuvers through his kitchenette.  It’s a complete 
           disaster area: the dirty plates and glasses have all been 
           chaotically tossed in here.

           In a serious panic, Adam flings open the drawers - all 2 of 
           them.  He only finds a half empty bag of crisps and a lone 
           tea box.

                                 ADAM
                        How about tea?

                                 MARY ANN (O.S.)
                        Lovely.

           Adam reaches for the tea box.

                                 MARY ANN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What a...  Cozy space.

                                 ADAM
                        Thank you.  It’s nearly double the 
                        size of my last one!

           Adam opens the tea box: there’s only one bag inside...

           THE SHRILL WHINE OF A TEA KETTLE
           Adam pours one steaming cup of tea and sets it in on the 
           piano, directly in front of Mary Ann.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Please.  Do sit.

           He drags over the piano bench, offering it to her.  Mary Ann 
           is puzzled by the one cup of tea.

                                 MARY ANN
                        None for you?

                                 ADAM
                        Oh no, I’m fine.  I...  Already had 
                        one.

           He plops down on the edge of his bed.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        So - what can I do for you?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Well.  I was thinking about our 
                        last conversation and, how do I put 
                        it...  Is that concert you 
                        mentioned completely off the table?

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           Mary Ann sits up front next to the Driver, who navigates a 
           busy London road.

           In the back seat, Derek is sandwiched between Nanny and Adam.  
           Nanny quietly hums Molly Malone, filling in the tense 
           silence.  

           They drive towards a towering collection of buildings, built 
           with concrete and glass in a brutalist architectural style.  
           This is the BARBICAN PERFORMING ARTS CENTER.

           As they near the entrance, they hear a BUZZING CROWD...

           EXT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - DAY

           A throng of REPORTERS swarm the Mercedes, snapping photos as 
           Mary Ann and Adam struggle to climb out of the vehicle.  

                                 REPORTERS
                        Mrs. Paravicini!  Derek!

           Nanny protectively waits with Derek inside the car, 
           sheltering him from this swirling madness.
                                 RADIO REPORTER
                        Mr. Ockelford!  It must be so 
                        exciting to have your student 
                        perform with a professional 
                        orchestra for the first time.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s truly a wonderful opportunity.  
                        But first he needs to rehearse!

           He opens the door for Derek, guarding him against the mob of 
           Reporters.  Derek whips his head left and right, overwhelmed 
           by the chaotic noise.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Mrs. Paravicini, how is your son 
                        responding to all this?

                                 MARY ANN
                        Derek will be just fine, thank you.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        But is it right to put him into 
                        such a new, pressure-filled 
                        situation?

                                 MARY ANN
                        He is a very capable and resilient 
                        little boy.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        So no one is concerned about his...  
                        condition?

                                 MARY ANN
                        You are welcome to come and see for 
                        yourself.  You would also be 
                        contributing to our Fight for Sight 
                        charity, which we would all very 
                        much appreciate.

           More Reporters surround Mary Ann.  She frantically searches 
           for Nanny, who won’t stand for any more nonsense.

                                 NANNY
                        Make room, make room!  No time for 
                        dilly dallying!

           She erupts from the car and pushes her way through the crowd 
           like a steamroller, all 5 feet of her shielding and pulling a 
           confused Derek into the building.
           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - GREEN ROOM - DAY

           An ORCHESTRA AIDE flips on the light in a spacious green 
           room, where two upright pianos have been placed back to back.

                                 ORCHESTRA AIDE
                        Here we are, Mr. Ockelford.  Just 
                        as you requested.

                                 ADAM
                        Thank you.

                                 DEREK
                        Hello, I’m Derek!

           He extends his hand into the air, aiming in the direction of 
           the Aide’s voice.

                                 ORCHESTRA AIDE
                        Oh.  Hello.

           She quickly shakes Derek’s hand and hurries out.

           Adam plops Derek onto a piano stool.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  G minor scale please.

           Derek plays a slow, steady scale.  The rich sounds from the 
           piano are absorbed by the sound proofed walls.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Excellent.  F Major.

           Derek effortlessly executes the scale.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Wonderful.  Now - just like we 
                        practiced.  Stick to your part.  
                        And no twiddly bits.

                                 DEREK
                        No twiddly bits, Adam.

           Adam sits down at the other piano.  Without another moment’s 
           notice, he bursts into an energetic ACCOMPANIMENT, starting 
           the last movement of the Gershwin Concerto in F.

           Mary Ann and Nanny watch Derek, who waits patiently, not 
           interrupting Adam’s part.  Adam crescendoes, the 20 second 
           introduction coming to an end...
           And Derek is off, the rapid SOLO flying out of his fingers.  
           He’s incredibly focused on his solo part and allows Adam to 
           play the accompaniment in the background, the two parts 
           coexisting harmoniously.

           Adam meets eyes with Mary Ann - both are pleased that Derek 
           is under control.

           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - DAY

           Derek grips Adam’s hand as he’s led into the actual hall.  
           Soft house lights illuminate a sprawling auditorium of warm 
           wood that can seat nearly 2000.  But today the hall is empty.

           Except for the stage...

           Derek is overwhelmed as he hears a sea of MUSICIANS warming 
           up: a FRENCH HORN testing out a note.  A FLUTE practicing a 
           melody.  STRINGS bowing nimble passages.  The sudden taps of 
           a TIMPANI.

           All 70 members of the ROYAL PHILHARMONIC POPS ORCHESTRA are 
           there, ready for rehearsal.

           Derek shakes with nervous excitement, thrilled yet puzzled by 
           the literal symphony of sounds that surrounds him.

           Adam and Derek are greeted by the sophisticated conductor, 
           NEIL RICHARDSON.

                                 NEIL
                        So wonderful to see you both.

                                 ADAM
                        And you, Mr. Richardson.  Thank you 
                        for having us.

                                 DEREK
                        Hello, I’m Derek!

           He extends his hand into the air.  Neil shakes his hand.

                                 NEIL
                        Very good, Derek.  It’s great to 
                        meet you.

                                 DEREK
                        And you, Mr. Richardson.

           Neil leads them to the middle of the stage, to a majestic 
           STEINWAY CONCERT GRAND PIANO, a 9 foot colossus that is the 
           ultimate weapon of a concert pianist.
                                 NEIL
                        Shall we?

           Adam gently places Derek on the comfortable, cushioned piano 
           bench.  Derek’s entire body trembles as he struggles to 
           process what is happening around him.

           Neil TAPS his stand with the baton and the orchestra 
           instantly quiets down, the warm-ups shifting to silence.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  Just like we practiced.

           Derek anxiously reaches forward and feels the perfect, 
           shimmering keys of the piano.  His head continuously swivels, 
           hearing every BREATH and CHAIR SHIFT and sound from the 
           orchestral musicians.  He feels the hot lights bearing down 
           on him.

           Confused and disoriented, Derek launches right into the piano 
           solo.  Before the orchestra can even start playing. 

           BACKSTAGE: Mary Ann and Nanny can barely watch.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Derek...

           He taps the boy on the shoulder, stopping the playing.  Derek 
           pokes at his eyes uncomfortably.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s quite alright.  Whenever he is 
                        ready.

           Adam holds Derek back, pulling him away from the keyboard.  
           Once Derek has settled down, Adam nods at Neil.  

           The conductor raises his arms.  The orchestra members raise 
           their instruments.

           And with one WHOOSH of the baton, they’re off!  Playing the 
           20 second orchestral introduction before the soloist’s 
           entrance.

           It’s an amazing experience being there - right in the middle 
           of an entire symphony orchestra, all the instruments playing 
           simultaneously in sync, glued to the conductor’s movements.  

           And nobody is more amazed than Derek, who hears every 
           individual instrument, each melody and harmony and beat, 
           coming from every direction.  He can hardly breathe, the 
           experience beyond overwhelming.
           Adam taps Derek on the shoulder - they’re almost at the point 
           of his solo entrance...

           But Derek is so enamored by the surrounding sounds that he 
           stays frozen, entirely missing his entrance!

           Neil stops the orchestra.  Smiles politely at Adam.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Again from the top?

                                 ADAM
                        How about a few bars before his 
                        entrance.

                                 NEIL
                        Very good.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  Let’s remember when to 
                        come in now.

           Neil conducts and the orchestra plays again.  Neil watches 
           Derek expectantly as they near his entrance...

           Derek snaps out of his funk and explodes onto the keyboard!  
           His fingers flying into the energetic solo.

           Orchestra musicians exchange understanding looks with one 
           another, impressed by this small boy’s skill.

           Derek dances across the keyboard, in the zone with this 
           booming new piano, but he can’t quite escape all the 
           interrupting orchestral sounds.  A short FLUTE passage.  A 
           riff from the VIOLINS.  A descending XYLOPHONE scale...

           Very quickly, each surrounding sound becomes overwhelming and 
           Derek’s hands start flying across the keyboard even faster, 
           playing his part as well as the accompaniment.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        No, Derek, stick to your part...

           Neil glances back at Derek, wondering what the hell he’s 
           doing.

           Growing even more excited, Derek completely forgets his solo 
           part and plays along with the orchestra.  Matching a passage 
           in the LOWER STRINGS.  Then the WOODWINDS.  Abandoning his 
           part.  Even adding his own improvisations to the mix.

           Neil stops the orchestra and Adam takes a deep long breath.
           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           As Adam walks Derek offstage, Mary Ann takes her son.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Perhaps we should call off the 
                        whole thing.

                                 ADAM
                        It may be too late for that.

                                 MARY ANN
                        He isn’t ready...

                                 NANNY
                        Come now, Bumpy. 

           Nanny takes Derek by the hand and leads him away so he 
           doesn’t hear the rest of this.

                                 MARY ANN
                        What if he reacts that way in front 
                        of the audience?  He likely won’t 
                        perform ever again.

                                 ADAM
                        I know.

           Adam studies Derek, who is completely oblivious to the 
           worries of his mother.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Just give me a minute.

           Adam head back out to the stage.  He speaks to Neil on the 
           podium, animatedly pointing to the two microphones hanging 
           above the orchestra...

           INT. LINDEN LODGE - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           A JANITOR mops the floors in the quiet, abandoned gym.

           Derek sits patiently on the piano bench as Adam finishes 
           setting up 4 LARGE SPEAKERS, arranged in a semi-circle around 
           the baby grand - a surround sound setup.

           Adam connects the speakers to a receiver and cassette player.  
           He pulls out a padded envelope from Neil Richardson.  Inside 
           is a tape with a hand written label on it.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok Derek.  Time to perform.
                                 DEREK
                        Yes, Adam.

           Adam pops the cassette into the player.  CLICKS play.

           BOOM!  Derek nearly flies off the bench as the 4 speakers 
           explode with sound: it’s a recording of the Royal Pops 
           playing the Gershwin orchestral part.

           Adam has created a setup that imitates the experience of 
           playing with the live orchestra.  Derek shakes with nervous 
           excitement as the tremendous sound washes over him.  Unable 
           to restrain himself, he plays along with the accompaniment.

           Adam hits STOP.  The music grinds to a halt.

                                 ADAM
                        No Derek.  

           He REWINDS the tape.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Just your part...

           PLAY.  He starts the recording from the beginning again.

           This time, Derek sits at the edge of his seat, barely 
           restraining himself.  And then he jumps in at the right time 
           with his solo.  So far so good...

           Adam slowly cranks up the volume, the speakers overpowering 
           Derek’s solo.  Derek can barely hear his own playing, 
           surrounded by a deafening noise of strings, woodwinds, brass 
           and percussion, blasting at him from all 4 speakers.

           Within moments, Derek’s hands shift and he breaks out of his 
           solo, playing along with the accompaniment.

           STOP.  REWIND.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Focus on the solo, Derek.

           Derek BANGS the keyboard in frustration.  Adam crosses his 
           arms, waiting patiently, not responding to Derek’s behavior.  
           After a moment, the boy settles down.

           PLAY - the recording starts over from the beginning.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Focus...

           Derek plays his solo.
           The speakers blast in his ears.

           Derek plays his solo part, then can’t help himself from 
           playing the orchestra accompaniment and improvising over the 
           top.

           STOP.  REWIND.  PLAY.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Your part.  And no twiddly bits.

           The Janitor watches this whole exchange, a bit confused.

           EXT. NANNY’S FLAT - NIGHT

           A row of terraced houses.

           Adam’s Triumph Vitesse clunks to a stop in front of Nanny’s 
           residence.

           Derek is practically falling asleep in the front seat.

           Nanny rushes outside to greet them.  Adam quickly hops out 
           and opens Derek’s door.

                                 ADAM
                        So sorry we’re later than expected.

                                 NANNY
                        Quite alright.

           Adam helps an exhausted Derek out of the car.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s just, he was making such 
                        remarkable progress and...

                                 NANNY
                        Adam.  It’s alright.  Truly.

           She puts her hand on Adam’s shoulder, comforting.  Then 
           gently takes Derek.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for everything.  Derek 
                        very much appreciates it - as do I.  
                        Now get some rest.  Tomorrow is a 
                        big day.

           As she leads Derek inside, Adam takes in the moment.  Moved 
           by this warm exchange.
           INT. ADAM’S STUDIO FLAT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Adam lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Too many 
           worries spinning through his mind.

           INT. NORTH LODGE FARM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Mary Ann tosses and turns in bed, unable to fall asleep.

           INT. NANNY’S FLAT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Derek fidgets in bed, an excited smile on his face.  He wears 
           his headphones, the faint sounds of the GERSHWIN RECORDING 
           spilling out from his ears.

           In the other room, Nanny SNORES.

           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - GREEN ROOM - DAY

           A concert dressed Adam sits at one of the pianos, waiting 
           patiently.  He studies the cover of the concert program: the 
           event is called BLUES TO BROADWAY and Derek has star billing.  
           The date is JULY 18th, 1988.

           Mary Ann paces back and forth, the most anxious person in the 
           room.

           Nanny tucks Derek’s lustrous white silk shirt into his shiny 
           black trousers.  She slips a new cummerbund around his waist 
           and quickly fastens it in back with safety pins. 

                                 NANNY
                        Isn’t that comfy now.

                                 DEREK
                        Yes, Nanny.

           Derek rocks in place, visibly excited.  He continuously turns 
           towards the door, listening to the commotion of VOICES 
           outside.

           Suddenly, the door bursts open, revealing a CROWD OF 
           REPORTERS.  They immediately YELL for Derek, who quickly 
           retreats behind Nanny.

           A PHOTOGRAPHER pushes his way into the green room, raising a 
           camera.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        If I may, please!  Just a quick 
                        shot for the Telegraph.
           Before anyone can stop him, SNAP!  A flash blinds all of them 
           (except Derek of course).

           Nanny shoos the Photographer out of the room and SLAMS the 
           door.

                                 NANNY
                        It appears our Bumpy is quite the 
                        sensation.

           KNOCK KNOCK!

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Please go away!  Derek is warming 
                        up!

           The door CREAKS open, revealing Nic, Libbet and Charles.

                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Oh!  Hello Mr. Paravicini.  

                                 NIC
                        Nanny.  Adam.  Mary Ann.  

                                 MARY ANN
                        Nic.  Thank you for bringing the 
                        children.

           They’re perfectly polite with one another.  

           Libbet and Charles run up and hug Derek dearly.  Nic gently 
           pats Derek on the back.

                                 NIC
                        Best of luck, Derek.

                                 NANNY
                        What do you say?

                                 DEREK
                        Thank you, Daddy.

           Nic smiles politely and walks out with the two children.

           Nanny adjusts Derek’s recently trimmed hair.

                                 NANNY
                        There we are, Bumpy.  Very 
                        handsome.

           She inspects Derek one last time.  He’s ready.
                                 NANNY (CONT’D)
                        Come now, Mary Ann.  It’s time we 
                        took our seats.  It’s all up to 
                        Bumpy and Adam now.

                                 MARY ANN
                        Yes.  Very good.

           She gives Derek the biggest hug of her life, pecks him on the 
           cheek and rushes out with Nanny, who clears a path through 
           the lurking reporters before shutting the door behind them.

                                 ADAM
                        Well then, Derek.  How about we 
                        start with a slow g minor scale...

           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Adam slowly walks Derek through the darkness, nearing the 
           stage.  One tall, one small, silhouetted by the blinding 
           lights out in the auditorium.

           They wait in the wings - Adam sees waves of movement rippling 
           on the orchestra-filled stage and in the audience-packed 
           hall: it’s a full house.

           Derek shakes with nervous anticipation, his head darting back 
           and forth with every VOICE, MURMUR and MOVEMENT emanating 
           from the awaiting audience.

           A tuxedo-clad COMPÈRE touches Adam and Derek on the 
           shoulders.

                                 COMPÈRE
                        Almost showtime, gentlemen.

           Adam can barely hold Derek still.  The boy anticipating a 
           thrill of a lifetime...

           As the Compère steps out onto the stage to take the mic, the 
           house lights dim.  Darker and darker as Derek listens in, all 
           light fading away...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:

                                 COMPÈRE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And now, ladies and gentlemen.  I 
                        would like to introduce you to a 
                        truly remarkable young man...

           Derek’s RAPID BREATHS.
           Adam CLEARING HIS THROAT.

                                 COMPÈRE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Playing tonight for the very first 
                        time with an orchestra.  Please 
                        welcome Derek Paravicini.

           A WAVE OF APPLAUSE ERUPTS in the distance.  

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Here we go, Derek...

           And then CHILD FOOTSTEPS next to ADULT ONES, walking out onto 
           the stage.

           The applause grows DEAFENING as they exit the wings.

           TAP TAP TAP: there’s a repetitive sound coming from all 
           directions...

           INT. BARBICAN CONCERT HALL - SAME

           Adam leads Derek between the first and second violin 
           sections, the violinists all TAPPING their metal music stands 
           with their wooden bows.

           The same height as the seated musicians, the little boy 
           practically skips along with Adam.

           IN THE AUDIENCE

           Mary Ann and Nanny anxiously CLAP, watching as their little 
           Derek’s blond hair moves past the seated violinists, nearing 
           the glimmering grand piano that awaits him.  Derek looks 
           absurdly small and vulnerable on the packed stage.

           Elsewhere, Nic sits with Libbet and Charles, APPLAUDING with 
           tremendous pride.

           In fact, numerous people from Derek’s life are all there for 
           this monumental event: Headmistress Brumm, Miss Lingard, the 
           piano donating Official, the Doctor that delivered Derek, 
           Sister Walker, the Enthusiastic Rotarian, Mr. Sutton the 
           tuner, and even Linden Lodge students like Andrew and Kelly.

           ON STAGE

           Neil, standing on the podium and dressed in tails, awaits 
           Adam and Derek, a noble, welcoming expression on his face.

           Adam lifts little Derek onto the piano bench, plopping the 
           boy on the cushioned seat, positioning him the perfect 
           distance away from the instrument.
           The applause dies down.

                                 ADAM
                        Ok, Derek.  I have to go backstage 
                        now.  Just remember: focus.  It’s 
                        all up to you.

           It pains him to leave Derek but he has no choice.

           The teacher departs.  Leaving the student all alone.

           Derek listens to Adam’s FOOTSTEPS disappearing into the 
           distance.

           Adam peers out from the backstage darkness.  The stage is 
           still - the calm before the storm.

           Mary Ann fiddles with the program on her lap.  Nanny uses her 
           program to fan herself.  Both women equally nervous.

           Ever so slightly, Neil TAPS his conductor’s stand with his 
           baton.  Just loud enough for Derek to hear and turn his head.  
           Signaling that they’re about to start.

           All the musicians raise their instruments...

           Mary Ann shifts in her seat.  Unable to contain her nerves.

           And with a quick wave of the baton...

           THE ORCHESTRA IS OFF, playing the 20 second introduction 
           before Derek is supposed to come in.

           IN THE AUDIENCE, Mary Ann’s eyes remain glued to Derek.  Her 
           little baby boy.  Wondering what he’ll do.

           Derek’s hands move inexorably up towards his eyes.  Mary Ann 
           suppresses the impulse to scream.

           BACKSTAGE, Adam watches Derek touching his eyes.  Adam rubs 
           his beard anxiously, helpless to do anything.

           As the orchestra nears Derek’s solo entry point, Neil glances 
           over his shoulder to see if Derek is readying himself.  The 
           boy lowers his hands to his sides...

           IN THE AUDIENCE, Mary Ann breaths a sigh of relief, then 
           realizes that Derek hasn’t even felt for the piano yet.  How 
           does he know where the keys are??  She closes her eyes, 
           unable to look.

           BACKSTAGE, Adam notices Derek rocking back and forth.  Is he 
           going to come in on time or not?  Adam closes his eyes, 
           unable to look either.
           IN THE AUDIENCE:

           Nanny, meanwhile, lovingly watches her little Bumpy.  Maybe 
           it’s through blind faith in God or in the boy, but she has a 
           little smile on her face, at peace with whatever is about to 
           happen.

           Neil nervously glances at Derek’s hands, which haven’t at all 
           moved towards the keyboard.  

           Nanny is the only one that notices Derek finally feeling the 
           piano pedals.  Orienting himself perfectly with the keyboard.

           And at the very last moment...

           Derek reaches forward and brings his hands down perfectly on 
           the correct keys, launching into his SOLO!

           Mary Ann’s eyes shoot open!  As do Adam’s!  Locked in on 
           Derek, who is completely in the zone.

           Neil relaxes, letting the baton flow as he follows his bold 
           little soloist.

           As the piano notes join with the orchestra, Derek’s face 
           breaks into the broadest, most radiant smile any of them have 
           ever seen.

           Neil cautiously brings in different instruments: the 
           trumpets, the clarinets, the violins...  All their sounds 
           attacking Derek from every direction. 

           BACKSTAGE: Adam pays close attention, studying Derek’s every 
           last movement to see how he’ll react.

           Derek soaks in those sounds, listening to every last melody 
           and harmony.  A seemingly overwhelming cacophony of different 
           sounds.  But this time, the presence of the other instruments 
           only increase Derek’s focus...

           He lasers in on the piano...  His fingers STRIKING the keys.  
           The hammers HITTING the strings.  The gorgeous Steinway sound 
           BOUNCING off the propped up lid and erupting into the 
           audience.

           BACKSTAGE: Adam practically rocks back and forth himself, 
           riveted by Derek’s performance.

           IN THE AUDIENCE: Mary Ann can’t help but grab Nanny’s hand, 
           steadying herself.

           Freeing himself from the shackles of his disabilities, Derek 
           engages with the orchestra in a mature, witty and joyous 
           conversation in sound.  
           The musicians are having the time of their lives, performing 
           passionately in sync as one giant, coordinated instrument.

           And before anyone can even breathe, Derek leaps into the 
           energetic CODA of the piece, his fingers flying across the 
           keyboard, faster and faster.  Neil accelerates his baton 
           movements, trying to keep up with this brilliant soloist.

           But Derek isn’t a runaway train.  He’s guiding the music.  
           Moving the sound exactly how he wants to.  Somehow imposing 
           his will on this most complex of social situations, gripping 
           the audience with his powerful musical communication.

           Every last person in the Barbican sits at the edge of their 
           seat as Derek explodes into the ending cadence...

           And before the FINAL NOTE stops echoing in the hall...

           The APPLAUSE hits Derek like a clap of thunder, lifting him 
           off his feet.  

           Mary Ann and Nanny simultaneously leap out of their chairs.  
           Mary Ann struggling to applaud and wipe tears from her eyes 
           at the same time.  Nanny blinks extra deeply, forcing her own 
           tears back inside - because Nannies don’t cry.

           Nic, Libbet and Charles jump to their feet, followed by the 
           entire audience: Derek’s family, friends and strangers alike, 
           rejoining at this brilliant, moving performance.

           BACKSTAGE: Adam finally exhales.  He watches Derek proudly, 
           this little boy who is physically shaking with excitement, 
           laughing and applauding himself. 

           Neil gestures backstage, inviting Adam to join them.  Adam 
           shyly comes forward, putting his arm around Derek.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Well done, Derek.  Very well done.

           He helps the boy take a bow against the endless sea of 
           standing, applauding audience members.

           But the applause doesn’t stop.  It only GROWS.  Adam glances 
           at Neil, who nods and gestures to the piano.  Adam puts his 
           hand on Derek’s shoulder.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I think they’d like you to play an 
                        encore...

           Derek cocks his head slightly, trying to understanding what 
           Adam is saying.
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Can you play something else for 
                        them, Derek? 

           Derek nods slowly as Adam’s words sink in.  He feels for his 
           piano bench, sits down, then moves to the side, glancing back 
           at Adam.  An invitation.

           Adam takes a seat next to his student.  The applause dies 
           down.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You get to choose, Derek.  Anything 
                        you’d like.

           Derek soaks this in.  Weighing these unfamiliar instructions.  
           He remains still, his face impossible to read as the whole 
           hall waits for him. 

           IN THE AUDIENCE: Mary Ann and Nanny wait with great 
           anticipation. 

           ON STAGE: Derek fidgets with his hands, his brain processing.

                                 DEREK
                        Anything I’d like...

           Slowly, he reaches for the keyboard.  Finally making his 
           choice - a seemingly trivial act but a monumental leap for 
           someone like Derek.  

           2000 people wait in complete silence. 

           Derek plays a soft, nearly imperceptible CHORD.  Then 
           another.  His hands slowly flowing across the white and black 
           keys, the notes crystalline like rain drops.

           A simple, lovely MELODY.

           Mary Ann inches forward in her seat, the music sounding 
           familiar...

           Adam leans back as he understands...

           And that’s when Nanny’s tears come - she really can’t stop 
           them now.  For Derek is playing Molly Malone.  The piece of 
           music she always sang to him.  

           Derek is reaching as far back into his musical memory as he 
           can remember.  Playing the very first song he ever heard, 
           when he arrived at North Lodge Farm for the first time nearly 
           9 years ago.

           And there’s not a dry eye in the hall.
           And as Derek makes the piece his, elaborating with beautiful 
           improvisations, transforming this version of Molly Malone 
           into something truly transcendent...

                                                               FADE TO:
