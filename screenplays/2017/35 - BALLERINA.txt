           EXT. SWISS ALPS / VILLAGE - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1609

           SSSCCHHHWWFUNK!!!

           A sword blade SLICES through an unprotected neck. 

           The HEAD of a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN tumbles into the dirt. Her 
           BODY lands beside it, hands still clutching a basket of fruit.

           The PERPETRATOR of this beheading stands over the body. 
           Sweaty, long hair, teeth clenched.

           He BENDS DOWN, grabs the head by the hair, lifts it up and 
           WALKS AROUND with it dangling by his side. Blood pours from 
           the stump of her neck-- painting a CIRCLE on the ground.

           He stands in the middle of the blood circle and LOOKS OUT AT--

           Around him, a quaint little village. Wooden huts, rudimentary 
           shops. The dirt roads LITTERED with the BODIES of villagers.

           Over a hundred men and women, throats slit, blood staining 
           their tunics, robes. Stomachs opened. Limbs slashed, missing.

           Standing over them, breathing heavily, two dozen men and 
           women. Weapons clenched in their hands. They look to the man 
           clutching the woman’s head-- their LEADER.

           The LEADER speaks in GERMAN, subtitled.

                                 LEADER
                        Clean up the bodies. Round up the 
                        surviving children. This will do.

                                  BLACK.

           AS CREDITS PLAY-- THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO TWO HALVES-- ON 
           EACH, A DIFFERENT SCENE PLAYS OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY.

           LEFT HALF -- EXT. ZURICH - NIGHT

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1718

           A MAN stumbles out of a TAVERN into the back alley. He walks 
           to the cobblestone wall. Rests a hand against it. SIGHS.

           The soft patter of his piss hitting the ground.

           A WOMAN passes behind him. It happens quickly-- she grabs him by 
           the forehead and cuts his throat before he has time to react.
           He collapses, blood mixing with his urine in the dirt road.

           RIGHT HALF -- INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1856

           A seedy brothel. On the bed, an ENORMOUS MAN rides a YOUNG 
           WOMAN. He throws his head back. As he does she pulls a knife 
           and SLASHES HIS THROAT. Some real Gone Girl shit.

           She gives him a shove. He TOPPLES off the edge of the bed.

           THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO THREE PARTS-- AGAIN PLAYING OUT 
           AT THE SAME TIME.

           FIRST SECTION -- EXT. NEVADA / HIGHWAY - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1964

           A classic Ford Mustang cruises down a desert road.

           IN THE CAR -- A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (50s) drives. She nears a 
           stop sign, slows. Nobody else in sight for miles. In the 
           backseat-- a YOUNG MAN (18) SITS UP. He slits the woman’s 
           throat before we realize what’s happening.

           Then he lurches forwards and presses down on the woman’s leg-- 
           keeping her foot on the brake. He awkwardly CLIMBS FORWARDS 
           into the passenger seat.

           SECOND SECTION -- INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1972

           A MAN sits in a movie theater, empty save for a guy behind 
           him, MAN 2. MAN 1 grabs a popcorn kernel, tosses it towards 
           his mouth. MAN 2 LURCHES FORWARD and pulls THE CHAIN of a 
           PAIR OF NUN-CHUCKS over Man 1’s throat. 

           THE POPCORN KERNAL lands in Man 1’s mouth as he struggles. On 
           the handle of each nun-chuck is a yellow smiley face.

           THIRD SECTION -- EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE -- 1980

           A DUDE skis down a slope. ANOTHER DUDE, DUDE 2, skis up 
           behind him. Dude 2 pulls a gun-- ready for action. Dude 1 
           goes off a jump-- loses control--
           And lands on his HEAD. SNAP! Dude 2 stops-- looks down at 
           Dude 1’s body-- then SHRUGS, continues on.

           THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO SIXTEEN SECTIONS.

           You get the idea of what’s happening in each of them-- in 
           each, a murder from some point in the last FIVE HUNDRED YEARS. 
           It’s just like that sex montage in that classic Dane Cook 
           movie Good Luck Chuck that everyone loves and remembers*, but 
           with murder instead of Dane Cook fucking people.

                        END CREDITS. SLAM TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON...

           INT. HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A room illuminated only by the glow of a boxy old TV. 

           Silhouetted in front of the screen, a YOUNG GIRL. She watches 
           a VHS copy of Enter the Dragon intently, her eyes tracking 
           every blow thrown by Bruce Lee’s fists.

           This is YOUNG ROONEY BROWN (6). Her fingers roll on the 
           ground. A door CREAKS OPEN. VOICES in the next room. Rooney 
           gets to her feet, pads to the door, and peers into--

           INT. HOUSE / ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

           ROONEY’S FATHER (40s) steps into the house, exchanges words 
           with a WOMAN standing inside. Their voices barely audible.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER
                        Thanks for uh... for watching after 
                        her, you know we... I appreciate it.

           The woman nods, puts a hand on his shoulder, leaves. Rooney’s 
           Father wipes his eyes. Then glances up at ROONEY, in the 
           doorway. She DUCKS out of view.

           INT. HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney’s Father enters. He sits next to Rooney on the couch 
           and pulls her into an embrace. ON ROONEY’S FACE as she 
           listens to the sound of her father crying.

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        Is Mom coming home?

        *Author's Note: I do not actually like Good Luck Chuck.
                                 ROONEY’S FATHER
                        No she’s not, sweetie.

           But Rooney, we can see from her face, already knew this.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        She’s somewhere happier now. Hold on.

           He reaches into his bag, pulls something out. It’s a small, 
           ornate MUSIC BOX.

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        What is it?

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER
                        It was given to your Mom, by her 
                        mother, when she was a little girl.

           He opens it. A delicate glass ballerina, dressed in a pink 
           tutu, rises from the box and starts to SPIN. A soft, lyrical 
           melody begins to sound.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        She wanted you to have it. To give 
                        to your own daughter someday.

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        It’s stupid. I don’t want it, I 
                        want Mom back. Trade it back.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER
                        Rooney--

           The sound of the front door creaking open. Rooney’s Father’s 
           gaze shoots towards the door.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Miriam must have forgotten 
                        something. Hold on.

           Still holding the music box, he walks out of the room.

                                 ROONEY’S FATHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        How--

           PEW! The THUMP of a body hitting the floor. Rooney jumps to 
           her feet and runs back into--

           INT. HOUSE / ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

           Rooney looks down at her FATHER, lying on the ground with 
           blood fountaining out of his head. She looks up at a MAN, 
           dressed in black. They lock eyes. The man RAISES A GUN--
           And Rooney THROWS HERSELF backwards. The man SHOOTS after her 
           but she’s GONE up the winding staircase, out of sight. The 
           man GRUNTS, then sets off after her up the stairs.

           INT. HOUSE / STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           He reaches the top of the staircase and looks left and right. 
           No sign of Rooney. BAM! A SHOE flies towards him, CLOCKS HIM 
           in the side of the head. He stumbles, looks up--

           Rooney, from around a corner, throws a BOOK at him. It hits 
           him in the face. He regains his bearings, raises his gun--

           But Rooney is already RUNNING TOWARDS HIM. She BARRELS INTO 
           HIS LEGS, sending him TOPPLING BACKWARDS down the staircase.

           We hear him thumpbumpthumpbump down the staircase. CRACK! 
           Rooney takes a few deep breaths. Then RUNS down the stairs.

           INT. HOUSE / ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

           She doesn’t even glance at the intruder, lying with his neck 
           at an impossible angle. She runs into a DIFFERENT ROOM, then 
           RETURNS moments later. She kneels next to her father.

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        I called the police, they’re coming.

           Rooney looks at him, blood leaking out of his head. She puts 
           her hands on the bullet wound. Trying to hold him together.

                                 YOUNG ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Dad, you gotta stay awake, okay? 
                        You gotta stay awake.

           She shifts her foot. It knocks into the MUSIC BOX, lying on the 
           ground next to them. It tilts onto its side and FALLS OPEN.

           The glass ballerina rises out of it and begins her dance. The 
           song tinkling on, on and on, on and on. Rooney’s Father’s 
           blood crawls across the ground. It pools around the base of 
           the music box. And still the music plays.

                              FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPERIMPOSE -- ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 1

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           YOUNG ROONEY sits in a sterile room, a CASE WORKER sitting 
           across from her, talking at her.
                                 CASE WORKER
                        Because neither of your parents had 
                        any living relatives that we could 
                        find, we’ll unfortunately have to 
                        place you in a group home until we 
                        can find a more permanent place to--

           INT. GROUP HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY

           ROONEY (7) reads on the couch as OTHER KIDS run back and 
           forth. A BOY, JAKE (7), runs up and POKES Rooney in the leg.

                                 YOUNG JAKE
                        You’re it!

           He turns to run-- and Rooney STICKS OUT HER LEG. He SPRAWLS 
           over it and SLAMS to the ground face-first. Rooney leaps off 
           the couch, kneels over him, whispers--

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        Don’t ever touch me.

                                 YOUNG JAKE
               (crying)
                        I didn’t mean to-- I just wanted-

                                 YOUNG ROONEY
                        I’m-- I’m sorry--

           He scampers away. ALL EYES IN THE GROUP HOME look at Rooney 
           warily. She runs out of the room. Jake glares after her.

           QUICK CUTS-- Of Rooney through her teen years in the home.

           -- ROONEY (11) does pull-ups furiously, using the frame of an 
           upper bunkbed as her pull-up bar. 

           JAKE (11) runs in, raises his hand-- and throws a CLUMP OF 
           MUD at her back. She drops, spins, gives chase. She catches 
           him before he’s out of the room and SLAMS him into the wall.

           -- ROONEY (13) lies on the couch reading Slaughterhouse Five.

           -- ROONEY (15) does PUSH-UPS on the floor of her room. JAKE 
           (15), stands in the doorway, staring daggers at Rooney. She 
           looks up at him. Holds up a hand and FLIPS HIM OFF while 
           continuing to do one-handed push-ups. Jake leaves.

           INT. GROUP HOME / BATHROOM - EVENING

           ROONEY (17) stands under the shower, looking up at the falling 
           water. She runs her hands through her hair. Closes her eyes.
           A BUCKET is lifted over the lip of the shower. It SPILLS onto 
           her-- SHIT AND PISS, stirred into a soup. The bucket follows 
           its contents OVER the stall and clonks Rooney on the head.

           Rooney’s eyes fly open. She looks at her arms, at the shit 
           sloshing into the drain. LAUGHTER from outside of the shower.

           INT. GROUP HOME / BATHROOM - EVENING

           Rooney tears open the curtain. JAKE (17) stands there, smile 
           plastered on his face. He freezes, takes in the sight.

                                 JAKE
                        Whoa, Rooney--

           Rooney JUMPS AT HIM, knocking him BACK into the wall.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK--

           Rooney THROWS HIM to the tile floor of the bathroom. He lands 
           HARD. She kneels over him and PUNCHES HIM in the face-- some 
           of the shit on her hands smearing onto his cheeks.

           He spits out blood, holds up his hands to protest. Rooney 
           grabs him by the shirt collar and DRAGS HIM--

           INT. GROUP HOME / HALLWAY - EVENING

           --Down the hallway. OTHER KIDS come out of their rooms. 
           Jake’s hands slap at Rooney’s legs, ass. Not helping.

           She drags him to the WINDOW at the end of the hall, HOISTS 
           him up-- and SLAMS HIM back through it. The glass SHATTERS.

           INT. / EXT. GROUP HOME / HALLWAY - EVENING

           They’re on the second story-- he dangles backwards fourteen 
           feet off the ground, legs still gripping the window frame.

                                 JAKE
                        DON’T DROP ME, YOU CRAZY BITCH!

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m crazy?

           Rooney hesitates. Just looks at him. Loosens her grip a 
           little bit. Holy shit she’s gonna drop him--

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        BROWN!
           Rooney freezes, turns. A CARETAKER stands in the hallway.

                                 CARETAKER
                        Put him down. Inside.

           INT. GROUP HOME / OFFICE - NIGHT

           ROONEY sits in a chair in a cozy office. Arms crossed over 
           her chest. The door opens behind her.

                                 ROONEY
                        If you’re gonna kick me out just do 
                        it already, don’t make me wait to--

           She stops when she sees who’s coming through the door. The 
           caretaker, but, behind her, ANOTHER MAN-- a big, burly dude. 
           He carries himself with calm-- but there’s a dichotomy here, 
           the sense he could flip on a dime. This is BERKOWITZ (55).

                                 CARETAKER
                        Rooney. Meet Colonel Berkowitz.

           The caretaker exits. Berkowitz sits across from Rooney. He 
           holds out his hand. She just looks at it.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Not gonna shake my hand?

                                 ROONEY
                        Am I... in trouble?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        In trouble? Didn’t he dump a bucket 
                        of shit on you? No, you’re not in 
                        trouble, and even if you were, the 
                        way I understand it, group homes 
                        aren’t generally in the practice of 
                        bringing in government operatives to 
                        deal with... troubled youths.

                                 ROONEY
                        Government operative?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Turn eighteen next week, right? 
                        Gonna need a place to go. We’ve been 
                        watching you. Rooney. For some time.

           Berkowitz pulls out a laptop. Opens it in front of Rooney.

           THE SCREEN is divided into sixteen quadrants-- each 
           displaying footage from a different point in Rooney’s life.
           ONE SCREEN -- Rooney walks down the street smoking a 
           cigarette. Somebody films her from the shadows.

           ANOTHER SCREEN -- YOUNG ROONEY dances on stage in a school 
           production of Annie.

                                 ROONEY
                        What the hell--

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        June 1st. 1991. Does that date  
                        mean anything to you?

           Rooney clams up. Berkowitz slides a PHOTO across his desk. She 
           looks at it. An image of ROONEY AND HER DAD, both smiling.

                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        I need you to tell me what happened 
                        that night. I need you to tell me. 
                        So I know you can face it.

                                 ROONEY
                        A man broke into my house and 
                        killed my father. Nobody knows why. 
                        It was... random.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        That. Is not true.

           He slides a FILE across the desk to Rooney. She looks inside. 
           Her FATHER’S PHOTO at the top.

                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        I work for a private military company 
                        called Whitewater. Your father did 
                        intelligence work for us. The man who 
                        killed him-- the man who chased you 
                        around the house, who you pushed down 
                        a staircase and killed when you were 
                        six years old-- he was a high-level 
                        contract killer. And we’ve been 
                        tracking you ever since.

           Rooney looks up from the folder and says nothing.

                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        What do you want to do with your life?

                                 ROONEY
                        I... I don’t know. Help people, maybe. 
                        But I don’t know--
                                 BERKOWITZ
                        You don’t know the path. I think you 
                        could help people. You have the 
                        passion. The... aggression, the 
                        strength, the intelligence. But 
                        helping people doesn’t always look 
                        the way you think it will.

                                 ROONEY
                        What exactly do you do, Mr. Berkowitz?

           Berkowitz says nothing for a long moment.

           Then he GRINS. It’s a big, toothy, joyless grin. It’s 
           terrifying. It lasts for a long time.

           INT. GROUP HOME / ROONEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney sits in her bed in the group home. She opens the 
           bedside table and pulls out an object-- the MUSIC BOX. She 
           runs her hands over the surface. A familiar gesture. 

           She opens the box. The glass ballerina rises and begins to 
           SPIN. The soft lyrical melody begins to sound.

           Rooney sets the music box on the bedside table. She lays on 
           her side and wraps her arms around herself. She rocks back 
           and forth as she watches the ballerina spin on and on.

           The soft tinkling takes us through a SERIES OF QUICK SCENES--

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA - DAY

           AERIAL SHOT -- The grounds of a private military corporation.

           -- A rainy field. ROONEY does push-ups in formation with other 
           trainees. One by one, the others tap out. Rooney DOESN’T.

           -- Rooney and the other trainees run through an obstacle 
           course. Rooney AHEAD of the others. She reaches a wall, 
           CLIMBS THE ROPE dangling from it with ease.

           -- Rifle practice. Rooney looks through a scope, SQUEEZES the 
           tigger, BLASTS a hole in the head of a paper 33 yards away.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           ROONEY (early 20s now) sits at a two-top. Drinking a beer, 
           lost in thought.
                                 ROONEY - V.O.
                        I’m not ready.

                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O.
                        You’re ready.

           A GUY walking past BUMPS into her. His beer sloshes onto her.

              ROONEY
                               GUY
           Watch where you’re--
                        Hey, I’m so sorry--

           Rooney and the guy look at each other. He has nice eyes, a 
           scraggly beard, a Smiths t-shirt. This is TOM (20s).

                                 TOM
                        I really didn’t mean to-- oh God, I 
                        spilled beer on you!

                                 ROONEY
                        It’s-- fine. Don’t worry about it.

                                 TOM
                        No, I-- I’ll be back! Stay still!

           Tom starts to run towards the bar-- realizes he’s still 
           holding a full beer-- sets it on the table-- runs off again.

           MOMENTS LATER, he returns with a wet rag in hand and a 
           haphazard smile on his face.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Tom and Rooney sit across from one another.

                                 TOM
                        Whitewater, sure, but-- what do you 
                        do, actually?

                                 ROONEY
                        Clerical work, mostly. It’s boring. 
                        But they make everyone who travels 
                        for them go through basic training.

                                 TOM
                        That’s, that’s intense, man. I’m 
                        just-- I could never-- you could 
                        totally kick my ass.

                                 ROONEY
                        Are you okay with that?

                                 TOM
                        If you are.
           He reaches out and puts his hand on Rooney’s.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Should I not have done that? 
                        I’m sorry, I--

           Rooney smiles. The first time we’ve seen her do so. Then she 
           glances at her watch.

                                 ROONEY
                        Fuck. 
               (beat)
                        What are you doing later?

           INT. HOTEL / HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Rooney walks down a hotel hallway dressed in a maid’s outfit.

           INT. HOTEL / ROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney stands behind the door, gun clutched in her hand. The 
           door creaks open.

                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O.
                        And Rooney? Don’t miss.

           An Anderson Cooper-looking SILVER FOX steps through the door. 
           Rooney raises her pistol at the back of his head. Hand 
           shaking-- SLIGHTLY. She hesitates-- SLIGHTLY.

                                 ROONEY - V.O.
                        Yeah, no fucking shit.

           She FIRES. The bullet GRAZES the back of his head. He TURNS 
           BACK, and as Rooney FIRES AGAIN he DIVES TOWARDS HER.

           His weight carries her to the floor. They ROLL on the carpet, 
           they scrapple for the upper hand, they trade positions UNTIL--

           --Rooney has his neck CLENCHED BETWEEN HER THIGHS. How did we 
           get here? Use your imagination. He STRUGGLES. 

           She aims her gun DOWN at the top of his head, sticking out 
           from between her legs, and--

           INT. HOTEL / BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney washes blood off her face. She checks her watch.

                                 ROONEY
                        Shit.
           INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ding! TOM, in sweatpants, walks to the front door of his 
           apartment. Opens it. ROONEY stands there, looking remarkably 
           well-put together given what just happened.

                                 TOM
                        I wasn’t sure you were coming.

                                 ROONEY
                        Well. Here I am.

           INT. APARTMENT / BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney and Tom MAKE OUT FURIOUSLY on Tom’s bed.

           SUPERIMPOSE-- THIS TIME IN BRIGHT, FLASHING NEON COLORS--

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 2

           EXT. MOSCOW / MARKETPLACE - NIGHT

           ROONEY (mid-20s now) crosses a crowded patio. Phone out.

                                 ROONEY - V.O.
                        Take me through it.

                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O.
                        These men belong to a group 
                        responsible for beheading twenty-
                        five journalists over the last seven 
                        years. Covered it up well-enough--

                                 ROONEY - V.O.
                        That we’re here. Got it.

                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O.
                        Jack Stone. That’s who you’re working 
                        with on this. You should be able to 
                        spot him. Easily.

           A few dozen feet away, a table under a streetlight. 

           Illuminating a bouquet of roses and a handsome-ass dude, a 
           JACK STONE (30s) if ever you’ve seen one. Rooney hastens 
           towards him. He kneels, kisses her hand.

                                 ROONEY
                        We’re supposed to be fucking covert.

                                 STONE
                        I am. I’m posing as a man in love.
           EXT. MOSCOW / ALLEY - NIGHT

           Rooney and Stone stand in the shadows of an alley. A DOOR 
           opens-- two WAITERS step out into the alley. Rooney steps up 
           behind one, Jack behind another. Chloroform rags in hand.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Rooney and Jack enter, wearing the waiters’ uniforms. They 
           move straight for the private back dining room.

           INT. RESTAURANT / BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney and Jack push into the back room. LOUD MUSIC plays. A 
           DOZEN MEN, sitting around a table, look up. Rooney and Jack 
           are already moving, guns out, shooting-- HEADS EXPLODING.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A WAITER enters the back room. Sees the bodies, the walls 
           painted in blood. Opens his mouth to YELL--

           INT. MOSCOW / ALLEY - NIGHT

           Rooney and Jack strip their uniforms, black clothes underneath.

                                 STONE
                        Well done.

           Stone moves to kiss Rooney. She puts her hand in his face.

           AGAIN, IN BRIGHT NEON COLORS -- ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 7

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           ROONEY and TOM stroll through a park, holding hands.

           EXT. CRUISE SHIP / DECK - NIGHT

           A cruise ship, out to sea. On deck, men drinking, socializing. 
           They all have short-cropped hair. An OLD DUDE locks eyes with 
           a group of friends. Instead of waving he does a heil Hitler. 
           Bunch of Nazi motherfuckers.

                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O.
                        Nathanial Rutger’s operation. Rented 
                        it out for what intel tells us is a 
                        planning retreat. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERKOWITZ - V.O. (CONT'D)
                        Looking to strategically target three 
                        majority black elementary schools in 
                        Alabama.

           ROONEY, in a service uniform, carries a tray of drinks. She 
           looks up. Makes eye contact with a black woman, LAURA (40s), 
           MOPPING the deck. A nod between the two of them.

                                 ROONEY - V.O.
                        Boat full of Nazis. Got it.

           Rooney pivots. Locks eyes with a Latina woman, KAY (20s), 
           holding a tray of hors d'oeuvres. They nod at one another.

           The song CHANGES-- and Rooney, Laura and Kay fly into action. 
           Laura STABS an old skinhead in the throat with her mop, then 
           pulls an automatic pistol from her apron and starts shooting.

           Rooney and Kay drop their trays-- revealing GUNS held beneath 
           them. They spin, firing--

           EXT. CRUISE SHIP / DECK - LATER

           The deck is a fucking Ghost Ship-level massacre (if anybody 
           hasn’t seen the opening scene from Ghost Ship, check it out). 

           Rooney, Laura and Kay descend the ship on a ladder and get 
           into a SMALL DINGHY. They race away from the cruise ship.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 19

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A fancy restaurant. Tom and Rooney. A waiter delivers two 
           flutes of champagne. Rooney sips hers. Tom STOPS her. She 
           looks into the glass-- an ENGAGEMENT RING floats inside.

           EXT. SWISS ALPS - MORNING

           Fuck if it isn’t gorgeous here, mountains and trees and a 
           light dusting of snow under the crisp, clear fall air. 

           We follow a RENTAL CAR as it winds its way up a mountain 
           road. Far away from any semblance of real civilization.

           IN THE CAR -- AN ELDERLY COUPLE.

           In the road ahead, A CONSTRUCTION ZONE. The highway closed 
           off. Two CONSTRUCTION WORKERS stand watch.
           The first construction worker holds up a STOP sign as the 
           elderly couple approaches. They draw to a stop. The 
           construction worker leans down as they roll down their window.

           The elderly couple have American accents -- the construction 
           worker, a thick German accent.

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        How are the two of you doing today?

                                 OLD MAN
                        We heard there was a town this way?

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        Road’s closed. Avalanche conditions. 
                        You’ll have to go back through 
                        Zermatt, come up the back way. But I 
                        wouldn’t do it in this car.

           MOMENTS LATER -- The elderly couple’s car drives BACK DOWN 
           THE MOUNTAIN in the direction it came from. The construction 
           worker watches them go.

           We PUSH PAST the construction zone. Moving towards the LITTLE 
           TOWN that lies beyond it. To the side of the road, a sign--

           A rainbow. Words in German and translated below -- “WELCOME 
           TO SUNNYVALE. EST. 1609. POPULATION 2,142. ENJOY YOUR STAY!”

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           QUICK CUTS from around the town.

           For a quaint little town nestled in the mountains of the 
           Swiss Alps, it’s about what you’d expect. Cute, small, old, 
           everything built from wood. We recognize it, a little-- the 
           same Swiss village from earlier, four hundred years later.

           People walking their dogs on the streets. A couple motels. A 
           bowling alley. An old fashioned diner.

           AERIAL SHOTS show us the unusual geography of this place.

           There are only two roads in and out of town. First the one the 
           old couple came in on, on the WEST side of town.

           The other road, on the EAST side of town, looks treacherous-- 
           it’s a skinny two-lane highway that passes between a half-
           mile section where TWO CLIFF WALLS tower on either side.

           The whole town, nestled into a little valley in between all 
           of this, seems to be built on TWO LEVELS, an upper section 
           and a lower section. 
           We PUSH IN on the residential section of Sunnyvale. On one of 
           the cute little houses.

           INT. PINE’S HOUSE / BEDROOM - DAY

           White sheets. Two beautiful people, a man, PINE (20s), and a 
           woman, KATIE (20s), lie in bed. Soft, peaceful, romantic--

                                 KATIE
                        I have to get up. I have to pee.

           Pine sleepily throws his arm around her, holding her down.

           Katie has an American accent -- with some German edges to it. 
           Pine has a HEAVY SOUTHERN ACCENT. Like Dukes of Hazard heavy.

                                 PINE
                        Noooooo. Stayyyyyy.

                                 KATIE
                        Pine.

           Pine relents. He lifts his arm. Katie gets to her feet, walks 
           towards the bathroom. PINE sits up. Kind features, warm eyes.

           KATIE returns. She stands in the doorway.

                                 PINE
                        You shouldn’t have to do this 
                        anymore. You’re his daughter.

           No response from Katie.

            PINE (CONT'D)
           Just promise me that you’re 
           gonna--
                               KATIE
                        I’m gonna be okay.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mommmmmyyyyyy!!!!

           A YOUNG GIRL, EVE (6), runs into the room and wraps her arms 
           around Katie’s waist. Katie kisses her on the head.

                                 EVE
                        Do you have to go?

                                 KATIE
                        Unfortunately, sweetie, but I’ll be 
                        back soon.

                                 PINE
                        I’ll still be here!
           Eve looks at him, sticks out her tongue.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna make me cry.

           Eve runs towards Pine, JUMPS onto the bed. He grabs her, 
           starts tickling her. She SHRIEKS.

           EXT. PINE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The three of them step out onto the porch.

           A CAR idles in the driveway. A DRIVER waiting. Pine and Katie 
           kiss. Katie picks Eve up and plants a kiss on her cheek. 
           Katie enters the car. It departs. Pine and Eve watch her go.

                                 EVE
                        I’m sad.

                                 PINE
                        Me too.

               EVE
                               PINE
           Do I still have to go to 
           school--
                        Yes.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           Pine walks, now wearing blue coveralls and a baseball cap. He 
           whistles as he walks past a row of shops. Then past a CHURCH.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A PASTOR (60s) gives a sermon to his congregation. A NASTY 
           SCAR criss-crosses the left side of his face. The pews are 
           full. Everyone listens with rapt attention. PINE steps 
           inside. He stands by the door and listens.

           The Pastor delivers his sermon with a THICK GERMAN ACCENT.

                                 THE PASTOR
                        ...and we will realize that God 
                        always delivers us opportunities. 
                        Sometimes when we least expect them.

           The Pastor notices Pine standing by the door. He smiles.

                                 THE PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        Like delivering the Godless Pine 
                        Morrow to our sermon on this fine 
                        morning. What brings you this way?
           The congregation turns to look at Pine. Warm smiles.

                                 PINE
                        Thought I’d see if I could glean 
                        any wisdom by poking my head in.

                                 THE PASTOR
                        And?

                                 PINE
                        Not today. Pardon the interruption.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Pine steps to the counter, tosses down a Cliff Bar. Behind the 
           counter, a KINDLY OLDER CLERK (60s). She looks up, smiles.

                                 CLERK
                        Pine! How are you?

                                 PINE
                        Fine and dandy.

           Pine pays, leaves. The clerk bends down, looks under the 
           counter. A SHOTGUN strapped there, easily reachable. Good.

           INT. / EXT. PINE’S AUTO SHOP - DAY

           Pine walks into an AUTO-MECHANIC GARAGE. The lights FLIP ON. 
           Pine walks to the counter, steps behind it.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           Outside. People on the streets. People walking their dogs. A 
           perfectly normal motherfucking normal-ass town.

                                  BLACK.

           EXT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           An upper-middle class home in the suburbs of Chicago.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / BEDROOM - DAY

           Rooney and Tom’s WEDDING PHOTOS on the wall. Rooney sits in 
           bed. Her PHONE buzzes on the bedside table.

           She stands, picks it up, looks at it. The Caller ID simply 
           tells us it’s “WORK.” Rooney hesitates--
           Then sets the phone down, opens the TOP DRAWER of the bedside 
           table and pulls out--

           THE MUSIC BOX. She handles it carefully, looks at it. On the 
           table, the phone stops buzzing.

           TOM walks into the room. He comes up behind Rooney, wraps his 
           arms around her and kisses her on the cheek.

           The phone BUZZES again-- the notification tells us somebody’s 
           left a VOICEMAIL. Tom clocks it.

                                 TOM
                        Where are they sending you this 
                        time?

                                 ROONEY
                        I don’t know yet.

                                 TOM
                        Have you thought more about asking 
                        for a transfer? Be nice to have you 
                        around more.

                                 ROONEY
                        I don’t know yet.

           Tom kisses her cheek again and walks out of the room. 

           The phone BEGINS TO BUZZ again. Rooney places the music box 
           back into the drawer-- and picks up the phone.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY

           We PUSH IN on the boarded up window of a run-down high-rise.

           INT. RIO DE JANEIRO / HIGH RISE - DAY

           This floor appears to be an abandoned construction zone, 
           exposed pillars and rebar. Rooney rests the stabilizing bipod 
           of a Remington MSR sniper rifle on the old radiator, puts her 
           eye to the sight, and looks through the window.

           On the floor beside her, a Kombucha and Eugene Thacker’s In 
           the Dust of This Planet. She talks into an earpiece.

                                 ROONEY
                        You never told me what this guy did.
                                 BERKOWITZ - EARPIECE
                        And you didn’t always think to ask.

           P.O.V. OF RIFLE -- A metro train cuts through the city below. 
           Rooney aims at the car, then counts her way back. One two 
           three four five-- she stops on the sixth car and TRACKS IT.

           IN THE TRAIN CAR-- A young child. A pregnant woman. Not what 
           we’re looking for. Then there he is, slumped against one 
           window, a schlubby dude who also happens to be our TARGET. 

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m about to shoot at a train car 
                        with children and a pregnant woman. 
                        I’m allowed to know why we’re 
                        taking this risk.

                                 BERKOWITZ - EARPIECE
                        Name Marcus Reyes ring a bell? 
                        Guyanese Presidential candidate. 
                        This is the guy who hacked his 
                        computer, leaked pictures of him, 
                        threw the election for the other 
                        party, now their economy is fucked 
                        beyond unfucking.

                                 ROONEY
                        We’re killing him because he hacked 
                        a political candidate?

                                 BERKOWITZ - EARPIECE
                        Rooney.

                                 ROONEY
                        And here I remember when we killed 
                        Nazis, Russians and terrorists.

                                 BERKOWITZ - EARPIECE
                        People died because of his actions, 
                        we don’t know where he’ll go next.

                                 ROONEY
                        Because of how people voted, not--

                                 BERKOWITZ - EARPIECE
                        Getting second thoughts about our 
                        line of work?

           P.O.V. OF RIFLE -- The scope over the man’s head. She leads 
           it a little. Hesitates another beat. And--

                                 ROONEY
                        I can’t.
                                 BERKOWITZ - PHONE
                        Goddamnit, Rooney--

           P.O.V. OF RIFLE -- Rooney swings her scope away from the 
           train, towards the SURROUNDING BUILDINGS. As she’s about to 
           look away from the scope-- SHE GLIMPSES SOMETHING.

           Fuck, in the next high-rise over-- ANOTHER PERSON with a 
           sniper rifle. It’s trained on Rooney.

           Rooney has barely any time-- just enough to turn her head. 
           POP! A little flash in the window of that other building--

           WE TRACK THE BULLET IN SLOW MOTION. It spins through the air. 
           It pierces THROUGH one of the boards over Rooney’s window.

           In the room now. The bullet speeds towards Rooney, still in the 
           process of turning away from the window. She faces parallel to 
           it. The bullet nears her face. It’s totally gonna hit her--

           It does.

           Her mouth is open in a yell. The bullet passes THROUGH her 
           left cheek, and then EXITS through her right cheek.

           RESUME NORMAL SPEED.

           Rooney collapses to the ground-- but is back up quickly. Two 
           holes in her cheeks, from which blood gushes, but remarkably 
           her head is still intact. She wastes no time, she looks back 
           through the sight, aims the gun quickly, sees it--

           The OTHER PERSON still in the window. For one moment, we get 
           a clear look at her face. It’s KATIE-- Pine’s lovely lady. 
           Katie turns away from the window.

           Rooney SHOOTS. Her bullet takes Katie in the back. Katie 
           stumbles, pivots-- and COLLAPSES OUT THE WINDOW. She plummets 
           towards that sweet, sweet Rio De Janeiro sidewalk.

           Rooney watches Katie fall. The bottom half of her face SOAKED 
           IN BLOOD. Then she opens her mouth and YELLS. The sounds that 
           come out are half audible, half gargling noise.

                                 BERKOWITZ - PHONE (CONT’D)
                        Rooney?

           INT. HIGH RISE / STAIRWELL - DAY

           Rooney runs down the stairwell, hands clutched to her face. 
           Blood GUSHES out of her, dying her skin, her clothes red.
           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO / STREETS - DAY

           Rooney runs toward the street, hand in the air as she 
           attempts to hail a taxi. One SCREECHES to a stop. The taxi 
           driver takes one look at her-- and PEELS OFF.

                                 ROONEY
                        Motherfucker.

           It comes out sounding like, “Mmmrrrffuck.” Rooney stumbles off.

           SUPERIMPOSE -- ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 20

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Rooney opens her eyes. She lies in a hospital bed. The bottom  
           half of her face is covered in gauze. She GROANS weakly. A 
           DOCTOR (60s) stands over her.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Welcome back.

           All Rooney’s words come out muffled through the gauze.

                                 ROONEY
                        I-- You’re American?

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re in Chicago. Where did you 
                        think you were?

           Rooney looks out the window. The Chicago skyline, indeed. The 
           doctor exits. BERKOWITZ walks in. He examines the gauze.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        One bullet? Through both cheeks?

                                 ROONEY
                        What am I gonna tell Tom?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Tell him the truth. You got shot. 
                        In an alley somewhere.

                                 ROONEY
                        Think he’ll buy it?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        They always do. The first time.

           Berkowitz sits on the bed. Sighs.
                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        I should have told you. This isn’t 
                        the first time this has happened. 
                        Them, whoever they are, they keep 
                        popping up. At our jobs.

                                 ROONEY
                        And you didn’t.. tell me? You 
                        didn’t think that was something I 
                        should fucking know?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Kay put one down in Norway, Stone 
                        dropped one in Prague. Hoped it was 
                        done. Now I think it’s some other 
                        organization, trying to take us out. 
                        Either way. We’ll need you out there. 
                        Help us get to the bottom of this.

           He puts his hand on her arm, stands to go.

                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        Look. You choked. It happens to 
                        everyone. Few months, you think, to 
                        get back on your feet?

                                 ROONEY
                        Berkowitz. I’m fucking out.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Think I might be mishearing you 
                        through all that gauze. You never 
                        back down. From anything. Not in your 
                        whole life. That’s why I chose you.

                                 ROONEY
                        This isn’t what it used to be. I 
                        have a husband now. And we used to 
                        kill people who needed to be killed--

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        The world doesn’t work in blacks 
                        and whites, it never did, don’t 
                        pretend we were paragons of 
                        morality before. Nothing’s changed.

                                 ROONEY
                        A lot has changed.

           Berkowitz paces towards the door. Then turns back.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        You think I’ve never thought about 
                        getting out? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERKOWITZ (CONT'D)
                        Disappear to Hawaii, spend the rest 
                        of my life drinking beer on a cliff, 
                        watching the sunset?

                                 ROONEY
                        Why don’t you?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Because. That’s not how this works. 
                        There is no “getting out,” not after 
                        the things we’ve done. Sooner or 
                        later, someone will come knocking.

                                 ROONEY
                        And I’ll be ready. I’m fucking done. 
                        Berkowitz. If this keeps-- my family-- 
                        if I don’t stop-- I’m done.

           He looks at her for a long moment.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Well then. Thank you for your 
                        service.

           He walks out. The door swings shut behind him.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Rooney walks in, kicks the door shut behind her.

                                 ROONEY
                        Tom?

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rooney walks into the living room. Tom lies on the couch 
           reading Freedom, the Franzen book.

                                 ROONEY
                        Don’t freak out.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / BATHROOM - LATER

           Rooney stands in front of the mirror looking at her bandages. 

           Tom stands near the door, covering his eyes and looking away.

                                 ROONEY
                        Tom, I need help--
                                 TOM
                        Those bastards, a fucking alley?! 
                        Why were you in an alley, were you 
                        peeing? Rooney, be honest with me, 
                        were you peeing in an alley? It’s 
                        not embarrassing.

              ROONEY
                             TOM (CONT'D)
           Tom--
                        I’m serious, I can’t look, 
                        it’s too gross!

                                 ROONEY
                        About to get a whole lot grosser.

           She rips the gauze off her left cheek. It really is gross. 
           The stitches look gnarly as fuck. The caked blood and dried 
           puss give the vibe that this wound will never heal.

               TOM
                            ROONEY (CONT'D)
           Oh God.
                        Tom!

                                 TOM
                        I-- No, it looks fine.

                                 ROONEY
                        Double down?

                                 TOM
                        What?

           She rips the gauze off the second cheek.

            TOM (CONT'D)
                              ROONEY
           Ah!
                        Tom!

           Rooney dabs hydrogen peroxide onto the wound. Tom makes a 
           sound like he’s throwing up in his throat.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Tom. It feels ridiculous that I’m 
                        the one saying this to you at this 
                        moment. But... it’s gonna be okay 
                        now. It’s all gonna be fine.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           A PLUME OF DARK SMOKE rises from the center of Sunnyvale. 

           A gathering of a FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE. They stand in a ring 
           around a WIDE PIT. A FIRE burns furiously in the pit.

           The crowd watches as a metal platform WHIRS, lowering a SIX-
           FOOT LONG WOODEN BOX into the depths of the fire pit. 
           Everyone in the crowd somber, stoic. A few figures stand out.

           A YOUNG WOMAN (25) in a polka dot sundress. She’s adorable. 
           Pink, rosy cheeks. This is a face we’ll remember.

           A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE who look like they just came from a 
           restaurant-- wearing aprons, and fry-cook uniforms.

           A GNARLED OLD MAN holding a pair of nun-chucks. On each 
           handle, a smiley face. That’s familiar.

           The PASTOR from the Church.

           Also visible-- PINE and EVE. Tears streaming down both of 
           their cheeks as they watch the flames lick up around the box. 

           Front and center, ahead of everyone, an INTENSE, WILLEM 
           DAFOE, MADS MIKKELSEN-LOOKING MOTHERFUCKER. He stands so 
           close the fire must be burning him.

           This is MAYOR ELIAS MULLER-- AKA THE MAYOR (60) OF SUNNYVALE.

           The light from the flames dances off his face. The Mayor takes 
           one last look down into the fire. The flames DEVOURING the 
           box. The CLERK from the convenience store steps towards him.

                                 CLERK
                        So sorry. She was a lovely girl.

           The Mayor looks ACROSS the fire pit. He locks eyes with PINE. 
           Pine nods slightly. The Mayor nods back.

           A man sporting what is clearly a PROSTHETIC NOSE, puts a hand 
           on the Mayor’s shoulder, whispers into his ear. The Mayor 
           nods. Resumes staring into the fire.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / BEDROOM - MORNING

           Rooney and Tom lie in bed.

           The scars on Rooney’s cheeks are healing-- but still 
           noticeable. They always will be.

           Rooney stirs. Tom, eyes closed, GROANS, reaches a hand out 
           and grabs one of her breasts.

                                 ROONEY
                        Morning.

                                 TOM
                        I would like it stated that I was 
                        trying to grab your shoulder, not 
                        your boob.
           He touches her cheek gently.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        They’re healing well.

                                 ROONEY
                        They’re hideous.

           He kisses her on the cheek, on the scar.

                                 TOM
                        No they’re not.

           Rooney smiles.

                                 ROONEY
                        How long until they start getting 
                        here?

                                 TOM
                        A few hours. Enough time to prep 
                        some meals so my Mom doesn’t--

           The doorbell rings.

            TOM (CONT'D)
                              ROONEY
           You’re kidding.
                        Oh fuck off.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / FOYER - MINUTES LATER

           Rooney and Tom, bleary eyed, open the door. BETH (60s) stands 
           on the front porch.

              THOMAS
                               BETH
           Morning Mom--
                        Sweeheart.

           Beth throws her eyes around Tom, hugs him vigorously, then 
           lets go and extends her cheek for Rooney to kiss. Rooney does.

                                 ROONEY
                        Guess the drive was a little 
                        quicker than anticipated?

              BETH
           What is she talking about?
                               TOM
                        We thought you were getting 
                        here this afternoon.

                                 BETH
                        And let you do all the cooking 
                        yourself? Especially with this one 
                        as your only helper, I-- Rooney, I 
                        don’t mean to needle, you have many 
                        wonderful skills but--
                                 ROONEY
                        I get it. Come on in.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Tom and Beth load a pie into the oven. Rooney, on the couch 
           in the living room, looks in at them and smiles. 

           DING! The doorbell again. Rooney’s head slumps back.

                                  BLACK.

           EXT. BERLIN - NIGHT

           KAY, who we recognize from the Nazi boat, walks down the 
           street. It’s dark. Nobody around. She pulls her coat tight 
           around her. Looks over her shoulder. Nobody there. She goes 
           to her car. Gets in. Starts the ignition--

           BOOM! The flames gobble up the oxygen of the quiet night.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           LAURA, also from the boat, sleeps. A DARK FIGURE approaches 
           her. Pillow in hand. He brings it down over her face. SHE 
           KICKS, STRUGGLES. No dice.

           INT. HOTEL / ROOM - NIGHT

           JACK STONE reclines on a hotel bed in satin boxers. A KNOCK.

                                 STONE
                        It’s open.

           The door creaks open. A woman enters. We recognize her. She’s 
           the adorable, polka-dot sundress-wearing woman from Katie’s 
           funeral. Now wearing a trench coat.

                                 STONE (CONT’D)
                        I was expecting somebody of the 
                        more, er, oriental variety.

           She throws off her trench coat. What she’s wearing underneath 
           can only be described as “Hot damn, gentlemen, am I right?”

                                 STONE (CONT’D)
                        But you’ll do.

           She comes to him. Straddles him. They start making out. He 
           puts his hand on her breast.
                                 WOMAN
                        Mmmmm.

           As he gropes her, she reaches up. Her hair is bound into a 
           pun with TWO PENCILS. She PULLS THEM OUT. Sharp.

           Then she JAMS A PENCIL into the underside of Stone’s chin. 
           His head flies back. She JAMS the other pencil into his ear.

           His teeth NASH SHUT. He SPASMS, but she holds him in place. 
           His eyes are wide. Still kind-of alive. She looks down.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Huh. Still hard.

           She pulls down his boxers, and her panties, and PUTS HIM 
           INSIDE HER. She rides him. She fucking rides him, using the 
           pencils, still STICKING OUT OF HIM, as handles.

           She MOANS, LOUDER AND LOUDER, as blood dribbles from Stone’s 
           nose, mouth and ears.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house bustles with TWENTY PEOPLE. Tom, Rooney, Beth, a few 
           dudes who must be TOM’S BROTHERS, their WIVES, other assorted 
           ADULTS, and four YOUNG GIRLS who run around, screaming.

           Rooney and Tom stand in a circle with CHET (30s), one of 
           Tom’s brothers and also a douche, and CHET’S WIFE-- he has 
           his arm around her. Chet points at Tom.

                                 CHET
                        Come on! Just give me a number!

                                 TOM
                        I’m not gonna-- no! We’re not kids 
                        with paper routes anymore, we don’t 
                        have to compete about who brings 
                        more money home on a given day--

                                 CHET
                        Roons, come on, that fancy  
                        government job must have coughed up 
                        after the accident, right?

               TOM
                              ROONEY
           Come on, man!
                        I--

           Rooney’s phone BUZZES in her pocket. She takes it out, looks 
           at the screen. Incoming call from “Work.”
                                 TOM
                        What is it?

                                 ROONEY
                        Nothing. Back in a second.

           Rooney pushes into the KITCHEN and puts the phone to her ear.

                                 BERKOWITZ - PHONE
                        Brown.

                                 ROONEY
                        Berkowitz? Why the fuck are you 
                        calling me?

                                 BERKOWITZ - PHONE
                        You have to run. They’re coming.

                                 ROONEY
                        Berkowitz?

                                 BERKOWITZ - PHONE
                        They’re picking us off, they got 
                        everyone. Take your family and run. 
                        They’re coming for me too, I don’t 
                        have much time, I--

           A muffled THUMP from the other end of the call--

           And the line goes dead. Rooney looks at the phone-- then RUNS 
           into the living room. People gathered around in different 
           groups of conversation.

              BETH

           EVERYBODY LISTEN!
                               BETH
                        --just ridiculous, I’m just 
                        trying to get some pot pies--

           Everyone quiets down, looks at her. One of the OTHER LITTLE 
           GIRLS (6) notes her concern.

                                 OTHER LITTLE GIRL
                        What’s wrong, Aunt Rooney?

                                 ROONEY
                        We-- We have to go. I, um--

                               TOM
                        Honey?
            ROONEY (CONT’D)
           That was the gas company on 
           the phone-- 
                                 ROONEY
                        --we need to get out of here, it’s--

                                 BETH
                        Get out of here, where are we 
                        going? We haven’t even had fucking 
                        cake yet, the cake I slaved over--

               TOM
                              ROONEY
                        EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP!
           Hey, language, around the 
           kids--

              BETH
                            ROONEY (CONT'D)
           What--
                        You too, Beth. Shut your 
                        fucking mouth.

           That certainly does it. Everyone looks at her.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        You all need to listen to me, for 
                        once. We need to get out of here, and 
                        we need to go now. No questions. I’ll 
                        explain later. We just all need to 
                        move towards the door.

           All quiet for a few moments. Then--

                                 BETH
                        Alright, alright, we’re--

           GUNFIRE. Windows shatter. Half of Beth’s face BLOWS OFF.

           Bullets pepper the walls, the furniture. People tumbling, 
           blood spraying. Tom, in the middle of it, is frozen. Rooney 
           sprints towards him, TACKLES HIM to the ground.

           They land on the floor behind the couch, Rooney on top of 
           Tom. They look around wildly. QUICK CUTS of what they see--

           Their relatives, their loved ones lie dead on the ground. Two 
           of the little girls in a pile, one on top of another.

           Bullets still fly, from where it’s hard to tell, it’s all 
           happening so fast. People still falling all around them. 
           Rooney rolls off of Tom. He looks at her.

           His face, there’s no way to describe his expression, what 
           he’s seeing would be impossible for any person to comprehend.

                                 TOM
                        R-Rooney? What’s happening?

                                 ROONEY
                        Tom, we have to stay down.
                                 TOM
                        Is this-- What’s happening? I-- I 
                        have to see if my Mom’s okay, I--

           Tom pushes himself to his feet. A bullet rips through his 
           head. He falls forwards onto his face. Rooney grabs Tom’s 
           body and pulls him back over to her. One eye is missing. 

           In shock, Rooney plants a kiss on his lips. AS SHE’S KISSING 
           HIM, she sees, over his shoulder--

           A MAN WITH A GUN walking around the couch. Nothing to do but-- 
           Rooney PULLS TOM’S BODY OVER HER and falls to the ground.

           The gunman WALKS PAST. Rooney LURCHES OUT, pulls him to the 
           ground. His arm SPLAYS OUT as he falls. Rooney JERKS the gun 
           out of his hand and shoots him twice in the side of the head.

           She glances back. FIVE MASKED MEN moving towards her.

           All the doors too far away, the only close escape-- THE 
           STAIRCASE. Rooney BREAKS FOR IT. She SPINS back around as she 
           moves, fires into the living room. TWO OF THE MEN go down.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Rooney ducks around a corner. ONE OF THE MEN runs past. 
           Rooney POPS HIM in the side of the head. MORE FOOTSTEPS 
           approaching. She DUCKS into an open door.

           INT. ROONEY'S HOUSE / BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney pushes through into her BEDROOM. BULLET HOLES have 
           pierced the windows and walls. Rooney moves to the corridor 
           of floor between the bed and wall. She slumps down. 

           Tears, snot running, she runs her hands through her hair, 
           looks around, trying to make sense of it, trying to make 
           sense of all of it, heart beating audibly.

           She glances at the BEDSIDE TABLE. Just looks at it for a long 
           second. Then she yanks it open and pulls out THE MUSIC BOX. A 
           BULLET has torn through its side.

                                 ROONEY
                        No, no--

           She opens the music box. AS BEFORE, the glass ballerina rises 
           and begins to spin. As she spins, the upper third of her body 
           cracks off and falls to the ground.
           The music that comes out of the box is warped, distorted. A 
           fucked-up, haunted melody.

           Rooney SHUTS THE BOX and clutches it to her chest. Eyes 
           closed, tears seeping through. Then her eyes OPEN.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE / UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Rooney-- backpack now slung over her shoulder-- steps out 
           into the hallway. No longer shaking. Tears, drying.

           The two men TURN TOWARDS HER. She raises her gun, POPS one of 
           them in the face, DUCKING as the other one PUTS A BULLET 
           where she WAS seconds ago, she comes up in front of him, gun 
           under his chin, BANG, paints the ceiling with his brains.

           INT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rooney walks back down the stairs back into the living room. 
           She looks around. The girls. Beth. Tom, half his face gone. 
           SOMETHING MOVES in the periphery of her vision, one of the 
           men PUSHING HIMSELF off the ground.

           Rooney DIVES TOWARDS HIM. She PUNCHES HIM. He collapses to 
           the ground. She points her gun at his face. He looks up at 
           her, only his eyes visible through the mask.

                                 ROONEY
                        Get up.

           She grabs him and drags him to his feet. Half-conscious, he 
           stumbles along beside her as she drags him into the kitchen.

           EXT. ROONEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They kick through the door, exiting the side of the house. 
           Rooney prods the man with her rifle as they move.

           EXT. CHICAGO / SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           They stumble down the sidewalk, keeping to the shadows. In 
           the background, SIRENS grow louder. RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH 
           as police cars and ambulances RACE BY. Once they’re gone--

                                 MASKED MAN 
                        Just kill me now.

                                 ROONEY
                        Not how this works.
           EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT

           AN UBER rolls down the street. It pulls up to the curb. 
           Rooney, still dragging the masked man, opens the door.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           The DRIVER, an awkward nineteen-year-old, glances back.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Did you guys see those cop--

           He gets a good look at them. Rooney, covered in blood, 
           holding a gun on the masked man.

          UBER DRIVER (CONT’D)
           Jesus--
                              ROONEY
                        There’s another gun aimed at 
                        your back, drive or I’ll put 
                        a bullet in your spine.

           The kid hesitates-- then the car TAKES OFF.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 25

           EXT. CHICAGO / GHETTO - NIGHT

           The car pulls to the curb in a seedy section of Chicago.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           The kid puts the car into park. Rooney holds up her phone.

                                 ROONEY
                        I have your name and your license 
                        number. Tell anyone about this, it 
                        won’t take me long to find you. 

             UBER DRIVER
                            ROONEY (CONT'D)
           Please--
                        LISTEN. I’ll kill you, but 
                        not before I kill your 
                        parents, siblings, any pets 
                        you might have, right down to 
                        the fucking goldfish. Or you 
                        can keep quiet. Got it?

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rooney kicks open the door of a large ABANDONED WAREHOUSE and 
           drags the masked man inside. A COUPLE TWEAKERS shoot up in a 
           corner. They look up. Rooney aims the gun at them.
                                 ROONEY
                        Get out.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Rooney THROWS the masked man to the ground in a corner of the 
           warehouse. He GROANS as he hits the ground.

                                 ROONEY
                        Look at me.

           Rooney puts the tip of the rifle under his chin, directs his 
           gaze towards her. With her free hand, she reaches out and 
           PULLS the mask off his head.

           We know him-- it’s the PASTOR from Sunnyvale, recognizable by 
           the SCAR that runs across one side of his face.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Good. I want you to look me in the 
                        eyes. Because I want to see what it 
                        feels like. To die.

           She PULLS the trigger. It CLICKS empty. The Pastor SQUEEZES 
           his eyes shut before realizing he’s still alive.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Just kidding. This thing’s been 
                        empty since back at the house.

           She SWINGS IT, cracking him across the face again.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        You are gonna die tonight. Your 
                        choice is whether it happens 
                        quickly, or slowly.

           Rooney strolls across the warehouse, leaving the Pastor in a 
           heap on the floor. His eyes closed.

           The sound of Rooney’s feet padding back towards him.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Open your eyes.

           He does. Rooney holds, in her hand, A RUSTY METAL SPOON. What 
           the TWEAKERS were using to smoke crack out of.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have any knives, or guns. But 
                        I think this should do the trick. 
                        You’re not gonna try to run, are you?
           Rooney STOMPS on his kneecap. He HOWLS in pain. Rooney grabs 
           his face, leans down, pulls it close to hers.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. Look at me.

           Rooney SLICES the edge of the spoon across his cheek, flaying 
           his skin open. He SCREAMS again.

            ROONEY (CONT’D)
           Tell me the name of your 
           organization.
                              PASTOR
                        Oh God in heaven, my lord and 
                        savior--

           Rooney SLICES his other cheek open.

                                 ROONEY
                        Religious, huh? Maybe I’ll carve a 
                        couple swastikas into your face, 
                        see how you like that.

            ROONEY (CONT’D)
                              PASTOR
                        I can’t--
           Tell me the name of your 
           organization.

           Rooney JAMS the spoon INTO the cut on his right cheek and 
           TWISTS IT. He SCREAMS.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Rooney has done a number on this motherfucker. In such a way 
           that he’s still very much ALIVE and CONSCIOUS. Little cuts 
           all over his body. Pieces of skin hanging in flaps. She 
           kneels over him. He breathes heavily.

                                 ROONEY
                        Fuck. Sitting like this is killing my 
                        back. It would really be a lot easier 
                        if you just talked, you know that?
               (beat)
                        Normally I’m not one for this sadistic 
                        shit. But my family died tonight. So. 
                        I think it’s only fair that you tell 
                        me what I want to know.

           The Pastor only looks at her. Pure hatred in his eyes.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        There’s one thing we haven’t tried.

           Rooney reaches for the crotch of the Pastor’s pants. Grabs 
           the zipper. Zip.
                                 PASTOR
                        No.

                                 ROONEY
               (mocking)
                        “No. No.” Your fucking face is 
                        hanging in four pieces, but “Oh, no, 
                        not my dick. Please, not my dick.”

           Rooney grabs the Pastor’s pants, yanks them down around his 
           thighs. Everything blood-stained. She reaches for his boxers.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Not a briefs guy?

           She pulls them down. For posterity’s sake, let’s stay above 
           the waist from here on out. Our imaginations can do the rest.

            ROONEY (CONT’D)
                              PASTOR
           Tell me the name of your 
           organization.
                        I can’t--

           SQWIRP, that’s the fleshy slicing sound that we hear as she, 
           PRESUMABLY, drags the sharpened edge of the spoon across the 
           surface of his dick.

              ROONEY
                              PASTOR
           Tell me the name of your--
                        SUNNYVALE! SUNNYVALE!

              ROONEY
           Sunnyvale? That’s the name of 
           your--
                              PASTOR
                        It’s... Where. I’m... From...

                                 ROONEY
                        What. Do. You. Mean?

                                 PASTOR
                        I-- I can’t. I have a family. You 
                        can’t hurt my family.

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m not gonna hurt your family. I 
                        don’t hurt innocent people. I’m 
                        gonna kill everyone in your 
                        organization, no more and no less.

                                 PASTOR
                        You don’t understand.

           SQWIRPTHHP she SLICES the spoon across his dick again.

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        IT’S A TOWN! IT’S THE TOWN I’M FROM!
                                 ROONEY
                        Where you’re based out of? Where is it?

           The Pastor speaks between sobs. Glances down at his dick.

                                 PASTOR
                        The Swiss Alps. Forty miles North of 
                        Zermatt. We are Sunnyvale. 2,000 
                        people. We are all the organization.

           Rooney swallows hard. She puts a finger under his chin and 
           tilts his head to look her in the eyes.

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m gonna ask some clarifying 
                        questions. You’re gonna answer them. 
                        You’re saying there’s a town, and 
                        everyone who lives there, is--

           The Pastor SPITS blood in Rooney’s face.

                                 PASTOR
                        Every one of them a killer that 
                        could end your life in a heartbeat.

                                 ROONEY
                        The kids?

                                 PASTOR
                        In training.

                                 ROONEY
                        The elderly?

                                 PASTOR
                        Retired. And the rest of us. We have 
                        jobs, all of us. Keeping the gears 
                        turning. When one of us leaves for an 
                        assignment, the others fill in.

                                 ROONEY
                        That’s fucking crazy.

                                 PASTOR
                        And yet. It’s worked. For five 
                        hundred years. Hiding in plain sight.

                                 ROONEY
                        Who do you-- Who do you work for?

                                 PASTOR
                        Whoever pays. Like your own government. 
                        Whitewater was too traceable. So they 
                        set you up, for us to pick you off. 
                                 ROONEY
                        So you killed all of us? Our families?

                                 PASTOR
                        Just your family. Penance for 
                        shooting his daughter. Our leader’s. 
                        Our Mayor’s. In Rio.

                                 ROONEY
                        Only after she gave me these fucking 
                        scars-- I think it was justified. 
                        This Mayor. Tell me about him.

           The Pastor laughs. It comes out as a strange half-wheeze.

                                 PASTOR
                        The title is ceremonial. The position 
                        inherited. The last descendant of our 
                        first leader, four hundred years ago.

                                 ROONEY
                        Why do you stay, why has nobody 
                        tried to overthrow him?

                                 PASTOR
                        Leave? Nobody leaves, those who leave 
                        are tracked down and killed, their 
                        families disposed of. But. It’s a 
                        good life. Community, family, 
                        protection. We are trained from birth-
                        - our mortality rate is low. We are 
                        taken care of when we are old. Why 
                        would anybody want that to change?

           Rooney gets out her phone, brings up a map of Switzerland.

                                 ROONEY
                        Point to it. And I’ll spare your 
                        wife and children. Parents, too, if 
                        they’re there.

           The Pastor taps the map. Coordinates pop up.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        And... what was your job?

                                 PASTOR
                        I’m-- I was the Pastor.

                                 ROONEY
                        Don’t think that’s a little ironic?

                                 PASTOR
                        I suppose, I’m about to find out.
           Rooney brings the edge of the spoon to his throat.

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m gonna find this town. I’m gonna 
                        kill as many of your citizens as I 
                        can, so you can’t reform. And then 
                        I’m gonna blow your Mayor’s brains 
                        out. That’s what happens now.

                                 PASTOR
                        How will you know what my family--

           Rooney SLICES the spoon across his throat.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 26

           EXT. CHICAGO / PARK - EARLY MORNING

           A cute little park. Rooney walks to a patch of bushes and 
           trees, kneels down, starts to DIG with her bare hands. 

           She stops-- pulls a CANVAS BAG out of the dirt. She zips it 
           open, looks through it. CASH and FAKE PAPERWORK. A PASSPORT.

           EXT. SWITZERLAND / AIRPORT - DAY

           A plane lands. ROONEY disembarks.

           SUPERIMPOSE -- SWITZERLAND. 20 HOURS LATER.

           EXT. ZERMATT - DAY

           Rooney drives a rented Nissan Leaf drives through Zermatt. She 
           parks in front of a cute, quaint little bookstore.

           INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Rooney walks through the door, sunglasses on. She looks 
           around. No other customers in the store. Just a SKINNY DUDE 
           IN A BAND T-SHIRT behind the counter.

           Rooney walks to the counter, leans towards him.

                                 ROONEY
                        Do you have any 1849 printings of 
                        Moby Dick?

           MOMENTS LATER -- The employee flips the door sign to CLOSED. 
           He turns to Rooney, raises his finger as if to say “Aha.”
                                 BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE
                        June of 2015. You needed a rifle, 
                        when I gave you one you argued with 
                        me about the specs.

                                 ROONEY
                        Yeah. Sorry about that.

                                 BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE
                        Is alright. I like a woman who knows 
                        what she wants. That sounded less 
                        creepy in my head. Shall we get to 
                        the goods?

           INT. BOOKSTORE / BASEMENT - DAY

           Rooney and the employee descend a staircase into the basement.

           MOMENTS LATER -- The bookstore employee hits a button on the 
           wall. A WOODEN PANEL slides open. He walks around the room, 
           hitting other buttons on each wall, opening other hidden 
           compartments-- each dedicated to a specific type of weapon.

                                 BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE
                        Handguns. Rifles. Shotguns. Assorted 
                        other shit, see for yourself.

           She peers into the last cabinet. Smoke grenades, real 
           grenades, knives-- assorted other shit, indeed. Rooney points 
           to the final unopened cabinet behind him.

           He grins. Opens it. Various mechanical gadgetry inside. And 
           what looks to be a Goddamn rocket launcher.

                                 BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        If you’re interested, I’ll have to 
                        show you how to use it--

                                 ROONEY
                        I’m interested. In all of it.

           INT. BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Back upstairs. Rooney forks over massive bundles of cash. The 
           bookstore employee begins to leaf through it.

           INT. HOTEL / ROOM - NIGHT

           Rooney kneels over a BLUEPRINT of a small town. Pen in hand, 
           she circles things, crosses things out.
           When she’s done, she reaches into her backpack-- and pulls 
           out the music box. She kisses the lid of it.

           EXT. SWISS ALPS / MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

           Rooney’s Nissan Leaf winds its way up a mountain road.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           ROONEY drives. Hand on the gearshift, she swerves around a turn.  
           She glances into the backseat. It’s fucking FILLED WITH 
           WEAPONRY. Of every kind imaginable.

           Somebody yodelling on the radio. Rooney is cold, expressionless. 
           She reaches out, boops the radio to another channel.

           “Shake it off, shake it off--” She changes it again. Static. 
           She shuts it off.

           Ahead, THE CONSTRUCTION ZONE. Rooney’s face unreadable as she 
           nears it. The construction worker holds up a STOP sign and 
           motions for Rooney to roll down her window.

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        Hello, miss, how are you doing to--

           He looks at Rooney, sees she’s HOLING A HANDGUN IN HER LAP.

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Shit--

           He reaches for the GUN HOLSTER concealed behind his back--

           Rooney holds a handgun in her lap. Without her expression 
           changing in the slightest, she pulls the trigger.

           The bullet plants itself in the construction worker’s heart. 

           His words catch in his throat, and as a little flower of blood 
           begins to blossom on his shirt, he topples over backwards.

           In the road ahead, the SECOND CONSTRUCTION WORKER stands with 
           his back to Rooney. Hasn’t heard anything. Rooney lets her 
           foot off the gas. The car creeps forwards.

           Twenty-five feet from him. Fifteen. Ten. The construction 
           worker TURNS just as Rooney rolls past him. 

                                 SECOND CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        What--
           Rooney FIRES a second time. The bullet PINGS in through his 
           forehead and PONGS out through the back of his head. He 
           topples over backwards.

           Rooney stops the car and gets out. Behind her, a twist in the 
           road. Ahead, a downward-sloping hill. Nobody around.

           Rooney JOGS to the first man and pulls his body off the road. 
           She then JOGS to the second and does the same. She gets back 
           in her car and accelerates away from the scene.

           Off to the side of the road, the sign-- “Welcome to Sunnyvale.”

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 28

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           Rooney drives through Sunnyvale, taking in the layout.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

           Rooney drives through the residential area of Sunnyvale. 
           Baseball cap pulled low on her head.

           A few pedestrians walk the streets around her. She pulls over 
           behind what looks like an ABANDONED BUILDING. Backpack slung 
           over her back, she walks towards the facade.

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING / SECOND STORY - DAY

           Rooney kneels down-- screwing together METAL POLES.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / CITY HALL - DAY

           Rooney walks down the street-- a CARDBOARD BOX in her hand. 
           On the other side of the street -- “SUNNYVALE CITY HALL.”

           Looks exactly like any normal City Hall in any normal town.

           Nobody watching. Rooney reaches a trash can. She moves to 
           toss the box into it, but instead drops it into the bush 
           BEHIND the trash can. It SINKS into the green.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           Rooney drives down another street. 

           She stops next to a STORM DRAIN. Opens her door-- blocking 
           our view of whatever she’s doing-- then SLAMS the door shut.
           --Rooney repeats this process twice more, on two other 
           streets, stopping in front of storm drains, opening her door.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           Rooney passes a ROW OF SHOPS on the outskirt of town. 
           Isolated, few people on the streets. Good place to start.

           She pulls into the parking lot of the SAME CONVENIENCE STORE 
           Pine stopped in.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / CITY HALL - DAY

           Where Rooney was, minutes ago.

           INT. CITY HALL / SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT

           AGAINST ONE WALL, an electronic map of the town. MOVING RED 
           DOTS, one for each person in town. Other surveillance screens 
           display feeds from around town. TECHS man the equipment.

           A YOUNG TECH walks up to an OLDER TECH who watches a still 
           feed of the East road into town, between the cliff walls.

                                 YOUNG TECH
                        Sir. It’s the hour, the West guards 
                        haven’t checked in.

                                 OLDER TECH
                        Bring it up on the screen.

           The young tech moves to a control panel, starts to type.

           EXT. ROONEY’S CAR - DAY

           In the convenience store parking lot. Rooney reaches into her 
           backpack and pulls out-- 

           A KEY FOB. THREE BUTTONS on it-- labeled one, two, and three. 
           Seems appropriate. Rooney HITS THE NUMBER ONE BUTTON.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / CITY HALL - DAY

           The bush, where Rooney dumped the cardboard box. It’s still 
           nestled there, down in the bush. The box has opened, a 
           little. Inside, some metal device, a light on it blinking--

           BEEP! A PULSE radiates out of the bag.
           And electricity in the entire building SHUTS OFF.

           INT. CITY HALL / SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

           Just as the feed of the NORTH ROAD goes up--

           The power in the room SHUTS OFF.

                                 OLDER TECH
                        What the fuck was that?

           INT. ROONEY’S CAR - DAY

           Rooney looks in the rearview mirror. She takes a DEEP BREATH 
           IN, lets a DEEP BREATH OUT. 

                                 ROONEY
                        As many shops as you can, then the 
                        street, then the woods. They’ll 
                        follow you. Like lambs to the 
                        fucking slaughter.

           She laughs a little bit. Then regains her composure.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Come on now.

           Rooney checks her gun, tucks it into the waistband of her 
           pants, and pulls her shirt down over it. She gets out of the 
           car and strolls towards the--

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Ding! The door opens. We push through it after Rooney.

           Behind the counter, the same CLERK as before.

           Rooney walks to a drink cooler and gets out a blue PowerAde. 
           She walks to the counter and sets the drink down. The clerk 
           looks up at her, smiles-- then falters.

                                 CLERK
                        Will that be all today, sweetheart?

                                 ROONEY
                        Actually. A park of Marlboro Lights 
                        would be... just great.

           The clerk turns to the shelf behind her.
                                 CLERK
                        It must have been a long drive.

                                 ROONEY
                        Sorry?

                                 CLERK
                        The main road is closed for avalanche 
                        conditions. You must have come up 
                        from the East, the mountain road?

                                 ROONEY
                        Of course.

           The Marlboro Lights are on the next shelf up-- she climbs 
           onto a step-ladder to grab them.

                                 CLERK
                        Must have been treacherous. Lately we 
                        don’t get many visitors around here--

           Click. The clerk freezes. Turns to look at Rooney. Rooney’s 
           gun is out. Finger on the trigger. The clerk goes sheet pale.

            CLERK (CONT’D)
                              ROONEY
           Wh-- what--
                        Shut. The fuck. Up.

           The clerk raises her hands in the air.

                                 CLERK
                        I don’t know what you think this is. 
                        But you don’t want to make a mistake 
                        you’ll never be able to take back. I 
                        have grandchildren.

                                 ROONEY
                        Look. Look here. I’m gonna blow your 
                        brains out one way or another. So is 
                        there anything you want to say?

           Beat. And the fear on the clerk’s face DROPS AWAY.

                                 CLERK
                        I don’t know what you think you’ll 
                        achieve here, but you’ll never stop us.

                                 ROONEY
                        That’s what I th--

           The clerk DIVES to the ground. Rooney FIRES her gun-- too 
           slow. The bullet passes through the space where the clerk WAS 
           seconds ago. The glass display behind her SHATTERS.
           Rooney leans over the counter. The clerk is on her back with 
           a shotgun. She GRINS. Rooney REELS backwards. The shotgun 
           BLASTS a hole in the ceiling. Plaster rains down.

           Rooney stands still in the center of the shop. Gun out. Watching 
           the counter. Waiting for the woman to reappear. She doesn’t.

           BEHIND THE COUNTER -- The woman crawls along the ground. She 
           FLIPS OPEN a hidden wooden panel at the base of the counter-- 
           a red button contained beneath it. She reaches for the button.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           The clerk looks up. Rooney stands above her, pistol drawn.

                                 CLERK
                        Please don’t--

           Rooney SHOOTS. Then kneels down. She looks at the red button. 
           Flips the panel covering it closed. And gets to her feet.

           QUICK CUTS -- As Rooney PULLS the Clerk’s body into the back 
           room and uses paper towels and Clorox to wipe up the blood.

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Rooney strolls OUT of the convenience store. Standing by the 
           door, Rooney lights a cigarette. She takes a LONG DRAG IN, 
           exhales, then tosses the cigarette to the ground.

           She walks back to her car, drives out of the parking lot--

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - DAY

           And drives twenty feet before turning into the next lot over--

           EXT. BURGER JOINT - DAY

           A greasy, delicious looking burger joint. All the blinds are 
           pulled shut-- can’t see in from the outside.

           Rooney walks towards the front door. A cutesy sign on the 
           door reads “BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES!” followed by a smiling 
           cartoon of a clock. Rooney walks inside.

           INT. BURGER JOINT - DAY

           SIX PATRONS eat burgers at the 1950s style booths. A CUTE 
           HOSTESS (22) stands by the door, wearing an old-school uniform.
           TWO WAITRESSES mill about. In the kitchen, FIVE FRY COOKS. We 
           recognize them, this group, from the funeral.

           Every one of them looks up as Rooney enters. All cold. 

           Except for the hostess girl, who is cute and sweet.

                                 HOSTESS
                        I’m sorry, miss, we’re actually 
                        closed at the moment.

           Rooney draws her gun. The HOSTESS GIRL DRAWS A GUN from a 
           holster behind her apron. Rooney SHOOTS her in the head. The 
           PATRONS all leap to their feet, all drawing weapons.

           Rooney THROWS A GRENADE towards the booths. It DETONATES. 
           Patrons are consumed in a fireball. Others fall to the floor.

           A WAITRESS (50) leaps towards Rooney, foot extended in a 
           flying kick. Rooney SHOOTS HER in the heart-- her body 
           continues through the air, KNOCKING ROONEY TO THE GROUND.

           The cook staff shoots from the kitchen. Rooney lies under the 
           waitress’s body. She takes aim. Shoots three people.

           She throws the waitress’s body off of her, scrambles back up 
           against the counter behind which lies the kitchen, and rolls 
           another SMOKE GRENADE across the floor. Smoke fills the air.

           Rooney points her gun UP. A COOK jumps over the counter. She 
           SHOOTS HIM as he passes overhead. The bullet hits him in the 
           dick. He falls to the ground. She shoots him in the face.

           Another grenade towards the booth section. ANOTHER smoke 
           grenade back into the kitchen.

           Rooney LEAPS off the ground, rolls over the counter, and lands 
           in the KITCHEN. A MEAT CLEAVER hangs from a magnetic knife 
           block. She grabs it, stands, and strolls through the smoke.

           A sound behind her--

           She turns, SWINGS the cleaver. It sticks into a COOK’S head. 
           She turns and SWINGS the cleaver again--

           Taking a fry cook’s arm off. The severed arm, GUN CLUTCHED IN 
           ITS HAND, hits the ground. The gun GOES OFF--

           And the bullet HITS the third remaining fry cook, across the 
           kitchen, in the chest. He STUMBLES BACKWARDS into the stove, 
           grabs a pot to steady himself, FALLS, pulling the pot over, 
           DUMPING BOILING OIL ONTO HIS FACE. His face melts off.
           Rooney SWINGS the cleaver at the one-armed fry cook, taking 
           him in the side of the neck. He falls dead.

           Rooney grabs his gun, checks it, turns back towards the main 
           part of the restaurant. Through the smoke, three shadows.

           BAM! BAM! BAMBAMBAM! All three shadows fall to the ground. 
           Rooney pushes through the door into the main restaurant--

           And the HOSTESS, half her face destroyed by the bullet that 
           ripped through it, runs towards Rooney, knife in her hand. 

           She SWINGS THE KNIFE. Rooney holds up her left hand 
           defensively and the knife CUTS OFF HER PINKIE FINGER.

           Rooney PUNCHES THE GIRL with her right gun-holding hand. The 
           gun barrel rams into the girl’s ear. BAM!

           Rooney looks at her severed pinkie, runs BACK to the kitchen--

           To the pot of oil that now lies on the ground-- and PRESSES 
           THE PINKIE STUMP TO THE METAL, cauterizing it.

                                 ROONEY
                        AHHHHH!!! FUCK!

           She grabs the FIRE EXTINGUISHER off the wall, marches across 
           the restaurant, and EXTINGUISHES the booths.

           EXT. BURGER JOINT - MINUTES LATER

           Rooney walks calmly out of the burger joint. No passerby. Good. 
           She gets back in her car.

           From the outside, the burger joint looks remarkably intact 
           given what just happened inside.

           EXT. CONCRETE BUILDING / PARKING LOT - DAY

           Rooney drives for half a block and pulls into the back lot of 
           the concrete building next door. 

           A SMALL PATCH OF TREES. She drives INTO IT, foliage all around.

           IN THE CAR-- Rooney tucks four handguns into the waistband of 
           her pants. She clips grenades to her belt. Slides a knife 
           into her sock and slides another knife through a belt loop.

           Rooney gets out of the car and moves towards the building.
           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Whistling, PINE enters the convenience store. He grabs a 
           Gatorade from a cooler, walks to the counter, sets it down.

                                 PINE
                        Mabel?

           No response. Pine leans over the counter and looks down. The 
           floor behind the counter is clean. Shiny. Pine walks around 
           the counter. He bends down. He sniffs the floor. Hmm.

           INT. CONCRETE BUILDING - DAY

           The building Rooney just ducked into.

           It’s a fucking bowling alley. Rooney stands on the obnoxiously 
           bright carpet and looks around.

           EIGHTIES ROCK MUSIC BLARES. GROUPS OF MEN AND WOMEN BOWL.

           TWO TWENTY-SOMETHINGS work behind the counter. Well, “work”-- 
           they’re making out. Feeling each other up and down.

           We PUSH IN on their making out faces, so close all we see is 
           lips smacking and all we hear is spittle flying.

           It’s pretty gross. OR hot, maybe you love extreme close-ups 
           of young lips devouring each other in cringe-worthy detail. 
           Like, maybe that’s your thing. Who am I to judge--

                                 ROONEY (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           The kids separate, see Rooney, REACH FOR THEIR WEAPONS--

           BANG! Bullet between the girl’s eyes.

                                 BOY
                        JENNA--

           BANG! Bullet in this dude’s head. The girl still stumbles 
           around, like she hasn’t realized she’s dead yet.

           ONE BY ONE, the bowling alley customers look up at Rooney. One 
           dude DROPS HIS BALL as he sees her-- it rolls limply into the 
           gutter and becomes stuck there.

           The girl finally COLLAPSES, her head smashing into a KEYBOARD 
           as she goes down--

           Activating the rave function of the bowling alley. The normal 
           lights shut off, replaced by FLASHING STROBES.
           The song switches to-- “Josie’s on a vacation far away. Come 
           around and talk it over.”

           REDLIGHTSANDBLUELIGHTSANDBLUEANDGREENYELLOWTHEDISCOBALLSTWIRL--

           Guns coming out. Rooney’s already gone. As the first bullets 
           tear towards her, she dives behind a rack of bowling balls.

           A MAN WITH AN EYEPATCH draws his gun and walks towards the 
           rack of balls. He looks behind it--

           Rooney’s NEXT TO HIM. Bam! Bullet in the head.

           “So many things that I want to say. You know I like my girls 
           a little bit older.”

           TWO MEN approach a rack of balls, closing in from either side. 
           Rooney uppercuts one with a knife, stabbing him under the chin.

           She holds him like that, knife in him like a ventriloquist 
           with its hand up a puppet’s ass.

           Rooney SPINS the puppet man around. The other guy SHOOTS-- his 
           bullet hits this already dead dude in the back of the head.

           Rooney drops the puppet man, DIVES at the second dude like a 
           monkey, and stabs him in the heart over and over.

           An OVERWEIGHT MAN runs towards her. He BARRELS INTO HER, 
           knocking her back onto the WAXED LANE.

           They SLIDE until they’re halfway down the lane. The dude CHOKES 
           Rooney. She knees him in the dick, scrambles to her feet--

           And is GRABBED from behind by a WOMAN. Rooney SNAPS FORWARDS, 
           flipping the woman over her head. Rooney grabs her head and 
           SLAMS IT INTO THE FLOOR.

           The fat dude rushes her from behind. She SLIDES HER FINGERS 
           into the ball stuck in the gutter. She SWINGS IT--

           And caves in the side of the fat guy’s face.

           “I just want to use your love tonight. I don’t want to lose 
           your love, tonight.”

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - EVENING

           Pine stands outside and looks around. His eyes land on the 
           burger joint, the only other shop in sight, a block down.

           All quiet. So quiet. Birds chirp in the crisp mountain air.
           EXT. BURGER JOINT - EVENING

           Pine walks to a side window and does his best to peer through 
           the blinds. He can JUST make out the inside of the shop-- 

           A body slumped dead across a table. Alright then.

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

           BEHIND THE COUNTER, the two teens lie dead as can be. Then--

           One of girl’s hands TWITCHES-- and she OPENS HER EYES. She 
           GASPS for breath and pulls herself towards the base of the 
           counter. She FLIPS OPEN a hidden panel--

           Revealing a RED BUTTON, like the one in the convenience 
           store. She reaches for it-- and, as she dies-- HITS IT.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

           Rooney walks across the parking lot towards her car. As she 
           walks, a LOW ALARM begins to sound, seemingly from 
           everywhere, growing louder and louder. 

           Rooney turns in a circle, looking for the source of it. BIRDS 
           take off from the ground all around her.

           A MAILMAN walking the other way sees Rooney, blood-covered, 
           and FLIES INTO ACTION. Both hands PLUNGE into his mail bag.

           BANG, Rooney puts two bullets in his chest. He falls back, 
           packages and letters flying out of his bag.

           Rooney breathes fast now, on the verge of losing her cool for 
           the first time. She runs towards her car. She bends down, 
           looks at her reflection in the window.

                                 ROONEY
                        They’re coming. Now the street, 
                        then the woods. Come on.

           She SLAPS herself again and moves to the trunk.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 53

           INT. SUNNYVALE / CITY HALL / CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

           Fingers roll across a desk. They belong to the Mayor, at the 
           HEAD of a conference table. OTHER PEOPLE around the table. 
           Lights in the room still off.
           They all speak English-- though the strength of their German 
           accents varies on a case by case basis.

           A COUNCILWOMAN (40s) talks. We don’t hear her words. Nor does 
           the Mayor, he’s not listening, but slowly they become audible--

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        ...keep passing through-- MAYOR 
                        MULLER. Are you listening?

           We hear him talk for the first time-- an unhinged looniness 
           in his eyes, an edge to his voice.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        I’m sorry. What the fuck did you 
                        say?

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        Twenty-seven people this year have 
                        driven through, from the back road. 
                        More than last year. If we don’t do 
                        more to deter people--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        What are we gonna do? Blow up the 
                        highway? Or do you think, maybe, we 
                        can manage to keep up appearances, 
                        considering that the whole fucking 
                        point of this town is to keep up 
                        appearances? And in the meantime 
                        maybe try to get the fucking power 
                        back on?

                              THE MAYOR
            COUNCILWOMAN
           The... loss of your daughter 
           was--
                        WAS WHAT? You fucking cunt?

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        You can’t talk to me that--

           The Mayor throws his chair to the floor behind him, rises to 
           his feet, pulls a gun and trains it on the Councilwoman’s 
           head-- all in one fluid motion.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        What were you saying?

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        You lunatic. You’re gonna shoot me? 
                        In front of all these people?

                                 THE MAYOR
                        I haven’t decided yet.
           He looks around at the other Council members.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        Does anybody see this? This gun that 
                        I’m not holding, not in my hand? 
                        Think about where you want yourselves 
                        and your family members sent on 
                        assignment before you answer.

           THE LOW HUM OF THE ALARM reaches their ears. They freeze.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        Somebody tell me this is a drill?
                        FUCK. Lock down the school. 
               (beat)
                        Make sure Eve is protected.

           INT. PINE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Pine walks through the living room, loading a pistol. THE LOW 
           SOUND OF THE ALARM reaches him. He goes to the window.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           A normal looking SCHOOL BUILDING sits in lower Sunnyvale. THE 
           LOW ALARM hits this part of town-- still growing louder.

           INT. SCHOOL / CLASSROOM - DAY

           A MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASS. Fourteen-year-olds chatting, restless, 
           loading books into bags. They hear the alarm and look around.

           INT. SCHOOL / GYMNASIUM - DAY

           SIX AND SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS stand in a cluster in the gym. 

           JOUSTING WEAPONS discarded on the ground next to them. EVE 
           stands amongst the kids, wearing a RED BOW in her hair. The 
           GYM TEACHER (40s) stands before them.

                                 GYM TEACHER
                        Okay, that bell’s gonna ring any 
                        second, but remember for next time--

           THE HUM OF THE ALARM reaches their ears. The kids GROAN. The 
           gym teacher looks around, concerned.

                                 GYM TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, don’t worry, it’s probably 
                        just a drill.
           The door BURSTS open. Another MAN (30s) runs through-- 
           motions for the gym teacher to come with him. Eve watches 
           with worry as the gym teacher jogs off.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           QUICK CUTS OF -- DOORS slamming shut. LOCKS clicking. Kids of 
           various ages file from the hall BACK into classrooms.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - EVENING

           SERIES OF SHOTS -- Of people AROUND SUNNYVALE running to 
           their vehicles, getting in.

           AERIAL VIEW OF SUNNYVALE -- A CONVOY OF CARS, about thirty in 
           all, heads through town-- heading TOWARDS the bowling alley.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

           Rooney throws open the trunk of her car and pulls out a tripod, 
           a gun turret, she screws them together.

           We CUT BACK AND FORTH a few times. The cars getting closer. 
           Rooney assembling her weapon. The cars winding down a hill.

           Rooney FINISHES assembling the weapon, a machine gun turret 
           screwed onto a swivel platform nestled on top of a tripod--

           She RUNS to the middle of the road, sets it down, and RUNS 
           BACK towards her car hidden in the trees.

           AS THE CARS RACE AROUND THE CORNER-- AND TEAR DOWN THE STREET--

           Rooney reaches into her pocket. She pulls the KEY FOB and 
           HITS THE NUMBER TWO BUTTON.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - EVENING

           The first street where Rooney parked in front of the storm 
           drain. DOWN IN THE STORM DRAIN-- a red light BLINKS-- BLINKS--

           A COUPLE walks down the street, holding hands. BOOM! The 
           street beneath them EXPLODES. They’re THROWN by the blast.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - EVENING

           THE SECOND STREET where Rooney parked. A car drives down it. 
           The street EXPLODES. The car PLUMMETS into the resulting hole.
           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - EVENING

           BOOM! The street UNDERNEATH THE CONVOY OF CARS explodes-- 
           five cars PLUNGE into the massive pothole.

           The others SWERVE around the hole. Some hurry to TURN AROUND. 
           As the front of the line of cars BEARS DOWN on the gun turret--

           ROONEY hits THE THIRD BUTTON on the key fob, and--

           Bullets RIP out of the machine gun turret as it SWINGS BACK 
           AND FORTH spraying bullets across the width of the street.

           THE FIRST CAR -- A bullet hits the driver IN THE THROAT.

           His car SWERVES, SLAMS into a mailbox. He flies OUT OF IT, 
           lands face first on the ground and SLIDES, leaving a sludgy 
           red trail behind him. We recognize one of the buildings on the 
           SIDE of this street--

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING / SECOND STORY - EVENING

           It’s the ABANDONED BUILDING Rooney was in earlier. A SECOND 
           GUN TURRET is stationed just inside the window. IT STARTS TO 
           FIRE, bullets BLASTING through the concrete wall and RAINING 
           DOWN on the street below.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - EVENING

           The cars take fire from the two turrets--

           And from A THIRD TURRET on the second story of ANOTHER 
           BUILDING on the other side of the street.

           THE NEXT THREE CARS IN LINE drive side by side. BAM, the face 
           of the driver in the middle car explodes. His car FISHTAILS, 
           BUMPING into the two cars to either side, which SPLAY OUT--

           And the SIX CARS behind them SLAM INTO THEM at full force. 

           ON A CAR as it slams FULL FORCE into a car in front of it.  
           The driver, a YOUNG WOMAN, FLIES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD and 
           flies through the air like a puppet.

           She lands in a sprawl ON THE TURRET. PFT! PFT! PFT! It blasts 
           a HOLE in her stomach. It pivots her body like a mannequin 
           until the bullets CUT HER IN HALF. She falls in two pieces.

           The twenty cars behind the initial onslaught try to turn. But 
           the bullets are still COMING AT THEM--
           BOOM! A car EXPLODES. BOOM! The street is SLUICED with thick 
           rivers of blood. 

           BOOM! BOOM! Two more cars EXPLODE, the whole wreck ON FIRE.

           PFTPFTPFT-- Seven more running people pumped with bullets.

           STANDING ON THE HILL ABOVE THE CARNAGE -- Townspeople look 
           down on the massacre. They draw their guns.

           They split, moving in different directions, around the 
           massacre and down the hill. ROONEY runs back to her car.

           She throws open the door, jumps in, and is already backing 
           out of the patch of trees before her door is closed.

           The gun turret stops spitting bullets.

                                 ROONEY
                        Step three.

           Vroooooommm that’s the sound Rooney’s car makes as she drives 
           towards the FOREST on the other side of the street.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 102

           EXT. FOREST - EVENING

           Rooney drives through the woods, plowing over baby trees. The 
           trees around her getting thicker and thicker.

           Can’t drive any further through them so she STOPS. Reaches 
           into the backseat, grabs her BACKPACK.

           She loads weapons into the pack. As she does, she glimpses 
           the broken music box, nestled safely at the bottom of the 
           bag. A couple tears roll out of her eyes.

                                 ROONEY
                        Not fucking yet.

           Rooney wipes them away and gets out of her car. She grabs 
           whatever she can, leaves, dirt, she throws them over her car, 
           hiding it from view. Then stands back and looks at it--

           GOOD ENOUGH. A low rumbling in the distance--

           EXT. FOREST’S EDGE - EVENING

           HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE pour into the forest on foot. All loaded 
           up, armed with guns, people of all different colors, creeds. 
           PINE is among them. He holds a CELL PHONE to his ear.
                                 PINE
                        Sweetie, it’s--

           INT. SCHOOL / CLASSROOM - EVENING

           EVE now sits at a desk in one of the classrooms, phone to her 
           ear. The kids around her chattering excitedly.

                                 EVE
                        I’m scared. Are-- are people here 
                        to hurt us?

                                 PINE - PHONE
                        It’s gonna be fine, baby. I’ll see 
                        you real soon.

           EXT. FOREST - EVENING

           ROONEY stands with her eyes closed. She lets a deep breath 
           out. Then JUMPS UP and GRABS ON to a tree branch extending 
           above her. She hoists herself up onto it. She’s gone.

           INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           The Mayor slumps back in his chair. His guard, Prosthetic 
           Nose, stands before him.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Forty-five fucking people dead?

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE
                        In the street alone. More in the 
                        downtown, they just-- tore their  
                        way through it, the gas station, 
                        Dan’s Burgers--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        They? Somebody had eyes on them?

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE
                        The only one who’s actually been 
                        seen is a woman. Young, brown hair--

           The Mayor laughs, too loud, too long, lunacy in it.

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           The Mayor kicks up his feet and spins two full circles in his 
           office chair before planting his feet back on the ground.
                                 THE MAYOR
                        The guards, on the edge of town, 
                        they’re dead, too?

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE
                        On the way in--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        I know who it is. She came. And she 
                        came alone. The woman who killed my 
                        daughter. Where is she?

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE
                        She went into the forest on foot, 
                        across from the bowling alley. We’re 
                        after her now. It’s just a matter of 
                        time.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Good.

           EXT. HIGHWAY / WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           CONSTRUCTION WORKERS establish a blockade on the road Rooney 
           came in on, moving signs and SANDBAGS into place, parking 
           cars lengthwise across the road for good measure.

           Ten men stand on the Sunnyvale side of the blockade. Waiting.

                                 THE MAYOR (V.O.)
                        Close the town, eradicate the problem.

           EXT. HIGHWAY / EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           The same happens on the road leading out of town on the other 
           side-- the road stretching between TWO TOWERING CLIFF WALLS.

           INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

                                 THE MAYOR
                        She’s one woman. We’re a town of 
                        assassins. How much damage can she do?

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           The full moon above gives us just enough light to see by. 
           This whole sequence should be set to classical music. 

           LONG SERIES OF SHOTS. SERIES OF TOO MANY SHOTS.
           -- People comb through the forest.

           -- Rooney crawls along a TREE BRANCH. A WOMAN walks directly 
           below her. Rooney puts a bullet into the top of her head.

           -- Rooney swings from one branch to another. She’s a fucking 
           monkey, the way she moves through these trees.

           -- Three men walk. A branch CRACKS behind them. They WHIRL 
           around. Bullets fly through all their dumbshit faces.

           -- QUICK CUTS of Rooney putting bullets in

           ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT! NINE! TEN!

           peoples’ heads from above.

           -- QUICK CUTS of Rooney slitting

           ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT! NINE! TEN!

           peoples’ throats from behind.

           -- QUICK CUTS of Rooney blowing

           ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT! NINE! TEN!

           groups of people apart with grenades.

           -- Rooney wipes blood off her face.

           -- Rooney crouches with her hands on her knees, breathing 
           heavily, PANTING. Slowing down.

           She JOLTS. Looks up. THROWS HERSELF TO THE GROUND as a bullet 
           slams into the trunk of the tree she was standing in front of.

           Rooney runs behind a row of trees. She peeks out from behind 
           one-- sees a LARGE MAN walking through the woods, gun drawn, 
           back to her. She draws her gun-- aims-- SHOOTS--

           It CLICKS empty. The man hears it, starts to turn around. 

           Rooney draws a knife and SPRINTS towards the man. As he sees 
           her she JUMPS TOWARDS HIM.

           He throws her to the ground and falls on top of her. She 
           struggles beneath him. He draws his gun, HITS HER across the 
           face with it, then aims it at her face, and--

           BANG! The man clutches his arm and FALLS OFF of Rooney. She 
           looks up to see--

           PINE. Standing there with a gun in hand-- he saved her.
           Beat. Then the large guy on the ground LURCHES UP--

           Rooney dives towards him and stabs him in the throat. The 
           dude falls back, dead.

           A friendly reminder that when Pine speaks, it’s in a THICK 
           Southern accent. Unreasonably, unconscionably thick.

           Breathing heavily, Pine looks at Rooney for a long time. The 
           look in his eyes, it’s hard to tell if he’s gonna kill her, or--

                                 PINE
                        Follow me. Or you’re dead. You’re 
                        probably dead anyway but--

           He extends a hand to her. She just looks at it. Then TAKES 
           IT. Pine pulls Rooney to her feet.

                                 ROONEY
                        If you’re gonna kill me. Do it now.

           Pine says nothing. Rustling elsewhere in the trees.

                                 PINE
                        We have to move.

           Pine jogs off, moving back in the direction of town. Rooney 
           hesitates. Pine looks back at her.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        You’d be stupid. Not to follow me.

           Rooney still doesn’t move. Pine shakes his head, runs towards 
           town. Rooney waits a beat, then runs after him.

           He glances at her to confirm her presence, says nothing.

                                 ROONEY
                        I need a gun.

                                 PINE
                        You don’t have enough?

                                 ROONEY
                        Fine, I need ammunit--

           Without looking back, he thrusts a gun at her. She grabs it. 
           Pine continues on, moving ahead of her. IMMEDIATELY, she 
           TAKES AIM at the back of his head.

                                 ROONEY (CONT'D)
                        Okay, stop. I’m not going further 
                        until you tell me why you’re not 
                        trying to kill me.
           Pine turns back to face her.

                                 PINE
                        Do you know how many people are in 
                        these woods? Do you really think this 
                        is a break we can afford to take?

                                 ROONEY
                        Then you know I’ve killed a lot of 
                        you already.

                                 PINE
                        Yeah. You have.

                               PINE
              ROONEY
           You’re from here. You’re one 
           of them.
                        Not for long.

                                 ROONEY
                        You want out?

                                 PINE
                        For a long time. Not just for myself. 
                        When the alarm goes off, they lock 
                        down the school. It’s protocol, keep 
                        all the kiddos safe until the 
                        danger’s cleared. One of the kid’s in 
                        that school-- she’s my daughter. Eve. 
                        I can’t raise her in this. I can’t 
                        raise her to kill, while everyone she 
                        loves is dying all around her. You 
                        seem like the best bet in a while to 
                        make a clean break.
               (beat)
                        I’ll help you get to the Mayor. Help 
                        you kill him. If you help me get her 
                        out safe. Yeah?

           For a moment, Rooney looks at Pine. Debating. Then she WINCES.

                                 ROONEY
                        Adrenaline’s wearing off.

                                 PINE
                        Somebody get you?

                                 ROONEY
                        A couple nicks. Nothing I can’t--

           She winces again.

                                 PINE
                        Come on.
           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 205

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Rooney and Pine crouch in a little clearing, a safe wall of 
           foliage protecting them from view. Moonlight shining down.

           Rooney holds up her hand-- shows Pine the STAB WOUND. He can 
           almost see clean through it.

                                 PINE
                        Not great.

                                 ROONEY
                        Yeah, that’s not great.

                                 PINE
                        There’s more?
               (off her hesitation)
                        Listen. I don’t much like it either. 
                        But we’re gonna have to trust each 
                        other here, aren’t we?

           Rooney relents-- then takes off her shirt. A NASTY GASH in 
           her side oozes blood.

           THE BULLET WOUND in her shoulder also doesn’t look so hot. 
           Various other dips and dots mark her torso. Rooney pulls a 
           small FIRST AID KIT from her backpack, tosses it to Pine.

           Pine wraps a bandage around Rooney’s shoulder. His eyes flick 
           down, ever so quickly-- Rooney catches it.

                                 ROONEY
                        Fucking-- stop it.

                                 PINE
                        Stop what?

                                 ROONEY
                        Don’t look at my tits.

           Pine SCOFFS.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 PINE
                        “Don’t look at my tits.” I have no 
                        interest in lookin’ at your tits, 
                        and I resent the implication. First 
                        of all, you’re a little old for me--
                                 ROONEY
                        I’m thirty! How old are you?

                                 PINE
                        Twenty-four.

                             PINE (CONT'D)
              ROONEY
           Oh, Jesus Christ.
                        Second, they’re covered in 
                        blood, oh, yeah, that’s real 
                        hot, that’s what you want, 
                        bloody tits.

           Pine examines the gash in Rooney’s side-- she WINCES.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        Why is that the taboo, though, you 
                        know what I mean? Tits, they’re just 
                        there, on the outside of the body, 
                        there’s nothing unnatural about tits. 
                        Your fucking insides are spilling out 
                        on my hands, isn’t it more fucked up 
                        that I have to see that shit? “Don’t 
                        look at my tits.” How about “don’t 
                        look at my blood,” motherfucker.

                                 ROONEY
                        Are you workshopping that for a 
                        standup routine, or--

                                 PINE
                        Come on. Put your shirt back on. 
                        “Don’t look at my tits.”

           EXT. FOREST’S EDGE - NIGHT

           Rooney and Pine peek through the edge of the forest. GUARDS 
           stand in the street-- one every ten feet or so.

              ROONEY
           Any of these friends of 
           yours, or--
                               PINE
                        Do what you must.

           Rooney fishes into her backpack, pulls out one of the last 
           weapons in there-- a grenade. She looks at Pine, and--

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / RESIDENTIAL AREA - NIGHT

           PINE AND ROONEY rush into frame, spattered with fresh blood.

              ROONEY
                               PINE
           That was close.
                        Come on.
           They run across another street, moving deeper into the 
           residential section of Sunnyvale.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 211

           INT. PINE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Pine and Rooney enter through the back door. Pine turns, 
           leans against the door, and looks at Rooney.

                                 PINE
                        Alright. What’s your plan?

                                 ROONEY
                        Kill as many people as I can, so 
                        they can’t reform somewhere else, 
                        everyone except the kids. Then blow 
                        your Mayor’s brains out.

           As she talks, she fishes the SCHEMATIC of the town out of her 
           backpack and unrolls it onto the table before them.

           He looks down at it, spattered with blood. She points to 
           illustrate her path thus far as she talks.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        This was the idea. Start the assault. 
                        Lure them to the woods. Then double 
                        back once the panic had started.

           She taps the schematic.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        This is next.

                                 PINE
                        That’s fucking crazy.

                                 ROONEY
                        But do you think it’ll work?

                                 PINE
                        It might. Come on. I’ll show you the 
                        stockpile.

           MOMENTS LATER -- Rooney and Pine walk into the living room. 
           She passes the mantle-- glances at the displayed photographs. 
           Freezes on one of them.

           INSERT -- It’s Pine and Katie, arms around one another, smiling. 
           PINE stands over her shoulder.
                                 ROONEY
                        She’s pretty.

                                 PINE
                        She was. Sidewalk didnt’ help.

           Realizing, Rooney SPINS to face him. In one hand, he holds a 
           knife. In the other, a sharpening block. He slides the blade 
           of the knife across it. Rooney reaches for her gun.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, whoa!

           He looks down at his knife.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Suppose that looked kind of 
                        menacing. Sorry. It’s alright. I 
                        mean, it ain’t alright. When I first 
                        heard she was dead... I told myself 
                        I’d find whoever did it. And kill 
                        them. Painfully. Then I started 
                        thinking about it.

           He slides the knife across the sharpening block once more.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        Thinking about who really killed her. 
                        It wasn’t you. You was just doin’ 
                        your job. It’s this town. This... 
                        legacy of violence. That, I thought-- 
                        that’s what I’d really like to kill.

                                 ROONEY
                        If she’s your wife... Then you’re 
                        his son-in-law. Which means your 
                        daughter is--

                                 PINE
                        Next in line to take over, if the 
                        town survives. Now you get why I 
                        gotta get her out?
               (beat)
                        Come on, take a look.

           They continue into the living room. On the carpet, an 
           ENORMOUS STOCKPILE OF WEAPONRY. Grenades, machine guns, 
           handguns, and a fucking ROCKET LAUNCHER.

                                 ROONEY
                        How about we give this town a wake-
                        up call? But first I have to pee.
           INT. PINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pine and Rooney stand in front of a door in Pine’s home.

                                 PINE
                        Do you know why I got a Southern 
                        accent? I taught myself it when I 
                        was six, cause I wanted to be Bo.

                                 ROONEY
                        You wanted to beebo?

                                 PINE
                        To be Bo Duke. From the Dukes of 
                        Hazard. And you know what those good 
                        old boys were known for, right?

                                 ROONEY
                        Cars?

                                 PINE
                        Cars. I been planning my getaway from 
                        this place for about as long as I 
                        been talking this way. With regards 
                        to both, too long to look back. So 
                        yeah. What I got in here is gonna do 
                        the trick just fine. You also never 
                        asked what my job is. When I’m here.

              ROONEY
           What’s your--
                             PINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m a mechanic. Take a look.

           INT. PINE’S HOUSE / GARAGE - NIGHT

           They step into the garage. Pine’s car should do the trick. 
           It’s a 1978 neon blue Plymouth Fury and it’s dope as shit.

                                 PINE
                        1978 Plymouth Fury, with bulletproof 
                        windows and room for a shitload of 
                        weaponry inside.

                                 ROONEY
                        No bulletproof tires?

                                 PINE
                        Not bulletproof, that don’t really 
                        exist, but got pneumatic inserts in 
                        there so they can take a shot or two.

                                 ROONEY
                        I was joking, but cool.
           Rooney and Pine load the stockpile of weapons into the 
           passenger seat. Pine gets into the driver’s seat. Rooney 
           rides in the back. He puts the car into gear.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / RESIDENTIAL AREA - NIGHT

           Pine’s garage door creeps silently open. The Plymouth Fury 
           rolls out of the garage and turns onto the street.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE CAR AND THE SURROUNDING STREETS.

           The car rolls down the street at twenty-five miles an hour. 
           Rooney, in the back, holds the ROCKET LAUNCHER on her lap.

           Rooney looks at Pine. Pine looks at Rooney. NODS. Rooney 
           rolls down her window and extends the rocket launcher out of 
           it, balancing it on her shoulder and the lip of the window.

                                 PINE
                        Firing that thing can be a bitch. Make 
                        sure you don’t burn your face off.

                                 ROONEY
                        Yeah, I’ll try.

           As they roll past a particularly large house, she FIRES.

           The rocket BLASTS out of the launcher (the launcher KICKS 
           like a motherfucker, but she’s got it) and flies towards the 
           house. It SMASHES through a window--

           And the house EXPLODES. Pine SLAMS on the gas. The car TEARS 
           towards an intersection-- TEARS around a corner-- And SPEEDS 
           OFF down the next straightaway.

           Rooney fishes around on the floor. She grabs another 
           projectile and laboriously SLOTS IT into the launcher.

           AGAIN-- Rooney takes aim. Waits until they pass a LARGE HOUSE 
           and-- FIRES the rocket launcher out the window.

           BOOM! The house EXPLODES, wood paneling blasting outwards. 
           SIRENS start to blare in the background.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        You guys have fire trucks?

                                 PINE
                        Assassins still need public SAFETY--

           He says this as he BARRELS around another corner and takes 
           off down ANOTHER STRAIGHTAWAY of residential housing. Rooney 
           takes aim-- FIRES the rocket launcher.
           BOOM! A third house explodes.

           They tear off down ANOTHER STRAIGHTAWAY. Pine expertly slides 
           backwards into a PARALLEL PARK on the curb.

              ROONEY
                             PINE (CONT'D)
           What are we--
                        Get DOWN--

           Pine RECLINES his seat flat backwards. Rooney lies flat in 
           the back, holding the rocket launcher on her chest--

           Two fire trucks FLY PAST, heading towards the fires.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / RESIDENTIAL SECTION - NIGHT

           AERIAL SHOT of the residential section of Sunnyvale.

           THREE FIRES burn on separate blocks. Firemen try to douse the 
           flames. People POUR out of their homes into the street.

           THE FIRST FIRE has spread to the houses on either side. A 
           BURNING WOMAN runs out of one, collapses dead into the yard.

           THE SECOND FIRE -- Same situation here, the FIREMEN douse the 
           house with water, even as the flames are spreading.

           THE THIRD FIRE -- A woman throws herself out the window.

           ON PINE AND ROONEY, in their car. They nod at one another. 
           Pine throws the car into gear, and they TAKE OFF.

           QUICK CUTS OF-- Rooney FIRING the launcher THREE MORE TIMES. 
           Three more houses EXPLODING.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 228

           EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

           Behind CITY HALL, a MASSIVE MANSION stands. SECURITY GUARDS 
           stationed all around. Every ten feet, and more on the roof.

           INT. MANSION / BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE, TOO CLOSE on the STRAINED, SWEATY FACE of the Mayor. 
           Looking straight down the barrel of the camera.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        You bitch.

           His face DESCENDS out of frame-- then RISES back into frame. 
           Every muscle in his face tense.
                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        You fucking bitch.

           WIDER TO REVEAL -- The Mayor does ONE-ARMED PULL-UPS on an 
           EXERCISE BAR installed in front of a mirror.

           He’s bare-assed naked. We’re graced this view from behind, 
           but can more or less make out the reason these pull-ups are 
           one armed-- he’s using the other arm to JERK OFF as he looks 
           at himself in the mirror.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        You slut. You think you can come to 
                        my town and destroy what I’ve 
                        built? You fucking--

           The door bursts open. Prosthetic Nose runs into the room.

                                 PROSTHETIC NOSE
                        Sir.

           The Mayor turns and looks at him, chin elevated over the bar.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        What?

           Then he sees it-- the sky BURNING ORANGE outside the window.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Sirens fainter in the background now, the police and ambulances, 
           such as they are, also heading towards the residential area--

           As the Plymouth Fury BARRELS through the DOWNTOWN. Rooney 
           leans out the window with the rocket launcher.

           BOOM! A bookstore EXPLODES. Paper fire rains down.

           BOOM! A VIDEO STORE (these motherfuckers still watch DVDs?) 
           EXPLODES. Disc fragments rain down into the street. Reload.

           BOOOOM! A car dealership EXPLODES-- and all the cars in it 
           EXPLODE TOO, BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM!!!

           FIVE PEDESTRIANS appear from around a corner, shoot at the car.

           Rooney DUCKS back into the window, grabs a MACHINE GUN off 
           the floor of the car, sticks the barrel out the window--

           And CUTS DOWN the five pedestrians. TEN MORE pop out on the 
           other side of the street. One of the tires POPS, but the car 
           keeps rolling, and the bullets PING off the bulletproof 
           drivers’ side window.
                                 PINE
                        You ready?

                                 ROONEY
                        Wha--

           Pine SPINS the car around. Rooney DUCKS BACK out of sight and 
           shoots blindly out the passenger window--

           MOWING DOWN the ten pedestrians, their blood painting a 
           tapestry on the pavement behind them. The car SPINS AGAIN and 
           takes off back in the same direction.

                                 PINE
                        Calm your bloody tits.

                                 ROONEY
                        I assure you. They’re calm.

           Pine TEARS AROUND A CORNER. Cars SPEED TOWARDS THEM from that 
           direction. They BARREL AROUND another corner. CARS UP AHEAD 
           too. They’re CLOSING IN.

                                 PINE
                        I can outrun them! I’ll have to ditch 
                        the car somewhere, jump in a new one, 
                        I can do it faster without you! You 
                        were serious? About killing as many 
                        people as possible?

                                 ROONEY
                        Except the kids.

                                 PINE
                        That’s what I thought, HOLD ON--

           Pine veers OFF THE ROAD, speeds down a GRASSY HILL, lands on 
           the road down below and continues towards a BIG UGLY BUILDING. 
           The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of it.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll pick you up on the other side in 
                        ten minutes. You’ll be fine. 
                        Remember, they’re no better-- they 
                        used to do it, too.

                                 ROONEY
                        Why, this building, what is it?

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 243
           EXT. BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

           Rooney SPRINTS towards the building as Pine TEARS OFF. CHAINS 
           bind the front door shut. Rooney raises her gun and SHOOTS 
           the lock. It springs open.

           INT. BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

           Rooney, gun in hand, steps through the door. She’s greeted by 
           the sound of music that is diegetic AF.

           “Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann.”

           Oh, shit. Rooney looks around. Takes in her surroundings. 

           A bona fide sea of wrinkled knees and liver spotted skin. 
           It’s only, maybe, five AM-- but everyone in this room is 
           already awake. Awake and doing puzzles. Of course they are.

           It’s the town’s old people home.

           “Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann. Take my hand...”

           The main recreation area. TWO HUNDRED OLD PEOPLE sit around 
           playing cards, doing calisthenics, and listening to their old 
           people music.

           One by one, all these former assassins turn to look at Rooney.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        She’s the one! GET HER!

           “You've got me rockin' and a-rollin,' rockin' and a-reelin,' 
           Barbara Ann, ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann.”

           And Rooney’s already going.

           “Went to a dance, looking for romance--”

           The old people descend on Rooney. She fires off THREE SHOTS.

           POP! The young janitor’s head EXPLODES. POP! The young nurse’s 
           head EXPLODES. POP! The doctor’s head EXPLODES. Now it’s Rooney 
           and the old people-- and they’re closing in from all sides.

           “Saw Barbara Ann, so I thought I'd take a chance--”

           BANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANGBANG--

           She squeezes off EIGHT SHOTS, blasting holes into eight 
           eighty-year-old heads. Dentures and blood GO FLYING.
           Then the old people are upon her. They form a cautious ring, 
           coming at her a few at a time.

           “Barbara Ann, take my hand...”

           Rooney gun-punches a woman in the mouth, blows her brains out*.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREETS - EARLY MORNING

           Pine speeds through the streets, cars tearing after him. The 
           odometer creeps up over 100.

           INT. OLD PEOPLES’ HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Rooney PUNCHES an old woman in the face.

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        STOP!!!

           And the old people STOP FIGHTING, stepping back. Rooney keeps 
           shooting though, she spins in a circle firing her machine 
           gun, blowing holes in like eighteen octogenarians in one go--

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        STOP THIS, YOU CUNT!

           And Rooney DOES stop as she sees the source of the voice--

           THE CREEPY OLD MAN from the funeral. NUN-CHUCKS hanging by 
           his side. A YELLOW SMILEY-FACE on each handle.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        You fucking whore. You think you can 
                        just walk in here and kill us? Do you 
                        know how many people I’ve killed? 
                        Men, children, you think I’ve never 
                        killed a woman before? You think I’ll 
                        cower to some bitch? Come on. Have 
                        some honor. Throw down your gun and 
                        face me like a man, one on one, hand 
                        to hand, not like the pussy you are.

           He twirls his nun-chucks expertly above his head. He does a 
           BACKFLIP, spinning the nun-chucks underneath him as he does 
           it. It’s hardcore, especially given how old he is.

           He lands, breathing hard. He takes a defensive stance, nun-
           chucks in hand. Ready for her.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        NOW SHOW ME WHAT YOU--

       *Author's Note: I know this is pretty fucked. Not sorry.
           Rooney blows his brains out. 

           He topples to the ground. The other old people are quiet for 
           a second, just kind of looking at her, at each other.

           “You've got me rockin' and a-rollin,’ rockin' and a reelin--”

           And the old people are ON HER AGAIN.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREETS - EARLY MORNING

           Pine’s car rips down a straightaway. Pine BRACES HIMSELF, 
           then CRANKS THE WHEEL. 

           His car TURNS A CORNER, barrels down a road alongside a HILL.

           The other cars behind him haven’t made the turn yet-- Pine 
           throws open his door and THROWS HIMSELF out of the car.

           He rolls down the hill while his car carries on down the 
           straightaway-- the other cars carrying on after it. He looks 
           regretfully back after his car.

                                 PINE
                        Bye baby.

           INT. OLD PEOPLES’ HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Rooney ducks. She weaves. She bobs, stabs, spins. She kicks 
           people in their old dicks.

           It’s like Lebron James versus eight year-olds. The remainder 
           of the old people FALL DEAD. Blood literally two inches thick 
           on the ground. Somebody’s dentures floating in it.

           This isn’t over. Rooney sprints towards the HALLWAY.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - EARLY MORNING

           Pine, hunched over, keeping to the shadows of the early 
           morning, runs to an old car and throws open the door.

           He tears out the wires under the dash, strips two of the 
           wires and touches them together.

           INT. OLD PEOPLES’ HOME / HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

           A hallway. Rooney looks through the WINDOW of a door. An OLD 
           MAN still asleep in bed. Rooney looks down the hallway--
           Lined with probably A HUNDRED ROOMS, many of them presumably 
           still containing sleeping old people. Oh, Jesus. Rooney 
           RELOADS HER GUN-- and KICKS OPEN the first door.

           “Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann--”

           Rooney runs back into the hall, veers towards the next door--

           “You've got me rockin' and a-rollin,' rockin' and a reelin--”

           EXT. OLD PEOPLES’ HOME  - EARLY MORNING

           Pine’s newly acquired car idles outside. Rooney, SOAKED head 
           to toe in blood, runs to the passenger side and GETS IN.

           INT. PINE’S CAR - EARLY MORNING

           Pine looks at her knowingly.

              ROONEY
                               PINE
           You don’t have any--
                        My parents died years ago.

                                 ROONEY
                        Thank god.

           The car TAKES OFF. MOMENTS LATER, they drive around the front 
           of the building.

                                 PINE
                        Now blow it up.

              ROONEY
                               PINE
           But everyone inside is 
           already--
                        Blow it. Up.

           Rooney hesitates-- briefly-- then NODS.

           MOMENTS LATER -- Rocket launcher BOOM the building EXPLODES, 
           old people guts rain down into the street. And Pine and 
           Rooney are OUT OF THERE.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 485

           AERIAL SHOT OF SUNNYVALE-- Much of the town is now on fire.

           EXT. OLD PEOPLES’ HOME - EARLY MORNING / MINUTES LATER

           A BALD MAN (50s) runs towards the old people’s home. The 
           wreckage comes into view-- flaming bodies and rubble.
                                 BALD MAN
                        Jesus fuck.

           BEHIND HIM -- More people head towards the wreckage.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - EARLY MORNING

           Pine and Rooney drive. Rooney’s seat is reclined flat.

           IN THE CAR -- Pine turns the wheel. The car ROUNDS A CORNER. 
           They see, through the windshield, A MASSIVE CROWD OF PEOPLE. 
           Heading UP the hill, away from them.

                                 ROONEY
                        They going where I think?

           INT. CITY HALL / CONFERENCE ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           CLOSE ON the Mayor’s face as he opens his mouth--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        FUUUUUUCCCKKK!!!

           He sits at the head of the table. The town council, all in 
           various states of dishevelment, sit around the table. Some 
           tears on some faces, all clearly sleep deprived.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        How is this fucking happening? 
                        She’s one woman! One! One woman! 
                        Huh?! Why aren’t you fuckers out 
                        there looking for her?!

            COUNCILWOMAN
                           THE MAYOR (CONT'D)
           People are scared--
                        I don’t give a fuck, they 
                        kill people for a living, I 
                        think they can--

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        PEOPLE ARE SCARED FOR THEIR CHILDREN--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        They’re safe, they’re locked down 
                        in the school, as per procedure--

                                 COUNCILWOMAN
                        We need to let people leave.

           The Mayor stares at her.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Leave? Let people leave? Nobody’s--
           The Mayor freezes-- he hears something-- A DIN of people, 
           yelling, a crowd. He storms out of the room.

           EXT. CITY HALL - EARLY MORNING

           A CROWD of EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE descends on City Hall, 
           yelling, angry. The GUARDS attempt to keep them back.

           THE LIGHTS slam on. THE DOORS of a second-floor balcony fly 
           open. THE MAYOR steps out onto the balcony, his guards 
           flanking him, and looks down at the crowd.

           A HUSH falls over them.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        What the fuck is this?

           The BALD MAN, in the crowd, steps forwards.

                                 BALD MAN
                        The fuck is that bitch just blew up 
                        the Good Samaritan home!

                                 THE MAYOR
                        JESUS CHRIST, ALL OF YOU! WHAT THE 
                        FUCK IS THIS? WHY IS THIS BITCH 
                        STILL ALIVE?! YOU KILL PEOPLE FOR A 
                        LIVING-- KILL HER!

                                 WOMAN
                        SHE’S GETTING HELP!

                        THE MAYOR
                             SHORT WOMAN
           FROM--
                        YOUR FUCKING SON IN LAW!

           MORE ENRAGED OUTBURSTS from the crowd.

                        THE MAYOR
                              BALD MAN
           What the fuck--
                        They found his car--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Did anyone see him, did it occur to 
                        you all that she might have STOLEN his 
                        car, has anybody actually seen him?

                                 BALD MAN
                        WE NEED TO LEAVE!

           AGREEMENT from the crowd--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Leave? You need to KILL HER.
                                 BALD MAN
                        FUCK THAT. YOU FUCKING LUNATIC, YOU

                        DONE, WE’LL REBUILD SOMEWHERE ELSE, 
                        WITHOUT YOU!

           CHEERS of agreement from some in the crowd. Bald Man turns, 
           pushes back through the crowd, arms raised--

                                 BALD MAN (CONT’D)
                        I’M LEAVING! THROUGH THE EAST ROAD! 
                        FOLLOW ME!

                                 THE MAYOR
                        THE SCHOOL STAYS LOCKED! FOR YOUR 
                        FUTURE LEADER’S PROTECTION! IF YOU 
                        LEAVE, IT’S WITHOUT YOUR CHILDREN!

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - EARLY MORNING

           Pine’s car winds its way up a hill.

           IN THE CAR -- Rooney lies flat while Pine drives.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - MORNING

           Pine and Rooney drive through the UPPER PART of Sunnyvale-- 
           through the neighborhoods at the highest elevation point.

           HOUSES dot the road. Pine VEERS RIGHT. The car barrels into--

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / BACKYARD - MORNING

           --A BACKYARD belonging to a small house.

           The backyard is FENCED OFF-- due to the STEEP CLIFF DROPOFF 
           on the other side of the fence. Down below that, the lower 
           section of Sunnyvale. Rooney and Pine glance at the house.

                              ROONEY
              PINE
           There could be people in th--
                        I’m on it.

           Rooney runs THROUGH THE BACK DOOR of the house. Beat. BAM! 
           BAM! BAM! Three gunshots from within the house.

           Rooney runs out of the house, wipes a smear of blood off of 
           her face, and joins Pine at the fence. They look down at the 
           town. They have a CLEAR VIEW of it--

           The way OUT of Sunnyvale to the East. Two towering cliff 
           walls. A mile away. And the narrow road leading between them.
           EXT. HIGHWAY / CLIFF SECTION - DAY

           The length of road stretching between the cliff walls is 
           about a half mile long.

           A MASSIVE CONVOY OF CARS speeds towards the edge of town-- 
           the panicked exodus beginning.

           THE FIRST CARS reach this stretch of highway, start to SPEED 
           THROUGH IT between the canyon walls. Not moving very fast, 
           because it’s a two-lane highway, one lane coming each way.

           But THREE LANES OF CARS now attempt to drive down the highway, 
           utilizing the shoulder-- but threatening to bump each other 
           off the road. They drive with ONE CAR-LENGTH between them.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN Rooney and Pine, on the edge of the cliff, 
           and the section of highway below.

           Rooney raises the rocket launcher, rests it on top of the 
           fence and looks through the sight. Pine looks at the stockpile 
           on the ground-- only TWO ROCKETS remain after this.

                                 ROONEY
                        I have to do this. Even though 
                        they’re running. If I don’t they’ll 
                        just rebuild somewhere else.

                                 PINE
                        I’m not arguing.

           Beat.

                                 ROONEY
                        And I wasn’t talking to you.

           Beat.

                                 PINE
                        You’ve only got three chances-- you 
                        have to make sure to account for 
                        the wind and--

           Rooney looks at him. Her look silences him. She’s got this.

           Rooney waits for her perfect moment-- waits until the FIRST 
           LINE OF CARS NEARS THE END OF THE CLIFF SECTION--

           And FIRES.

           I’ve crunched the numbers. 2,640 feet of road. So 88 cars in 
           a row could fit in that section of highway, accounting for 
           the distance between them-- and three rows-- so 264 cars-- so 
           if we assume, each car has, on average, three people in it--
           THE ROCKET, PERFECTLY TIMED, FLIES AT A SLIGHT ANGLE BETWEEN 
           THE TWO CLIFF WALLS AND SLAMS INTO THE LEFT WALL RIGHT NEAR 
           THE END OF THE CLIFF SECTION.
           BOOMBLAMSLAMBANGFUCKYOU-

           The cliff wall EXPLODES, sending boulders RAINING DOWN onto 
           the parade of cars.

           CLOSE ON some of the lead cars as BOULDERS SMASH THROUGH THE 
           WINDSHIELDS AND ROOFS and PEOPLES’ FACES FUCKING CAVE IN--

           Each car near the front section of road is SMASHED. Some of 
           them EXPLODE as gas and sparks leak out onto the road, blood 
           staining the ground--

           The cars behind attempt to throw themselves in REVERSE-- but 
           it’s chaos-- no room to maneuver.

           Rooney watches. It’s pretty badass, undeniably, objectively, 
           what she’s looking at. But she doesn’t smile. She can’t.

                                 ROONEY
                        God help me.

                                 PINE
                        God help us b--

           Rooney fires the rocket launcher again. This rocket hits the 
           wall NEAR THE START OF THE CLIFF SECTION. A similar BOOM.

           MASSIVE CHUNKS OF CLIFF WALL bend forwards, slamming into the 
           OPPOSITE CLIFF WALL, which also BUCKLES, caves. Boulders, so 
           many boulders, slamming down, down, down, DOWN, DOWN WITH THE 
           FURY OF A THOUSAND PRETENTIOUS METAPHORS--

           DEATH, DEATH BE UPON US, OH FOUL HELL, OPEN UP YOUR JAWS AND 
           SWALLOW US WIDE, DRINK US IN, DRINK US--

           And finally, the dust starts to settle. 264 cars buried in 
           rubble. The road blocked.

           Rooney and Pine turn to look at one another. Holy. Fucking. 
           Shit. Rooney’s eyes rimmed red with tears. But still she 
           PIVOTS with the third and final rocket loaded--

           On, look there in the distance, THIRTY CARS attempting to 
           escape through the OTHER road. CURRENTLY, the cars are stopped 
           as SEVERAL MEN drag the sandbag roadblocks out of the way.

           NOPE, Rooney takes aim, looks through the sight, and--
           BOOM! The rocket hits the central batch of cars, and the 
           FIREBALL emanates outwards as all the cars EXPLODE, throwing 
           the people moving the sandbags in either direction.

           IN THE BACKYARD-- Rooney finally DROPS the rocket launcher. 
           It lands in the dirt with a THUMP. A half-laugh, half-sob 
           escapes Rooney’s throat. She and Pine look at one another.

                                 ROONEY
                        Tell me something nice? Tell me 
                        about your daughter?

                                 PINE
                        Yeah. She’s uh-- she’s real cute. Her 
                        name is Eve. Her Mom got her a red 
                        bow for Christmas last year, she used 
                        to wear it whenever Mom was out of 
                        town. Now she wears it all the time.

           Rooney wipes her eyes with her forearm.

                                 ROONEY
                        We’ve probably got, what, two-
                        thirds of them? They’ll be 
                        panicking. Trying to put out the 
                        fires, to look for another way out.

           She POINTS, to a building down below, CITY HALL.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        I think we go for it. There’s never 
                        gonna be a better distraction. Then 
                        we get your daughter.

                                 PINE
                        I think you’re right. Considering 
                        that we just killed a thousand 
                        people--

                                 ROONEY
                        I. I killed them. You’ll be haunted 
                        by enough ghosts, you don’t need 
                        these ones too.

                                 PINE
                        What about you?

                                 ROONEY
                        I never planned on leaving this town.
                                 PINE
                        Then, uh-- let’s circle down, pick 
                        people off as we go if we need to, 
                        we can be there in ten minutes and-- 
                        and we’ll make our move.

           Rooney NODS. Guns in hand, they move towards the car.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        I--

           A bullet tears through Pine’s throat from behind.

           A BULLET TEARS THROUGH PINE’S THROAT FROM BEHIND.

           A BULLET--

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        R-R-Rooney--

           Pine falls to the ground. He lands on his face, gargling on his 
           blood. Rooney SPINS, her gun already flying up as she does--

           THREE MEN descending on her. Rooney squeezes off THREE SHOTS--

           They fall dead. Rooney falls to her knees over Pine. She 
           presses a hand over the hole in his throat. But he’s going.

                                 PINE (CONT’D)
                        My-- daugh--

                                 ROONEY
                        Shh, shh, I’ll get her. It’s okay. 
                        I’ll--

           And Pine is dead, his eyes staring off, looking nowhere. 
           Rooney hangs her head. For a second. Then LOOKS UP.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE - MINUTES LATER

           Rooney runs through the streets. Keeping to the shadows.

           AERIAL SHOT-- Showing us that MOBS OF PEOPLE are winding 
           their way through the streets, weapons drawn, from up here it 
           looks kind of like a life or death version of Pac-Man.

           ON ROONEY as she rounds a corner and sees, in front of her--
           CITY HALL. GUARDS mill around the front. She draws her gun, 
           starts to move towards it-- but STOPS. She grits her teeth. 

                                 ROONEY
                        Motherfucker.
           She TURNS and runs BACK in the other direction.

           MINUTES LATER -- Rooney rounds another corner. There before 
           her-- THE SCHOOL.

           The front doors are OPEN. PARENTS stream out of the building 
           carrying screaming, crying children. The PRINCIPAL stands by 
           the door, trying to catch parents’ attention--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        It’s safer if we keep them all here 
                        until the threat has been 
                        eradicated! Please! It’s--

           Parents PUSH PAST HIM without stopping. Rooney lowers her 
           head, tucks her gun away, and walks towards the BACK DOOR of 
           the school. A GUARD looks up as she approaches.

                                 GUARD
                        This door stays closed, if you’re 
                        here for your kid--

           Rooney SHOOTS him. Then SHOOTS the lock on the door.

           INT. SCHOOL - MORNING

           The hallways MOSTLY EMPTY NOW, the school mostly abandoned. 
           Rooney moves through the halls. She STOPS, listens-- the 
           faint sound of music somewhere close by. She pushes INTO--

           INT. SCHOOL / EMPTY CLASSROOM - MORNING

           An EMPTY classroom. But there’s a DOOR on the far side. She 
           moves towards it. As she nears, the sound on the other side 
           of the wall COMES INTO FOCUS--

           It’s the SESAME STREET THEME SONG.

           “Sunny days, sweeping the clouds away.”

           Rooney STOPS. Listens for a moment. BRIEF MEMORY FLASHES OF--

           Rooney DANCING with Tom in the front yard of their house.

           “On my way to where the air is sweet.”

           Rooney and Tom spin in a circle. She gives him a kiss.

           “Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street.”

           Rooney PUSHES OPEN THE DOOR and steps through.
           INT. SCHOOL / CLASSROOM - MORNING

           “Come and play! Everything's A-OK!”

           Rooney stands at the back of the room. Takes it in. A bright 
           pink rug. Big brightly colored letters stapled to the walls. 

           A chalkboard bearing a buttload of misspelled words, and, at 
           the top, the name “MS. APPLEBLOSSOM.”

           Sesame Street playing on the TV. TWO DOZEN KIDS sitting in 
           desks, facing away. ONE BY ONE, they turn to look at Rooney.

           “Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street.”

                                 KID 1
                        You’re not supposed to be here.

           Rooney scans faces-- then SEES HER. A little girl with a 
           telling RED BOW in her hair. EVE. Rooney feels behind her. 
           Gun tucked into her waistband. Good.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (O.S.)
                        Okay, kids!

           An adorable woman walks through the door. Polka-dot blouse, 
           sweet round cheeks. We know her. She’s the cute girl from the 
           funeral. She’s the girl who dick-fucked Jack Stone to death.

           She’s the town’s elementary school teacher.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        For those of you whose parents are-- 
                        are still on the way, our day of 
                        lockdown fun continues with FINGER 
                        PAINTING! Who’s ready for some--

           She glances up, sees Rooney, goes pale.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        ...finger painting?

           Rooney and Ms. Appleblossom are deer in one another’s 
           respective headlights. The kids in between them looking back 
           and forth. Ms. Appleblossom keeps her eyes locked on Rooney.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        Nothing to worry about, kids. It 
                        simply seems we have an unexpected 
                        visitor today.

           Rooney watches Ms. Appleblossom just as carefully as Ms. 
           Appleblossom watches her.
                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        And what do we say when we have 
                        visitors? You all know it. On three...

           Ms. Appleblossom does her best to GRIN-- it’s grotesque.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        One... Two...

           Rooney’s hand tightens on her gun.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM (CONT’D)
                        Three!

                                 ALL KIDS
                        WELCOME TO OUR CLASSROOM!

           Ms. Appleblossom quick draws a pistol just as Rooney draws 
           her own weapon. They both fire. They both MISS.

           Appleblossum DIVES behind a desk. Rooney runs towards it, 
           looks behind it. Nobody there. Appleblossum LURCHES TOWARDS 
           HER from behind-- PENCILS in hand.

           Rooney turns, grabs Appleblossom’s wrists, stops the pencils 
           millimeters from her eyes. She KNEES Appleblossum’s crotch.

           Appleblossum grabs a crayon off her desk and STABS Rooney in 
           the side of the head with it. THEY TRADE BLOWS, grabbing 
           classroom objects, beating at each other with them, markers, 
           tape dispensers, what have you.

           Appleblossum TRIPS on the hem of her sundress, FALLS. Rooney 
           descends on her. Appleblossum looks up just in time to see--

           Rooney REIGNING A STAPLES “EASY” BUTTON down into her face.

                                 MS. APPLEBLOSSOM
                        NO--

           BAM! The Easy button slams into her forehead. “That was easy.”

           BAM! Again. “That was easy.”

           AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN until Appleblossom’s face is a fucking 
           caved-in pile of trash, and one final time for good measure--

           “That was easy.”

           Rooney stands. Wipes Appleblossom’s blood off her face. The 
           kids look from Appleblossom’s body to Rooney and back again.

                                 ROONEY
                        Now hold on--
                                 KID 1
                        GET HER!

           The kids strike Wing Chun poses-- DRAW KNIVES-- and CHARGE 
           towards Rooney. Rooney PUNCHES KID 1 IN THE FACE*.

           Kid 1’s teeth fly out of his face as he’s knocked sideways. 
           No time to follow up on that-- KID 2 is FLYING TOWARDS HER, 
           knife sticking through two knuckles of her clenched fist.

           Rooney leaps into the air and KICKS. The kick takes Kid 2 in 
           the stomach and sends her flying back INTO the other 
           students, who fall like dominoes.

           EVE runs towards Rooney. She LEAPS at her, hands clenched 
           into fists--

           And Rooney GRABS HER out of the air. Holding her to her 
           chest, she turns, RUNS to the door, reaches it--

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL / HALLWAY - MORNING

           --And SLIPS OUT into the hallway. She rounds a corner. Up 
           ahead, a DOUBLE GLASS DOOR marking a SIDE ENTRANCE. Eve 
           YELLS, SCRATCHES and SLAPS at her face.

                                 EVE
                        NO! LET ME DOWN!

                                 ROONEY
                        You’re Eve, right?! Your father 
                        sent me! To save you!

                                 EVE
                        Where is he?!

           Rooney BARRELS towards the glass door, obviously LOCKED--

                                 ROONEY
                        CLOSE YOUR EYES!

           Eve obeys. Rooney LEAPS, SPINNING BACKWARDS AS SHE DOES, and 
           SMASHES BACKWARDS through the glass door.

           EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

           Rooney STUMBLES but regains her footing. With Eve still in 
           her arms, she SPRINTS away from the school. As Rooney RUNS--

                                 EVE
                        My Dad’s dead. Isn’t he?

           *Author's Note: At least she’s not killing them?
                                 ROONEY
                        I’m getting you out of here. It’s 
                        what he wanted.

           Eve processes this impossible thing for about two seconds.

                                 EVE
                        Put me down. It’ll be faster.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           Rooney and Eve sprint sideways through a neighborhood. They 
           ROUND a corner. A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE ahead of them.

                                 ROONEY
                        Fuck.

               EVE
                            ROONEY (CONT'D)
           Bad word.
                        Come on.

           They round ANOTHER CORNER-- a group of people that way, too. 
           They VEER into a backyard.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

           They RUN halfway across the yard-- then Rooney STOPS. She 
           grabs Eve’s shoulders, making her stop too. DISTANT VOICES 
           closing in from all directions.

                                 EVE
                        What do we do?

           Rooney glances around, then SCOOPS Eve up and carries her 
           towards a LARGE DOGHOUSE on the edge of the yard.

                                 ROONEY
                        Hide in here. I’ll be back for you.

           Eve clambers into the doghouse, then turns back to Rooney.

                                 EVE
                        You promise you’ll come back?

                                 ROONEY
                        Yes.

                                 EVE
                        You were my Dad’s friend?

                                 ROONEY
                        I-- yes I was.
                                 EVE
                        What’s your name?

                                 ROONEY
                        It’s Rooney.

           Rooney looks into this little girl’s eyes. She brushes a lock 
           of hair over her ear. The VOICES growing ever louder.

                                 EVE
                        I’m Eve.

                                 ROONEY
                        It’s nice to meet you. Stay out of 
                        sight. I’ll be back.

           Eve puts her hand on Rooney’s cheek. Rooney turns and RUNS 
           towards the back of the house.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           She runs down the street. She SPRINTS AROUND A CORNER-- 

           And finds herself FACE TO FACE with a group of people. She 
           SHOOTS one woman in the head. A MAN ducks the swing of her 
           gun, POPS back up, PUNCHES HER IN THE FACE--

           And as Rooney FALLS TO THE GROUND we--

                               CUT TO BLACK.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 1,385

           QUICK FLASHES-- AERIAL SHOT of the town burning.

           A few streams of people attempt to hike down the steep cliff 
           on the North side of the town.

           A MAN carries Rooney’s unconscious body down the street.

                       BLACK. BLACK FOR A LONG TIME.

           INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rooney’s eyes FLY OPEN. THE MAYOR’s eyes look down at her. 

           WIDER to reveal the scope of this here situation. ROONEY sits 
           strapped to a desk chair in the middle of the office. The 
           Mayor sits on his desk. Still in his suit. Gun in his hand.

           Rooney looks around wildly. Prosthetic Nose stands guard.
           INT. CITY HALL - DAY

           The hallway outside of the Mayor’s office. Filled with other 
           guards. The hallway smoky from the fire outside.

           INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           The Mayor spins his gun on his hand and looks at Rooney.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Rooney. Rooney Brown. Rooney Brown 
                        Brown Brown Brown Brown. That’s a 
                        stupid fucking name.

                                 ROONEY
                        I have a st--

           Rooney COUGHS, then SPITS a massive goopy wad of BLOOD onto 
           the floor. She clears her throat.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        I have a stupid name, and I still 
                        managed to kill everyone you know 
                        and love. Suck my dick.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Would that I could, little sheep.

                                 ROONEY
                        Do you know how many people I 
                        killed to get to you?

                                 THE MAYOR
                        No. How many?

                                 ROONEY
                        I don’t know. I lost track after four 
                        hundred. Must be over a thousand. I 
                        killed more than one thousand people 
                        so I could shoot you in the head.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        You kill my granddaughter, too? Down 
                        in that school?
               (beat)
                        I guess it doesn’t matter anymore, 
                        does it?

           ON ROONEY’S HANDS bound behind her back. She wriggles her 
           right hand-- the hand that’s NOW MISSING A FINGER. Thus, a 
           little looser than the left hand. POP! Her thumb escapes its 
           joint. Her face doesn’t give it away.
                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why I woke you up. The 
                        damage you’ve done, no amount of pain 
                        would be satisfying enough. Except if 
                        I told you... No. I couldn’t.

                                 ROONEY
                        Tell me or kill me, you fuck, you’ve 
                        clearly already decided so there’s no 
                        point in monologuing at me--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Don’t you want to know. Why your 
                        father died? Haven’t you been 
                        wondering that your whole life?

           This hits Rooney.

                                 ROONEY
                        He was taken out. By a contract 
                        killer, he worked for Whitewater--

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Is that what the fat black fucker 
                        told you? What was his name? 
                        Fuckowitz? Birkenstocks?

           ON ROONEY’S HANDS behind her back. The hand with the stab 
           wound and the missing finger, it’s bleeding again. Bleeding a 
           lot. The blood lubricates the rope, the hand. She wriggles 
           closer to being free. The Mayor leans towards her.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s no accident that you were so 
                        good at killing. It’s in your blood. 
                        Your father was one of us.

                                 ROONEY
                        Stop it.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        It’s true. He wasn’t the first to try 
                        to escape, or the last. In spite of 
                        the protection we offer, in spite of 
                        giving him a safe fucking cozy place 
                        to grow old... he left. Found a wife, 
                        a daughter. Then we found him. Your 
                        boss put together who your father was, 
                        realized killing was in your blood.

                                 ROONEY
                        Berkowitz knew Sunnyvale existed?
                                 THE MAYOR
                        Your government always knew. They 
                        just couldn’t do anything about us. 
                        And when their priorities changed, 
                        they realized they could use us. You 
                        were trained to kill the worst of the 
                        worst, they knew you’d balk at some 
                        of their new requests. So the choice 
                        was made to shift the scope of your 
                        operations to our purview. By my 
                        understanding, they tasked your 
                        Berkowitz with carrying it out. Or 
                        else they would have killed him too.

                                 ROONEY
                        Stop it.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        He sent you on missions where he knew 
                        we’d be waiting. We did recon on all 
                        of you. And... put your past together. 
                        That’s why I sent my daughter to kill 
                        you, because she was the best there 
                        was and I knew she could handle 
                        somebody with Sunnyvale in their 
                        blood. But look what you did.

           He looks at the scars on her cheeks.

                                 THE MAYOR (CONT’D)
                        Were those her work, at least?
               (beat)
                        That’s my girl. Berkowitz, he just 
                        fucked off somewhere. We tapped his 
                        phone of course, we know he tried to 
                        warn you. But we got you in the end. 
                        Telling you that, it doesn’t change 
                        anything, I know. I just wanted to 
                        see you realize it. Before you died.

           Beat. Then the Mayor SWINGS HIS GUN UP AT ROONEY’S HEAD--

           And she SWINGS UP HER BLOODY HAND, free of the restraints, 
           and SHOVES the gun out of the way--

           As the Mayor FIRES. The bullet BLASTS OFF two of Rooney’s 
           four remaining fingers. She SCREAMS. Even as she does, she’s 
           wrapping her THUMB and RING FINGER around the gun.

           She JERKS IT free of the Mayor’s hand and spins it around. 
           Can’t operate it properly with only two fingers remaining--
           Thank God her recently-blown-off finger is LODGED between the 
           trigger guard and the trigger. She wraps her pinkie around 
           the index finger and leverages it AGAINST THE TRIGGER--

           BAM! Prosthetic Nose goes down. 

           BAM! A bullet pierces the side of the Mayor’s throat. His 
           hands fly to his neck as he hits the ground.

           The rope loosened, Rooney WRIGGLES her other hand free-- then 
           unties her legs and kneels over the Mayor. She looks at him, 
           seething, watching blood seep out of his throat.

           He looks back at her and GRINS. Blood bubbles out from 
           between his teeth as he does.

                                 ROONEY
                        My turn to talk too much. Do you know 
                        why I’m really gonna kill you?

           Rooney cocks her gun at the Mayor’s face. She leans over, 
           grabs her backpack off his desk, pulls it to her, pulls it 
           open. And pulls out-- THE MUSIC BOX.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Is that a fucking music box?

                                 ROONEY
                        It was. It doesn’t play so well 
                        anymore. Took a bullet when you 
                        shot up my house.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        You’re gonna kill me because we 
                        shot your music box?

           Rooney looks at him for a long beat.

                                 ROONEY
                        Yes.

           She OPENS IT. The HEADLESS BALLERINA rises, begins to SPIN at 
           a tilted, awkward angle. The fucked up, off-kilter, haunted 
           music begins to play. She sets the box behind his head.

           Da-di-daaaahhh-blurrrrggg the fucked up music box tinkles on 
           in the background. Rooney looks at it.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        When I was six, my Dad went to visit 
                        my Mom in the hospital. When he came 
                        back, he gave me this music box. From 
                        when she was a little girl.
           Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-di-di-di-da the music box skipping 
           horribly in the background before continuing on.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        He told me to carry it with me 
                        wherever I went, to give it to my own 
                        daughter someday. And then, somebody 
                        from this town broke into our house 
                        and blew his brains out. I pushed that 
                        man down the stairs, and sat next to 
                        my dad’s body, trying to hold his 
                        brains in as this music played. And 
                        now I can’t ever give this to my 
                        daughter. Because you broke it and 
                        killed my husband. That’s why I’m 
                        gonna kill you.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        You couldn’t just get it fixed?

           Rooney moves the barrel of the gun towards his mouth. He 
           clamps his teeth shut. She PRESSES the barrel of the gun 
           against them until he’s forced to open up.

           She sticks the gun as far back in his throat as it will go. 
           And for a long moment they just look at each other. We PAN UP 
           to the music box, sitting RIGHT BEHIND HIS HEAD.

           The headless ballerina continues her dance. The music stops 
           but she keeps spinning, spinning in the silence.

           From offscreen-- BANG!

           Rooney gets to her feet, wiping a spray of blood from her 
           face. She puts the music box back in her backpack.

           She checks her gun-- empty. She picks up Prosthetic Nose’s 
           gun, braces herself, then KICKS OPEN the door to the hallway--

           INT. CITY HALL / HALLWAY - DAY

           It’s EMPTY. The guards, they’ve taken off.

           EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

           The whole town burning. Rooney walks out of city hall.

           ROONEY KILL COUNT -- 1,407 (PEOPLE ARE STILL BURNING TO DEATH)
           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - DAY

           The Mayor’s GUARDS walk dejectedly towards the edge of town.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

           Rooney walks down the street. She hears a sound and WHIRLS 
           AROUND, gun raised. A FAMILY OF FOUR runs in the other 
           direction. Rooney lowers her gun.

           LATER -- Rooney comes across Pine’s dead body, still facedown 
           in the backyard where she left him.

           She grabs him, HOISTS him up, throws him over her shoulder.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / STREET - DAY

           Rooney carries Pine’s body down the street. 

           As she walks, PINE’S PLYMOUTH FURY comes into view ahead-- it 
           has rolled gently into a telephone pole and come to a stop. 
           Rooney smiles, walks towards it.

           EXT. SUNNYVALE / TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Rooney sets Pine’s body onto the platform. Uses the pulley 
           system to lower him into the pit. Everything around, on fire.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET

           The winding road out of town. THREE HUNDRED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
           CHILDREN, covered in soot and grime, walk despondently down 
           the road. A CAR ENGINE approaching. The kids PART--

           And Rooney DRIVES PAST THEM in the Plymouth Fury. They look 
           after her-- then wordlessly continue their march.

           INT. CAR - SUNSET

           Rooney drives. Determined. Eyes on the road. Leaving town.

                                 EVE (O.S.)
                        Can I sit up now?

           Rooney glances over her shoulder. EVE lies in the backseat.

                                 ROONEY
                        Yeah, sweetie. You can sit up.
                                 EVE
                        Where are we going?

                                 ROONEY
                        Have you ever been to Hawaii?

           EXT. HAWAII / CLIFFSIDE - SUNSET

           It’s Hawaii. It’s a cliffside. It’s sunset. It’s predictably 
           beautiful. BERKOWITZ sits in a folding chair. A COOLER FULL 
           OF BEER next to him.

           Far down below, a white sand beach. Back off of the beach, a 
           Hilton. ROONEY walks up behind him. He doesn’t see her.

                                 ROONEY
                        Hey Larry.

           Berkowitz starts to turn around--

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t turn around.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Rooney. What are you doing here?

                                 ROONEY
                        What are you doing?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Me? Oh. Just drinking some beers, 
                        watching the sunset.

                                 ROONEY
                        I can see that. I don’t blame you. 
                        Beautiful day. You here alone?

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        No.

                                 ROONEY
                        Of course you are. Which sucks. 
                        Because now you’re in such a position 
                        that you’re up here, and I’m up here, 
                        but besides the two of us there’s not 
                        anyone else around. How about that?

           Berkowitz turns around. Rooney draws her pistol, takes aim 
           square at his forehead.

                                 ROONEY (CONT’D)
                        Stay right there.
                                 BERKOWITZ
                        You gonna shoot me?

                                 ROONEY
                        Not unless you make me.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Given the circumstances of us both being 
                        here, I don’t really know what to say.

                                 ROONEY
                        You killed my husband.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        I thought they’d only kill you. And 
                        when you got out, I really hoped you 
                        were out.

                                 ROONEY
                        Nobody gets out. Not really. Somebody 
                        told me that once.
               (beat)
                        Hey Berkowitz. Do you remember twenty 
                        seconds ago, when I said I wasn’t 
                        gonna shoot you? Unless you made me?

           She motions with her gun to the edge of the cliff. Berkowitz 
           walks to the edge. Looks down. SHARP ROCKS jut out of the 
           water at the base of the cliff. He turns back.

                                 BERKOWITZ
                        Rooney.

           She shrugs.

                                 ROONEY
                        Your call.

           For a few seconds, he just stands there. Then he THRUSTS his 
           arms out. And PLUMMETS backwards off the edge of the cliff. 
           WE FOLLOW HIM as he falls. Just before he hits the rocks--

           Back to Rooney. She lowers her gun. Hard to read her face.

           EXT. BEACH - EVENING

           EVE splashes around in the surf. Rooney stands on the beach. 
           Watching her. A LARGE WAVE sweeps up onto the beach. Eve 
           SHRIEKS and runs back towards Rooney.

           LATER -- Rooney and Eve sit on the shore, watching the last 
           of the sunset drain from the sky.
                                 ROONEY
                        Hey. I’ve got something for you.

           Rooney reaches into her backpack and pulls out THE MUSIC BOX. 
           The bullet hole in the side repaired.

                                 EVE
                        What is it?

                                 ROONEY
                        It was broken.
               (beat)
                        But I fixed it.

           Eve opens it. The ballerina rises, unbroken, and begins to 
           dance. The music starts to play, soft and lyrical again.

           And for the first time in a long time, Rooney SMILES.

           SUPERIMPOSE -- FINAL KILL COUNT -- 1,408.

           Not bad.

                      THE END
