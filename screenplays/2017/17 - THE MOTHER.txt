           A YOUNG WOMAN from behind.  (cid:13)
           Gazes out the window.

           The street is DESERTED.  (cid:13)
           But she seems to be staring beyond it.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Who is the father?

           MOANS.  RAW.  LOUD --

           INT. HACIENDA - CUBA - NIGHT (THE PAST)

           The Woman and HECTOR (sleek, feral) have sex.  (cid:13)
           Thrilling sex.(cid:13)
           Too bad it's just finishing.  

           They fall back onto the bed.(cid:13)
           Glistening.(cid:13)
           Out of breath.(cid:13)
           Shuddering from the power of the orgasm.

                                 HECTOR
                        I love you.

           He speaks in Spanish.(cid:13)
           The Woman smiles.  (cid:13)
           That's it.(cid:13)
           It's telling.(cid:13)
           Hector ignores what it's telling him.

                                 HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        I have something for you.

           He stands.  (cid:13)
           Naked.  (cid:13)
           Unashamed.(cid:13)
           Throws open the double doors of the suite.

                                 HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Bring it in.

           TARANTULA (beady eyes, spider tat crawling up his neck). (cid:13)
           Brings it in.(cid:13)
           "It" being a custom made SNIPER RIFLE.(cid:13)
           A YELLOW HAPPY FACE covers the scope cap.

                                 HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        You like?

           The Woman handles the weapon with ease.(cid:13)
           With excitement.
                                 THE WOMAN
                        I love.

           She stretches out on the bed.(cid:13)
           Powerful in her sexuality.(cid:13)
           A girl and her gun.(cid:13)
           Godard would be proud.

                                 HECTOR
                        I want you to use it for me.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        When?

           Hector leans back.(cid:13)
           Gazes at her with frank admiration.

                                 HECTOR
                        Soon.

           INT. BEDROOM - SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           The Woman stares out the window. (cid:13)
           With bombed out eyes.(cid:13)
           A shadow of that carefree girl in Hector's bed.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        Who else knows I'm here?

           She fidgets.(cid:13)
           Nervous.(cid:13)
           Barely keeping it together.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        No one outside of my office.

           An OLDER CIA AGENT (STONE) sits at the table behind her.(cid:13)
           A YOUNGER CIA AGENT (CRUISE) ready to take notes beside him.

                                 STONE
                        And as soon as you give us more than
                        a list of demands, we're prepared to
                        move both of you into WITSEC.

           The Woman says nothing.

                                 CRUISE
                        There's six agents here.  You're
                        safe.

           The Woman wants to believe that.(cid:13)
           Doesn't.
                                 STONE
                        Look, we don't have time for kid
                        gloves.  Skyjacking.  That's what's
                        on the table here.  If you've really
                        gotten your hands on a program that
                        can hack our drone database --

           A GUNSHOT.(cid:13)
           The bullet SHATTERS a window.(cid:13)
           SMASHES into Stone's forehead.(cid:13)
           BLOOD sprays.  (cid:13)
           "Database" was his last word.  

           Cruise drags The Woman to the ground --

                                 CRUISE
                            (into his earpiece:)
                        Agent down.  I repeat, Stone's down. 
                        We've got a sniper on the left side
                        of the house --

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           On the MOVE with Cruise and The Woman.  (cid:13)
           FAST.  (cid:13)
           FRANTIC. (cid:13)
           GUNSHOTS echo.  (cid:13)
           Cruise's ear piece CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER --

                                 RADIO (V.O.)
                        Shots from the south end...how many
                        are there?...shit...

                                 CRUISE
                        Have we been breached?  Are they in
                        the house --

                                 THE WOMAN
                        He won't enter until he knows it's
                        clear.

           He.  (cid:13)
           One man.(cid:13)
           Cruise absorbs that.

                                 CRUISE
                            (into the radio:)
                        Give me an exit route now...
                            (static, then:)
                        Someone talk to me --

           INT. STAIRS - SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           Cruise out front.  (cid:13)
           The Woman behind.
           An AGENT at the foot of the stairs.  (cid:13)
           Bullet in the chest.  (cid:13)
           Cruise moves to check for signs of life.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        Don't --

           The amount of time Cruise spent in the light of the window?(cid:13)
           Just half a second.

           BANG!  

           A bullet RIPS through the wall.  (cid:13)
           SMASHES into his chest.  (cid:13)
           He drops like a sack of wheat.(cid:13)
           Hyperventilating BLOOD.(cid:13)
           The bullet punctured a lung.

           The Woman presses her back to the wall.(cid:13)
           Out of the light of the window.(cid:13)
           Listens.  (cid:13)
           Just Cruise's watery WHEEZING.(cid:13)
           No more gunshots.

           There's only one person left to kill.

           The Woman grabs Cruise's GUN.(cid:13)
           Hesitates.  (cid:13)
           Every instinct is telling her to move on.(cid:13)
           Leave Cruise to bleed out.(cid:13)
           Protect herself...

           INT. KITCHEN - SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           The Woman grits her teeth.(cid:13)
           Drags Cruise across the tiled floor.(cid:13)
           His blood trail in their wake.  

           The Woman ransacks drawers and cabinets.  Finds...  

           SUPER GLUE.(cid:13)
           FOIL.  (cid:13)
           BIRTHDAY CANDLES.  (cid:13)
           A HALF-FILLED GLASS OF WATER.  

           The Woman tears Cruise's shirt open.(cid:13)
           Rinses his wound.  (cid:13)
           Fills the oozing bullet hole with super glue.  (cid:13)
           Squeezes it closed.

           Cruise writhes in pain.  (cid:13)
           Tries to speak.  (cid:13)
           Coughs up nothing but blood.

           The Woman moves on without ceremony...
           INT. BATHROOM - SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           The Woman empties a SHAMPOO BOTTLE.  (cid:13)
           Fills it with DRAINO from under the sink.  (cid:13)
           Adds WATER.  (cid:13)
           A little FOIL.  (cid:13)
           Breaks a BIRTHDAY CANDLE in half.  (cid:13)
           Sticks it through the top of the shampoo bottle.  (cid:13)
           Lights it.  (cid:13)
           Places it behind the door.  (cid:13)
           Climbs into the bathtub.  (cid:13)
           Pulls the shower curtain closed, and -- 

           Waits.

           The birthday candle melts. 

                                          And melts.

                                                       And melts.

           It's quiet. (cid:13)
           So fucking quiet.  

           The door CRACKS open.  (cid:13)
           A FLASH of movement through the gauzy shower curtain.(cid:13)
           The Woman fires Cruise's gun.

           BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  

           Three shots.  (cid:13)
           In a controlled arc. 

           A GRUNT.(cid:13)
           IMPACT.  (cid:13)
           The curtain is ripped aside by --

           ALEXEI (dead shark eyes, brutish, cold to Hector's hot).(cid:13)
           A fresh BULLET WOUND in his arm.  (cid:13)
           But he's still got his gun trained on The Woman.  (cid:13)
           A standoff.

                                 ALEXEI
                        Close range.  Not exactly our
                        specialty.

           He looks down at her.  (cid:13)
           With the barest hint of a smile.

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        But I guess I've got the advantage. 
                        Two hostages to your one.  

           What the hell is he talking about?  (cid:13)
           The Woman's belly answers the question.
           REVEAL -- she's 8 months pregnant.

           The birthday candle melts.(cid:13)
           But not fast enough.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        Alexei, please.  Listen, I'll show
                        you where --

                                 ALEXEI
                        I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANOTHER FUCKING
                        CHANCE TO ESCAPE!?!

           They strike like cougars. (cid:13)
           At the same time.(cid:13)
           He kicks her gun away.(cid:13)
           She knocks his arm to the side.  

           BANG!  

           The stray bullet splinters the ceiling.(cid:13)
           She TWISTS his wrist.(cid:13)
           Forces him to release his gun.  (cid:13)
           But he already has a KNIFE pulled in his other hand, and --

           He STABS The Woman in her pregnant belly.  

           She SCREAMS in agony.(cid:13)
           We practically feel it ourselves.  

           She summons all her strength.  (cid:13)
           Kicks Alexei back.  (cid:13)
           Ducks into the tub because, finally -- 

           KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

           INT. LOBBY - CIA - NIGHT

           The Woman stumbles through the front door.  (cid:13)
           Covered in BLOOD.  (cid:13)
           Bleeding.  (cid:13)
           Clutching her belly.  

           In LABOR.  

           She collapses on the CIA symbol covering the tiled floor.  (cid:13)
           As AGENTS rush to help her --

                                                          SMASH TO WHITE.

           Two words bleed onto the screen:

                                T H E  M O T H E R
           Slowly FADE IN.(cid:13)
           As if coming back to life from the dead...

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Agent Cruise wakes in a hospital bed.  (cid:13)
           Lit by the blue glow of machines.(cid:13)
           A BREATHING TUB down his throat.

           Someone's in the room with him.

           Hidden in shadow.(cid:13)
           He TENSES. (cid:13)
           Finger inching towards the call button.

           Another inch...

                            Another...

                                          Almost there...  

           The shadow moves.  (cid:13)
           Into the light --

           THE WOMAN.  (cid:13)
           Weak.(cid:13)
           Post c-section.  (cid:13)
           In stolen O.R. scrubs.  

                                 THE WOMAN
                        Find...a safe home for the baby...and
                        I'll...give you...the program.

           She sways.(cid:13)
           Unsteady on her feet.    (cid:13)
           Desperate.  (cid:13)
           Determined.

           He shakes his head.(cid:13)
           Pulls at the breathing tube.(cid:13)
           Also desperate.  (cid:13)
           Also determined.

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Alexei will destroy...everything to
                        find me.  And he always finds me...

           Cruise finally drags the tube out --

                                 CRUISE
                        You...saved my life --

                                 THE WOMAN
                        You can't protect me.  So protect
                        her.
           INT. NICU - NIGHT

           A WINDOW separates us from a beautiful BABY GIRL.  (cid:13)
           In an incubator.  (cid:13)
           A BANDAGE covers half her tiny face.  

           The Woman's reflection appears in the glass.  (cid:13)
           She takes one last look at her daughter...

           INT. BATHROOM - STADIUM - DAY (THE PAST)

           The noise of a SOCCER GAME echoes.  (cid:13)
           The Woman leans against the cramped stall door.(cid:13)
           Stares at something in her hands.(cid:13)
           A million thoughts running through her head.

           bangbangbang!  

           An open palm against the stall door.(cid:13)
           Someone can't hold it any longer.  (cid:13)
           The Woman drops...

           A PREGNANCY TEST. (cid:13)
           Into the toilet...

           INT. HALLWAY - STADIUM - DAY (THE PAST)

           The Woman moves through a throng of rabid SPORTS FANS.

           She's grabbed from behind.  (cid:13)
           Pulled into a dark corner by --

           ALEXEI.(cid:13)
           SLAMS her up against the wall.  (cid:13)
           Menace in his eyes.

           No.(cid:13)
           Not menace.(cid:13)
           LUST.

           He KISSES her hungrily.(cid:13)
           Like he owns her.  (cid:13)

                        Hi?  

           She throws a paranoid glance around the corner...  

           Hector's thug TARANTULA.(cid:13)
           Snakes through the crowd.  (cid:13)
           Looking for her.

                        Tell me you aren't risking getting
                        caught to say hi.

           Alexei shrugs. (cid:13)
           Lights a CIGARETTE.(cid:13)
           Offers to The Woman.  (cid:13)
           She ashes it.  (cid:13)
           Places it back on his lips.

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hector doesn't like smokers.

                                 ALEXEI
                        I don't give a fuck what he likes.

           He possessively wraps his arms around her waist. (cid:13)
           Eyes her curves.  (cid:13)
           His curves.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        He told me about the buy.

           Alexei's eyes SNAP back to The Woman's.(cid:13)
           "The buy" interests him.  (cid:13)
           More than the curves that belong to him.

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        He wants me there.  Next Sunday.

                                 THE WOMAN

           Alexei takes a deep drag.(cid:13)
           Contemplates a million details.  (cid:13)
           The Woman looks at him.  (cid:13)
           Raw.  (cid:13)
           Open.

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        We're done after this.  Right?  

           Alexei smiles.(cid:13)
           A devil's head grin.

                        Not paying attention to the situation brewing.  (cid:13)
                        Too busy flirting with a SUBURBAN DAD.

                        The scope hovers over him.  (cid:13)
                        It'd be a clean shot.

                        That Black Van circling towards them...

           The Mother tenses.(cid:13)
           Finger curving around the trigger...
           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        The Black Van gets closer.  (cid:13)

           Takes her finger off the trigger.  (cid:13)
           She overreacted.  (cid:13)
           But...

           Something still feels off.(cid:13)
           She raises the rifle again...

           EXT. PARKING LOT - PARK - DAY

           POLICE SIRENS in the distance.  (cid:13)
           Zoe shakes her unconscious Mother like a rag doll.  (cid:13)
           Streaks of tears run down her cheeks.  

                                 ZOE
                        Mom, get up.  Please, get up --

                        Zoe!

           Zoe turns in a daze.  (cid:13)
           The Mother GRABS her before she can process what's happening.  (cid:13)
           She struggles against this stranger.  (cid:13)
           Scared out of her mind.  

                                 ZOE
                        Let me go --
           Tarantula peeks from behind that bench.  (cid:13)
           The Mother struggles with a freaked out Zoe in her arms.  (cid:13)
           Distracted.  (cid:13)
           He raises his gun --  

           BANG!  BANG! 

           The Mother spins for cover.(cid:13)
           Behind a car.  (cid:13)
           Gets CLIPPED in the arm by a bullet.  (cid:13)
           She drops Zoe.  (cid:13)
           Who immediately makes a run for it.  

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Zoe, no --

           BANGBANGBANG!  

           Tarantula lays down fire.(cid:13)
           To keep The Mother trapped behind the car.  (cid:13)
           Dashes after the little girl. 

           The Mother pulls her 9mm.(cid:13)
           Rises to fire, but...

           Tarantula's got Zoe in his arms.(cid:13)
           Uses her as a shield.(cid:13)
           Gun to her tiny forehead. 

           The Mother tracks Tarantula and Zoe. (cid:13)
           Waiting for a clear shot.  (cid:13)
           That she doesn't get.

           Tarantula hops into the idling van with Zoe.  (cid:13)
           Speeds off. 

           RED and BLUE LIGHTS disco across The Mother's face.  (cid:13)
           Four SQUAD CARS surround her.  (cid:13)
           Cutting off any chance she had of pursuing.  

           POLICE MEN crouch behind open doors.  (cid:13)
           Guns trained on her.(cid:13)
           The only threat in sight.

           A NURSE tends to her gunshot wound.  (cid:13)

                        Not a word. 

           Near the nurse's station.(cid:13)
           Two DETECTIVES (BARNEY & FIFE) observe.

                                 FIFE (CONT'D)
                        And no ransom demand yet.  

                                 BARNEY
                        You see that rifle we found on the
                        roof?  She has to be a part of it.  

                                 FIFE
                        Seems to me the Cubans --

                        I thought they were Mexican?

                        -- with bullets in them were the
                        kidnappers.  It's like...

                                 BARNEY
                        Like what?

                                 FIFE
                        Like she was trying to stop them.

           Barney tries to digest that.(cid:13)
           Can't.

                                 BARNEY
                        She shot the girl's mother.

                        Compared to...?

                                 FIFE
                        The kill shots in everyone else.

           The Mother in a prison jump suit.  (cid:13)

           A few LATINA GANGBANGERS side-eye her from their cells...

           CLANG!  

           The door slides closed.  (cid:13)
           The Mother lays down on the bare mattress...

           EXT. DESERT HILLSIDE - CUBA - DAY (THE PAST)

           The Woman lies on her stomach in the dirt.(cid:13)
           Eye to that custom sniper rifle Hector gifted her.

           THROUGH THE SCOPE: 

                        A lone BLACK SEDAN.(cid:13)

                        Here they come, baby.

           His honey-laced Spanish.(cid:13)
           Buzzes from the EARPIECE in The Woman's ear.

                                 ALEXEI (O.S.)
                        Something's wrong.

           The Woman looks over the rifle's barrel.(cid:13)
           Alexei is laid out beside her.  (cid:13)
           His eyes through a pair of binoculars.  (cid:13)
           Her spotter.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        What do you see?

                                 ALEXEI
                        Not down there.  I know you. 
                        Something's bothering you.
           The Woman looks off.(cid:13)
           He does know her.  (cid:13)
           And something is bothering her.  

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        Did it get real?

                                 THE WOMAN
                        No --

                                 ALEXEI
                        You're in love with him --

                                 THE WOMAN
                        He's the mark.

                                 ALEXEI
                        I don't like surprises.

           A lethal beat.(cid:13)
           The Woman has one hell of a surprise for him.  

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        We're in position.

           He turns his eyes back to his binoculars.(cid:13)
           Back to the task at hand.

                        Stepping out in front of the Humvees.(cid:13)
                        The target.

           The Woman adjusts. (cid:13)
           Alexei watches her every move.

                        Whenever you're ready.
           The Woman takes a deep breath.(cid:13)
           Flexes her finger on the trigger.  (cid:13)
           Alexei's body TENSES.  (cid:13)
           He's impatient.  (cid:13)
           Finally --

           BANG!

           INT. CELL - JAIL - DAY

           The arm sling is crumpled on the floor.  (cid:13)
           The Mother does her exercises.  (cid:13)
           Methodical.  (cid:13)
           Rep after rep.  (cid:13)
           Feels like she's been up all night. 

           She has.  

           The cell block opens...

           CIA AGENT CRUISE enters.  (cid:13)
           10 YEARS OLDER.  

           He's aged well.  

           The Mother doesn't react at all.  (cid:13)
           Cruise opens a THIN file.  (cid:13)
           Pulls out a BALLPOINT PEN.  (cid:13)
           CLICKS it once.

                                 CRUISE
                        There's not much in your file.  Ex-

           CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.(cid:13)
           Cruise fiddles with his pen.  (cid:13)
           A nervous habit.

                        But that's fine.  I don't care about
                        any of that.  I'll talk to a ghost
                        if it means saving a little girl.

           CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.(cid:13)
           The Mother remains silent.

                                 CRUISE (CONT'D)
                        Your people still have her.  No
                        contact.  No demands.  So I'm here
                        to ask what you want us to do.  To
                        get her back safely.

           CLICK CLICK CLICK.(cid:13)
           Not a peep from The Mother.  (cid:13)
           Cruise swallows his annoyance. 

                                 CRUISE (CONT'D)
                        This case might be FBI jurisdiction. 
                        But I know this family personally. 
                        They're good people.  And I'm going
                        to do whatever it takes to get their
                        little girl back to them.

           Cruise pauses.(cid:13)
           Locks eyes with The Mother.(cid:13)
           To sear that point home.  

           CLICK.(cid:13)

           Morse code.

           The Mother nods.(cid:13)
           Almost imperceptible, and --

           Cruise pops like a balloon.(cid:13)
           LAUNCHES across the table.  (cid:13)
           STABS the pen into The Mother's shoulder.

                                 CRUISE (CONT'D)
                        TELL ME WHERE THE GIRL IS!?!

           He GRINDS the pen into her bullet wound.(cid:13)
           Reopens it in a gush of blood.

           GUARDS rush in.(cid:13)
           Struggle to pull him off.  
           Cruise's hand brushes across The Mother's.(cid:13)
           He slips her something.

           She quickly SWALLOWS this something.  (cid:13)
           The Guards too distracted by Cruise's rage to notice...

           INT. INFIRMARY - JAIL - DAY

           A CONSTRUCTION AREA is coned off.  (cid:13)
           Near an exposed window.(cid:13)
           No bars.  (cid:13)
           A GUARD stands watch.  

           The Mother's cuffed to a bed.  (cid:13)
           Wound re-bandaged.  (cid:13)
           She eyes the clock on the wall.  (cid:13)
           Five minutes til 3.  

           She's overtaken by a VIOLENT COUGH.(cid:13)
           Feigned cover.  (cid:13)
           She regurgitates what Cruise slipped her.  

           A lock pick.  

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Can I have some water?

           The Guard just stares at her.

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Please...

           The Guard gets up.(cid:13)
           Annoyed.(cid:13)
           Grabs a dixie cup at the sink.  

           The Mother discreetly uncuffs herself.  (cid:13)
           Eyes the window.  (cid:13)
           Just one Guard between her and escape.  

           The Guard approaches with the water.  (cid:13)
           The Mother readies to make her move...

           The door unlocks.  (cid:13)
           FIVE LATINA GANGBANGERS enter.  (cid:13)
           With PRISON WEAPONS.

                        Get out.

           The Guard turns tail.  (cid:13)
           Locks the door behind him.  

           Now five crazy bitches between The Mother and escape.(cid:13)
           The Gangbangers circle the bed.
                                 GANGBANGER (CONT'D)
                        Hector says hi, puta --

           The Mother EXPLODES. (cid:13)
           Kicks the Gangbanger at the foot of the bed.  (cid:13)
           Square in the breast.(cid:13)
           Wraps her hand around the HANDCUFFS.  (cid:13)
           Uses them like brass knuckles.  (cid:13)
           Breaking the nose of the Gangbanger on the left.  (cid:13)
           Grabs the arm of the one on the right.  (cid:13)
           Twists.  (cid:13)
           Pulls the TOOTHBRUSH SHANK from her hand.  (cid:13)
           Lodges it in her throat.  

           One down.  (cid:13)
           Four to go.

           The Mother springs off the bed.(cid:13)
           Always on the move.  (cid:13)
           Making the Gangbangers come to her.  

           She fights like she shoots.  (cid:13)
           Every blow is a kill shot.  (cid:13)
           Meant to put you down and keep you down.  

           Two down.(cid:13)
           Three down.(cid:13)
           Four.

           The Guard outside scrambles to unlock the door.(cid:13)
           The Mother jams a chair under its handle.  (cid:13)
           Throws a dead Gangbanger against it.  (cid:13)
           For extra support.

           One Gangbanger left standing.(cid:13)
           Barely.  

           The Mother BUM RUSHES her. (cid:13)
           Smashing through the bar free window...

           EXT. PARKING LOT - JAIL - DAY

           ...and uses the gangbanger's body to break the fall.  (cid:13)
           They land on the hood of a parked car.  (cid:13)
           UGLY IMPACT.

           An SUV pulls up.  (cid:13)
           The passenger door is thrown open.  (cid:13)
           Cruise is behind the wheel.

           The Mother peels herself off the dead Gangbanger...
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - BETWEEN WAREHOUSES - DAY

           A beat up, abandoned OLDSMOBILE.(cid:13)
           Wedge between dumpsters.  (cid:13)
           The SUV slides to a stop next to it.  (cid:13)
           Cruise and The Mother climb out.

                                 CRUISE
                        I've got a change of clothes for
                        you.

           Cruise pops the trunk of the Olds.(cid:13)
           Bends into it --

           The Mother SLAMS the hood down on his head.(cid:13)
           Pulls his GUN from his holster.  (cid:13)
           Jams it right up under his chin.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        You told Hector.  About Zoe --

                                 CRUISE
                        No --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        It can't just be a coincidence.  You
                        send the postcards --

                                 CRUISE
                        Every year.  Why turn on you now?

           The Mother hesitates.(cid:13)
           Cruise speaks quickly.  (cid:13)
           Can barely get a full breath.(cid:13)
           Steel jammed in his throat.

                                 CRUISE (CONT'D)
                        There's a leak in the department. 
                        To the cartels.  Hector recently
                        became their main supplier of weapons. 
                        Someone turned over the information,
                        but it wasn't me...

           The Mother steps back.(cid:13)
           Gun still trained at Cruise's head.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Get in the trunk.

                                 CRUISE
                        I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

           A long moment.(cid:13)
           Cruise stands his ground.  (cid:13)
           Finally...
           The Mother lowers the gun.  (cid:13)
           Reluctantly.   

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Do you know where Hector is?

                                 CRUISE
                        No.  I've tried all my sources. 
                        He's gone into hiding.  But there's
                        no evidence he's left the island.

           The Mother grabs clothes from the trunk.  (cid:13)
           Changes.  (cid:13)
           Cruise diverts his eyes.  (cid:13)
           A gentlemen.

                                 CRUISE (CONT'D)
                        He...wouldn't --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        No.  He thinks she's his.

           A flash of curiosity in Cruise's expression.(cid:13)
           If not Hector, than who is the father?  

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Give me your keys.

                                 CRUISE
                        I can help --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        I can't trust your people --

                                 CRUISE
                        No CIA.  Just me.  I'm coming with
                        you --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Give me the keys.

           The Mother's got that gun back in her hand.(cid:13)
           She's going to get those keys.(cid:13)
           Whatever it takes.

                                 CRUISE
                        How are you going to get past the
                        TGF without me?

                                 THE MOTHER
                        I'll find a way.

                                 CRUISE
                        And how much time will that waste?
           EXT. WATERS OFF THE COAST OF - FLORIDA - DAY

           The island of Cuba. (cid:13)
           Just a speck on the horizon.  (cid:13)
           Cruise pilots a speed boat. (cid:13)
           Across the choppy waters...

           EXT. MARINA - CUBA - DAY

           This is how Cruise gets past the Tropas Guarda Fronteras: 

           1) He flashes his BADGE.  (cid:13)
           2) A TGF OFFICER waves his boat through.

           EXT. DOCK - CUBA - DAY

           Cruise opens a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT.  (cid:13)
           The Mother climbs out.  

                                 THE MOTHER
                        There's something I need...

           EXT. CUBAN HIGHWAY - DAY

           A rusting FOOD TRUCK powers at us.(cid:13)
           Pedal to the metal.(cid:13)
           MARCOS (twitchy, a human hummingbird) drives.

           His eyes flit to the rearview mirror.(cid:13)
           Don't like what they see.  (cid:13)
           At all.

           He swerves onto a dirt road, REVEALING --

           A GAZ 2410 on his tail.(cid:13)
           The Mother behind the wheel.  

           She swerves onto the back road.(cid:13)
           Guns the gas.(cid:13)
           Inches along side the Food Truck.  (cid:13)

           Cruise motions from the passenger seat.(cid:13)
           Pull over.  (cid:13)
           Marcos shakes his head adamantly.(cid:13)
           No chance in hell.

           The Mother lets up on the gas.(cid:13)
           The Gaz drops behind the Food Truck.  (cid:13)
           Marcos breathes relief.  (cid:13)
           It's short lived --

           The Mother's hand is out the driver's window.  (cid:13)
           GUN aimed.  (cid:13)
           She fires three shots.
           (cid:13)           Tire.  (cid:13)
           Tire.(cid:13)
           ENGINE.

           The Food Truck veers sharply.(cid:13)
           Barely balancing on bald tires.(cid:13)
           Smoke wafting from the engine.  

           Marcos twists the wheel. (cid:13)
           This way and that.  (cid:13)
           TOO HARD.  

           The Food Truck FLIPS.(cid:13)
           TUMBLES wildly across the dirt road.  

           One revolution.(cid:13)
           Two.  (cid:13)
           THREE.

           Finally it comes to a crunching stop on its head...

           INT. FOOD TRUCK - DAY

           An assortment of WEAPONS line the walls. (cid:13)
           Scatter the ceiling.  (cid:13)
           Which is now the floor.

           The Mother rummages.(cid:13)
           Bags a KNIFE.  (cid:13)
           A GLOCK.  (cid:13)
           BULLETS.

           She checks out a BLACK MARKET 9MM. (cid:13)
           SILENCER.(cid:13)
           INFRARED SIGHT.  (cid:13)
           She clicks it on.

           The RED LASER slices through the air. (cid:13)
           Lands on a beat up non-descript BLACK CASE.(cid:13)
           Looks familiar.

           The Mother pops the case open.(cid:13)
           Her eyes fill with surprise.

           It's her gift. 

           That CUSTOM MADE SNIPER RIFLE.(cid:13)
           10 YEARS LATER.(cid:13)
           Half the smiley face scratched off the scope cap...

           EXT. BACK ROAD - CUBA - DAY

           A very pissed off Marcos.(cid:13)
           Fidgets.  (cid:13)
           Spits blood.
                                 MARCOS
                        That bitch.  Almost got me killed. 
                        Now she robbin' me...

           Cruise has his gun trained.(cid:13)
           Right between Marcos's eyes.

                                 CRUISE
                        There's a safety deposit box in
                        Havana.  Half a mil.  Untraceable --

                                 MARCOS
                        Motherfucker you robbin' me.  And
                        you think I'm just gonna trust you. 
                        Fuck you --

                                 CRUISE
                        Go on a treasure hunt or die right
                        here.  Your choice.

           Marcos shuffles.(cid:13)
           From one foot to the other.  (cid:13)
           Considering...

           A RED DOT.(cid:13)
           Appears in the middle of his creased forehead.  (cid:13)
           A BULLET HOLE replaces it seconds later.  

           His LIFELESS body drops to the dirt.  

           Cruise blinks surprise.(cid:13)
           Gun still trained at the empty air.(cid:13)
           The empty air now cut by an INFRARED LINE.  (cid:13)
           His eyes follow it to...  

           THE MOTHER.(cid:13)
           Lowers the black market 9MM.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        We can't let anyone warn Hector.

           Cruise absorbs that.(cid:13)
           The finality.  (cid:13)
           There was never any other way this scenario ended.

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        This is what it's going to take to
                        get her back.  Can you handle it?

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CUBA - DAY

           A GERMAN SHEPHERD rips at a PITBULL'S throat.(cid:13)
           In a barbwire laced CAGE.
           A throng of LOWLIFES surround it.(cid:13)
           Cheering for blood.  (cid:13)
           The vibe EXPLOSIVE.

           TARANTULA.(cid:13)
           Oversees the illegal blood sport.(cid:13)
           Surrounded by his... 

           SPIDER THUGS.(cid:13)
           Snake through the crowd taking bets.  (cid:13)
           Holding the leashes of vicious ATTACK DOGS...

           INT. BATHROOM - WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The wall shakes from the adrenaline on the other side.  (cid:13)
           A SPIDER THUG hangs by the door.(cid:13)
           Tarantula sidles up to a urinal.  (cid:13)
           Right next to...

           CRUISE.(cid:13)
           They trade a cursory glance.  (cid:13)
           That's it.  (cid:13)
           Just two men pissing.

           Cruise zips up. (cid:13)
           Washes his hands.  (cid:13)
           Discreetly eyes in the mirror's REFLECTION...

           SPIDER THUG.(cid:13)
           TARANTULA.(cid:13)
           The DOOR.

           Something has Cruise's forehead creasing.(cid:13)
           Something he doesn't like...

           IN THE STALL:

                        The Mother peeks through the door crack.(cid:13)
                        BLACK BAG in hand.(cid:13)
                        9MM in back pocket.(cid:13)
                        Impatient.(cid:13)
                        Waiting for a go signal.(cid:13)
                        That Cruise isn't giving.(cid:13)
                        Why?

           Tarantula zips up.(cid:13)
           Washes his hands.

           Cruise dries his.(cid:13)
           Clocks the slow turn of the stall's lock.  (cid:13)
           Subtly shakes his head to his reflection... 
           IN THE STALL:

                        The Mother continues turning the lock.(cid:13)
                        Ignoring Cruise's warning signal.(cid:13)
                        Black bag now in back pocket.(cid:13)
                        9MM now in hand...

           Cruise shakes his head again.(cid:13)
           More adamant.  (cid:13)
           Still subtle, but --

           The Mother bursts from the stall.

           bang!

           A bullet to the head for Spider Thug.(cid:13)
           His body hitting the floor?  (cid:13)
           Louder than the silencer-aided gunshot.  

           Surprise floods Tarantula's features.  (cid:13)
           It's quickly replaced by anger at the sight of The Mother.  (cid:13)
           And that's knocked away by a SUCKER-PUNCH from Cruise.  

           The Mother throws the black bag over Tarantula's face.  (cid:13)
           Cinches it tight.  (cid:13)
           Cutting off the yell bubbling out -- 

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Tell us where Hector is.

           Tarantula resists.(cid:13)
           VIOLENTLY.  (cid:13)
           Cruise struggles to zip tie his slippery still wet hands.  

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Forget his hands.  Lock the door.

                                 CRUISE
                        Lock's broken.  That's why I signaled
                        to wait --

           The door's pushed open.(cid:13)
           Cruise draws his gun.  (cid:13)
           Finger hesitating on the trigger...

           A LOWLIFE.(cid:13)
           Stands in the doorway.  (cid:13)
           Jaw dropped.

           He turns tail.(cid:13)
           The door swinging closed behind him.  (cid:13)
           The Mother and Cruise trade a look.

           Clock's ticking now.  
           Cruise keeps his gun trained at the door.  (cid:13)
           The Mother turns all her attention to Tarantula.  (cid:13)
           Fierce urgency.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Where's Hector?

           She loosens the black bag.(cid:13)
           Tarantula coughs out --

                                 TARANTULA
                        Fuck you.

           Cinched TIGHT.(cid:13)
           She whirls him around.  (cid:13)
           Slams him face first into the wall.

           A SPIDER THUG barrels through the door.(cid:13)
           Gun raised.

           BANG!  BANG!  BANG!

           He gets off a shot.  (cid:13)
           Before Cruise uses two to put him down.

           BANGBANGBANGBANG!

           Someone's shooting a SEMI-AUTOMATIC through the wall.(cid:13)
           Spray and pray.  

           The Mother and Cruise take cover --

           IN THE STALL:

                        The Mother drags Tarantula in with her --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Where's Hector?

                        But she doesn't have enough leverage anymore.(cid:13)
                        Tarantula's too big.(cid:13)
                        He rams her back across the toilet.(cid:13)
                        She goes limp.(cid:13)
                        Dazed.(cid:13)

                        He gets free.(cid:13)
                        Rips the black bag off...

           BANGBANGBANGBANG!

           Bullets eat up every surface.(cid:13)
           Porcelain shards fly.

                                 TARANTULA (O.S.)
                        Stop shooting --

           Spider Thugs surround the bullet ridden bathroom door.(cid:13)
           Fingers coming off triggers.  (cid:13)
           Guns smoking.    

           LOWLIFES scramble around them.  (cid:13)
           Tripping over themselves.  (cid:13)
           Scared out of their minds...

           INT. BATHROOM - WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Tarantula hauls ass for the door. (cid:13)
           He's side blinded by Cruise.(cid:13)
           Linebacker-tackled to the ground.

           But Tarantula is TOUGH.(cid:13)
           Throws Cruise off.(cid:13)
           Barrels out the door.

           The Mother exits the stall.(cid:13)
           Charges after Tarantula.

                                 CRUISE
                        Wait...

           She heard him.(cid:13)
           Doesn't slow down.(cid:13)
           In juggernaut mode --

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The Mother lurches out the bathroom door.(cid:13)
           Straight into CHAOS.   (cid:13)
           Focused.  (cid:13)
           Gun raised.

           She takes out the Thugs collapsing on Tarantula to help.(cid:13)
           He grabs one of their guns.(cid:13)
           Fires back.  (cid:13)
           The Mother begrudgingly takes cover.

           CRUISE. (cid:13)
           Barrels out the bathroom now.  (cid:13)
           His cover fire for The Mother forces Tarantula to retreat.

                                 TARANTULA
                        Kill them!

           The rest of his Spider Thugs join the fire fight.(cid:13)
           Releasing their dogs on The Mother and Cruise. 

           The Mother takes out two charging GERMAN SHEPHERDS.(cid:13)
           Cruise fires at a PITBULL.  (cid:13)
           Misses.  
           The Pit LATCHES onto his arm.  (cid:13)
           Jaws of steel.  (cid:13)
           Blood and spit flying.  (cid:13)
           A close range shot drops it.(cid:13)
           But that was Cruise's last bullet.  (cid:13)
           The Mother's out too. 

           A GRIMY FIGHT ensues.

           Cruise uses his fists.(cid:13)
           The Mother grips her empty 9MM by the barrel.  (cid:13)
           Uses the handle's blunt force to break noses.  (cid:13)
           Always on the move in Tarantula's direction.  (cid:13)
           Cruise always on the the move in The Mother's.(cid:13)
           Both taking HEAVY PUNISHMENT.

           A Spider Thug knocks the 9MM from The Mother's hand.(cid:13)
           Follows that with a punch that rocks her.  (cid:13)
           Staggers her back into the cage.

           She rips BARBED-WIRE from it.(cid:13)
           Wraps it around Spider Thug's neck.(cid:13)
           Chokes him to his knees.  (cid:13)
           Eyes locked on... 

           TARANTULA. (cid:13)

           The Mother's hit by a CAB.
           She's airborne for a split second.  (cid:13)
           Grinds to the pavement.  (cid:13)
           Head snapping to concrete.  

           The SOUND DROPS OUT.(cid:13)
           Just underwater half-silence.  (cid:13)
           Ears RINGING.  

           Tarantula doesn't slow down.  (cid:13)
           Doesn't look back.  (cid:13)
           The Mother writhes in pain.  (cid:13)
           Uses the cab's grill to pull herself up.  (cid:13)
           Stumbles --  

           Cruise catches her.  (cid:13)
           His bloodied face creased with concern.(cid:13)
           He's saying SOMETHING.  (cid:13)
           It doesn't matter what.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Go.

           She shoulders past the irate CABBIE.(cid:13)
           Climbs behind the wheel of his cab.  (cid:13)
           He attempts to drag her back out.  (cid:13)
           She SLAMS him head first into the door.(cid:13)

           Just glimpses of him.  (cid:13)

           Swerves THROUGH a Shanty.  (cid:13)
           Slices easily through the cardboard walls.  (cid:13)
           Shooting out the other side.(cid:13)
           Timed just right.  

           The front of the cab sideblinds Tarantula.  (cid:13)
           He flips onto the hood.  (cid:13)
           His body spider cracking the entire windshield.

           Each punch also a vicious cut.

           He's tied to a chair center ring.(cid:13)

           BAMBAMBAM!

           The Mother lets up.(cid:13)

                        It's the only room without a window

           Places it like a finger to her lips.  (cid:13)
           Shhhhhhhhh.(cid:13)

           More FRANTIC this time.  (cid:13)
           Didn't The Mother tell Scared Wife to shut the fuck up?

           The realization hits The Mother.(cid:13)
           Like a smack to the face.  (cid:13)
           Scared Wife must be pleading with someone new.

           Hard enough to lodge into the wood.  (cid:13)

           Finds that first machete at her throat.  (cid:13)
           A muscled arm locked around her waist.  (cid:13)

           That honey laced Spanish.(cid:13)
           Just a whisper in The Mother's ear.(cid:13)
           Cruise's voice crackles in the other --

           She eyes the machete at her feet. (cid:13)
           Lodged in the balcony.(cid:13)
           Hector presses the blade into her throat.  (cid:13)
           A warning.

                                 HECTOR
                        You know I always wondered.  If it
                        was all a lie.  I finally got my
                        answer.  

           He holds her tight.  (cid:13)
           Like a lover.  (cid:13)
           Their body's flush against each others.(cid:13)
           STIRRING.

                                 HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        The love was real.  It created that
                        beautiful little girl...

           The EMOTION.(cid:13)
           On The Mother's face.  (cid:13)
           Her own memories resurfacing.  (cid:13)
           She fights to keep her tone neutral.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        I won't have her growing up with
                        monsters.

           Hector sad-smiles.(cid:13)
           What he expected.  (cid:13)
           He lets out a resigned breath.  (cid:13)
           An inch of space opens. (cid:13)
           Between The Mother's neck and the blade --  
           She SMASHES her head back.(cid:13)
           Shattering Hector's nose.  (cid:13)
           He reacts on instinct.  (cid:13)
           Slicing blade across skin, but -- 

           The Mother's already twisting from his grip.  (cid:13)
           Dislodging that second machete from the balcony.  (cid:13)
           Her hand goes to the slit in her neck.(cid:13)
           It's just superficial.  (cid:13)
           Hector's hand goes to his nose. (cid:13)
           It's broken.

           They square off.(cid:13)
           Grips tighten on machetes.  (cid:13)
           A volcano of unspoken emotions between them.

           The VILLA CHAOS is still in The Mother's ear.(cid:13)
           Distracting her.

           CRUISE'S CALLS FOR HELP. 

           The Mother slashes first.(cid:13)
           Hector dodges.  (cid:13)
           Clearing the doorway.

           She slips into the...

           INT. BEDROOM - VILLA - NIGHT

           ...just barely dodging the arc of his blade.

           The MACHETE FIGHT is brutal.(cid:13)
           Personal.  (cid:13)
           Somewhere between love and hate.  

           CRUISE'S LABORED BREATHING.

           Hector hacks away at The Mother.  (cid:13)
           Unrelenting.  (cid:13)
           Forces her back towards the bed.  

           GUNSHOTS.

           The Mother uses the Bound Couple as shields.(cid:13)
           Hector draws BLOOD.  (cid:13)
           The couples.  (cid:13)
           Hers.  

           ZOE'S TERRIFIED SCREAMS.

           The Mother's eyes flit out the balcony doors.(cid:13)
           Towards the villa she can't see three blocks down.(cid:13)
           Protective mother instinct --

           BAM!
           A vicious punch from Hector.(cid:13)
           Knocks The Mother's ear piece out.  

           He's too close.  (cid:13)
           She grabs his knife arm to stop a slash.  (cid:13)
           He grabs hers.  (cid:13)
           They GRAPPLE.

           He brings a knee to The Mother's midsection.(cid:13)
           She folds.  (cid:13)
           Falls back on her ass.  (cid:13)
           Hector once again has both machetes.

           The Mother scoots back.(cid:13)
           Through the BATHROOM DOOR.  (cid:13)
           Hector stalks her in...

           THAWP!

           A MACHETE BLADE slices through the wall.(cid:13)
           Is retracted.  (cid:13)
           Another blade strike.(cid:13)
           A few feet to the right.  (cid:13)
           It's retracted again.  

           Hector's striking at The Mother while she's on the move.

           She's heading toward the opposite bathroom door.  (cid:13)
           She rolls out of it.(cid:13)
           Slams it shut behind her.(cid:13)
           Two hands on the doorknob to keep it closed.  

           A blade slices through the door.(cid:13)
           Cutting into her hand.  

           She screams in frustration.(cid:13)
           Slams the door open.  (cid:13)
           Before Hector has time to retract the machete.  (cid:13)
           Catching him by surprise...

           INT. BATHROOM - VILLA - NIGHT

           ...driving him back through the GLASS shower doors. (cid:13)
           That SHATTER around them. 

           Hector drops his second machete.(cid:13)
           But maintains a grip on The Mother.  (cid:13)
           Maneuvers her into a REAR NAKED CHOKE HOLD.  (cid:13)
           Lifting her off her feet.

           Her eyes bulge.  (cid:13)
           She gasps for air.  (cid:13)
           For LIFE.
           Tears well in Hector's eyes.(cid:13)
           He squeezes...  

                            And squeezes...  

                                               And squeezes...

           His grip loosens.(cid:13)
           He can't do it.(cid:13)
           The love was real.(cid:13)
           He can't finish her off.

           The Mother can.

           The moment her feet crunch into broken glass.(cid:13)
           She tightens her grip on Hector's arm around her neck.  (cid:13)
           Flips him over her shoulder.  (cid:13)
           Gravity does the rest.

           Hector slams down on what's left of the shower door.(cid:13)
           The shark fin shaped glass EXPLODES through his chest...

           INT. BEDROOM - VILLA - NIGHT

           The Mother still gasping for air.(cid:13)
           Pushes the couple's dead bodies out of the way.(cid:13)
           Feels around on the bed.(cid:13)
           Searching for...

           Her EARPIECE.

           She grabs it.  (cid:13)
           A drowning victim for a life preserver.  (cid:13)
           Jams it into her ear.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Cruise...

                        Cruise!

           STATIC...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - VILLA - NIGHT

           The Mother moves for the front door.(cid:13)
           Bloody.  (cid:13)
           Broken.  (cid:13)
           Pushing beyond the pain.  (cid:13)
           Throws it open to stare down -- 

           The BARREL OF A GUN.(cid:13)
           Held by... 

           CRUISE.  (cid:13)
           He lowers it at the sight of her.
                                 CRUISE
                        We got her.

           The Mother looks past him.(cid:13)
           To the GAZ in the driveway.  (cid:13)
           Zoe's terrified face framed by the windshield.

           The Mother steps back. (cid:13)
           Out of her daughter's eye line.(cid:13)
           Braces herself against the furniture.(cid:13)
           Adrenaline finally leaving her.  

           Her entire body SHAKES.(cid:13)
           With RELIEF.  (cid:13)
           CONFUSION...

           EXT. WATERS OFF THE COAST OF - CUBA - NIGHT

           Cruise pilots the speed boat. (cid:13)
           Zoe strapped into the seat beside him. (cid:13)
           The Mother surrounded by bloody towels in the rear.(cid:13)
           Wiping off Hector's blood.

           Her lover's blood.

           Both mother and daughter stare blankly out at the water.(cid:13)
           Emotionally drained.  (cid:13)
           Numb.  (cid:13)
           Clearly changed forever...

           Zoe's in back.  

           The Mother's eyes go to the rearview mirror.(cid:13)
           To her daughter's reflection.  (cid:13)
           Zoe's staring right at her.

           They have the same INTENSE eyes...

           INT. QUICKMART - NIGHT

           The Mother does her best to find her "travel" items.

           A JUG of water.     (cid:13)
           ZIPLOCK BAGS.  (cid:13)
           JERKY.  (cid:13)
           PREPAID PHONE.  (cid:13)

           The electronics aisle turns into TOYS & GAMES.  (cid:13)
           The Mother pauses.(cid:13)
           Picks up... 

           A DECK OF CARDS.

           She considers the weight of them.(cid:13)
           In her hand.(cid:13)
           As a present for her daughter...

           EXT. DOCKS - FLORIDA - DAY

           DAWN breaks.(cid:13)
           The Olds pulls in between CARGO CONTAINERS.  (cid:13)
           The Mother and Cruise climb out.  (cid:13)
           She hands him the Prepaid Phone.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Call when she's safe.

           Their look holds.(cid:13)
           Still meaningful.  (cid:13)
           Still strained.

                                 CRUISE
                        Did you ever consider keeping her?

           The Mother looks to Zoe.(cid:13)
           Sprawled across the back seat.  (cid:13)
           Asleep.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        The only way to protect her was to
                        give her up.

                        A kid needs more than just protection.

           The Mother feels Cruise's sincerity.(cid:13)
           For a moment she's genuinely conflicted, then --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        She has a mother.

           EXT. PEST BANK - BUDAPEST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           In the SHADOWS of the SZÉCHENYI CHAIN BRIDGE...

           LASZLO (ratty blond cornrows, diamond studded grill).(cid:13)
           Sits on the hood of a tricked out BENTLEY.

                                 LASZLO
                        I heard this was Hector's score.
           The Woman stands in the glow of the Bentley's headlights.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        You've never been friends with Hector.

                                 LASZLO
                        Never enemies either.  And from what
                        I've heard, neither were you.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        We're half a world away from Hector's
                        reach.  You've the got connections. 
                        Sell it discreetly.

           Laszlo considers, finally...

                                 LASZLO
                        I want to see it.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        When I see cash.

                                 LASZLO
                        Fine.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        20 mil?  

                                 LASZLO
                        I heard you the first time.   It'll
                        take me a few days to get it.

           The Woman reaches for the GUN in her waistband.(cid:13)
           A wave of UNEASINESS washing over her.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        You always negotiate --

                                 ALEXEI (O.S.)
                        He's already made his deal.

           She freezes.  (cid:13)
           Stunned. (cid:13)
           Doesn't have to turn to know there's a gun trained on her. 

           Alexei tosses a bag of cash to Laszlo.(cid:13)
           He climbs into the Bentley.  (cid:13)
           The headlights recede as he pulls away.

           The Woman's eyes search.(cid:13)
           For a way out.(cid:13)
           Any way out.  (cid:13)
           There's none.

           Just her and Alexei left in darkness.
           He takes the Gun from her waistband.(cid:13)
           Puts his to the back of her head.(cid:13)
           Holds it there.(cid:13)
           Finger on the trigger.

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        I want what you stole from me.

           A TEAR rolls down The Woman's cheek.(cid:13)
           It takes her a moment to find her voice.

                                 THE WOMAN
                        Okay --

           He PISTOL-WHIPS her.(cid:13)
           Dropping The Woman to her hands and knees.  (cid:13)
           Follows that with a kick to the face.(cid:13)
           VOLCANIC in his anger --

                                 ALEXEI
                        You betrayed me, for what?  20 mil? 
                        That's not even what it's worth -- 

           The Woman rolls onto her back.  (cid:13)
           One hand covering her belly.  (cid:13)
           Not even thinking to defend herself first.

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        I fucking loved you --

           He kicks her again.(cid:13)
           And again.  (cid:13)
           Wild with fury --

                                 THE WOMAN
                        I'M PREGNANT --

           Alexei just stops. (cid:13)
           All the hurricane wind taken out of his sails.  (cid:13)
           The Woman curls into a fetal position.  (cid:13)
           Protecting her stomach from the next blow.  

           Alexei stares down at her.  (cid:13)
           Dizzy with confusion.  (cid:13)
           Incapable of processing the conflicting emotion...

           An impossible idea strikes him.

           He grabs The Woman by the hair.(cid:13)
           Yanks her up to face him --

                                 ALEXEI
                        Is it his?
           The Woman's pulled a BLADE.(cid:13)
           One small enough to grab from a hidden strap on your ankle.(cid:13)
           While you're curled in a fetal position.  (cid:13)
           Pretending to protect your stomach.

           She rams the blade into Alexei's gut.(cid:13)
           Pierces something vital.  (cid:13)
           Alexei roars in pain.  (cid:13)
           Releases her.

           She takes off running.  (cid:13)
           For her life.  (cid:13)
           For her baby's life...

           That deck of cards.  

           She bought them.  (cid:13)
           Never gave them to her daughter.  (cid:13)

           A familiar voice responds.(cid:13)
           Not The Mother.

                                 FAMILIAR VOICE (O.S.)
                        Then we'll have to make her come to

           He stares down in confusion at...

           The Mother slings her sniper rifle over her shoulder.(cid:13)

           JUMPS.  

           She falls 30 feet to the docks below.(cid:13)
           The line RINGING the entire time...

           The Mother turns dials on the rifle.(cid:13)
           Adjusting for it.  (cid:13)
           Never taking her eye off the scope.  (cid:13)

                        Into the parking structure below.(cid:13)
                        The third SUV disappearing with it...

           The Mother's on the move.(cid:13)
           RUNNING.  (cid:13)

                        He registers the sniper rifle pointed at him.(cid:13)
                        A flash of PANIC, then --(cid:13)

           She keeps the rifle aimed right at his head.(cid:13)

           Cruise turns the wheel sharply. (cid:13)
           At the last second.(cid:13)
           The Rover swerves right.(cid:13)
           Plowing into a row of parked cars, REVEALING --

                        Centered in the crosshairs.(cid:13)

                        Right through The Mother.(cid:13)
                        That devil's head grin cresting his lips.

           The Mother's eye falls from the scope.(cid:13)
           Surprise rioting her features.  (cid:13)
           Time stands still for a MESMERIZING MOMENT, then --

                        (cid:13)           Alexei guns the gas.(cid:13)
           No intention whatsover of swerving like Cruise.  (cid:13)
           The Mother DIVES out of the way.(cid:13)
           Barely dodging the front of Alexei's SUV.

           He brakes.(cid:13)
           Burns rubber.(cid:13)
           Swerves sideways into the far wall.

           The Mother's on her feet. (cid:13)
           9mm out.  (cid:13)
           Runs toward Cruise helping Zoe from the crashed Rover.

           Their eyes scan the spaces between vehicles.(cid:13)
           On the hunt.

           The Mother finally stops at a car.(cid:13)
           A '92 TOYOTA 4RUNNER.(cid:13)
           Old enough to HOT WIRE.

           The Mother quietly opens the door.(cid:13)
           Reaches under the dash.  (cid:13)
           Stripes WIRES.  (cid:13)
           Cruise quietly pops the back door.  (cid:13)
           Motions for Zoe to climb in --

           She SCREAMS.(cid:13)
           Ducks.(cid:13)
           Cruise whirls...

           A PRECISION SHOOTER.(cid:13)
           Has spotted them.(cid:13)
           Three cars over.(cid:13)
           Gun raised --

           BANG!

           The Mother fires off a quick shot.(cid:13)
           Clips the Precision Shooter.(cid:13)
           He takes cover.(cid:13)
           But now...

           Their position's compromised.

           The Precision Shooters quickly surround them.  (cid:13)
           TRADE FIRE.

           Zoe clambers into the back seat.(cid:13)
           Cruise slams the door closed behind her.

           SCREEEEEEEECH!

           The SUV fishtails into the aisle.(cid:13)
           The Driver joining the fire fight.

                                 CRUISE
                        Get it started.
           The Mother tosses him her 9mm.(cid:13)
           Turns back to Hot Wiring.

           Cruise fires with both guns.(cid:13)
           But he doesn't have a 360 line of sight.  (cid:13)
           The Precision Shooters are closing in...

           VROOOOOOOM!

           Car started.(cid:13)
           The Mother climbs in, but --

           Alexei grabs her from behind.(cid:13)
           Yanks her out.  (cid:13)
           Rams her into the hood.  (cid:13)
           Cruise moves to help.  (cid:13)
           But he's waylaid by a Precision Shooter --

           It's a brutal fight on two fronts.

           The Mother in a WRESTLING MATCH with Alexei.(cid:13)
           Cruise in a SLUG FEST with two Precision Shooters.

           Zoe can do nothing but watch from the back seat.  (cid:13)
           WIDE-EYED.(cid:13)
           Each fight moving further and further out of her eyeline.  

           The Mother slashes at Alexei with her knife.(cid:13)
           He dodges.  (cid:13)
           Forces it out of her hand.  (cid:13)
           She braces herself against a car hood.(cid:13)
           Palm flat to steel --

           Alexei stabs The Mother right through her hand.

                                 ALEXEI
                        Now we can always keep it intimate.

           He TWISTS the knife.(cid:13)
           Between her pointer and middle finger.  (cid:13)
           She screams in AGONY.  (cid:13)
           And that hits...

           ZOE.(cid:13)
           Climbs into the passenger seat.    (cid:13)
           Presses her face against the glass.(cid:13)
           Vibrating with DREAD.  (cid:13)
           Trying to catch a glimpse of the fight's outcome --

           BAM!

           A Precision Shooter slams against the window.(cid:13)
           Zoe jumps out of her skin.  (cid:13)
           Scrambles into the driver seat.  
           Precision Shooter tries the handle.  (cid:13)
           LOCKED.  (cid:13)
           He SMASHES the window out.  

           Zoe FREAKS.(cid:13)
           Slams her foot on the gas pedal.(cid:13)
           The 4Runner lurches forward.(cid:13)
           Bumps over the parking stop.

           She turns the wheel.(cid:13)
           Narrowly avoiding the next row of parked cars.  (cid:13)
           Driving HAPHAZARDLY.  (cid:13)
           Like a ten year old that doesn't know how to drive...

           The Mother clocks Zoe careening down the aisle.  (cid:13)
           Head butts Alexei.  (cid:13)
           He staggers back just enough.  (cid:13)
           For The Mother to kick him back more.(cid:13)
           Into the path of the oncoming 4Runner --

           BAM!

           Zoe hits Alexei dead on.

           He rolls up.(cid:13)
           Over the hood.  (cid:13)
           Like a rag doll.

           Zoe doesn't slow down.(cid:13)
           Doesn't know how to.(cid:13)
           She side swipes three cars.(cid:13)
           SPARKS fly.

           Cruise takes off after the runaway 4Runner.  (cid:13)
           The Mother only steps behind.(cid:13)
           Laying down cover.  (cid:13)
           Firing wildly with her left hand.  (cid:13)
           Now her good hand.

           Cruise manages to get into the 4Runner.(cid:13)
           Slams the brakes.  (cid:13)
           Pops the trunk --

           The Mother dives in under a hail of GUNFIRE.(cid:13)
           They speed off.

           ALEXEI.(cid:13)
           Scraped and bruised.  (cid:13)
           His arm at an UNNATURAL angle.  (cid:13)
           Peels himself off the pavement.(cid:13)
           Limps to the SUV.(cid:13)
           Pulls his SNIPER RIFLE.

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        Give me your shoulder.
           He shoves a Precision Shooter to the concrete railing.(cid:13)
           Positions the sniper rifle on his shoulder.(cid:13)
           Using him as a tripod...

           EXT. BRIDGE OVER A - RIVER - NIGHT

           Pedal to the metal.  (cid:13)
           Cruise checks on Zoe in the passenger seat.  

                                 CRUISE
                        You okay?

           She tongues her scar.(cid:13)
           Tears streaking her cheeks.(cid:13)
           Not okay.

                                 ZOE
                        I didn't mean to hit him.

           Cruise looks to The Mother reloading in the back seat.  (cid:13)
           She drops a bullet.  (cid:13)
           Hands SHAKING.(cid:13)
           Also not okay.  

           She reaches for the bullet -- 

           BLAM!  

           A bullet slices through the back window.(cid:13)
           Catches Cruise in the neck.  (cid:13)
           It was meant for The Mother.  (cid:13)
           If she hadn't moved...  

           She grabs Cruise's neck. (cid:13)
           With both hands.  (cid:13)
           Attempting to stanch the blood GUSHING.  

           They lock eyes. (cid:13)
           The look still meaningful.(cid:13)
           Still strained.  

           They know it's the last one.

           Cruise's eyes FLUTTER closed.(cid:13)
           His body goes limp.  (cid:13)
           His hands fall from the wheel.

           The 4Runner veers left. (cid:13)
           Ricochets off the center divide.  (cid:13)
           Careens across the highway.(cid:13)
           Breaks through the railing.(cid:13)
           And rockets off the side smashing into the water...
           INT. SECOND LEVEL - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Alexei tosses his rifle to Precision Shooter.(cid:13)
           Climbs into the SUV cradling his broken arm.

                                 ALEXEI
                        What the fuck are waiting for?  I
                        want confirmation she's dead.

           EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - NIGHT

           The 4Runner sinks. 

                                And sinks...  

                                               And sinks...

           Zoe struggles out of her seat belt.  (cid:13)
           Pops open her door --  

           The Mother GRABS her.(cid:13)
           Zoe's eyes widen in ALARM.(cid:13)
           Is The Mother trying to drown her?

           LIGHT slashes the water around the sinking car.  (cid:13)
           Followed by BULLETS.  

           The steel car frame their only protection.

           The Mother lets Cruise out of his seat belt.    (cid:13)
           Pops open his door...

           Alexei and Precision Shooter at the destroyed railing.(cid:13)
           Flashlights trained on the water.  (cid:13)
           Unloading their guns into the milkly black.  

           CRUISE'S BODY bobs to the surface.(cid:13)
           They pause.  (cid:13)
           Wait.  (cid:13)
           EMERGENCY SIRENS in the distance.

                        We need to go...

           Alexei doesn't move.(cid:13)
           Doesn't take his eyes off the water.

                                 ALEXEI
                        She can hold her breath this long.

                                 PRECISION SHOOTER

           He's right.  (cid:13)
           Zoe's struggling.  (cid:13)
           Her chest BURNING.

           She pushes away from The Mother.  (cid:13)
           Half swims.(cid:13)
           Half floats for the surface.  

           The Mother pulls her back. (cid:13)
           Wraps her own feet around the open passenger door.  (cid:13)
           Using it as an anchor to keep them submerged.  

           Zoe beats against The Mother.(cid:13)
           Screaming air bubbles.(cid:13)
           Panic in her blood shot eyes.

           The Mother covers her mouth.  (cid:13)
           Trying to force the girl to preserve air.  (cid:13)
           Her own chest burning now too.(cid:13)
           But she remains submerged...

           Even as Zoe PASSES OUT.  (cid:13)
           Even as her daughter's body convulses violently in her arms...

           The Mother BURSTS to the surface.(cid:13)
           Gasping for air.  (cid:13)
           An unconscious Zoe in her arms.

           The destroyed railing is VACATED.(cid:13)
           Alexei is gone.

           The Emergency Sirens close in...

           EXT. BANKS OF THE - RIVER - NIGHT

           The Mother drags a blue lipped Zoe onto the muddy shore.(cid:13)
           Performs CPR.  

           That's not working.  

           The Mother continues compressions.  (cid:13)
           Eyes fixed and fierce.  (cid:13)
           Pressing HARDER. 

                              And HARDER.

                                           AND HARDER --

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.
           Linger in the VOID.(cid:13)
           Stale SILENCE.  (cid:13)
           Thick with TENSION.

           This feels like DEATH.  

           Metal scrapes across metal.(cid:13)
           A door is dragged open.  (cid:13)
           A slice of light slashes through the darkness.  (cid:13)
           Falls on...    

           THE MOTHER. (cid:13)
           Beat up.  (cid:13)
           Bruised.  (cid:13)
           Exhausted.  

           She steps from the shipping container. (cid:13)
           Into the Alaskan sun, REVEALING --

           ZOE.(cid:13)
           Peeks from the darkness behind her.(cid:13)
           Also beat up.  (cid:13)
           Also bruised.(cid:13)
           Also exhausted.  

           But ALIVE...

           Zoe's bruises are fading.  (cid:13)
           She lies in bed. (cid:13)
           Discreetly watches...

           THE MOTHER.(cid:13)
           Doing her morning exercises.(cid:13)
           Methodical.  (cid:13)
           Rep after rep.

           She finishes.  (cid:13)
           Zoe squeezes her eyes shut.  (cid:13)
           Pretends to be asleep.  (cid:13)
           The Mother heads outside without a glance her way...

           Everywhere rolled up to fit her tiny frame.  (cid:13)
           Her gaze through the window...  
           THE MOTHER.(cid:13)
           Showers.(cid:13)
           That c-section scar.

           Zoe tongues the corresponding scar in her cheek.(cid:13)
           Curious about The Mother.  (cid:13)
           But too afraid to do anything more than watch.  (cid:13)
           From a distance.  (cid:13)
           Like mother like daughter...

           EXT. ALASKAN FOREST - DAY

           The Mother treks through the snow.(cid:13)

           The Mother breathes steadily. (cid:13)
           Adjusts her BANDAGED HAND...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        A DEER. (cid:13)
                        Saunters into the crosshairs.(cid:13)
                        20 yards away.(cid:13)
                        Much closer than that first shot.

           The Mother attempts to pull the trigger.  (cid:13)
           Can barely flex her finger.(cid:13)
           She strains.(cid:13)
           Finally --

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

           This is not the first hunting attempt.  (cid:13)
           Or the second.  (cid:13)

           She reaches her hand out.(cid:13)
           Slowly.  (cid:13)
           Cautiously.

           Uncomfortable with her daughter's discomfort --

           A low GROWL.(cid:13)
           From behind.

           The Mother freezes.(cid:13)
           Realization washing over her.(cid:13)

           Inch by inch.  (cid:13)
           Until her eyes lock on...

           The SHE-WOLF.  (cid:13)
           That simmering darkness.  (cid:13)
           That primal kinship.

           The Mother raises her Rifle.(cid:13)
           Very slowly. 

           The She-Wolf angles towards Zoe.  (cid:13)
           Bares her teeth.  (cid:13)
           The same threat The Mother made the last time they crossed.  

           The Mother stops.(cid:13)
           Rifle halfway up.  (cid:13)
           Mother instincts kicking in.  (cid:13)
           Protect the offspring.  (cid:13)
           At all costs.  (cid:13)

           Industrial strength TENSION, then --

           The Mother backs up.(cid:13)
           Towards Zoe.  (cid:13)
           Never taking her eyes off the She-Wolf.(cid:13)
           Retreating just like the She-Wolf last time.

           Another low GROWL escapes the She-Wolf.(cid:13)
           Her Cubs SCRAMBLE.  (cid:13)
           And The Mother understands.

           This isn't like before.

           The She-Wolf is of the wild.(cid:13)
           And she has the power now.

                        Run.

           A simple command.(cid:13)
           As simple as the one the She-Wolf gave to her cubs.

           Zoe takes off in a flash.(cid:13)
           The She-Wolf gives CHASE.

           The Mother pulls her Shotgun.(cid:13)
           Lines up the shot.  (cid:13)
           Is only going to get one --

           BANG!
           She MISSES.(cid:13)
           Her fucking hand.

           The She-Wolf is on Zoe.(cid:13)
           RAVENOUS.  (cid:13)
           Tears at her back.(cid:13)
           The girl's SCREAMS horrific.

           It hits The Mother in the deepest part of her soul.(cid:13)
           She PANICS.(cid:13)
           Pulls her Shotgun.(cid:13)
           Charges forward.(cid:13)
           Fires openly.  (cid:13)
           Until the barrel CLICKS empty.

           The last bullet finds its target.(cid:13)
           The She-Wolf's howl is bone-chilling.  (cid:13)
           She disappears into the trees...

           The Mother rushes to Zoe.(cid:13)
           She's face down.(cid:13)
           CRYING in the BLOOD dotted snow.(cid:13)
           CLAW MARKS all down her shredded hand-me-down coat.

           The Mother rips it open.(cid:13)
           Pulls up Zoe's sweater.(cid:13)
           RED WELTS all down her back.(cid:13)
           That's it.  (cid:13)
           Skin didn't break.  (cid:13)
           The blood is the She-Wolf's...

           She looks to Zoe.(cid:13)
           This little girl.(cid:13)
           Full of fear.  (cid:13)

           Bends her middle finger back.(cid:13)
           She WINCES.

                        I can't risk it.

           Jons pulls out a bottle of PAIN KILLERS.(cid:13)
           Sets them in front of her.

           Looks to Zoe stuffing her face.(cid:13)
           Wary of the task at hand.

           12 TARGETS.(cid:13)

           Tacked to trees at varying distances.

           BANG!

           THROUGH THE BINOCULARS:

                        TARGET 8. (cid:13)
                        The Mother missed it before.(cid:13)
                        The bullet slices through it.

           The Mother's eyes drop from the binoculars to...

           Tiny finger on the trigger.(cid:13)

           Zoe's across the table.(cid:13)
           Painting LUNCH BOXES.  (cid:13)
           Primary colors disappear under matte black.

           Takes deliberate steps.(cid:13)
           Covering her tracks.(cid:13)
           Double-timing to keep up with The Mother.  (cid:13)
           But keeping up.

           She carries two of those matte black Lunchboxes.(cid:13)
           The Mother carries a PICK AX.(cid:13)
           Sweat beads their brows.(cid:13)

           They FREEZE.(cid:13)
           Ears straining.

           The body of the DEAD She-Wolf.

           Shotgun blast carved in its side.(cid:13)

           Jons limps towards the pickup.(cid:13)
           Zoe helps The Mother drag a deer carcass from the bed.  

           No postcard this time.(cid:13)
           Jons has a thin box instead.(cid:13)
           He hands it to The Mother.(cid:13)
           She hands it to Zoe without ceremony.   

           Zoe hesitates.(cid:13)
           Is this a present?

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Open it.

           Zoe slides the lid off.(cid:13)
           Marvels at what's inside.(cid:13)
           Picks it up like it's a priceless artifact.

           REVEAL -- a SWITCHBLADE in a small sheathe.

           Zoe in bed.(cid:13)
           Stares at her EMPTY hand.(cid:13)
           Hand-me-down shirt bunched at the wrist.  (cid:13)

           The Switchblade appears in it.  (cid:13)
           Out of thin air.

           Magic.

           She resets the SPRING LOADED SHEATH.(cid:13)
           Strapped to her forearm.  (cid:13)
           Performs the trick again.  (cid:13)

           The Mother wakes.(cid:13)
           Half a smile on her face.  (cid:13)
           It was a good dream.  (cid:13)
           She's been having a lot of those lately, then --

           The ABSENCE hits her.
           Zoe.  (cid:13)
           Not in bed.  (cid:13)
           Not at the table.  (cid:13)
           Not out by the shower.

           Immune to the cold.  (cid:13)
           DREAD growing with each step.  (cid:13)

           She's covered her tracks well.

           A NOISE.(cid:13)
           Dances through the trees.

           The Mother turns on a dime.(cid:13)
           Follows it.  (cid:13)
           Faster.  (cid:13)
           And FASTER --

           The Mother spots Zoe through the trees.(cid:13)
           Goes weak with RELIEF.  (cid:13)
           She slows.(cid:13)
           Stays quiet.  (cid:13)
           Slipping back into distance with ease as she spies...

           ZOE. (cid:13)
           Plays with those Wolf Cubs.  (cid:13)
           Feeding them deer meat.

           One of the Cubs nips at her hand.(cid:13)
           She jumps back.  (cid:13)
           Startled.

           Her face erupts in a SMILE.(cid:13)
           Followed by a LAUGH.(cid:13)
           From some hidden place within.

           It breaks The Mother's heart.(cid:13)
           Watching her daughter happy.  (cid:13)
           Not a care in the world.  (cid:13)

           Zoe enters.(cid:13)
           A linger of that smile on her lips.  (cid:13)
           It evaporates when she sees...

           A SMALL DUFFEL BAG packed on the bed.

                                 THE MOTHER (O.S.)
                        It's time.  For you to go home.

           The Mother sits at the table.(cid:13)
           Eyes on the bag.(cid:13)
           Not her daughter.  

           Zoe doesn't understand.(cid:13)
           Did she do something wrong?  (cid:13)
           She looks to The Mother's boots.(cid:13)
           Caked in SNOW.  (cid:13)
           She does the math.

                                 ZOE
                        I'm sorry.  You told me not to play
                        with them, and won't anymore, I

                        It doesn't matter.

                        But you can't send me back, cause
                        you --

           The EMOTION swallows her words.(cid:13)
           The ground shifting beneath her.

                                 ZOE (CONT'D)
                        You said it's not safe anymore.

                        It will be soon.

           The weight of that hits Zoe.(cid:13)
           She fights the tears welling.

                        What if I want to stay?

                        You can't.

           Zoe pleads with her eyes.(cid:13)
           Hoping the answer will change.  (cid:13)
           The Mother returns her gaze with nothing.(cid:13)
           Just hard certainty.
                                 ZOE
                        I could.  If you're my real mom,
                        than I can stay.

           That question.  (cid:13)
           THE question.  (cid:13)
           It hits The Mother HARD...

                        Does it matter?

           The Doctor GRUNTS in response.(cid:13)
           Barely audible.(cid:13)
           But it sets off a SIREN in The Woman's soul.

           Wraps his fingers around a Tranq Dart of his own.

           Throws his head back.  (cid:13)
           Connecting with The Woman's face.

                        you go.  Let you sell the hack. 
                        Keep the money and live happily ever
                        after with the baby.

           He turns to her now.(cid:13)
           She reduces the movement in her right leg.  (cid:13)
           But she can't stop.  (cid:13)
           She needs to escape.

                                 ALEXEI (CONT'D)
                        I was going to do that.  Really. 
                        After you slipped me in Bangladesh. 
                        But then you come here.  You didn't
                        do any of it for that baby, did you? 
                        You did it for yourself. 

           The Woman is listening.(cid:13)
           Despite herself.(cid:13)
           Her ex-lover is touching on a dangerous truth.  (cid:13)
           He moves in close --

                        You wanted out.  And you thought
                        this baby would protect you from me. 
                        You're the fuckin' monster.

           She's finally got that stirrup free.(cid:13)
           Swings her thigh up.  (cid:13)
           Connects with the side of Alexei's head.  (cid:13)

           That question.(cid:13)
           THE question.  (cid:13)
           Still hits The Mother hard.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Yes.

           And finally admitting it.  (cid:13)
           Finally saying it out loud.  (cid:13)
           Opens the flood gates.  (cid:13)
           TEARS fall.

           She takes a deep breath.(cid:13)
           She needs it to finish the thought.

                                 ZOE'S MOTHER (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        If my baby's safer with you, she
                        should stay with you.

                        It'd be easier to catch her by bloody

                        You step on that ice you're dead.

           They look to him.(cid:13)
           Some CONFUSION.  (cid:13)
           More SKEPTICISM.

                        I'm guessing on all sides.  Which

                        of your average sniper rifle.  The

           The Bruisers take in the scene with new eyes.(cid:13)
           And more appreciation for who they're up against.

           She FIGHTS him.  (cid:13)

           Bruiser #9 drops her.(cid:13)
           Blood pouring from his wound.

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Don't follow him.  Pick a point. 
                        I'll adjust range.

           The Mother keeps her gaze through the binoculars.(cid:13)
           Turns the dial of the Rifle.(cid:13)
           A centimeter at a time...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        Zagging.(cid:13)
                        In and out of the crosshairs.  

           ZOE'S FINGER. (cid:13)
           Curls on the trigger.(cid:13)

                        The wind.  8 miles per hour from 4
                        o'clock.

           Zoe quickly adjusts...

                        He's going out of range...(cid:13)

                        Zoe continues to hold.(cid:13)
                        Despite The Mother's warning, finally --(cid:13)

                        BANG!  (cid:13)

                        Another zig --(cid:13)

                        The bullet catches up to Bruiser #5.(cid:13)
                        Smashes the back of his head open.

           The Mother looks to her daughter.(cid:13)
           A mix of emotions.(cid:13)
           PRIDE.  (cid:13)
           SADNESS.(cid:13)
           APPREHENSION.

           Her daughter is now a killer.

           Zoe looks over the barrel of the rifle.(cid:13)
           A grim smile edging her lips.(cid:13)
           Prideful.(cid:13)
           Fierce.

           A small RED DOT appears between her eyes.

                        I clocked you by the third shot. 
                        But I had to see if she could pop
                        Maurice from that far.

           He let his Bruiser's be fish in a barrel.(cid:13)
           Just to get a bead on their hide.

                                 ALEXEI (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        Our girl's got potential.

           The Mother sees that wash over Zoe.(cid:13)
           She might not be ale to hear every word through the static.  (cid:13)
           But she heard that.

           Our girl.

                                 ALEXEI (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        Meet me at the cliff's edge.  Two clicks
                        to the left of your position.  Or I
                        snuff out that potential right now.

           The Mother rises.(cid:13)
           No hesitation.

                                 ZOE
                        No, wait --

                        It'll take me four minutes to get
                        down there.  I'll give you one to
                        try and get a shot...

           Zoe lets that sink in.(cid:13)
           One minute.

                                 THE MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        In six you run.  No matter what...

           EXT. SIDE OF - CLIFF - DAY

           A SHADED clearing the size of a boxing ring.(cid:13)
           THICK TREES on three sides.  (cid:13)
           A 30 FOOT DROP on the last.  

           The Mother emerges.(cid:13)
           Trudging through the heavy snow pack.

                                 ALEXEI (O.S.)
                        Drop your weapons over the side.

           His voice echoes off the trees.(cid:13)
           Could be coming from anywhere.  (cid:13)
           The Mother moves into the sunlight of the cliff's edge.(cid:13)
           Tosses...

           The SHOTGUN strapped to her back.(cid:13)
           The 9MM she retrieved from Bruiser #7.(cid:13)
           Zoe's SWITCHBLADE hidden in an ankle sheath.

                        The camouflage too.

           The Mother strips.  (cid:13)
           Back down to the stealth black thermals she started in.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        You wanted me, here I am.  Let Zoe
                        go back to her mother.

           Alexei emerges from the trees.(cid:13)
           Sniper Rifle trained on The Mother's back.

                                 ALEXEI
                        Now what kind of father would I be
                        if I did that?

           The Mother faces him.(cid:13)
           RAGE in her eyes.  (cid:13)
           Deeper than the ocean.  (cid:13)
           Wider than the universe.
                                 THE MOTHER
                        She's not yours.  And never will be.

           Alexei stops.(cid:13)
           All bravado gone.  (cid:13)
           Playtime's over.

           He tosses his Rifle over the edge.(cid:13)
           He wants this personal.(cid:13)
           Intimate.

           Neither bothers squaring up.(cid:13)
           They just ATTACK.

           The fight is FEROCIOUS.

           A decade in the making.(cid:13)
           Neither holding back.(cid:13)
           Each bone shattering blow met with a deflection and counter...

                        Just FLASHES of movement beneath it.  (cid:13)

                        She can't get a shot.  (cid:13)

                        It's why Alexei picked this spot...

           BLOOD spatters the snow.(cid:13)
           Both The Mother's and Alexei's.

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!

           The Mother ducks.(cid:13)
           Dodges.  (cid:13)
           Landing more BLOWS.  (cid:13)
           But she's expending more energy than Alexei.(cid:13)
           Trying to maneuver him to the cliff's edge.(cid:13)
           Into a patch of SUNLIGHT. 

           The spot Zoe will have a shot.

           Pulls her up into a choke hold.(cid:13)
           Cutting off her air.

                        She's got a shot now.  Bullet to

           The Mother continues to struggle.(cid:13)

                        We die, but our daughter survives. 
                        That's all you want, right?  So stop
                        fucking struggling and tell her to

                        Daring Zoe to take the shot.

           A cold determination washes over The Mother.(cid:13)
           She's made the decision.(cid:13)
           She steels herself for what has to come next.

                        If it's all been about protecting

                            (screaming to Zoe:)
                        Take the shot.

           The Mother spits through gritted teeth --

                                 THE MOTHER
                        She needs.  More than just.

           This time it's not an excuse to abandon her daughter.(cid:13)
           It's a reason to fight to stay.

           And that's exactly what The Mother intends to do...
           She summons all her strength.(cid:13)
           Stomps Alexei's foot.(cid:13)
           He doubles over.(cid:13)

           Cruise regains his professionalism --

                                 CRUISE
                        The next step is a briefing with
                        myself and another agent.  We'll ask
                        you a series of questions to determine
                        if you may have any other intel useful
                        to the United States government... 

           boom BOOP!  boom BOOP!  boom BOOP!

           Cruise trials off.(cid:13)
           That TINY HEARTBEAT fills the room.  (cid:13)
           Every inch.

           And it happens in an INSTANT --

           The Woman's eyes focus on her belly.  (cid:13)
           Her baby's heartbeat.  (cid:13)
           Fills her up.  (cid:13)
           Every inch.

           boom BOOP!  

                          boom BOOP!  

                                            boom BOOP!

           The Woman becomes The Mother.

           Cruise's eyes are on the monitor.  (cid:13)
           He SMILES.(cid:13)
           Like a proud father.

                        She's beautiful...

           EXT. ALASKAN FOREST - DAY

           Zoe's fetal HEARTBEAT echoes.(cid:13)
           Dancing over...

           The Mother's DEAD BODY.

           Sunken in the snow pack. (cid:13)
           Her chest a blossom of BLOOD.(cid:13)
           Her Dislocated Arm splayed at an unnatural angle.

           Her body starts to MOVE.(cid:13)
           An inch that way.  (cid:13)
           Then back.  (cid:13)
           As if to the grove of Zoe's fading heartbeat.

           REVEAL -- The Mother surrounded by the WOLF CUBS.
           They nip at her.(cid:13)
           Not trying to eat her.  (cid:13)
           Trying to wake her.  (cid:13)
           Get up.(cid:13)
           Move.(cid:13)
           Save your offspring.

           A Wolf Cub sinks his teeth in.(cid:13)
           Deep into her dislocated arm.(cid:13)
           Pulls with all his little cub strength.

           The PAIN has The Mother's eyes shooting open.(cid:13)
           A guttural SCREAM clawing from her bloody chest.(cid:13)
           It sends the Wolf Cubs SCRAMBLING.

           She blinks through the confusion.(cid:13)
           Barely alive.(cid:13)
           Touches her shredded bloody chest.  (cid:13)
           How did she survive a shotgun blast at point blank range?

           She finds the answer out of the corner of her eye...

           A green discarded shotgun shell.

           Zoe dropped the boxes.(cid:13)
           Mixing up the shells.(cid:13)
           Her chest is filled with SALT.(cid:13)
           But it still hurts like a motherfucker.

                                 THE MOTHER
                        Zoe...

           The memory has her remembering why she's out here.(cid:13)
           Her mother instincts kicking in.  (cid:13)
           Protect the offspring...

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE - ALASKAN FOREST - DAY

           That SNIPER RIFLE.(cid:13)
           Abandoned in the show.

           The Mother holds her Dislocated Arm. (cid:13)
           Limps towards it.(cid:13)
           Slowly.  (cid:13)
           In pain.  (cid:13)
           Breath ragged.

           Dying by inches.

           She leans against the tree next to the Rifle.(cid:13)
           Steels herself.(cid:13)
           Holds her wrist.(cid:13)
           And SLAMS her shoulder into the thick trunk.

           CRACK!
           She gags on the scream as her shoulder realigns.(cid:13)
           Threatening to lose consciousness to the pain.(cid:13)
           But...

           She bites down on her tongue.

           Using more pain to keep her alert.(cid:13)
           Beyond desperate.(cid:13)
           Beyond determined.

           She picks up the Rifle.  (cid:13)
           Uses it as a cane.(cid:13)
           Forcing herself onward...

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE - ALASKAN FOREST - DAY

           The Mother slumps against another tree. (cid:13)
           Shakily brings the Sniper Scope to her eye...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        THE SMOLDERING ASHES OF THE CABIN.(cid:13)
                        ALEXEI.  (cid:13)
                        ZOE.  (cid:13)
                        Struggling in his arms.  (cid:13)

                        He pops the door of The Mother's truck.(cid:13)
                        Throws her in.  (cid:13)
                        Climbs in after.

           The Mother lowers the scope.(cid:13)
           Has to.  (cid:13)
           Strength waning.

           The Truck starts up.(cid:13)
           Pulls off.  (cid:13)
           Alexei driving away with her daughter.

           She raises the Rifle.(cid:13)
           Halfway up.  (cid:13)
           Takes a deep breath.  (cid:13)
           Grits her teeth.(cid:13)
           Forcing it all the way up to her eye...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        The Truck.(cid:13)
                        Getting further.  (cid:13)
                        And further away.

           BANG!

           The shot goes WIDE.(cid:13)
           She can barely hold the Rifle up.  (cid:13)
           Much less steady it against the ricochet.
                        (cid:13)           And that Truck.(cid:13)
           With her daughter.(cid:13)
           Gets further.(cid:13)
           And further away.

           She LURCHES onto the ice.(cid:13)
           Moving as fast as her broken body will allow.(cid:13)
           Sliding.  (cid:13)
           Flailing. (cid:13)
           DESPERATE. 

           And that Truck.(cid:13)
           With her daughter.(cid:13)
           Gets further.  (cid:13)
           And further away.  

           And if it gets to the lake edge -- it's out of the kill zone.

           The Mother slips.(cid:13)
           Her body giving under her.(cid:13)
           She goes down.(cid:13)
           Face first.  (cid:13)
           Nothing graceful about it.(cid:13)
           The Rifle slides from her grip.

           And that Truck.(cid:13)
           With her daughter.(cid:13)
           Gets further.(cid:13)
           And further away. 

           She SCREAMS with awesome power.(cid:13)
           Spit flying.(cid:13)
           Summoning every last bit of strength she can.

           This time she doesn't get up.(cid:13)
           There's no getting back up.(cid:13)
           She drags herself.  (cid:13)
           One hand clawing after the other.  (cid:13)
           To that Rifle.

           And that Truck.(cid:13)
           With her daughter.(cid:13)
           Gets further.  (cid:13)
           And further away. 

           She uses the ice as a tripod.(cid:13)
           Sights up.(cid:13)
           Adjusts for the wind.(cid:13)
           Continues to adjust the range with one hand.  (cid:13)
           Wipes the blood dripping into her eye with the other.  (cid:13)
           Relaxes her left finger on the trigger.  (cid:13)
           Takes a wheezed breath.  (cid:13)
           Then stops breathing.

           This is the only shot that will ever matter.
           BANG!

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        The Truck.(cid:13)
                        At the edge of the lake.(cid:13)
                        A truck-length away from the safety of the shore.  (cid:13)

                        The rear window SHATTERS.(cid:13)

                        The Truck veers to the left.  (cid:13)
                        CRASHES into a tree.(cid:13)
                        And just stays like that.  (cid:13)
                        Until...(cid:13)

                        The driver side door pops open.  (cid:13)
                        Alexei's still moving inside.(cid:13)
                        Still alive.

           The EMOTION hits The Mother hard.(cid:13)
           This is the worst moment imaginable.(cid:13)
           She's failed her daughter...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        Alexei climbs out of the truck.(cid:13)
                        No.(cid:13)
                        Not climbs.  (cid:13)
                        FALLS.(cid:13)
                        Pushed out by...(cid:13)

                        ZOE.

           The Mother remembers to breath again.(cid:13)
           Through the SOBS.  (cid:13)
           Through gallows LAUGHTER.(cid:13)
           An outpouring of RELIEF racking her exhausted body...

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        Zoe steps over Alexei's DEAD body.(cid:13)
                        Runs back.(cid:13)
                        Slipping and sliding across the ice...

           The Mother tries to get to her feet.(cid:13)
           Only makes it to her knees.

           And then her daughter is in her arms.

           Zoe hugs her TIGHT.(cid:13)
           The Mother winces from the PAIN.(cid:13)
           Tears streaking through the blood on her face.
                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)           Her daughter is squeezing the life out of her.  (cid:13)
           And it feels good...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

           THROUGH THE SCOPE:

                        KIDS in the playground across the street.      (cid:13)
                        Watched by their MOTHERS and NANNIES.  (cid:13)

                        ZOE.  (cid:13)
                        A deck of cards in her hand.(cid:13)
                        Still sitting off to the side.(cid:13)
                        But this time...(cid:13)

                        She's showing another GIRL a magic trick.(cid:13)
                        That doesn't involve a knife or blood.(cid:13)
                        They sit CLOSE.(cid:13)
                        BEST FRIENDS.(cid:13)

                        ZOE'S MOTHER.  (cid:13)
                        Across the park.(cid:13)
                        Watches her daughter with a half smile.(cid:13)
                        Still a bit of wariness in her eyes.(cid:13)
                        She says something to the woman next to her.(cid:13)

                        A woman with a short bob now.(cid:13)
                        But the razor edges are still everywhere else.(cid:13)

                        REVEAL -- THE MOTHER.(cid:13)

                        A smile cresting her lips as she watches Zoe.(cid:13)
                        No more distance.(cid:13)
                        She's staying close now and forever...(cid:13)

                        So who the fuck is this watching? (cid:13)

                        The Mother's smile FADES.(cid:13)
                        Mother instincts kicking in.(cid:13)
                        Protect the off spring.(cid:13)
                        At all cost.(cid:13)

                        She turns.(cid:13)
                        Looks RIGHT AT US.(cid:13)
                        Dead center in the CROSSHAIRS.(cid:13)

                        BANG! 

                                                          SMASH TO WHITE.
