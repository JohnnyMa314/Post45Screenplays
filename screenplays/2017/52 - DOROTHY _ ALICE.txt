           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Icy rain drifts between tree limbs and streams of moonlight.  

           PANTING ECHOES through the forest.  Soon, A SHADOWY FIGURE 
           emerges from the trees.  

           Now in the moonlight, WE SEE that it’s a slender young woman  
           with dark hair, blue/green eyes and sharp features.  

           Freezing, she desperately falls to her knees and digs into 
           the muddy ground.

           She claws deeper into the sludge, desperate to find...  
           something.  Finally, her fingers uncover - A YELLOW BRICK 
           beneath the mud.  Then, another.  

           She can’t believe her eyes.  Soon, the heavy rain becomes A 
           FLOOD that reveals - AN ENTIRE PATH OF YELLOW BRICKS. 

           She’s nearly knocked over by the rushing water - when 
           something in the distance catches her attention... 

           A SHINING GREEN CITY 

           Gathering her strength, she scurries along the yellow bricks 
           to the gates of the city, before collapsing in the mud.  

           The wind howls.  Unexpectedly, the gates creak open.  The 
           girl gets up and enters...

           INT. THE EMERALD CITY - CONTINUOUS

           Maneuvering down an ominous hallway, she passes tall statues 
           flanked by lit torches.  GREEN GUARDS move towards the girl - 
           surrounding her with sharp spears.  Then, A VOICE ECHOES down 
           the hall. 

                                 VOICE 
                        Dorothy Gale? 

           The grotesque guards take a step back.  The young woman 
           doesn’t speak, but takes a step forward, attempting to gaze 
           into the EMERALD LIGHT emanating from the JEWELED THRONE at 
           the end of the hall.  

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Who’s there?

           An angelic, almost CHILDLIKE BEING steps from the brightness.  
           This is OZMA, Protectress of Oz.

                                 VOICE
                        Dorothy, it is you.
           Ozma is correct, this is in fact, DOROTHY GALE - from Kansas.  
           However, she’s no longer the child she once was; she’s now 
           18, and her eyes express a distant sadness. 

                                 OZMA
                        Finally, you’ve come back to us.

           Ozma slips off her emerald cloak and drapes it over Dorothy’s 
           shivering shoulders.  

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        You’re freezing.  Drink this. 

           She hands Dorothy a warm drink that seems to just materialize 
           in her hand.

                                 DOROTHY 
                            (sips the hot beverage)
                        I’ve had this same dream over and 
                        over, trying to find the yellow 
                        brick road...digging forever.  But 
                        this time I found it, I found you.

                                 OZMA
                        I used every kind of magic I know 
                        to bring you back here. 

           Ozma moves to a large CRYSTAL SHARD behind her-- inside it, 
           energy swirls and strange forces clash.  

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        There are other worlds Dorothy,  
                        you’re proof of that.  But what we 
                        never realized is that there are 
                        other lands-- countries, just 
                        beyond our borders.  

           IMAGES FORM in the shard...

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        Places like Wonderland.

           Plants and flowers (that move and communicate almost human-
           like) appear as a WHITE RABBIT hops along a winding trail, 
           clutching a gold pocket watch. 

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        And Neverland...

           Next, Dorothy SEES a WILD ISLAND, where boys dressed in 
           animal skins race through a dense jungle before jumping from 
           a rocky cliff into a crystal blue sea. 

           As the boys plunge into the clear water...beautiful MERMAIDS 
           are waiting for them.   
                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        But like Oz, these places have 
                        their own dark forces to reckon 
                        with. 

           AN ARMY of hundreds of KNIGHTS (flanked by enormous DIRE 
           WOLVES) are led by THE RED PRINCE (20’s), a masked warrior 
           dressed in crimson armor.

           They march through an endless desert of BLACK SAND.  

           Across from the Red Prince, another army waits...a rag-tag 
           collection of dirty sailors, people with painted faces, and 
           boys with makeshift weapons.  

           Gazing at the oncoming army, the Red Prince holds up a 
           BEATING HEART in his right hand, and squeezes it.  

           Across from him, the black sand OPENS UP under the feet of 
           the opposing army and CONSUMES THEM.  SCREAMS OF TERROR ring 
           out as the Red Prince watches them die...his fingers dripping 
           crimson from the crushed heart in his hand.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Dear God, who is that?

                                 OZMA
                        The Red Prince of Wonderland, the 
                        first born son of the one they call 
                        the Red Queen...or the Queen of 
                        Hearts.

           A SWIRL OF LIGHT changes the images in the shard. 

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        The Red Prince searches for the 
                        Dream Stone, an object so powerful, 
                        it can open the door to any world 
                        in existence. 

            WE NOW SEE A GLISTENING SAPPHIRE STONE in the shard. 

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        The stone must be found before the 
                        night of the pale moon... if not, 
                        the Red Queen will summon a 
                        powerful dark army-- waiting to 
                        fight and die for her.

           Ozma puts a hand on Dorothy’s shoulder.  

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, if this comes to pass, no 
                        world will be safe from her reign 
                        of terror...not even your own.
                                 DOROTHY
                        But what can I do, what can anyone 
                        do? 

                                 OZMA
                        There is someone.  A girl from your 
                        world.  We believe she knows where 
                        the stone is hidden.   

           Instantly, something MASSIVE strikes the ceiling.  The room 
           begins to crumble...as knights in RED ARMOR enter.

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        You have to go...

           Quickly, Ozma drops a tiny EMERALD into Dorothy’s hand.

                                 OZMA (CONT’D)
                        ...take this, go to the lake just 
                        beyond the Emerald City, throw it 
                        into the water.  Quickly!

           Red knights move in...Ozma’s guards try to hold them back.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Wait.  The girl, how do I find her?

           THE CEILING CRACKS - READY TO COLLAPSE. 

                                 OZMA
                        You don’t have to find her.  Alice 
                        will find you.  

           The ceiling CAVES IT.  Dodging falling rubble, Dorothy rushes  
           down the hallway she came from...fleeing the Emerald City.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

           Dorothy sprints down the watery yellow brick road.  Around 
           her, WAR has taken Oz.  Red knights do battle with Oz’s army - 
           catapults firing on the Emerald City. 

           Gazing into the sky, Dorothy SEES WINGED PRIMATES speeding 
           into the battle...swooping down to fight off the RED 
           SOLDIERS. 

           As Dorothy trudges through the rain, HAIL pelts her from 
           above.  Ozma’s VOICE rings in her head...

                                 OZMA (V.O.)
                        Dorothy, go to the lake.

           Sprinting through the woodland, Dorothy stops to catch her 
           breath, only to find...A PACK OF DIRE WOLVES. 
           They creep from behind the shadowy trees in front of her.  As 
           Dorothy backs up, the dire wolves slink closer, showing 
           teeth.  Then, out of the corner of her eye, she SEES...

           THE LAKE 

           She RUNS FOR IT, but the wolves follow...barking and biting.  
           Dorothy SLIPS, but she gets up-- struggling toward the lake. 

           Then, just as she’s at the edge of the water, she glances 
           back and SEES...THE RED PRINCE - right behind the wolves. 

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        I don’t know what Ozma told you, 
                        but it’s not the truth.  Come with 
                        me, and I’ll explain your part in 
                        this journey.

           As rain and hail crash, the Prince reaches out a hand.  

           Shivering, Dorothy shakes her head “no”.  In a flash, the 
           wolves bound for her.  Then, A LOUD ROAR ECHOES. 

           A POWERFUL LION leaps from behind them, biting and clawing at 
           the entire wolf pack.  Startled, the Red Prince takes cover 
           as the dire wolves and the lion rip into each other’s flesh.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Lion! 

                                 LION
                        Dorothy, go!

           Remembering something, she reaches into her pocket and 
           removes the EMERALD given to her by Ozma.

           Without even thinking, she pitches the stone into the lake.  
           Instantly, the entire lake becomes...SOLID GREEN ICE.  

           As Dorothy runs out onto it, the Red Prince follows her. 

           From the shore, a plaintive roar echoes.  The wolves have the 
           lion pinned on the ground.

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        All you have to do is stop running-- 
                        and I’ll call off my wolves and 
                        save your lion! 

           Dorothy freezes as huge HAILSTONES fall...some shatter the 
           green ice around her.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Okay, just leave him alone! 

           Seeing that Dorothy has stopped running, the Red Prince calls 
           out...
                                  THE RED PRINCE
                        Halt! 

           The wolves BACK AWAY from the lion, but just as the Prince 
           takes a steps toward her, a HUGE HAILSTONE HITS THE ICE.  

           As the lake CRACKS, Dorothy plunges under the water.  The Red 
           Prince goes to her, but she’s TRAPPED BELOW THE ICE. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. UNDER THE ICE - CONTINUOUS

           Screaming, freezing water fills her lungs.  Finally, she 
           clutches a BLOCK OF ICE and pulls her head out of the water.  
           As she struggles for air...she SEES the eyes of the Red 
           Prince-- behind the mask.

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Take my hand! 

           As he grabs her fingers, she slips back under - drifting to 
           the bottom of the lake as...EVERYTHING GOES DARK.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GALE FARMHOUSE/KANSAS - NIGHT

           A million miles from Oz, Dorothy is now in Kansas in 1901.  
           In her bed, she GASPS for breath...sweat pouring down her 
           face as she dreams.  Across the room, A LIGHT flicks on.  

           Her Uncle Henry (68), rushes to her bedside.  

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Dorothy, it’s me, it’s Uncle Henry.

           Dorothy thrashes in bed.

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Please, wake up.

           Suddenly, her eyes FLASH OPEN.  Slowly, she catches her 
           breath and gazes up at her Uncle.

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It was the dream again, wasn’t it?

           Henry wipes the sweat from her brow.  After a beat...

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s still the middle of the night, 
                        you should try to get back to 
                        sleep. 
           Leaving, he turns off the light.   

                                 DOROTHY
                        Please, don’t turn out the light.  

           As he flips the light back on, Dorothy’s elderly dog, TOTO, 
           climbs up onto the bed. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. GALE FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING

           In the modest Gale Kitchen, Uncle Henry scrambles eggs.  Toto 
           is at his feet, wagging his tail.  Henry puts the eggs onto 
           two plates, but also drops a scoop into the dog’s bowl. 

           Dorothy emerges from her room and sits at the kitchen table.  
           She glances down at an opened letter on the counter - it’s 
           from BAKER UNIVERSITY. 

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Hope you don’t mind, but I opened 
                        that.  Says you can still go for 
                        free, if you want to that is.

           He sits down and puts the eggs and toast on the table. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m not going anywhere.  I work 
                        here, on the farm.

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        I’m selling the farm. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Uncle Henry, you know you don’t 
                        mean that.

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        I do mean it.  With Emily gone, 
                        it’s not the same.  The dream died.

           He looks over at Dorothy.  She’s a beautiful girl, but she 
           looks too sad and tired for a young woman of her age. 

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Sides, you need to move on with 
                        your life...not stay here with me 
                        forever. 

           Dorothy takes a bite of her eggs and glances out at the slate 
           grey Kansas sky through the window. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. GALE FARMHOUSE - LATE MORNING

           WE SEE Dorothy doing various chores on the farm: tending to 
           the chickens, feeding the pigs, cleaning the horses’ stalls, 
           and plowing the fields with her Uncle.

           Later, we see her alone in THE BARN.  Opening a drawer, she 
           wipes the dust from an aged PICTURE of her younger self with 
           her Aunt Emily.  Seeing the image, Dorothy is visibly moved. 

           Soon, the day ends as the RED SUN sinks.  As Dorothy watches 
           it, she seems transfixed.  Not far off, her Uncle Henry 
           watches her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALE FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - DUSK

           Dorothy washes dishes in the sink.  Uncle Henry comes up 
           behind her.

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Dorothy, we can’t bring her back, 
                        but we both know she’s in a better 
                        place now. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        A better place... how do we know 
                        that? 

           Silent, Dorothy turns off the water.  

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Dorothy, look at me.

           She turns around, clearly upset. 

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        When you were a girl, your dreams 
                        were so vivid, so real; you had 
                        your own magic world that only you 
                        could visit, a place that needed 
                        you as much as you needed it.

           Tears begin to form in her eyes. 

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        But now, the very thing that seemed 
                        to save you is tearing you apart 
                        inside, isn’t it? 

           She collapses into his frail arms. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        Things happened in my dream last 
                        night-- things that I know I’m 
                        supposed to remember, but I can’t.  
                        I’m afraid, Uncle Henry.  

           Henry thinks. 

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        There was a doctor we took you to 
                        when you were a child...he believed 
                        in your dreams, do you remember?

           Pulling back from the embrace, she “nods” to him.

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s time you talked to him 
                        again.

           EXT. GALE FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           With the morning sun rising behind them, Dorothy and her 
           Uncle Henry climb into a horse drawn carriage.  For a block 
           or two, Toto runs behind them, barking and kicking up Kansas 
           dust.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patients wait tensely on cold leather seats.  Among them is 
           Dorothy.  Soon, a NURSE comes in and motions for Dorothy to 
           follow her.

           INT. DR. SIMON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy gazes out a window at the clouds.  DR. SIMON (65) 
           enters, his kind eyes framed behind dark glasses. 

                                 DR. SIMON
                        Dorothy Gale, it’s been a long 
                        time... I was so sorry to hear 
                        about your Aunt Emily’s passing.  I 
                        hope you know you meant the world 
                        to her. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Thank you.

           The Doctor sinks into a chair across from her.  He removes a 
           pen and journal from a black bag. 
                                 DR. SIMON
                        You know, I still have everything 
                        you ever told me written down...the 
                        tin woodman, the scarecrow, the 
                        lion--  even the witch, and the 
                        wizard.

           ANGLE ON: his notes.  WE SEE not only his hand written 
           account of Dorothy’s adventures in Oz, but also SKETCHES of 
           people and places from Dorothy’s tales.

                                 DR. SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, are your dreams still as 
                        fantastic as they were when you 
                        were a child? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Most of the time, I can’t remember 
                        my dreams anymore.

                                 DR. SIMON
                        Since your Aunt passed?

           Dorothy “nods.”  The Doctor makes a note in his black book. 

                                 DR. SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Sadly, death affects our reality 
                        and our dreams...and how are you 
                        spending your days?  Are you still 
                        working on the farm?

           Dorothy “nods.” 

                                 DR. SIMON (CONT’D)
                        And friends?

           Dorothy ignores the question.

                                 DR. SIMON (CONT’D)
                        No friends?  

           A dark silence creeps through the room.

                                 DR. SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, there must be a reason 
                        you’ve come here, other than to 
                        listen to an old man talk at you.

           Finally...

                                 DOROTHY
                        I know I have to get back to a 
                        world that only exists in my 
                        dreams...and if I don’t, terrible 
                        things will happen and people will 
                        die.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOROTHY (CONT'D)
                                  (pause)
                        I suppose that makes me crazy.      

           Dr. Simon slips off his glasses. 

                                 DR. SIMON
                        I’ve listened to lies and insanity 
                        my entire life, but what you told 
                        me about Oz?  That never sounded 
                        false or crazy. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Then how does a man of science 
                        explain a girl who claims she can 
                        travel to other worlds in her 
                        dreams?

                                 DR. SIMON
                        Because I don’t have to.  In a 
                        world where four, five, even six 
                        dimensions exist?  Anything is 
                        possible, and more likely than not, 
                        probable.  Just answer me this... 
                        what feels more real to you, your 
                        life when you’re dreaming, or your 
                        life when you’re awake?

           Dorothy turns back to the window.  A profound beat. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I don’t know anymore.

           On a bench outside Dr. Simon’s office, Dorothy OVERHEARS a 
           conversation between the doctor and her Uncle Henry. 

                                 DR. SIMON (O.S.)
                        Henry, I’ve known you since grade 
                        school--  I’d do anything in my 
                        power to help you, or Dorothy.

                                 UNCLE HENRY (O.S.)
                        Is there anything you can do for 
                        her? 

                                 DR. SIMON (O.S.)
                        I’m afraid not.  But I believe 
                        there’s someone who can.

           EXT. HORSE AND BUGGY - DAY

           Now heading home, Dorothy and Henry return to the farm in 
           their horse drawn carriage. 

                                 DR. SIMON (V.O.)
                        Dr. Adler in London is the foremost 
                        authority on dreams and the 
                        unconscious, and from what I

                        young people with situations very 
                        similar to Dorothy’s.  

           The carriage approaches the Gale Farm. 

                                 DR. SIMON (V.O.)
                        I’ll make contact and see if Dr. 
                        Adler will take on Dorothy’s case.

           INT. GALE FARMHOUSE/DOROTHY’S ROOM - LATE DAY

           Dorothy watches from her window as her Uncle Henry and Dr. 
           Simon talk.  Then, they shake hands.  The Doctor gets into 
           his 1901 Gasmobile, and drives off. 

           Dorothy steps away from the window...she knows what they were 
           discussing - we can see it on her face.  Soon, Uncle Henry 
           appears in her doorway.

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Dr. Simon had some good news.  Dr. 
                        Adler in London has agreed to work 
                        with you. 

           Dorothy doesn’t answer.

                                 UNCLE HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sweetheart, did you hear me?  
                        You’re gonna get some help...get 
                        your life back.

                        What about the farm?  

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        I got an offer.  It’s not exactly 
                        what I hoped for, but it’s a good 
                        price. 

                                 DOROTHY

                        But you can’t!  The farm was her 
                        dream... don’t we owe it to her to 
                        keep it alive?   

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        Sweetheart, we both want her back, 
                        but holding onto the past isn’t 
                        going to change what happened.   

                                   DOROTHY
                        This is home.  Her home.

           Henry’s eyes grow sad.

                                 UNCLE HENRY
                        After everything you’ve been 
                        through...you still don’t know 
                        where home is?  Where she is?

           Dorothy struggles, tears fill her eyes.  Below, Toto appears 
           at her feet, tail wagging. 

                                 DOROTHY

                                (cracking a smile)
                        I’ll take good care of Toto while 
                        you’re gone.  You have my word.

           EXT. PORT OF LONDON  - LATE DAY

           Docked on the bank of the River Thames, Dorothy exits the 
           ship.  Gazing through the crowd of disembarking passengers, 
           she manages to catch a fleeting glimpse of...

           THE CITY OF LONDON

           After walking down a long gang-plank, she finds herself at 
           the intersection of a busy street. 

           A mix of early automobiles and horse-drawn carriages zig-zag 
           around street vendors, hustling from the sidewalks to the 
           streets.  Nearly everyone who passes Dorothy stops to have a 
           look at her...she’s definitely not from around here.  

           A sooty faced boy (12) gazes up at her.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Excuse me, can you tell me how to 
                        get to Saville Row? 

                                 BOY
                        You gonna wanna take Regent Street.  
                        Come on, follow me!

           Grabbing her bag, he bolts across the street.  Hastening, she 
           follows him around a STREET BUS and across Regent Street into 
           a DARKENED ALLEY. 

           A HUGE STRIPED CAT leaps out in front of her, blocking her 
           path.  After a stare off, Dorothy slips past the animal, but 
           the cat never moves...it’s YELLOW EYES locked on her.  

           Dorothy hurries to catch up to the boy.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Hey, slow down, I mean it!

           DARIUS (20’s), tall, thin, and handsome appears behind her.    

                                 DARIUS
                        Dorothy Gale?

           She SPINS around.  Dorothy seems completely caught off guard.

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to frighten you...  
                        I heard your accent and assumed you 
                        might be our new guest.  I’m 
                        Darius, Dr. Adler’s assistant.  I 
                        was sent to meet you.

           THE BOY puts Dorothy’s bag down.  Darius quickly drops a 
           piece of copper into his waiting hand.  
           Tipping his hat, the kid runs down the alley.  Dazed, Dorothy 
           still stands in silence.

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        You are Dorothy, aren’t you? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Yes, yes--  I am.

           Darius picks up her bag.  

                                 DARIUS
                        Good.  If you’ll follow me, I’ll 
                        get you to Dr. Adler’s building.

           As the sun begins to set, Dorothy follows him deeper into the 
           alley.  Soon, they arrive at an ornate STONE DOORWAY.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        This looks like a church.

                                 DARIUS
                        Because it was.  Come. 

           He removes A KEY from his pocket and opens the imposing door.  

           INT. DR. ADLER’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy walks past painted walls and under archways carved 
           with portraits of saints and angelic beings.  Further down, 
           she takes in marble statues and other graven images.

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 DARIUS
                        Yes, the Doctor felt it would quite 
                        literally be a “sin” to redecorate.

           Ascending a spiral staircase, they enter another long hallway 
           with many doors. 

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        Years ago, nuns lived in these 
                        rooms, but now they’re occupied by 
                        Dr. Adler’s patients.  

           Almost immediately, a door SWINGS OPEN.  A YOUNG WOMAN 
           emerges...this is CHARLOTTE (17), a striking British girl of 
           Caribbean descent with a thick cockney accent. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Is this the yank?
                            (takes a look at Dorothy)
                        She is...where ya from, love?
                                 DOROTHY
                            (hesitantly)
                        Kansas.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Do you have the cinema in Kansas?

                                 DARIUS
                        Charlotte, you can talk with Miss 
                        Gale later.  Go back into your 
                        room.

           Displeased, Charlotte closes the door.  Darius and Dorothy 
           walk on.  Soon, another door opens down the hall.  

           MICHAEL DARLING (13) emerges.  He’s small for his age, but 
           impeccably dressed and well-groomed. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why, if it isn’t the girl from 
                        America.  Michael Darling, at your 
                        service.  Welcome to London...  
                        home of the brash, outrageous, and 
                        free.  

           Michael shakes her hand.  He starts to talk again, but...

                                 DARIUS
                        Alright,  Michael...you’ve made 
                        yourself known.  Now, let me get 
                        Miss Gale settled.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, yes of course.
                            (to Dorothy)
                        If you need anything at all, I’m 
                        just next door! 

           Watching Michael enter his room, Dorothy SEES another boy 
           inside - handsome and brooding.  

           This is JOHN DARLING (19), Michael’s older brother.  For a 
           moment, he glances up at Dorothy, but quickly turns away. 

           Darius opens the next door. 

                                 DARIUS
                        This is where you’ll be staying.  
                        It’s not spacious, but it does have 
                        quite a nice view of the city.

           Dorothy peeks around.  A desk, a bed, and a wardrobe are the 
           only items in the space.  She goes to the window and takes in 
           the view of London. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s perfect, thank you. 
                                 DARIUS
                        Get yourself settled.  I’ll be back 
                        at half past six to take you to 
                        meet Dr. Adler. 

           As he leaves, Dorothy begins to unpack her clothes and put 
           them into the wardrobe.  In the process, a tiny piece of 
           paper falls onto to the floor.  Picking it up, she reads an 
           address...484 Land’s End.  

           Suddenly, VOICES ECHO through the thin wall - they’re coming 
           from Michael and John’s room NEXT DOOR. 

                                 MICHAEL  (O.S.)
                        Perhaps we should go check on the 
                        new American? 

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Please.  I have little interest in 
                        aristocrats from New York...     
                        let alone peasants from Kansas. 

           Moving away from the wall, Dorothy glances at the window and 
           sees...THE STRIPED CAT, who is once again staring at her.  
           Before Dorothy can even process, CHARLOTTE is in her doorway.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey Kansas, mind if I come in? 

           Dorothy doesn’t get a chance to answer; Charlotte is already 
           entering the room and closing the door behind her. 

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        This was Alice’s room.  

           Something about the name “ALICE” registers with Dorothy...we 
           can even see it her face.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Nobody knows where she went, but 
                        her cat’s still around.  Bloody 
                        thing creeps me out.

           Charlotte collapses on the bed, watching Dorothy unpack.  

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        So, are you a dreamwalker? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m not sure I know what you mean.

           Ignoring Dorothy’s response, Charlotte rolls over on her back 
           and gazes up at the ceiling.  
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I am.  I’ve travelled to a secret 
                        garden protected by twin dragons 
                        who guard the innocent from evil.  
                        Twice I saw the dragons defeat a 
                        wicked enchantress. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Sounds dangerous.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You have no idea.

           Charlotte’s confident tone momentarily dissipates.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        You actually believe me? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Why not?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Because no one else here does. 

           Charlotte moves closer to her and lowers her voice. 

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        So, do you wanna know why Alice 
                        really left?

           Dorothy looks intrigued.  Nods.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Why?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Some say it was because of an 
                        argument she had with John Darling. 
                        But others think it was because of 
                        them.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Them?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Darius and Dr. Adler.  She told me 
                        she didn’t want them crawling 
                        around in her head any longer...  
                        You’ve met John Darling, haven’t 
                        you?

                                 DOROTHY
                        I haven’t met anyone here besides 
                        you and Michael.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well, you’re in for a treat.  John 
                        is divine to look at, but not to be 
                        trifled with or crossed. 

           Unexpectedly, Darius opens the door. 

                                 DARIUS
                        Charlotte, what are you doing in 
                        here?  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You said I could talk with her 
                        later, didn’t you?

                                 DARIUS
                        Get out.  Dorothy has a meeting 
                        with Dr. Adler.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                            (to Dorothy)
                        Nice chatting.

           Slipping out, Charlotte strides down the hall to her room.

                                 DARIUS
                        Well then, are you ready?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Whenever you are.

           After walking further down the hall (and climbing up the 
           spiral staircase), they soon come to a RED DOOR and enter...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. ADLER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Candles glow and incense burns.  A few well placed art pieces 
           hang on the walls, but the center piece of the space is a 
           STRANGE MAP on the back wall.  

           From a chair by the fireplace, DR. ROSE ADLER (40’s) gets up 
           and approaches Darius and Dorothy.  She’s tall and lean with 
           sharp features. 

                                 DARIUS
                        Dr. Adler, this is Dorothy Gale.  
                        Dorothy, meet Dr. Rose Adler.  

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Finally, the girl I’ve heard so 
                        much about.  I’m enchanted to meet 
                        you, Dorothy.  
                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s good to finally meet you, too. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        It’s no mere coincidence our paths 
                        have crossed.  You know that, don’t 
                        you?  

                                 DOROTHY
                        I think so. 

           The Doctor extends her hand - Dorothy shakes it.  Switching 
           gears, Dr. Adler and steps closer to Dorothy. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        You’ve seen so many things and been 
                        through so much.  Dr. Simon’s 
                        letters suggest you have truly been 
                        caught between two worlds. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        That’s one way to describe it.

           The Doctor smiles.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Attaching words and meaning to 
                        things that happen when we dream is 
                        what I do. 

           The Doctor moves over to THE LARGE MAP hanging on the wall.  

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t a map of some far off 
                        continent on the other side of the 
                        globe.  It’s a sketch of a 
                        dreamworld. 

           Dorothy moves closer to the map.  She SEES places marked: 
           Neverland, Wonderland, even Oz and a few others. 

                                 DOROTHY
                            (thunderstruck)
                        You know about Oz? 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Only very little.  Dr. Simon shared 
                        the information he compiled from 
                        his sessions with you.  Also, there 
                        was once a girl here who claimed 
                        she’d been to the border of Oz, but 
                        never actually entered the realm.  

           Dorothy turns from the map to the Doctor. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice?
                                 DR. ADLER
                        And what do you know of Alice? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Nothing really - only that I’m 
                        staying in her room.

                                 DARIUS
                            (to Dr. Adler)
                        Charlotte was in Dorothy’s room 
                        when I went to get her.

           Dr. Adler turns back to Dorothy.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        I wouldn’t listen to Charlotte--  
                        there’s little evidence she has any 
                        real abilities.  Alice, on the 
                        other hand, is quite gifted.  
                        Sadly, her history of mental 
                        instability drove her away from us. 
                        A real shame, actually.  She taught 
                        us all we know of Wonderland.

                                 DOROTHY
                        And what is Wonderland?

           Dr. Adler pours a cup of tea.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Wonderland is a reality not unlike 
                        Oz...  A place where nursery rhymes 
                        and riddles live and breath, and 
                        animals can speak.  However, after 
                        a time, the fantasy seems to turn 
                        quite dark for those who can slip 
                        into it, becoming less of a dream 
                        and more of a nightmare. 

           She hands Dorothy the tea.  Again, she switches gears. 

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        Dear child, you just travelled 
                        across an entire ocean... you must 
                        be exhausted.  Please, get some 
                        much needed rest...the tea will 
                        help you sleep.

                                 DOROTHY
                            (taking the tea)
                        Thank you, it was good to meet you. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Likewise, Dorothy.  Let’s talk more 
                        tomorrow.

           Darius starts to lead Dorothy out, but she stops him. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        Thank you, but I think I can find 
                        my way to my room. 

           Darius opens the door, but doesn’t follow her.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           IN THE HALLWAY:

           Rounding a corner, Dorothy sees JOHN DARLING in the hall.  
           Seeing her up close, he’s instantly taken with her indigo 
           eyes and raven hair.  

           Trying to pretend not to see him, she goes for her door, 
           but...

                                 JOHN
                        It’s Dorothy, right? 

           Dorothy stops.  She goes for her door again, but John puts 
           his hand on her wrist.  

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Why are you rushing off to sit in 
                        an empty room? 

           He smiles, pushing his chestnut hair from his eyes.  Dorothy 
           isn’t having it.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s been a very long day in a 
                        sophisticated new world...       
                        I’m afraid solitude is all a 
                        simpleton like myself can handle 
                        right now. 

                                 JOHN
                        Simpleton? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well, certainly not an aristocrat 
                        from New York. 

           Caught, John lowers his head. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Good night.  Jim, was it? 

           She steps into the room and closes the door.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. DOROTHY’S ROOM - LATER

           Dorothy tries to fall asleep.  Rain trickles into the flat 
           through the open widow.  

           Sitting up, she sips the tea from Dr. Adler.  Slowly, the 
           room spins around.  Then, she sees...

           THE STRIPED CAT AT THE WINDOW 

           It’s yellow eyes glower.  Delirious, Dorothy DROPS the cup.  
           Then, the cat seems to SMILE A TWISTED GRIN, before vanishing 
           into the darkness.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS/SNOWSTORM - NIGHT

           The wind howls as snow blows through a dark forest.  

           In the midst of the storm, we start to make out DOROTHY, 
           trudging through the blizzard.  Freezing, she pushes through 
           the snow, unsure where she is or where she’s going. 

           She practically runs into SOMETHING SOLID.  Reaching up, her 
           hands touch an icy metal object. 

           Slowly, she realizes she’s looking into the frozen face of 
           her old friend, THE TIN WOODMAN. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Tin Man?

           There’s no reply at all... only a sad, blank expression that 
           hints of fear.  A VOICE blows through the wind. 

                                 VOICE
                        Dorothy?  Is that you? 

           Stepping forward, she SEES a tattered SCARECROW propped up 
           against a tree.  Dorothy hurries to him. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Scarecrow!  

           She throws her arms around him.

                                 SCARECROW
                        It is you.  Help me to my feet, I 
                        know a place where we can get out 
                        of the storm.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DRY CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as they’re inside, the Scarecrow points out some 
           matches.  Dorothy sparks a fire.  

           In the firelight, we see that the Scarecrow’s once jovial 
           face is twisted and burned.  But he smiles, pleased to see 
           his old friend.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What happened to you-- and to the 
                        Tin Man? 

           Scarecrow watches the fire’s shadows dance on the cave wall. 

                                 SCARECROW
                        Tin Man and I went out to fight 
                        with the rest of Oz’s army, but we 
                        were no match for the red 
                        warriors...I doubt I’d even be here 
                        if Ozma didn’t conjure up the 
                        snowstorm that pushed them back.

           Dorothy notices his arm is gone.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Your arm...

                                 SCARECROW
                        Oh, that.  That’s nothing some 
                        fresh straw can’t fix.  Tin Man on 
                        the other hand, he’s as motionless 
                        as the day we found him rusted in 
                        the woods...poor fella took out at 
                        least ten of the enemy with his axe 
                        before he froze solid.  

           THUNDER CRASHES in the distance.  Scarecrow lowers his voice.

                                 SCARECROW (CONT’D)
                        Ozma said there was a girl.  A girl 
                        from your world-- she knows where 
                        to find the stone.

           Dorothy knows who he means. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice. 

           WOLVES HOWL... Scarecrow peeks out of the mouth of the cave. 

                                 SCARECROW
                        You have to go.  Dorothy, find the  
                        girl...only together will you be 
                        able to save Oz! 
           LOUD BARKING echoes outside.  The Scarecrow removes a rock in 
           the cave floor and takes out SOMETHING wrapped in a blanket.  
           He hands the item to Dorothy.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s this?

           As she removes the blanket, Dorothy can’t believe her eyes.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get these?

                                 SCARECROW
                        Ask me another time. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. WOODS/SNOWSTORM - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy blasts out of the cave.  Snow comes down in sheets as 
           LIGHTING FLARES.  THE DIRE WOLVES are already hot on her 
           trail.  

           In seconds, she’s trapped against a twisted tree.  The wolves 
           move in even closer.  

           PANNING DOWN TO HER FEET: WE SEE what Scarecrow gave her...

           HER FAMOUS RED SHOES - she tries to click her heels.   

                                 DOROTHY
                            (under her breath)
                        There’s no place like 
                        home...there’s no place like... 

           Thunder booms, as the wolf pack stealthily cuts through the 
           snow - inching nearer.  

           In a flash, one of the dire wolves LEAPS FOR HER, but she 
           dives out of the way, and lands right at the feet of...

           THE FROZEN TIN MAN  

           With the wolves surrounding her, Dorothy clutches tightly to 
           the Tin Man - hiding behind him (and his fierce axe) as... 

           THE RED PRINCE COMES THROUGH THE TREES 

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Dorothy! 

           Dorothy tries to click her heels again. 

                                 DOROTHY
                            (teeth chattering)
                        There’s no place like HOME! 
           Just as the wolf pack jumps on her, LIGHTING STRIKES the Tin 
           Man.  HIS EYES FLASH OPEN as a blast of WHITE LIGHT radiates.  

           The Red Prince shields his eyes from the light--as it sends 
           the wolves flying back, and Dorothy back to...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DOROTHY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           DOROTHY WAKES UP gasping for breath.  At the same time, 
           THUNDER and LIGHTNING crash outside her window...brightening 
           the room and illuminating... 

           A GIRL STANDING OVER HER.  The girl’s long blond hair is 
           drenched from the London rain.

                                 GIRL
                        What did you do with it?!  

           Dorothy hasn’t even processed that she’s back yet.  The girl 
           rips into the wardrobe and desk drawers, searching for 
           something.  Still delirious, Dorothy sits up-- watching her. 

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        I swear to God, if you lost it, 
                        I’ll murder you! 

           Dorothy studies the manic girl, tearing through her things. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice? 

           The girl spins around... She is ALICE (18), beautiful and 
           frail, but there’s a dangerous quality in her eyes. 

                                 ALICE
                        How do you know my name? 

           Dorothy climbs out of bed. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Because whether I’m dreaming or 
                        awake, I keep hearing it. 

           The DOOR flies open.  Michael and John Darling step inside. 

                                 JOHN
                            (to Alice)
                        You’re back? 

           Alice scowls at John. 

                                 ALICE
                        Not to see you!
           Alice EYES what she’s been looking for: the tiny piece of 
           paper that Dorothy found with the address written on it - 484 
           Land’s End.  

           She grabs THE PAPER before hurrying to...THE WINDOW.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice, wait.  Don’t go! 

           Another VOICE booms behind them. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        That’s good advice, Alice. 

           Alice turns from the window and sees... Dr. Adler and Darius 
           have both entered the room.

                                 ALICE
                        Never!  I can’t even dream anymore 
                        because of you!

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Alice, we both know that’s not 
                        true.  You begged us to take the 
                        dreams away.

           Alice shakes her head “no,” her eyes even more manic now.  
           Dr. Adler steps closer to her.

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        Please, let me help you.

                                 ALICE
                        No, get away from me!

           Suddenly, she turns and LEAPS out of the window.  

           Dorothy hurries to the window and sees that...Alice has 
           hurdled down to a lower structure-- and is now running down 
           the street. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Dorothy, come away from there.

           Dorothy thinks.  Suddenly, she makes a snap decision and...

           JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW, TOO. 

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, no!

           She’s gone.  Darius leaps out of the window after her.  In 
           the doorway, Charlotte appears in a nightgown.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did I miss something? 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

           Dorothy scurries after Alice, but Darius is close behind.  
           Dorothy SEES a shadow and follows it into...

           AN ALLEY - A VOICE calls from down the street.

                                 DARIUS (O.S.)
                        Dorothy!  

           Dorothy panics - she knows he’s getting closer.  

                                 DARIUS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what Alice told you, 
                        but it’s not the truth! 

           The only STREET LAMP GOES OUT.  As Dorothy turns around, 
           Darius is there.  

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        You’re our responsibility, Dorothy.  
                        We can help you, but not if you-- 
                        run!

           As he lunges to GRABS her, THE STRIPED CAT leaps between them 
           HISSING WILDLY.  Startled, Darius lets go of Dorothy - who is 
           suddenly grabbed by Alice.  

                                 ALICE
                        This way, now! 

           Splashing through puddles, Dorothy and Alice race out of the 
           alley and onto...

           LAND’S END STREET  

           Darius tries to follow them, but he’s cut off by a LARGE 
           STEEET BUS.  Beaten, he watches their shadows disappear in 
           the rain.  

           Alice seizes Dorothy’s wrist and pulls her under an ABANDONED 
           STORE FRONT.   

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?!

                                 DOROTHY
                            (catching her breath)
                        I’m Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

           The rain pounds around them.
                                 ALICE
                        The Dorothy Gale?  The witch 
                        slayer? 

           Dorothy looks confused...

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well...I suppose I did drop a house 
                        on a witch, and liquidated her 
                        sister...who incidentally was also 
                        a witch--

           Alice reaches out and touches Dorothy’s forehead.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        --What are you doing? 

           Alice CLOSES HER EYES.  Then, after a beat...

                                 ALICE
                            (under her breath)
                        They’ve seen everything. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What did you say??

           A LOUD HISS rings out behind them.  Alice turns to see - the 
           striped...CHESHIRE CAT. 

                                 ALICE
                            (to the cat)
                        What is it? 

           Cheshire meows, motioning to a sign across the street that 
           says...  484 LAND’S END - HATTER’S SHOP.  Alice turns from 
           the HATTER’S SHOP to Dorothy. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You, follow me.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. ADLER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Darius enters Dr. Adler’s dimly lit office.  

                                 DARIUS
                        They’re gone.  I lost them on 
                        Land’s End.  

           The doctor seems unfazed. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        You’re drenched.  Come, sit by the 
                        fire. 
                                 DARIUS
                        Sit?  I’ve got to get back out 
                        there and find them.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        And where do you propose you’ll 
                        look?  

           Dr. Adler pours tea.

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to find them...not 
                        in this world, anyway. 

           She hands him a cup.  

                                 DARIUS
                        So, what do you suggest we do?

           CLOSE ON: The doctor sipping her tea.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        You know exactly what it is that we 
                        have to do. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HATTER’S SHOP - NIGHT

           Outside the Hatter’s shop, a CLOSED sign hangs in the window.  
           Alice knocks anyway, but gets no response.  The CHESHIRE CAT 
           jumps up to an OPEN WINDOW, and slips into the shop.  

           Taking the cue, Dorothy and Alice follow the cat through the 
           window and into...

           INT. HATTER’S SHOP - CONTINUOUS 

           Inside, they slink through a maze of crates that are 
           overflowing with every kind of HAT one could possibly 
           imagine.  

           Following the cat through a DOORWAY, they creak down a long 
           wooden staircase to...

           THE BASEMENT   

           Heaping piles of hat boxes and packages rise from the floor 
           to the ceiling.  

           The Cheshire Cat MEOWS - pawing at a BOX OF MATCHES.  Alice 
           grabs them.  Sparking a match, she begins to search the room.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Um.  What are we doing?
                                 ALICE
                        We’re finding our way in.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Into what?

           The Cheshire Cat STALKS A MOUSE across the floor. 

                                 ALICE
                        The otherside.

           A VOICE (with a thick Irish accent), booms behind them.

                                 VOICE
                        Whose there?  

           From the shadows, THE MAD HATTER (40) emerges with a maniacal 
           look in his eyes.  He looks like a gothic Oscar Wilde in a 
           tattered black hat. 

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        Alice?

                                 ALICE
                        Hatter, you scared me. 

                                 THE MAD HATTER 
                        You’ve come for the looking glass.

                                 ALICE
                        You did get it, didn’t you?

           The Hatter turns to Dorothy.

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        Who’s she?

                                 ALICE
                        She’s the one we heard about, the 
                        witch slayer from Oz. 

           The Hatter’s eyes widen.

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        You’re Dorothy Gale...Princess of 
                        Oz?  

           Alice turns to her.

                                 ALICE
                        Princess?

                                 DOROTHY
                        I don’t know anything about being a 
                        Princess.
                                 MAD HATTER
                            (he extends his hand)
                        Your majesty, it’s an honor to 
                        finally meet you.

           Slightly unnerved, Dorothy shakes his hand.  Alice turns to 
           the Hatter. 

                                 ALICE
                        Please tell me you found the 
                        looking glass.

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        Alice, just how mad do you think I 
                        am? 

           He slips a satin blanket off an item behind him, revealing A 
           LARGE CRACKED MIRROR.  Alice steps closer to it. 

                                 ALICE
                        Hatter, it’s shattered.

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        Yes, and sadly the world behind it 
                        has become quite shattered, too... 
                        If the Red Prince finds the stone 
                        before the pale moon appears-- no 
                        world will be safe from his 
                        mother’s wickedness.

           The Hatter takes a step closer to Alice. 

                                 THE HATTER
                        Alice, you know as well as I do...  
                        The Red Queen’s lust for power is 
                        insatiable...she won’t stop until 
                        she rules over every world in  
                        existence. 

           Dorothy seems confused and more than a little nervous. 

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        You must see the stone safely 
                        delivered to the White Knight.    
                        You do still know how to find the 
                        stone, don’t you?

           Before she can answer, she notices that the Cheshire Cat is 
           CHASING THE MOUSE toward the LOOKING GLASS. 

                                 ALICE
                               (to the cat)
                        Hey, stop that!    

           The cat doesn’t listen.  It continues to chase the mouse, on 
           a collision course with the mirror.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Cheshire, don’t!

           Too late, the mouse DISAPPEARS into the mirror.  Then, THE 
           CAT as well.  Alice yanks Dorothy by the hand. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What are you doing?! 

                                 ALICE
                        Goodbye, Hatter!

           The Hatter watches as Alice pulls Dorothy through...

           THE LOOKING GLASS.  

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        Farewell, ‘till we meet again...

           INT. WONDERLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Still chasing the mouse, the cat DIVES for it, but CRASHES 
           into a stack of boxes.  Behind him, Dorothy and Alice skid 
           into the room and topple over.  

           Dusting herself off, Alice gets up, looks around.

                                 ALICE
                        Really Cheshire, a mouse...have you 
                        no self-control? 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        You know you’d still be in the rain 
                        if it weren’t for me, right?   

           The cat slowly gets up and licks his paws.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        Remember that when you’re passing 
                        judgement on my feline instincts.  

                                 ALICE
                        I like you so much better when you 
                        can’t talk. 

                               DOROTHY
                        The cat...talks?

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        This is Wonderland, everything 
                        talks. 
           Dorothy realizes the room seems to be identical to the one 
           they just left, but being a MIRROR WORLD - everything that 
           was on the right is now on the left.

                                 DOROTHY
                            (processing)
                        If we’re not dreaming...how did we 
                        get here? 

           Alice has already entered an adjoining chamber.

                                 ALICE
                        Because, there are other ways in 
                        beside dreaming...the looking glass 
                        is one of them.   

           Glancing back at the broken mirror, Dorothy processes. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                                   (to Dorothy)
                        Just be glad she didn’t drag you 
                        down a rabbit hole. 

           Dorothy moves into the next room where Alice is.  It’s a 
           massive DINING HALL filled with dozens of cakes and pies.  

           Dorothy picks up a COOKIE.  Written on it (in icing), it 
           say’s EAT ME.  Dorothy is just about to take a bite, but 
           Alice stops her.

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t eat...anything. 

           Dorothy slips the cookie into her pocket.  On a table across 
           from them, they see dozens of tiny corked BOTTLES marked - 
           DRINK ME.  Alice TAKES ONE and puts it in her pocket.

           Then, she moves to a DOOR at the back of the dining hall and 
           opens it.  As soon as she does, BRIGHT SUNLIGHT SHINES. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           Dorothy steps out into...

           EXT. WONDERLAND/GARDENS - CONTINUOUS

           ENORMOUS VIBRANT FLOWERS sprout forth from every inch of the 
           immense gardens.  Overhead, HUGE BUTTERFLIES flutter through 
           the sea of flowering plants.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        This place...it’s amazing.

           Bathed in sunlight, Dorothy takes it all in.  She reaches out 
           to touch a violet, but Alice stops her.  
                                 ALICE
                        Don’t touch.  

           Alice moves into the vegetation-- Dorothy follows.  Walking 
           on, Dorothy sees a multitude of FLOWERS, all taller than she 
           is. 

           Passing a row of six foot RED ROSES, Dorothy can’t help 
           herself - she leans in to have a sniff.   

           Her nose grazes a rose petal.   

           Instantly, a VINE wraps around her ankle and SLAMS her to the 
           ground, thorns digging into her flesh.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ahhh!

                                 ALICE
                        I thought I told you not to touch!!  

           Alice clutches Dorothy’s hand-- pulling her back from the 
           ROSE’S snapping JAWS.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Cheshire, help!

           The cat backs up.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Help.  Help, how?

           The ROSE’S fanged MOUTH bounds and bites.  Dorothy is pulled 
           closer to it.  Other vines begin to move in around them. 

           A monstrous CENTIPEDE rips onto the scene...dozens of its 
           arms grab Dorothy-- creating a tug of war with the Rose. 

           THE ROSE dives, BITING into the centipede...sparking a 
           vicious insect and plant battle.  

           Alice yanks Dorothy up. 

                                 ALICE
                               (sarcastic)
                        On your feet, witch slayer! 

           In seconds, EVERYTHING in the garden goes on the attack.  
           Even the butterflies begin to SWOOP DOWN WITH THRASHING JAWS.  

           Dorothy and Alice run, duck and dodge as stems and vines 
           twist toward them, POLLEN blasting into the air.  The 
           Cheshire Cat races behind them. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Hold your breath! 
           Dorothy holds her breath as Alice leads her to...

           A LABYRINTH OF TEN FOOT HEDGES 

           The girls collapse under a sign that says GARDEN MAZE. 
           Dorothy gazes up at it.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Maze?

                                 ALICE
                        Just follow me and listen to what I 
                        say...understand? 

           The cat ROLLS HIS EYES.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Sure...just listen to you.  

                                 ALICE
                        Perhaps you know where to go?

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        No, but neither do you...so it 
                        really doesn’t matter, does it?

           As the cat slinks deeper into the maze, the girls follow. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DR. ADLER'S OFFICE - MORNING

           Back in the REAL WORLD, Dr. Adler sits alone by the fire with 
           her tea, but this time it’s accompanied by a cigarette.  John 
           and Michael Darling enter the room.

                                 JOHN 
                        Doctor, you wanted to see us? 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Boys, yes-- and where is Darius?

                                 JOHN
                        He said he had something to attend 
                        to-- and that he’d be here shortly. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We assumed he went off to recover 
                        Alice and Dorothy. 

           The Doctor gets up and faces the brothers.  

                                 DR. ADLER
                        No.  The girls are long gone, far 
                        from this world.
           John takes off his hat and lowers his head.

                                 JOHN
                        Dr. Adler, with all due respect... 
                        why exactly is it that you wanted 
                        to see us at this time of night? 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        I am so glad you asked that 
                        question, John. 

           Dr. Adler takes a long drag off her cigarette.

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        As you both know, I have been 
                        absolutely committed to helping you 
                        find your sister. 

           The brothers exchange a glance. 

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        Unfortunately, locating her has 
                        become more...complicated. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        How so?

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Alice is close to finding a relic.  
                        The very relic we believe could 
                        help us find her. 

           The doctor extinguishes her cigarette into an ashtray. 

                                 JOHN
                        What relic?

                                 DR. ADLER
                        A stone, actually.  However, there 
                        are some very powerful people 
                        who’ve told Alice that it’s 
                        dangerous, and that it needs to be 
                        destroyed. 

           Darius enters the room. 

                                 DARIUS
                        And if it is destroyed, we may 
                        never find where that monster, 
                        Peter Pan, has taken your dear 
                        sister, Wendy.

                                 JOHN
                        What can be done?

           Dr. Adler approaches him.
                                 DR. ADLER
                        That, John-- is precisely the 
                        reason we need you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WONDERLAND/MAZE - CONTINUOUS

           Now deeper into the labyrinth, Alice leads the way round a 
           jagged corner.  The maze has become darker-- and the hedges 
           seem higher and more sinister.  Up ahead, their path has 
           become...A DEAD END.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Really?  This is the third time 
                        you’ve lead us absolutely nowhere.  

           Alice looks exhausted. 

                                 ALICE
                        I am so tired of your mouth.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        My mouth hasn’t tasted a morsel in 
                        over a day.

           Alice ignore him.  The cat rolls over on his back - paws in 
           the air.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to STARVE in here. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Maybe we should turn around. 

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, really, and go where? 

           Alice looks down.  She notices strewn bones and scattered 
           skeletons crushed under rocks.  At the same time, she hears a 
           GROWL down a distant passage. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What was that?

           As if on cue, the growl returns-- and FOOTSTEPS echo.   

                                 ALICE
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Agreed. 

           The trio dart down the shadowy passage.  Rounding a corner, 
           they nearly run into...
           A HUGE SLOBBERING TROLL-LIKE CREATURE  

           The brute is at least fifteen feet tall, covered in coarse 
           hair, and totally repugnant to look at.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What is THAT?

                                 ALICE
                        That’s a Tweedle. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        A Tweedle Dee, to be exact.

           The filthy creature opens it’s mouth to ROAR - revealing a 
           nasty mouth filled with rotting teeth.  At the same time, he 
           begins swinging a spiked MACE. 

                                 ALICE
                        RUN! 

           The mace nearly SMASHES the cat, but only catches the fur on 
           the tip of his tail.  

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Ahhh!!

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire! 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        I’m fine--  Just go! 

           The three of them blast around the next corner.  The rancid 
           creature is hot behind and closing the distance.  

           Up ahead, the maze breaks off in three directions.  Cheshire 
           GOES TO THE LEFT.  The girls follow him down a twisted trail 
           that leads into...

           AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

           Dorothy and Alice scurry down a botanical path (made up of 
           spiky cactus-like flowers), before running directly into...

           A SECOND TWEEDLE

                                 DOROTHY
                        There’s ANOTHER one?? 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Tweedle Dumb.  

                                 ALICE
                        Not as bright as his brother, but 
                        twice as strong. 
           Tweedle Dumb screams, SWINGING A CLUB at Alice.  

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Did you have to call it dumb?

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        What?  That’s it’s name! 

           Alice dives, but the beast persists...continuing to swat at 
           her with his weapon.  A WAD OF SLOBBER flies out of his mouth 
           and splatters over her head.

                                 ALICE
                            (wiping her face)
                        Eww! 

           As the cat scurries to hide, the troll SLAMS his club again.

                                 DOROTHY
                        We have to get outta here!!

           The cat looks back...Tweedle Dee is CHARGING right at them.  

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        And go where?!

           They’re TRAPPED.  Tweedle Dumb SCOOPS UP - Dorothy.  

           In the process, THE COOKIE (that she had put in her pocket), 
           DROPS to the ground.  The beast is just about to shove 
           Dorothy into its nasty mouth, when....  

           Alice SCREAMS up to the creature. 

                                 ALICE
                        You idiot, she’s poison!  

           Tweedle Dumb SNIFFS her and DROPS HER.  Dorothy crashes to 
           the ground-- Alice hurries over to her.  At the same time, 
           Tweedle Dee blasts into the hall. 

                                 TWEEDLE DEE
                        MINE!  

           Running toward the girls, he reaches down and scoops them 
           both up with his filthy claw.  Just as he’s about to slip 
           them into his mouth--  his brother GETS IN HIS FACE. 

                                  TWEEDLE DUMB
                            (growling)
                        Drop ‘em. 

           Refusing to give up his catch, Tweedle Dee FIGHTS HIS 
           BROTHER, punching and smacking - Dorothy and Alice flailing 
           around in his fist.  Dee’s mace FLIES - CRACKING Dumb over 
           the head. 
                                 TWEEDLE DUMB (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh!!!

           The beast BANGS to the ground, DROPPING Dorothy and Alice.

           Hiding in a hedge, the Cheshire Cat SEES the cookie and takes 
           a bite.  Instantly, one of his PAWS begins to GROW. 

           Regaining consciousness, Tweedle Dumb BEATS his brother 
           across the LEG with his club.  Dee goes DOWN.  At the same 
           time, both creatures notice that...

           DOROTHY AND ALICE ARE GETTING AWAY 

           The brothers move to recapture the girls, but hear an ear-
           shattering HISS - behind them.  Slowly, they turn around and 
           see...

           A NOW MASSIVE CHESHIRE CAT 

           The feline has grown to an astonishing ten-feet tall.  

           ANGLE ON: Dorothy and Alice - staring at the cat. 

                                 ALICE
                        Remember when I told you not to eat 
                        anything? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Yes.

                                 ALICE
                        That’s why. 

           Cheshire MEOWS menacingly at the Tweedles - WHO BACK UP.  

           Tweedle Dee flings his mace at the cat, who slaps it down 
           like a cheap toy.  It clangs to the ground.  Tweedle Dumb 
           tries to intimidate the cat with a GROWL, but gets a...

           CLAW TO THE FACE 

           The creature wails in pain.  Blood spatters.  Next, the cat 
           POUNCES - slamming Tweedle Dee to the floor. 

                                 TWEEDLE DEE
                        Ahhh!!!

           The cat and the trolls RIP into each other in a brutal 
           contest of claws and teeth.  However, it isn’t long before 
           the cat has both Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb... 

           ON THE RUN 

           The massive cat GLANCES DOWN at Dorothy and Alice. 
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                            (his loud voice bellows)
                        Take my fur!!!

                                 ALICE
                        Why?

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        So we can follow them out of here! 

           The girls grab on.  Instantly, the cat scurries after the 
           Tweedles, who dart through the labyrinth.  Dorothy and Alice 
           bounce and flail...hanging onto the cat for dear life.

           Cheshire races around tight corners and rips down narrow 
           hallways.  Finally, LIGHT shines up ahead as the Tweedles 
           hurry toward...

           THE MAZE’S EXIT 

           EXT. WONDERLAND/MAZE - CONTINUOUS

           Still freaked out by the giant cat, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle 
           Dumb blast out of the maze and disappear into...

           A TANGLED FOREST 

           Behind them, the Cheshire cat bounds out of the maze... with 
           Dorothy and Alice still (barely) clinging to his fur. 

           The cat collapses, out of breath.  Slowly, Dorothy and Alice 
           climb off of him. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        You know...I could get used to 
                        being this size. 

           Immediately, WATER SPLASHES in his face. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        Hey!!

           ANGLE ON: Alice, holding THE BOTTLE she picked up earlier. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        What was that for?

                                 ALICE
                        Sweets make you larger. 

           The cat begins to SHRINK before their eyes. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Water makes you smaller. 

           In seconds, Cheshire is back to his TRUE SIZE. 
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        You throw water in my face and I 
                        don’t even get a thank you for 
                        getting you out of that accursed 
                        maze, and saving your skins from 
                        slobbering trolls!?

           Ignoring him, Alice makes her way into the tangle of trees 
           ahead.  

                                 ALICE
                        Come on, witch slayer.  

           Dorothy follows, glowering. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DR. ADLER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dr. Adler (and Darius) lead the Darling brothers through a 
           SECRET DOORWAY and down a...

           DARKENED STAIRCASE 

           After creaking down many narrow steps, THE GROUP enters a 
           strange cave-like room.  

           The space is filled with ancient BOOKS dedicated to both art 
           and science, mixed in with a hodgepodge of mystical and 
           religious texts. 

           The center piece of the room is a set of FIVE SILVER 
           RECLINING CHAIRS...each of which is connected to a strange 
           collection of Jules Verne-esque machines and contraptions.  

           As the group moves into the room, Michael’s eyes widen.

                                 MICHEAL
                        What is this?  

                                 DR. ADLER
                        This, Michael, is my life’s work. 

           The Darling brothers move deeper into the chamber. 

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        For years, I’ve worked to create a 
                        device that could transport 
                        individuals from the physical 
                        world... into the dream realms.

           She moves closer to the silver chairs.
                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        Unfortunately, I quickly discovered 
                        that ordinary subjects cannot be 
                        crossed over.  However, gifted 
                        individuals like yourselves, who’ve  
                        already organically travelled to 
                        other worlds, can be easily moved 
                        between the realms. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        But how is it possible to send us 
                        both to the same destination at the 
                        same time? 

                                 DARIUS
                        By using a technique called dream 
                        sharing.  

           Darius turns a couple knobs on the machine. 

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        Once we’ve induced sleep, the 
                        device can lock in onto any 
                        location in your subconscious...  
                        so long as it already exists in 
                        both of your minds. 
                            (motioning to the chairs)
                        Please, have a seat.

           The brothers trade glances, clearly reluctant. 

                                 DARIUS (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, I assure you, you’ll 
                        never leave the comfort of your own 
                        minds.

                                 DR. ADLER
                        And once you’ve recovered the 
                        stone, we will be able to find your 
                        sister... and bring Wendy home. 

           After a beat, John has a seat.  Then, Michael. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        But how can we find the stone? 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        While under hypnosis, Alice 
                        revealed that the stone is hidden 
                        on the western coast of Wonderland.

           Darius slips a few wires over the boys and affixes small 
           devices to their temples.

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                        We’re quite sure she and Dorothy 
                        are on their way there now.
           Darius chimes in.

                                 DARIUS
                        Find the girls, and you’ll find the 
                        stone.

           The boys exchange another glance.

                                 JOHN
                        Doctor, Alice and I aren’t speaking- 
                        and Dorothy...let’s just say our 
                        first meeting was less than 
                        pleasant.  

           Michael cracks a smile. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        Neither one of them will ever speak 
                        to him again.

           Dr. Adler scoots closer to John.  She whispers in his ear. 

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Actually, I’ve already been inside 
                        both of their subconscious.  I 
                        believe you’ll have no trouble 
                        taking anything you want from 
                        either of them... 

           John processes this new information.  

                                 DARIUS
                        Remember, we can only send you to a 
                        place that already exits in both of 
                        your minds.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Neverland?

                                 DARIUS
                        Precisely.  However, once you 
                        arrive there, you’ll need to find 
                        passage to the Wonderland coast.  

           THE MACHINE buzzes and steams...as strange noises echo.   

                                 MICHEAL
                        Wait!  But how can we transport an 
                        object that only exists in a dream, 
                        back to reality? 

           The doctor smiles.  

                                 DR. ADLER
                        Once you have the stone, everything 
                        will make sense...  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. ADLER (CONT'D)
                        Now, just close your eyes...  
                        you’ll soon wake up in Neverland. 

           With her words, the boys’ eyelids close. 

                                 DR. ADLER (CONT’D)
                                  (to Darius)
                        Induce sleep.

                                 DARIUS
                        Inducing now...

           The boys’ eyes move beneath their lids as they quickly slip 
           into REM SLEEP. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WONDERLAND/FORREST - CONTINUOUS 

           HIGH WINDS bellow through the Wonderland forest, which is 
           quickly becoming less of a woodland and more of a SWAMP. 

           Soon, Dorothy and Alice find themselves up to their knees in 
           THICK MUD; Cheshire is up to his neck.  Alice yells over the 
           howling wind. 

                                 ALICE
                        If we can just get to the other 
                        side of that ridge-- there’s a 
                        shelter there! 

           The Cheshire cat’s head begins to SINK BELOW the muddy trail 
           and into the marsh.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Help! 

           Dorothy SCOOPS the cat up.  Then, after climbing a series of 
           hanging stones, they find themselves on a hilltop near a...

           TINY STONE COTTAGE

                                 ALICE
                            (over the wind)
                        Follow me!

           Dorothy and Cheshire rush behind Alice into...

           INT. STONE COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS 

           The girls (and the Cheshire Cat) hasten inside the cottage 
           and close the door behind them.  As Dorothy glances around, 
           she sees that the house is completely EMPTY. 
                                 DOROTHY
                        There’s nothing here.

                                 ALICE
                        Yes, but it’s a wishing house.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        And what exactly is that? 

           Suddenly, A FIRE materializes in the empty fireplace. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        How’d that happen??

                                 DOROTHY
                            (stammers, surprised)
                        Wh-when we walked in, I wished that 
                        there’d be...

                                 ALICE
                        ...a blazing fire? 

           The cat looks skeptical. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        If that were true, how come there 
                        isn’t a large saucer of warm milk 
                        waiting for me? 

           Alice MOTIONS for the cat to turn around.  As he SPINS 
           AROUND...he sees a large saucer of milk. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        What??

           Instantly, he dives into the milk.  Alice turns to Dorothy. 

                                 ALICE
                        Have a seat. 

           In a flash, COMFY CHAIRS and a table with TEA and TOAST (and 
           all the fixings), appear by the fire.  The girls walk over 
           and sit.

                                 DOROTHY
                        This place, how did you know about 
                        it? 

                                 ALICE
                        It’s one of the Hatter’s homes.  I 
                        stayed here before I got him out of 
                        Wonderland...for good. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        And why was that?  

           Alice takes a piece of toast and butters it.
                                 ALICE
                        When I heard the Red Queen had 
                        returned, I knew she’d want the 
                        Hatter’s head.  

           Alice pours tea for herself and Dorothy. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        So, I brought him through the 
                        looking glass to London.  

           Sipping her tea, Alice finally seems to have relaxed a bit. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I honestly don’t know what I’d do 
                        without him.  He’s the closest 
                        thing I have to family anymore.

           Dorothy wants to ask a question.  She waits a moment, then... 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What happened to your family? 

           Alice hesitates.

                                 ALICE
                        My parents died when I was very 
                        young, but my older sister took me 
                        in to live with her.  Then, one 
                        night there was a fire.

           Alice’s eyes gaze at the crackling wood in the fireplace.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                         That’s when I lost her. 

           A dark silence passes.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I don’t know what to say. 

                                 ALICE
                        There’s nothing to... I was off 
                        dreaming in this world when it 
                        happened.  I can’t help but 
                        wonder...

           Alice’s eyes drift back to the flames.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        ...if I’d been with her that night, 
                        maybe she’d still be alive.

           Dorothy is about to speak, but thinks better of it. 
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        And what about you, any family? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        My Aunt and Uncle raised me since I 
                        was only a child, but I lost my 
                        Aunt Emily last Christmas. 

           Alice seems to recognize the sadness in Dorothy’s eyes.

                                 ALICE
                        You want her back, don’t you?

                                 DOROTHY
                        More than anything in the world. 

           Dorothy gazes at the wall where a PICTURE (the one she found 
           in the barn in Kansas), begins to MATERIALIZE.  It’s now much 
           larger and framed. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        We got into an argument the night 
                        she died...the last words I ever 
                        spoke to her were in anger.  And 
                        now, I can never take them back. 

           Alice looks at THE IMAGE of a young Dorothy with her Aunt.

                                 ALICE
                        I wish this house had the power to 
                        bring her back, so you could say 
                        what it is you need to say, but it 
                        doesn’t.  

           Alice steeps her tea.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        But the stone...it has the power to 
                        take the one who possesses it to 
                        any world.  Even beyond...   

           Alice stops herself, but Dorothy finishes.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Death? 

                                 ALICE
                        Maybe. 

           Suddenly, it all makes sense...Alice really wants the stone 
           because she believes it’s power can reunite her with her 
           deceased sister.   

           After the revelation, a silence drifts through the room.  For 
           a beat, the girls share a mutual understanding of each 
           other’s past and pain.  Then...
                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice, if you pulled me into this 
                        world because you were told I’m a 
                        witch slayer...I’m afraid you’re 
                        going to be gravely disappointed. 

           Alice turns to her. 

                                 ALICE
                        But you did kill two witches-- 
                        didn’t you? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Yes, but I had a good witch 
                        watching over me, and my friends by 
                        my side.  I couldn’t have done it 
                        alone... I’m not a hero. 

           Unexpectedly, a LOUD NOISE echoes.  Dorothy and Alice turn to 
           see...

           THE CHESHIRE CAT PASSED OUT ON HIS BACK, SNORING

           The girls snicker... The milk is gone. Eyeing a MAP (under 
           the tea pot), Alice grabs it. 

                                 ALICE
                        A map!  I was just wishing we had 
                        one... 

           She unfolds it. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Are we far from the stone? 

           Alice studies the map.

                                 ALICE
                        Not far, but we can’t get to it 
                        until we pass through a treacherous 
                        cavern, protected by three riddles. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Riddles? 

                                 ALICE
                        Yes, but if we can solve the first 
                        two riddles, we’ll cross into the 
                        blue room-- where the Dream Stone 
                        has been hidden for a thousand 
                        years. 

           Unexpectedly, a LOUD SQUEAKING SOUND begins to reverberate.  

           The girls turn as...HUNDREDS OF MICE begin climbing in 
           through the walls.  Alice’s gaze turns to the sleeping cat. 
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Cheshire!  What did you do?

           Waking, the CAT SEES the army of mice flooding the room. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Um.  I wished for some mice while 
                        sleeping?

                                 ALICE
                        Some?!

                                 DOROTHY
                        Stop!  Let’s just get out of here!

           Dorothy and Alice BANG against the door.  Finally, the lock 
           BREAKS OPEN...they barely slip out before becoming...ENGULFED 
           IN RODENTS.  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. STONE COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, the girls fall down.  The mice run for the hills. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Be careful what you wish for, 
                        indeed. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND ISLANDS - MORNING

           An ORANGE SUNRISE bleeds into the Neverland sea.  WE SEE John 
           and Michael Darling, PASSED OUT on a powder white shore.  

           Slowly, Michael WAKES UP...coughing up sand and water.  

           As the tide rolls in, he glances over at his older brother.  
           John’s still out cold.  Michael turns to wake him up, but 
           something else catches his attention...

           A MERMAID SPLASHES THROUGH THE WATER - his eyes widen. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        John, wake up--  

           Three more MERMAIDS bound through the water. 

                                 MICHEAL (CONT’D)
                        --John, we’re here, in Neverland! 

           As John’s eyes blink open, he takes in the gorgeous vision of 
           the mermaids bounding and diving in the glow of the sunrise.  
           Abruptly, the expression on the mermaids’ faces becomes grim.  
           John and Michael turn from the sea to the shore and SEE...

           A DOZEN PIRATES - behind them. 

           Muskets unholster...as swords and long knives unsheathe.  
           Then, out of the group of filthy buccaneers, steps a tall, 
           dark-skinned man.  

           This is the CAPTAIN.  His braided hair can’t conceal the scar 
           that crosses his face, under the shadow of his three-cornered-
           hat. 

           He glares at John and Michael, studying them.  Then, as he 
           clenches his jaw, he reveals a mouthful of shining teeth.  

           He turns to his FIRST MATE.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Mr. Smee, have you ever seen such 
                        Darling boys?

           As some of the pirates snicker, WE ANGLE ON: The Captain’s 
           RIGHT HAND...it’s a SILVER HOOK. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WONDERLAND FORREST - CONTINUOUS

           Rain comes down.  Dorothy follows Alice (and a very wet 
           Cheshire Cat), down a pathway to...

           AN OVERSIZED WELL 

           The huge watering hole is made entirely of stone, except for 
           the iron-cast wheel and pulley that’s attached to a thick 
           ROPE.  Alice goes to it, struggling to pull up the bucket.

                                 ALICE
                        Help me with this! 

           Dorothy grabs ahold.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        I never saw a well this big in 
                        Kansas.

                                 ALICE
                               (pulling hard)
                        That’s because there are no giants  
                        in Kansas. 

           Straining, the girls manage to heave the enormous rusted 
           pail.  Alice climbs into it.  Dorothy slips right in behind 
           her, but the cat is reluctant.  
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Out of the rain and into the well?  

           Automatically, the PULLEY BEGINS TO MOVE.  

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire, come on.

           As the bucket keeps GOING DOWN, the cat watches. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have control of this - you 
                        have to jump, NOW! 

           Finally, he BOUNDS.  Alice CATCHES him.  As the bucket 
           plummets, A VOICE begins to reverberate. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dark underground...that’s the place 
                        where I’ll be found.

           A few BATS scatter. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        What’s that?

                                 ALICE
                        Shh...It’s the first riddle. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Cut me to the quick and I’ll be 
                        bright, glowing with heavenly 
                        light.

           Alice mumbles under her breath. 

                                 ALICE
                        The dark, the light-- and something 
                        bright...

           Suddenly, the bucket DROPS, free-falling deeper into the 
           abyss.

                                 DOROTHY AND ALICE 
                        Ahhh!!!

           The situation quickly turns from bad to worse as a brightness 
           appears below them...  

           A LAKE OF MOLTEN LAVA 

           The bucket is now on a collision course with the lava lake.  
           In it, what look like fiery SHARK FINS circle menacingly.  

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Fire sharks!!
           A FIRE SHARK leaps from the water, nearly engulfing the 
           bucket...barely missing. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to DIE!  

           Black smoke billows up from the lake.

                                 ALICE
                        Stop!  Let me think! 

           Other FIRE SHARKS raise their heads.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Whatever you’re thinking, think it 
                        faster! 

           Now just INCHES from the lava, Dorothy’s eyes widen.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What do you cut that becomes 
                        shining and bright? 

           The bucket begins to SMOKE and SINGE because it’s so close to 
           the lava; the fire sharks bite below. 

                                 ALICE
                        A diamond?

           As soon as the word is spoken, a WHIRLPOOL in the lake opens 
           up, revealing... 

           A DIAMOND TUNNEL 

           Clinging to the pail, the three barely escape the sea of lava 
           as their pail drops into the protective DIAMOND TUNNEL. 

           Like an elevator out of control, the bucket rips through the 
           glistening tunnel before nosediving into...

           AN UNDERGROUND CAVE

           CRASH!  The bucket SLAMS and ROLLS across the cave floor.  
           The trio spill out onto the stony ground.  Getting up, 
           Dorothy glances around. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Wh-where are we now? 

           Even her soft words cause a few pebbles to drop from above.

                                 ALICE
                               (whispering)
                        Quiet!  The chamber walls are not 
                        entirely stable.
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                                (trying to whisper)
                        Not entirely stable?  What about 
                        the fact that we’re trapped in 
                        here? 

           He’s right.  There are no windows and no doors, anywhere.  

           Dorothy, who’s been searching the grotto, finds SOMETHING.  
           She MOTIONS for Alice and the cat to come over to her. 

           As they do, Dorothy points to...A SMALL DIAMOND SHAPED HOLE 
           IN THE CAVE WALL. 

                                 DOROTHY
                            (whispering)
                        Look...

           There’s WRITING on the wall, just below the diamond shape.  

                                 ALICE
                                 (reading)
                        Riddles arrive on the North Wind.

           A GUSH OF WIND and an EERIE VOICE blow through the opening.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I make noise, yet you never see me.

           The mighty wind pushes Dorothy and Alice back, sending ROCKS 
           AND RUBBLE falling from above.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I call out for good, but mostly for 
                        worse...  watch for my friend, 
                        she’s a shining curse.

           Then, as quickly as it came - the wind is gone.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        She is a curse...is the answer a 
                        woman?

           The room RUMBLES - stones CRASH DOWN from above.  Then, a 
           huge chuck of the ground behind them...

           DISINTEGRATES 

           Cheshire nearly falls into the newly created abyss, barely 
           holding on with his front paws.  

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire!  

           Quickly, she pulls her cat up into her arms.
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                                 (still shaking)
                        I’m guessing a woman is not the 
                        answer. 

           Dust and rubble continue to tumble. 

                                 ALICE
                        We have to think--  I make noise, 
                        but I’m unseen... I have a 
                        friend...

                                 DOROTHY
                        ...who is a shinning curse.

                                 ALICE
                        Could it be...
                            (she whispers)
                        Fire? 

           Again, the CHAMBER SHAKES MIGHTILY...as more of the floor 
           gives out.

                                 DOROTHY 
                        Look out!

           Chunks of stone DROP AGAIN.  As the girls duck, something 
           catches Dorothy’s attention...

           A LIGHTNING BOLT-SHAPED BREAK IN THE CAVE WALL 

           She spins her head toward Alice. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I know the answer!  I call out for 
                        good, but mostly for worse...  
                        watch for my friend, she’s a 
                        shining curse.  Who is thunder’s 
                        shining friend? 

                                 ALICE
                        That has to be it...say it. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        The answer is lightning!

           Instantly, the bolt-shaped aperture (which was Dorothy’s 
           clue), shines forth a BRILLIANT LIGHT and... OPENS UP.  

           They race into THE BRIGHTNESS as the entire room CRUMBLES.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. A TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The trio races through a narrow tunnel as everything behind 
           them SHATTERS and SPLINTERS.  Finally, they exit the passage, 
           barely slipping into...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BLUE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Dorothy and Alice are immediately struck by the BLUE 
           GLOW permeating throughout the space, and...

           THE SUBZERO TEMPERATURE 

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s freezing in here. 

                                 ALICE
                        That’s because the stone comes from  
                        Glaciem--

           ICEY WATER LEAKS from the ceiling and begins POOLING ON THE 
           GROUND.  

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        --The coldest kingdom of any of the 
                        known worlds.

           Hundreds of blue BOOKS are showcased on high shelves, but 
           everything’s damp.  

           Aside from the leaking ice water (and the large number of 
           books), it’s pretty much just a ordinary blue room. 

           There’s a blue bed, a few blue pictures on the walls, two 
           blue chairs, and a turquoise music box playing blue 
           (melancholy) tunes.  

           Alice’s eyes are quickly drawn to something on a high 
           bookshelf...

           A BRILLIANT SAPPHIRE STONE 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Look, there it is. 

           The stone sparkles with a florescent glare. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s even more beautiful than I 
                        imagined. 
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                            (teeth chattering)
                        Yeah, it’s great.  Let’s get it and 
                        go.

           Cheshire starts to move into the room, but Alice sticks out 
           her foot, blocking him. 

                                 ALICE
                        Not another step.  We need to solve 
                        the final riddle first. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        More riddles?

           The book shelves begin to VIBRATE and SHAKE...a book FLIES 
           ARCOSS THE ROOM at Dorothy.  She catches it. 

                                 ALICE
                        Nice reflexes. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Thanks. 

           On the book is written, THE BLUE BOOK OF RIDDLES.  She opens 
           to the first page.  She reads aloud...

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        One more riddle to solve, but don’t  
                        be a moment too late, more than 
                        three guesses and you’ll be 
                        drowning in your fate.

           As the girls share a glance, the DOOR behind them SLAMS SHUT. 

                                 ALICE
                        The next page, fast. 

           Dorothy turns the next page, then the next, but the next 
           fifty pages have no words - only topaz pages.  Finally, she 
           finds a page with a sentence scribbled on it.  

                                 DOROTHY
                                  (reading)
                        Poor Mr. Blue lives alone in his 
                        single story home.

           Flipping the page, she reads on. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Everything Mr. Blue owns is blue...  
                        He spends his days in his blue room 
                        in his blue bed, watching blue 
                        shadows climb the blue walls.  You 
                        know the color of the chairs, but I 
                        ask you, what about the stairs?  
           With that, the book FLIES out of Dorothy’s hand and across 
           the room...landing right back on the shelf it came from. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        There’s only ONE answer, right? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I don’t know, something seems 
                        too...

                                 ALICE
                        ...simple? 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Too simple?  Why do you humans have 
                        to complicate life at every turn? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Cheshire, it’s a trick. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        A trick?  The ANSWER is clearly 
                        blue! 

           FREEZING WATER begins to POUR into the room from the ceiling 
           and the walls. 

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire, look what you’ve done!!

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        What?  It was the only logical 
                        answer!

           The girls try the door behind them, but it’s LOCKED.  The 
           cold water pounds into the room so fast, they’re up to their 
           hips before they know it. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t swim!

           Alice grabs the cat as the water continues to rise.  In no 
           time, they’re up to their necks and TURNING BLUE. 

                                 ALICE
                            (to Dorothy)
                        Think...what color could the stairs 
                        be?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Maybe just another shade of blue? 

           Obviously the BLUE ROOM takes her words to be ANOTHER GUESS, 
           because...

           MORE WATER SURGES IN 
           Now the girls have to dog-paddle just to keep their heads 
           above the ice water. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Figure it out, fast! 

           The water forces them to the ceiling.  They twist their 
           necks, trying to breathe.  Water keeps rising.  Then, just as 
           their about to run out of air, Alice has a revelation.  

                                 ALICE
                        Wait.  It’s a one storey house.

           Dorothy gets it, too. 

                                 DOROTHY AND ALICE
                                 (together)
                        There are NO stairs! 

           Instantly, A HATCH (that was previously invisible) 
           materializes in the roof and OPENS.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Oh my God!  

           As DAYLIGHT streams in from the outside, Dorothy pushes the 
           cat through the hatch.  Then, after pulling herself up and 
           out, she reaches down for Alice, but...

                                 ALICE
                        The stone! 

           SHE DIVES

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice, wait!  

           Underwater, Alice swims down...searching the shelves for the 
           stone, but it’s not there.  

           Finally, she spots the stone at the bottom of the room and 
           tries to GRAB IT, but it’s STUCK in a crevice. 

           Straining, Alice finally releases the stone.  Turning around, 
           she desperately swims back to the hatch.

           Dorothy’s waiting hand pulls her up and out. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BLUE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Coughing up icy water, Alice catches her breath.  Dorothy 
           sees the stone...sparkling in the sun.  
                                 DOROTHY
                        You did it! 

           Through the haze of morning, they begin to notice that 
           they’re surrounded by...

           A DOZEN ABORIGINAL WARRIORS

           The warriors are in full battle paint.  Some have bows with 
           arrows ready to be unleashed-- others hold sharp spears.

           A beautiful WARRIOR PRINCESS steps through the haze.  This is 
           TIGER LILY (18).  Her caramel skin is painted with bright 
           colors and adorned with feathers and animal teeth. 

           Taking a knee, Tiger Lily holds out an open leather pouch.

                                 TIGER LILY
                        The stone. 

           Alice refuses.  The warriors pull back on their bows. 

                                 TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
                        Now. 

           Alice realizes there’s no other way, finally she slips the 
           stone into the pouch.   

           Tiger Lily cinches the pouch and affixes it to her waist.  

           Standing, she turns to her warriors. 

                                 TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
                        On my command. 

           The warriors stand tall, pulling back FULLY on their bows and 
           readying their spears.  

                                 ALICE
                        What are you doing?!

           A split second before the word is given, A VOICE cries out...

                                 VOICE
                        HALT!

           Every head turns to see...

           A WHITE RABBIT - clutching a cane. 

           The once spry White Rabbit (who is nearly three feet tall), 
           is much older now, his careworn eyes set behind wire-fames. 
           He has on a waist-coat and clutches a pocket watch.  

           Alice and the rabbit share a knowing glance.  Tiger Lily 
           yells something in a strange tongue, which quickly becomes a 
           heated discussion between her and the rabbit.  
                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                                   (to Alice)
                        What’s happening? 

                                 ALICE
                                (whispers)
                        I don’t know...

           Finally, Tiger Lily turns to her warriors and waves her hand.

           THEY WITHDRAW THEIR WEAPONS 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Rabbit, what did you do? 

                                 WHITE RABBIT
                        They’ve agreed to stay your 
                        execution.  However, you will be 
                        taken as the prisoners of Princess 
                        Tiger Lily. 

                                 ALICE
                        Prisoners? 

           Tiger Lily barks at Alice, but it’s Dorothy who jumps. 

                                 TIGER LILY
                        You’re lucky to be alive.  The 
                        penalty for stealing the stone is 
                        death. 

                                 ALICE
                                (defensive)
                        We weren’t stealing the stone...we 
                        were taking it to...

                                 TIGER LILY
                               (cutting her off)
                        ...the White Knight?  So he can 
                        destroy it? 

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t know anything about 
                        destroying, only protecting.

                                 TIGER LILY
                        Then, you don’t know the truth. 

           Tiger Lily WHISTLES.  In a flash, GIANT FALCONS begin 
           circling overhead before landing amongst the warriors.  

           The massive birds have brightly colored WINGS and huge 
           talons.  Tiger’s warriors begin to mount the birds.  

           Alice turns to the rabbit.
                                 ALICE
                        What’s happening now? 

                                 WHITE RABBIT
                        You’re being taken to her kingdom, 
                        on Neverland Island. 

           Unexpectedly, a falcon SCOOPS the rabbit up in his talons. 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        And apparently, I am too...

           As the FALCONS take flight, Dorothy and Alice are GRABBED.  
           Cheshire tries to make a run for it, but he’s SNATCHED.  

           In seconds, the three of them are soaring over Wonderland 
           behind the warriors. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                              (eyes tightly shut)
                        Just tell me when we’re back on the 
                        ground, okay? 

           The falcons dart across the sky, speeding toward the sun. 

           EXT. THE JOLLY ROGER - DAY

           A SPANISH GALLEON bounds over towering waves.  On deck, 
           pirates hoist up the main sail under the direction of the 
           ship’s Master and Commander, CAPTAIN HOOK. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Bring ‘er up, boys...the rougher 
                        the seas, the smoother we sail! 

           Mr. Smee comes up from below deck and goes to the Captain. 

                                 HOOK
                        What is it, Mr. Smee?

                                 MR. SMEE
                        It’s the prisoners, Captain.  I 
                        think they’re ready to spill.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE JOLLY ROGER/BELOW DECK - CONTINUOUS

           WE HEAR: the tick-tock of a clock.  Deep in the belly of the 
           Jolly Roger, John and Michael are in a dank CELL on the 
           prison level.  Around them, the other prisoners are jeering 
           because...
           A HUGE CROCODILE is chained up in their cell.  The beast 
           snaps it’s powerful jaws, desperately trying to reach John 
           and Michael, who are just INCHES from the reptile’s grasp. 

           The door to the prison swings open - it’s Hook.  Seeing him, 
           the prisoners quiet down.  The silence reveals the source of 
           the ticking clock...it’s coming from inside the croc’s belly.  

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                            (to John and Michael)
                        Afternoon, boys. 

           He walks over to their cell (eating something) and glances 
           inside.  The Darling brothers cower in a corner, the croc 
           still biting at them. 

                                 HOOK
                        I bet you boys didn’t know that the 
                        crocodile has the most powerful 
                        bite of any animal in existence, 
                        did you?  People wrongly assume the 
                        title is held by either the shark 
                        or the tiger.  However, the 
                        crocodile is the absolute 
                        undisputed champion.  And do you 
                        know why?

                                 MICHEAL
                            (trembling with fear)
                        Why?

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Because the croc’s jaws were built 
                        not to chew...

           While the clock ticks, he glances at the silver hook at the 
           end of his wrist. 

                                 HOOK
                        ...but to crush. 

           As if on cue, the crocodile lunges.  It’s jaws crash down on 
           Michael’s shirt sleeve...grazing his wrist.  

           BLOOD SPATTERS. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           WE SEE Michael sleeping in the SILVER CHAIR... blood trickles 
           down his arm...  What happens in the DREAM WORLD, happens in 
           the real world too.

           We’re back in the cell.  Micheal clutches his bleeding wrist.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Ahhh!!  What do you want from us?  
                        We are not your enemies!

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Yes- Michael, but a friend of my 
                        enemy is my enemy.

                                 JOHN
                        If you’re talking about Pan - he’s 
                        not our friend.  On the contrary, 
                        we have nothing but contempt for 
                        him.

           Grabbing a stool in the corner, Hook sits.

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Oh, really?    

                                 JOHN
                        Michael’s right, Peter claimed he 
                        was finally ready to grow up.  So, 
                        we brought him back to London...  

           The clock ticks.  Michael jumps in. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        ...but his shadow became furious 
                        and consumed him.  He went crazy 
                        and disappeared...and took our 
                        sister with him! 

           Hook drinks from a FLASK taken from his coat pocket. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        And where exactly did he take her?

                                 JOHN
                        That we don’t know.

           The crocodile suddenly SNAPS. 
                                 MICHEAL
                            (loosing it)
                        But it’s why we’re back in 
                        Neverland, to get the stone and 
                        find out!

           John looks at his brother like...What did you just say?

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Stone?  I’m afraid I’m not 
                        following you boys. 

           He tosses what he’s eating to the croc, who devours it. 

                                 MICHEAL
                            (trembling with fear)
                        There’s a stone that can open the 
                        door to any world in existence.  
                        We’ve come back to find it...

                                 JOHN
                        ...so we can use it to find Wendy 
                        and bring her home. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Boys, if you’re referring to the 
                        Dream Stone, you’re going to be 
                        gravely disappointed.  It’s a 
                        bedtime story, a legend at best.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re wrong.  It’s real, and about 
                        to be found. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        By whom?

                                 MICHEAL
                        Two girls. 

           Hook thinks for a moment.  Then, he gets up. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Sorry boys, but I’m just not buying 
                        it. 

           He reaches into the cell, grabs the crocodiles CHAIN, and 
           begins to unfasten it.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Hook!  Listen to reason!!

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Good day, boys, farewell and adieu.  

           Michael and John panic. 
                                 JOHN
                        Don’t you see?  If we can recover 
                        the stone, we both get what we 
                        want...  We get Wendy and you get 
                        Pan!  

           Hook is no longer listening.  He’s just to about to unchain 
           the croc, when....  

           A VOICE CALLS OUT 

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Captain Sir, come up on deck! 

           HOOK stops what he’s doing and LEAVES.  On his way out, he 
           tosses his flask through the bars.  It hits the crocodile in 
           the head.  The beast goes crazy, nearly breaking its chain. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           On deck, the waves have settled.  The crew is watching...

           THE MASSIVE FALCONS FLY OVERHEAD 

           Hurrying to Smee, Hook snatches a TELESCOPE from his hand and 
           points it to the sky.  Looking up, he sees Tiger Lily and her 
           warriors, and... DOROTHY and ALICE.  

           Hook realizes... John and Michael may not be lying after all.  
           He takes the telescope from his eye and hands it to Mr. Smee.  

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        Mr. Smee, fetch me the Darlings.

                                 MR. SMEE
                        Aye, aye, Captain. 

           As Smee hurries off, Hook pensively watches the HUGE BIRDS 
           fly off to Neverland Island.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND - TIGER LILY’S KINGDOM - LATE DAY 

           Deep in a TROPICAL WILDERNESS, immense PYRAMIDS and a STONE 
           TEMPLE rise above the treeline.  Dozens of warriors return to 
           the settlement from a hunt. 

           Women (walking alongside a complex irrigation system), fill 
           clay pitchers.  Nearby, children play on a grassy field. 

           POUNDING DRUMS reverberate from inside the temple, signaling 
           the return of...TIGER LILY and her warriors. 
           As soon as Dorothy and Alice (and Cheshire) are dropped to 
           the ground, they’re apprehended by guards.  Alice catches 
           eyes with Tiger Lily.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re wrong about us. 

           Tiger ignores the comment.  As Alice and Dorothy are ushered 
           off, THE WHITE RABBIT hobbles over to them. 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        Don’t worry Alice...I’m going to 
                        get you out of this, I promise!

           As he goes, Alice notices a handsome WARRIOR named KOA 
           staring at her.  Inhibited, she turns away as she’s ushered 
           into... THE DUNGEON. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHIEF GREY PANTHER 

           He’s a mountain of a man, with wisdom in his lined eyes.  
           Soon, everyone in the room turns to see...

           TIGER LILY RETURN WITH HER WARRIORS 

                                 GREY PANTHER 
                        Tiger, you’ve come back to us.

                        Yes, and I have this.

           She holds up the DREAM STONE.  Eyes widen as the stone shines 
           brightly.

                                 TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
                        It was just as it was in my  
                        crystal vision...  two girls were 
                        trying to take the stone.  They 
                        claimed to be protectors, but I 
                        suspect they’re in league with the 
                        White Knight.

           She returns the stone to the leather pouch.

                        I’m proud of you, Tiger...You’ll 
                        make a worthy Queen one day.
           A VOICE rings out.

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        That’s true, Your Majesty.  She 
                        most certainly will. 

           The elderly rabbit moves into the throne room.  He bows.

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT (CONT’D)
                        Pardon me, Sire. 

                                 GREY PANTHER
                        The Rabbit...who’s always late?

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        Yes, but today I came just in the 
                        nick of time.  Sire, I’ve known one 
                        of the girls Tiger’s speaking of 
                        since she was a child...

           Tiger Lily and her father share a glance. 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT (CONT’D)
                        ...her name is Alice.  She came 
                        into this world with instructions 
                        to save the stone.  Her companion 
                        is Dorothy Gale, Princess of Oz.  

                                 GREY PANTHER
                        The witch slayer? 

           The rabbit takes a step closer to the throne.

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        Yes.  She could prove to be quite 
                        valuable when it comes time to do 
                        battle with the Red Queen.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS

           In an underground prison, Dorothy, Alice (and Cheshire), are 
           locked up behind bamboo bars.  The cat sleeps in a corner.   

           Dorothy scoops up a handful of dust from the ground.  She 
           lets it sift through her fingers...her mind is obviously 
           somewhere far away.  Alice watches her.

                                 ALICE
                        You okay?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Fine...just thinking about--
                                 ALICE
                        --home?

           Unexpectedly, KOA (the warrior who was checking out Alice 
           earlier), shows up at their cell with a tray of fruit. 

                                 KOA
                        I thought you might be hungry. 

           Alice looks annoyed. 

                                 ALICE
                        We don’t want food, we want to get 
                        out of here. 

           Dorothy sees the selection of tropical fruits. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Actually, I’m starving.

           Koa slips the food through the bars to Dorothy.  Trying not 
           to be conspicuous - Alice takes a mango from the tray; Koa 
           smiles at her.

                                 KOA
                        I’m glad I have something you like.

           The White Rabbit enters the hallway outside their cell.

                                 ALICE
                        Rabbit! 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        I have some good news...and some 
                        not so good news. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s the good news?

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        You’re to be released.  

                                 ALICE
                        And the bad?

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        You’ll have to remain here in the 
                        village, forever. 

                                 ALICE
                        Forever?!

           The Rabbit moves closer to Dorothy and Alice.

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        The other good news is that the 
                        stone is safe.
                                 ALICE
                        Safe?  Safe with Tiger Lily?  
                        Rabbit, the pale moon is nearly 
                        here! 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        It’s safe enough for now. 
                            (he lowers his voice)
                        Alice, I’ve received word that the 
                        White Knight is on his way here... 
                        as we speak. 

           GUARDS walk over an open their CELL DOOR.  Koa takes a step 
           closer to Alice. 

                                 KOA
                        Would you accompany me to the 
                        festival tonight? 

           Alice is about to reply “no,” but she stops herself, looking 
           into Koa’s strong eyes.  

                                 ALICE
                        I suppose I will have to find some 
                        way to pass the time. 

           She turns to Dorothy.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Coming?  

           Dorothy follows her out of the cell.  Stepping out behind the 
           girls, Cheshire turns to the White Rabbit.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        If you were looking for a thank you 
                        from either of them-- I wouldn’t 
                        count on it.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND ISLAND - TIGER LILY’S KINGDOM - NIGHT

           Bonfires burn as percussive music fills the valley.  
           Villagers encircle the fires to celebrate...

           THE FESTIVAL OF THE PALE MOON

           Winding through the multitudes, THE CHESHIRE CAT searches for 
           food and quickly finds...

           A HUGE SPREAD OF FRESHLY CAUGHT SALMON 

           The cat hops onto a platter and chows down.  Then, something 
           else catches his attention...
           TWO SHADOWS COMING THROUGH THE WOODS 

           Squinting, the cat now SEES who it is.  He bounds from the 
           table and RUNS OFF. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           NOT FAR AWAY...

           Alice watches FIRE DANCERS spin batons with incredible 
           agility.  Dorothy comes over and sits next to her.  Among the 
           fire dancers is KOA.  His eyes are locked on Alice.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice, you’re going to have to give 
                        that boy a break before the night 
                        ends.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t have to do anything... 
                        besides, suffering only makes the 
                        heart grow fonder. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Is that what you did to John 
                        Darling, made him suffer?

                                 ALICE
                        And what do you know about me and 
                        John? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Charlotte told me he was the reason 
                        you left.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, really?  And did Charlotte also 
                        tell you about her secret garden 
                        protected by twin dragons? 
                                   (a beat)
                        I’m sure John would love for 
                        everyone to believe that story, but 
                        truth be told, I took tea with him 
                        once and quickly inferred that John 
                        likes John, and isn’t interested in 
                        much more.  If you want him, by all 
                        means...he’s yours.

                                 DOROTHY
                        No, thanks.

                                 ALICE
                        Why not, you got a nice farm boy 
                        waiting for you in Kansas?

           Dorothy shakes her head “no.”  Alice grins.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe a not so nice farm boy?

           In a flash, the Cheshire Cat bounds onto the table in front 
           of them...knocking over their drinks. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                                 (out of breath)
                        Alice!  You’re never going to 
                        believe who’s here!

           Cutting through a maze of dancers, WE SEE: JOHN and MICHAEL. 
           Alice sees them, too.  

                                 ALICE
                        Speak of the devil. 

           Soon, the brothers are right in front of Dorothy and Alice. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What are you two doing here?

           John grabs a piece of bread from the table.

                                 JOHN
                        Isn’t it I, who should be posing 
                        that question to you?  After all, 
                        Neverland is the world of our 
                        dreams, not yours. 

           He pops the bread into his mouth. 

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t you mean your sister’s 
                        dreams?  I thought you boys just 
                        tagged along. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        Actually, our sister is the very 
                        reason we’ve returned to Neverland.

           John gives his brother an irritated look...why would you tell 
           them that?

                                 JOHN
                        What Michael means is... we’ve come 
                        to see if Tiger Lily can tell us 
                        anything about Wendy’s whereabouts. 

           Alice’s eyes convey a hint of suspicion. 

                                 ALICE
                        Well, good luck getting help from 
                        her, she threw us in her jail.  But 
                        you two are just so charming...
                            (she looks John in the eye)
                        ...should be easy for you.  
           Alice walks off towards Koa.  John and Michael watch her go. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        Bloody hell...is she always that 
                        prickly?  

                                 JOHN
                        What did you expect?  It’s Alice. 

           The crowd of dancers PARTS as TIGER LILY is paraded into the 
           festival. 

                                 DOROTHY
                            (watching Tiger Lily)
                        Prickly or not...Alice is right 
                        about Tiger-- she nearly had us 
                        killed. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, really...and for what reason?

           Dorothy doesn’t answer.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I’m going to talk to her... 
                        God knows I’ll have better luck 
                        than you.

           He EYES his brother as he walks off - leaving Dorothy and 
           John alone.  Dorothy glance over at John. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Why doesn’t Tiger Lily like you?

                                 JOHN
                        I suppose we...started off on the 
                        wrong foot. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What is it about you and first 
                        impressions? 

                                 JOHN
                        I wish I knew.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Maybe...the iconoclastic, 
                        egocentric way you approach 
                        strangers? 

                                 JOHN
                        Wow.  That was a mouthful.

                                 DOROTHY
                                 (cutting in)
                        Coming from a simpleton from 
                        Kansas? 
           He smiles looking into her eyes.  In them he sees LIGHTS. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                            (self-conscious)
                        What is it?

           Turning around, he realizes that THE GLEAM in her eyes is a 
           reflection of...

           DOZENS OF SPARKLING LIGHTS IN THE WOODS BEHIND THEM

                                 JOHN
                        Have you ever heard the summer 
                        sprites sing to the pale moon? 

                                 DOROTHY
                        ...um, I don’t think so.

                                 JOHN
                        You’d remember if you had. 

           He reaches out for her hand, but she doesn’t give it. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Please, it’s not to be missed. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           NOT FAR AWAY...

           Moving through the festivities, Michael approaches PRINCESS 
           TIGER LILY.  She sits in an ornate chair, handmaidens and 
           servants surrounding her.  Seeing him coming, Tiger’s eyes 
           widen.

                                 TIGER LILY
                        Michael Darling?  What are you 
                        doing back in Neverland?

           Michael lowers his head.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Your Highness.  

                                 TIGER LILY
                        Please tell me you left your 
                        brother at home.

                                 MICHEAL
                        No, he’s here.  
                                  (a beat)
                        Your Majesty, I’ve come to inform 
                        you about the two girls that 
                        arrived here, and to inquire about 
                        the Dream Stone.
           Tiger Lily motions to her servants to go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE NEVERLAND FOREST - NIGHT

           Deep in the woods, John and Dorothy COME TO THE EDGE of a 
           clearing where...

           HUNDREDS OF TINY BIOLUMINESCENT FAIRIES HAVE GATHERED

           Up close, the fairies have a savage look...and their facial 
           features are more animal than human.  Seeing them, Dorothy 
           can’t believe her eyes.   

                                 DOROTHY
                        The light, the colors, they’re 
                        absolutely....

                                 JOHN
                        ...indescribable?  

           He scoots closer to her. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I only wish you could see the way 
                        their light shines in your eyes.

           Shy, Dorothy starts to speak, but John puts his finger to her 
           lips.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Listen.

           With that, the creatures begin to SING an ethereal, 
           otherworldly song.  Dorothy whispers into John’s ear. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        How did you know about this?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s the longest night of the year, 
                        so the sprites always come out to 
                        sing.  To them, the long night is a 
                        bad omen...

           The tone is so enchanting, the forest itself seems to join in 
           the song.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ...and the pale moon it brings is a 
                        killing moon.  The song is a 
                        prayer, to keep away evil, and save 
                        all good souls from what’s coming.  
                                 DOROTHY
                        And what is coming?

                                 JOHN
                        Probably just an early frost or a 
                        month without rain, nothing we’d be 
                        concerned with. 

           Dorothy watches the fairies in the moonlight; John stares at 
           her until... 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, I am sorry our first 
                        meeting went so poorly...I hope 
                        you’ll give me the chance to start 
                        over. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        I suppose everyone deserves a 
                        second chance.  
                               (she turns to him)
                        Besides, this is only a dream, I 
                        can always change my mind about you 
                        when it’s over, right?

           He smiles at her. 

                                 JOHN
                        And what makes you so sure this 
                        isn’t the real world..and the other 
                        isn’t the dream? 

           Suddenly, John realizes...THE FAIRIES HAVE GATHERED AROUND 
           DOROTHY.  Noticing them, Dorothy’s eyes widen. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s happening??

                                 JOHN
                        They’re blessing you. 

           The fairies SINGING grows louder, as their lights grow 
           brighter. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You are now under the protection of 
                        the Neverland fairies. 

           Below the fairies, a sprinkling of SPARKLING DUST has 
           collected.  John scoops some up and puts it in his pocket.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s that?

                                 JOHN
                        Pixie dust...you never know when it 
                        might come in handy.
           It’s a perfect moment until... a LOUD HOWL RESOUNDS through 
           the forest.  The fairies suddenly SCATTER.  Dread manifests 
           on Dorothy’s face. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        We have to go, now.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. TIGER LILY’S KINGDOM/THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Seeing the CHESHIRE CAT, Alice steps away from her dancing 
           partner (Koa), and approaches the feline.

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire, have you seen Dorothy? 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Last time I saw her she was with 
                        that Darling boy.  Why?

           She doesn’t answer; her eyes scan the crowds for Dorothy.  
           Unexpectedly, A SCREAM thunders through the celebration.  

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        What was that??

           TERROR explodes as more SCREAMS resound.  Alice sees a DIRE 
           WOLF ripping into a member of the tribe.

                                 TRIBESMAN 
                        Ahhh!!!

           Above the screams, further howls fill the night air, as THE 
           WOLVES break through the crowd barking and biting. 

           CHAOS ERUPTS - Alice scoops up the cat.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        What are you doing?

                                 ALICE
                        Getting us out of here! 

           Seeing a discarded KNIFE, Alice grabs it. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy and John push through tall weeds.  Behind them, they 
           can hear the wolves yowling.  John SEES a moonlit trail that 
           winds to...
           A CLIFFSIDE PATH 

                                 JOHN
                        This way!

           Along the path, WAVES crash against the mountainside.  
           Glancing out at the Neverland Sea, Dorothy beholds...

           DOZENS OF RED SAILS IN THE MOONLIGHT 

           A DIRE WOLF LEAPS OUT - knocking John to the ground and 
           BITING his arm. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        John!

           Dorothy grabs a BRANCH, and CLOBBERS the beast over the head.  
           The wolf falls over, yelping.  Quickly, Dorothy grabs John 
           (who’s bleeding), and pulls him up.   

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        We have to go!

           EXT. THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           From the sky, A MASSIVE PREHISTORIC BIRD lands on the ground. 
           The strange beast appears to be half-pterodactyl and half- 
           condor - it lets out a horrible screech.  

           Dismounting the creature, WE SEE...

           THE RED PRINCE 

           Immediately, he swings his broadsword at anything or anyone 
           in his path.  Behind him, his knights unleash FIERY ARROWS on 
           the village.

           As a group of Tiger Lily’s warriors charge, the Red Prince 
           holds up a HEART.  Squeezing it, the ground in front of him 
           opens up and CONSUMES the oncoming warriors. 

           Nearby, Alice and Cheshire scurry through the destruction 
           searching for Dorothy. 

           A knight tries to grab Alice, but she PLUNGES her blade into 
           A GAP in his armor.  At the same time, Alice sees...

           Koa (her dance partner), DEAD ON THE GROUND.  Horrified and 
           saddened, she turns to...

           Tiger Lily and her warriors BATTLING with the red knights.   

                                 ALICE
                        Tiger!
           Tiger Lily SEES Alice through the clash of violence.  

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the stone? 

                                 TIGER LILY
                        Safe.

           Tiger’s hand touches to the leather pouch on her waist. 

                                 ALICE
                        Not safe enough.  Please, you have 
                        to run as far away from here as 
                        fast as you can!  

                                 TIGER LILY
                        No.  I have to stay and fight, with 
                        my people.   

           Alice is about to respond, but instead...

           She GRABS THE LEATHER POUCH.  

                                 TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing??

           In a flash, Alice CUTS IT FREE with her blade.  Tiger tries 
           to seize Alice but, she takes off. 

                                 TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
                        Alice!

           Tiger bolts after her, but is stopped when a FIERY ARROW 
           lands in her path.  Around her, other burning arrows rain 
           down on the village. 

           Seeing the destruction, tears well her eyes.  Michael runs to 
           her.  

                                 MICHEAL
                        Tiger, we have to get out! 

           Before she can respond...

           HOOK AND HIS PIRATES MARCH ONTO THE SCENE - surrounding them. 

                                 CAPTAIN HOOK
                        And where are you running off to, 
                        Princess? 

           Hook’s buccaneers move in closer, pointing muskets and 
           swords. 

                                 HOOK
                        Nicely done, Mr. Darling.  You and 
                        your brother led us right here.  
           Tiger glares at the hapless Michael.

           CLOSE BY...

           Sprinting back to the village, Dorothy’s eyes cut across the 
           FIRES, searching for Alice; the red knights have taken over.  

           Covertly moving though the wreckage (with John), Dorothy 
           spots the Cheshire Cat hiding behind A HUT. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Cheshire!  Where’s Alice?

                        She took off with stone...you have 
                        to hide!

                            (propping up John)
                        He needs help!

           Eyeing a cloth, Dorothy picks it up and wraps it around 
           John’s arm.

           Dorothy runs as fast as she can, desperate to find Alice.  
           The dire wolves pick up her sent...charging into the woodland 
           after her.

           Abruptly, Dorothy CRASHES TO THE GROUND (her foot caught on a 
           vine).  Wincing in pain, she tries to get up.  

           She screams as the wolves creep closer, but just as they 
           attack...  

           A SWARM OF FAIRIES blast onto the scene, BITING and CLAWING 
           into the wolves’ flesh. 

           Other fairies surround Dorothy, lifting her up off of the 
           ground.  In seconds, she’s back on her feet being led by them 
           to...
           A CLIFFSIDE TREE, on the edge of the Neverland Sea.  High in 
           the elm’s branches Dorothy sees... ALICE - CLUTCHING THE 
           DREAM STONE.

           Still behind the hut, Cheshire is grabbed by RED KNIGHTS and 
           shoved into a small cage.  At the same time, John is forced 
           to his feet and shackled. 

           Then, John’s pushed into a line of prisoners that includes... 
           Michael and Tiger Lily.  Michael sees his brother and his

                                 MICHEAL
                        Where are Alice...and Dorothy? 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know. 

           Infuriated, Tiger Lily glares at John.

                                 TIGER LILY
                        You took good care of everyone, 
                        didn’t you? 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Dire Wolves wait below the tree (where Alice is trapped), 
           snarling and snapping.  Nearing the tree, Dorothy calls 
           out...

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice! 

           Turning, the wolves glare at Dorothy, but don’t attack; 
           they’re intimidated by the swarm of GLOWING FAIRIES 
           protecting her. 

                                 ALICE
                        Dorothy, catch!

           From the tree, Alice PITCHES the Dream Stone to Dorothy.  In 
           SLOW MOTION - it tumbles across the sky, but at the same 
           time...
           THE RED PRINCE SWOOPS IN on his bird, AND CATCHES THE STONE.

                                 DOROTHY
                        No!

           The mere sight of the PRINCE causes the fairies to SCATTER.  

                                 ALICE
                            (calling to Dorothy)
                        Run! 

           In the sky, the Red Prince wheels the bird around...charging  
           for Dorothy.  She runs, but the bird of prey is too fast.  

           It DIVES down and...GRABS DOROTHY IN ITS TALONS.  

           Alice watches from the treetop in horror.

           In a flash, Dorothy’s hoisted off the ground (right over 
           Alice’s head), and whisked across the Neverland Sea. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (tears streaming)
                        Dorothy!!

           As the Rain begins to fall, a silence creeps through the 
           forest.  The wolves SNIFF THE AIR.  Sensing something, they 
           scatter.  

           Alice is still in the treetop unable to move; she’s overcome 
           with grief.  Then, A RUMBLE begins to build as... 

           KNIGHTS IN SILVER ARMOR STORM ACROSS THE FOREST    

           On powerful chargers, they gallop right past Alice - she SEES 
           their leader in an ivory suit-of-armor...

           IT’S THE WHITE KNIGHT 

           With a powerful sword held aloft, the White Knight lets out a 
           BATTLE CRY.  Alice screams out...

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re too late! 

           The other knights draw swords too, charging right past Alice.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE SEA - NIGHT

           Freezing (in the talons of the Red Prince’s bird), Dorothy is 
           flown across miles of sea to the frosted realm of...
           GLACIEM 

           The ominous dominion is a collection of tall glaciers and 
           frosted peaks.  Snow comes down in sheets.  Shivering, 
           Dorothy glances down at the sea below, and then into the 
           distance, where...

           A FORTRESS OF ICE AND SNOW rises up from the sea itself.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

           THE WHITE KNIGHT and his soldiers rip through the village, 
           slashing the unsuspecting red warriors and pirates who have 
           taken control.  

           As the White Knight moves in to free the prisoners (Michael, 
           John, Tiger Lily and Cheshire), HOOK steps in front of him 
           with his sword drawn. 

           Rain pelts from above. 

                                 HOOK
                        I don’t know what it is you think 
                        you’re doing, but these prisoners 
                        are mine.

           Unsheathing his sword, the White Knight tosses off his 
           helmet... revealing his EBONY SKIN and strong features. 

                                 WHITE KNIGHT 
                        Then let me explain it to you.

           The Knight’s SWORD CRASHES down on Hook’s weapon, sparking a 
           vicious battle of clashing blades.  Hook puts up a good 
           fight, but the White Knight is too fast and too skilled...

           HOOK IS QUICKLY DISARMED AND PINNED TO THE GROUND  

           The Knight towers over the fallen pirate. 

                                 WHITE KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Unshackle the prisoners. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - NIGHT

           Nearing the FROZEN FORTRESS, the Red Prince’s bird approaches 
           a towering gate that lowers as it approaches. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - NIGHT 

           Now inside the fortress, Dorothy is released from the bird’s 
           talons.  Her lips are blue...her body shivers and shakes. 

           The entryway is a massive hall with HUGE FIRE PITS and 
           stockpiled weapons.  The Prince goes to a wall where various 
           garments are hung.  He takes a coat.

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Put this on.

           Taking the coat, Dorothy wraps it over her body. 

                                 THE RED PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        Follow me.

           Obeying, Dorothy follows him down a long frosted hallway to a 
           RED DOOR flanked by guards.  Seeing the Prince approach, the 
           guards open the doors.  

           Dorothy is lead into...

           THE RED QUEEN’S CHAMBERS 

           The expansive room looks strangely familiar.  

           Candles glow and incense burns.  A large MAP and unusual art 
           pieces cover the crimson walls.  Dorothy looks confused... 
           where is she? 

           Suddenly, a VOICE BOOMS from across the room...

                                 VOICE  
                        Welcome, Dorothy.

           There’s A WOMAN standing across from her in the shadows.  
           She’s wearing a crown and a flowing red gown.  

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been expecting you for some 
                        time. 

           In her hand she clutches a MANUSCRIPT titled...

           THE BOOK OF WORLDS

           The woman steps out of the shadows and under A SKY LIGHT.   
           The PALE MOON SHINES down brightly from above, illuminating 
           the woman’s face.  Dorothy can’t believe it...

           THE RED QUEEN IS DOCTOR ROSE ADLER

                                 DOROTHY
                                 (disbelief)
                        You-- you’re the Red Queen?
                                 RED QUEEN
                        I’m a Red Queen.  Not the first and 
                        surely not the last. 

           Dozens of HEARTS are showcased on THE WALL behind the Queen.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Personally, I prefer... Queen of 
                        Hearts.  

           The Red Prince removes his mask, revealing...

           THE RED PRINCE IS DARIUS 

           Dorothy is dumbfounded.  The Queen moves toward her.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        When we met I told you it was no 
                        mere coincidence that our paths had 
                        crossed.  Do you remember?  

           Dorothy is still too stunned to speak.   

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Mother, I have the stone. 

           He removes THE DREAM STONE; it shines brightly in the light 
           of the pale moon.  Mesmerized by it’s brilliance, the Red 
           Queen takes the stone into her hands.  

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Well done, my son. 

           The Queen sets the stone on an ALTAR (that’s directly under 
           the skylight), and moves closer to Dorothy.  

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, you haven’t even begun to 
                        understand the powers you possess.

           She steps closer to her.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Or the important role you’re to 
                        play...this very night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the village, it’s a decidedly different scene.  

           Now, Hook and his pirates (and the remaining red soldiers), 
           are shackled and being hauled off to Tiger Lily’s prison.
           A figure comes from the forest and enters the village.  It’s 
           ALICE; she’s drenched and has a manic look in her eye. 

           She SEES Michael, John, and Tiger talking to the White 
           Knight.  

           From under a bush, Cheshire SPIES Alice as she approaches.  

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Alice, you’re alive!

           Alice remains silent.  ANGER FLARES in her eyes.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, are you okay?  

           Alice doesn’t respond, she goes right to the White Knight.  

                                 WHITE KNIGHT
                        Alice, we’ve been looking for you. 

           John turns to her.

                                 JOHN
                        Where’s Dorothy? 

                                 ALICE
                        Dorothy is gone and so is the 
                        stone.  

           Clenching her fists, she glares at the White Knight. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        She was taken by the Red Prince 
                        because you were late. 

           Tiger Lily breaks in. 

                                 TIGER LILY
                        You may want to direct some of your 
                        anger at them...
                            (she glares at John and 
                              Michael)
                        They made a deal with Hook that 
                        brought the Red Prince here. 

           Alice can’t take it anymore, her anger exploding inside her.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Alice, please, it’s not what you 
                        think--

           Before he can finish, Alice RAGES AT JOHN...she grabs him 
           forcefully by the neck.  He goes down hard.  She jumps on top 
           of him pounding him with her fists.  
                                 ALICE
                        I knew when I saw you everything 
                        would fall apart! 

           Michael tries to pull her off of his brother. 

                                 JOHN
                        Please...Listen!  We knew nothing 
                        about this Red Prince - we only 
                        wanted the stone-- to save Wendy! 

                                 MICHEAL
                        You know what it’s like to lose 
                        someone.  You’d have done the same! 

           The White Knight steps in and pulls Alice off of John.

                                 WHITE KNIGHT
                        Alice, we’re going to get Dorothy 
                        and the stone - you just have to be 
                        patient.

                                 ALICE
                        Patient?  The pale moon is here! 
                        The Red Queen has the stone--  
                        she’s probably using it to call her 
                        dark army right now! 

                                 WHITE KNIGHT
                        The Red Queen’s fortress is in 
                        Glaciem.  I’ve just received word 
                        that the Royal Navy of Oz is on 
                        it’s way there now... ready to 
                        attack.

           He looks deep into Alice’s eyes.

                                 WHITE KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        My ships will be right behind them 
                        as soon as we account for our dead 
                        and meet with Chief Grey Panther. 

           Tiger turns to the Knight. 

                                 TIGER LILY
                        I can take you to my father now.

           The Knight leaves with Tiger.  Alice is even more frustrated.  

                                 WHITE KNIGHT
                        Stay put, Alice.

           Bloodied, John gets off the ground and turns to Alice. 

                                 JOHN
                        If you want to get to Dorothy now.  
                        I know how to do it.
                                 ALICE
                        And what makes you think I’d EVER 
                        trust you to do anything?

           He wipes the blood from his face with his sleeve. 

                                 JOHN
                        Because you care about Dorothy, and 
                        whether you believe it or not, I do 
                        too. 

           Confused, Michael turns to his brother. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        And how exactly do you plan on 
                        pulling this off? 

                                 JOHN
                        By commandeering a ship. 

           He reaches into his pocket.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        And making the sails fly like 
                        they’ve never flown before.

           He pulls out a handful of shimmering... PIXIE DUST.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - THE RED QUEEN’S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Gazing out of an imposing WINDOW, the Red Queen continues her 
           conversation with Dorothy.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Like you, I travelled to far off 
                        worlds in my dreams when I was a 
                        young child, but by the time I was 
                        your age, my abilities had all but 
                        diminished... It became my life’s 
                        work to find a way to return. 

           Outside the window, snow and freezing rain trickle down.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        My son and I discovered the means 
                        to actually do it, but unlike the 
                        stone, machines have their 
                        limitations. 

           The Queen turns from the window and faces Dorothy. 
                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Very few people can unlock the 
                        stone’s power...even under the most 
                        ideal of circumstances.
                        However, this is the longest night 
                        of the year, illuminated by the 
                        pale moon-- and we have a Princess 
                        of Oz among us. 

           Suddenly, Dorothy realizes...the Red Queen needs her. 

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy, if you were to join with 
                        us, the possibilities would 
                        be...boundless.  Together we could 
                        control every world in existence!  

                                 DOROTHY
                        Join with you?  You’re murderers--  
                        both of you!  

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Murder?  How about sacrifices for 
                        the greater good.

           She glares at the Red Prince. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Who’s good?

           She turns back to the Red Queen.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Yours? 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Yes, and yours too.  Don’t you 
                        understand?  The stone can take you 
                        to any world.  Even to places 
                        outside space and time as we know 
                        it.

           The wheels in Dorothy’s head begin to spin.  

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Dorothy, the Stone can even 
                        reunite you with your dearly 
                        departed Aunt Emily. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE NEVERLAND SEA - CONTINUOUS

           Moonlight scatters across the ocean rain.  A CANOE knifes 
           through the waves towards...
           THE JOLLY ROGER - docked just off the Neverland coast.  

           In the canoe, John and Michael paddle.  Alice clutches the 
           Cheshire Cat.  Finally, the boys maneuver the tiny craft to 
           the edge of the pirate ship to...

           A ROPE LADDER.  Exiting the canoe, the kids climb up the 
           ladder and into...

           EXT. THE JOLLY ROGER - CONTINUOUS

           Alice climbs on deck first, with Cheshire.  John and Michael 
           come up after.  Michael rushes into action, searching to see 
           if anyone is still on the ship.

                                 MICHEAL
                        She’s deserted! 

                                 ALICE
                        Now what?

           Taking the helm, John is invigorated...his plan might 
           actually work. 

                                 JOHN
                        We sail.  Michael, take up the 
                        anchor! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Aye, Captain!

           Next, John PITCHES THE PIXIE DUST into the Jolly Roger’s MAIN 
           SAIL.  Instantaneously, the sail begins to SHINE WITH SILVER 
           LIGHT.  Then...

           THE SHIPS LIFTS OFF FROM THE WAVES - HOVERING ABOVE THE SEA

                                 ALICE
                        It’s working!

           Cheshire meows loudly.

                                 JOHN
                        Hold on tight everyone!

           The Jolly Roger picks up speed.  Soon, the ship is blasting 
           through the rain....sailing above the waves. 

           NOT FAR AWAY ON A CLIFFSIDE...

           THE WHITE RABBIT watches the pirate ship in the moonlight. 

                                 THE WHITE RABBIT
                        Good luck, Alice, and Godspeed.   

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - THE RED QUEEN'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 

           Dorothy is still in a state of disbelief...could she really 
           see her Aunt Emily again?  The Red Queen ambles closer to 
           her. 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Ask yourself, Dorothy, are you 
                        really willing to give up the 
                        chance to see her again? 

           Dorothy doesn’t respond.  The PALE MOON shines brilliantly, 
           illuminating the DREAM STONE on the Altar. 

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        See the way the stone shines?  
                        Surely a Princess of Oz could 
                        unlock it’s powers tonight!   

           Conflict rages in Dorothy; it’s written all over her face. 

           Glancing out the window, the Red Prince SEES a fleet of 
           EMERALD COLORED SHIPS approaching the fortress. 

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Mother, look!

           She goes to the window and sees the ships.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Oz’s pitiful Navy... they’re of no 
                        concern. 

                                 THE RED PRINCE 
                        But mother, my soldiers are still 
                        in Neverland, how will we fight?

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Have you forgotten?  We have the 
                        stone... we’ll bring forth an 
                        invincible army! 

           She turns to Dorothy.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        The time is now...place your hand 
                        on the stone and unleash its 
                        powers! 

                                 DOROTHY
                        No...I can’t...

           The Red Queen loses her patience.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        You fool, do it NOW! 
           Grabbing Dorothy’s hand...she SLAMS it down on the stone. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        No!!

           Dorothy’s CUT.  Blood trickles from her wrist onto the stone.  
           In seconds, BRIGHT LIGHTS emanate from the stone’s multiple 
           facets, revealing...

           DOORS OF LIGHT - ALL OVER THE ROOM

           The Red Prince’s eyes widen.

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Mother...

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Yes, I see!

           SOUNDS AND VOICES (from the worlds beyond the doors), being 
           to reverberate and echo throughout the space, but ONE gets 
           Dorothy’s attention...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dorothy?

           EXT. THE SEA - CONTINUOUS  

           The Jolly Roger soars above pounding waves.  Finally, the 
           vessel nears GLACIEM CASTLE.  Using a spyglass, Michael sees 
           it first.

                                 MICHEAL
                        There it is!  The Red Queen’s 
                        palace.

           He calls below deck to his brother.

                                 MICHEAL (CONT’D)
                        John, get up here! 

           John runs up stairs and onto the main deck, carrying A MAP.  

           As the ship nears Glaciem, the temperature drastically DROPS.  
           Taking the spyglass from Michael, Alice notices something 
           too...

           THE FLEET OF EMERALD COLORED SHIPS APPROACHING THE CASTLE 

                                 ALICE
                        Look, Oz’s Navy! 

           As the green ship nears Glaciem - the others see them too.  
           Hustling, Michael slips below deck.  Alice turns to John.   
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You had a plan for us getting to 
                        the castle... did you have one for 
                        getting us in? 

           He studies THE MAP of Glaciem in his hand. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m working on it. 

           Micheal rushes back on deck carrying coats.

                                 MICHEAL
                        Here, put these on! 

           They do.  Shivering, Cheshire watches them. 

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        Where’s mine?

                                 ALICE
                        You’re wearing it. 

           The cat HISSES.  John studies the icy fortress. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hand me the spyglass.

           As Alice gives it to him, he sees...

           A CRESCENT SHAPED BREAK IN THE FORTRESS’ WESTERN FACE   

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        There it is.

                                 ALICE
                        There’s what?

           He hands her the spyglass.  

                                 JOHN 
                        The split...looks like a half-moon. 

           The Jolly Roger slows down...drifting right toward the 
           WESTERN FACE OF THE FORTRESS.  

                                 ALICE
                            (using the spyglass)
                        I don’t see anything except snow 
                        and more snow. 

           John TURNS the spyglass for Alice.  

                                 JOHN
                        There... the crescent shape, it’s a 
                        secret entrance.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                               (a beat)
                        Michael, drop the anchor! 

           As Alice puts the spyglass down, John hands her a FLINTLOCK 
           PISTOL.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You may need this. 

           Cheshire MEOWS loudly.

                                 CHESHIRE CAT
                        I volunteer to watch the ship!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - THE RED QUEEN'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           The LIGHT emanating from the stone is now shining so 
           intensely, it has created it’s own environment. 

           The space no longer even looks like the Queen’s chambers; 
           it’s become it’s own celestial plane...where hundreds of 
           LUMINOUS DOORWAYS have materialized. 

           Each of the doors is MARKED WITH A UNIQUE SYMBOL.  Dorothy 
           walks past them, trying to find where THE VOICE came from. 

           The Red Queen and The Prince watch her.  She walks past more 
           doors.  Then, she hears THE VOICE again. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dorothy, I’m here.  

           Turning, Dorothy SEES the DOOR where THE VOICE is coming 
           from.  As she’s about to enter, the Red Prince tries to stop 
           her, but the Queen intervenes. 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        No, let her go.  We have our own 
                        business to attend to. 

           The Red Queen opens the BOOK OF WORLDS manuscript.  Searching 
           the pages, she finds what she’s looking for. 

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Find the door marked with three 
                        stars...behind it we’ll find an 
                        army, ready to do battle for me. 

           Nearby, Dorothy steps through the doorway and into...
           INT. GALE FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Stepping through the brightness, Dorothy quickly realizes 
           she’s in THE GALE KITCHEN.

           However, there are subtle differences.  The sun that shines 
           through the open window is exceedingly radiant, and 
           everything seems just slightly otherworldly. 

           Near the stove is A WOMAN.  Her back is to Dorothy, but even 
           from behind, Dorothy recognizes her.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Aunt Em?  

           The woman turns around.  It is indeed her AUNT EMILY (68).  
           Emily has silver hair and a kind face. 

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Dorothy, it is you.  I thought I 
                        heard your voice outside.  Come, 
                        sit and have some cornbread. 

           Astonished, Dorothy goes to the table and takes a seat.  
           Emily puts the cornbread on the table and sits down, too. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Is it really you?  

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Of course it’s me.

           A tear falls from Dorothy’s eye. 

                                 AUNT EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Honey, don’t cry.  Eat, please.

           Dorothy takes a piece of the cornbread, and bites into it.

                                 AUNT EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Good?

           Dorothy “nods,” studying her Aunt’s face.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Aunt Emily... this place...  We’re 
                        not really in our kitchen in 
                        Kansas, are we?

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Of course not dear, but it’s the 
                        perfect place for us to talk.
                                   (a beat)
                        I’ve been gone from Kansas for some 
                        time now.
                                 DOROTHY
                        Since last Christmas.

           Emily thinks.

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Yes, that sounds right...Christmas.  

           Dorothy puts her hand on top of her Aunt’s hand.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’ve been lost without you.

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        I know you have, but I can’t figure 
                        out why.

                               DOROTHY
                        What do you mean?

                                 AUNT EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Because, I never left you. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        But the night you passed...         
                        I was angry, the words I said--

           Emily stops her. 

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        --Dorothy, we both said things.   
                        But I never thought for a second 
                        you didn’t love me, did you doubt 
                        my love for you?  

           Tears run down Dorothy’s cheeks. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        No.

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Of course not.  It’s time you took 
                        control of your life. 

           Emily smiles.

                                 AUNT EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You have crystal days ahead of you.  
                        I know, because I’ve seen them. 

           Dorothy EMBRACES her.  Then, Emily looks in her eyes. 

                                 AUNT EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You have to go now, but I have to 
                        give you something first. 
           Emily hands her A NAPKIN.  On it is an image that looks like 
           TWIN DRAGONS encircled together... creating a ring.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        I don’t understand.

                                 AUNT EMILY
                        Before the long night ends, you 
                        will. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE THE DOORWAY WHERE DOROTHY IS...

           The Red Queen and her son search in vain for the door marked 
           with the THREE STAR symbol, but they can’t find it.  

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        There’s too many doors...this is 
                        impossible! 

           Suddenly, the Red Queen SEES a door marked with THREE STARS. 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        There it is...

           But just as she approaches it, SOMETHING STRIKES the 
           fortress.  As the ceiling cracks, chunks of stone plummet.

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        We’re under attack!

           THE DREAM STONE falls off of the Altar.  Instantly, the DOORS 
           OF LIGHT vanish.  The room returns to exactly the way it was. 

           Dorothy is now alone on the floor.  The Red Queen SEES her. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. THE SEA - CONTINUOUS

           Oz’s fleet nears the fortress.  On the deck of one of the 
           ships, WE SEE - the LION, the SCARECROW, and the TIN MAN.  
           Scarecrow yells out.

                                 SCARECROW
                        Fire, again!!

           With that, Oz’s fleet FIRES cannons on Glaciem Castle. 

           NOT FAR AWAY...
           The Jolly Roger is anchored outside the north face of the 
           Castle, but only the CHESHIRE CAT remains on deck. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE ON: Alice, holding the flintlock pistol.  Right behind 
           her, John and Michael (both with swords), trudge through the 
           snow toward...

           THE SECRET ENTRANCE 

           They slip through the CRESCENT SHAPED SPLIT and into...

           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Maneuvering past guards, Alice and the brothers hurry down 
           narrow corridors and tight hallways-- searching for Dorothy.

                                 MICHEAL
                            (whispering)
                        This place is enormous...              
                        how are we ever going to find her?

           Alice spies TWO STAIRCASES: one ascending and one descending.  

                                 ALICE
                        You two search the lower levels, 
                        I’ll go upstairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - THE RED QUEEN'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Again, the fortress is hit.  Stone and ice tumble from above.  
           Dorothy is on the floor...still affected by the events that 
           have transpired over the last few moments.  The Red Queen 
           towers over her.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Dorothy, you saw what the stone can 
                        do, didn’t you? 

           The Queen picks up the stone, placing it back on the Altar.  

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Now, help us protect it from those 
                        who would destroy it! 

           The Red Prince is about to grab Dorothy, but... A VOICE rings 
           out across the room.  
                                 VOICE
                        Don’t you touch her. 

           ALICE-- stands in the doorway of the Red Queen’s chambers, 
           her pistol pointed at the Queen. 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Alice, how nice of you to join us.

           Alice COCKS the weapon.

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t make me kill you.  

                                 RED QUEEN
                        You, kill me?  In what realm of 
                        imagination would that be possible?

           The Red Prince steps in front of the Queen.  The gun shakes 
           in Alice’s trembling hand. 

                                 ALICE
                        I mean it, not another step! 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Alice, put down the weapon.  I know 
                        what it is you want...to see your 
                        sister again.  

           A moment of vulnerability shows on Alice’s face, but quickly 
           passes.  Stealing herself, she lifts the gun in defiance.  

           The Prince takes another step, the GUN GOES OFF - only 
           grazing his armor.  He lunges for Alice and GRABS HER.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Alice! 

           The gun hits the ground; the Red Queen smiles.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        This just makes everything so much 
                        simpler. 

           She grabs Dorothy, pushing her toward the stone.

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Now, put your hand on the stone and 
                        unleash it’s power again-- or...

           The Prince draws his sword and places it to Alice’s NECK. 

                                 RED QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Off with her head.

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t listen to her, don’t do it! 
                                 RED QUEEN
                        Careful Dorothy... if she dies 
                        here, she dies on the otherside, 
                        too. 

           The Prince moves the blade closer to Alice’s neck.  Shaking, 
           Dorothy gives in....

           SHE DROPS HER HAND ON THE STONE

                                 ALICE
                        No!!

           In a flash...the room becomes the spectral plane again, as 
           THE DOORWAYS OF LIGHT REAPPEAR.

           The Red Queen searches for the THREE STAR SYMBOL, and quickly 
           finds it.  Nearing the door, she enters. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           In the glow of the pale moon, OZ’s Navy storms the shores of 
           Glaciem.  The Lion ROARS wildly as he rushes the gates of the 
           fortress - leading the assault.  

           Nearby, THE TIN MAN holds his AXE above his head-- while THE 
           SCARECROW draws a sword.

                                 SCARECROW
                        Charge!

           Behind them, SOLDIERS IN EMERALD ARMOR push through the snow 
           to the fortress-- and begin to BASH IN THE GATE. 

           Turning back to the sea, the Scarecrow NOTICES something. 

                                 SCARECROW (CONT’D)
                        The White Knight is here,   
                        Wonderland fights with Oz! 

           He’s right, THE WHITE KNIGHT’S SHIPS are nearly to the 
           castle.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           The Red Prince’s blade is still at Alice’s neck.  Dorothy 
           looks defeated; tears stream down her face.  

           Around the room, CHUNKS of the ceiling fall, but nothing hits 
           the stone.  It’s still bathed in moonlight on the Altar.
           The Red Queen emerges from THE DOOR OF LIGHT.  Her face glows 
           with confidence as she raises her hands to the pale moon.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Now, fight!!

           With that, HUNDREDS OF WARRIORS in black armor (with HOLLOW 
           EYES and GREY SKIN), storm out of the glimmering doorway - 
           just in time to meet...

           OZ’s WARRIORS AS THEY BLAST INTO THE CASTLE

           BLADES clang as SPEARS and ARROWS are unleashed.  Soon, the 
           entire castle is in the throes of a DANGEROUS BATTLE. 

           In the chaos, THE LION sees THE RED PRINCE (still holding 
           Alice), and CHARGES him.  

           The Prince releases his hold on Alice as...

           THE LION RIPS INTO HIM

                                 THE RED PRINCE
                        Ahhh!!! 

           Watching, the Red Queen SCREAMS in horror.  At the same 
           time...

           ALICE RUNS TO DOROTHY - the reunited friends embrace.  

                                 ALICE
                        The stone, we have to get it! 

           Dorothy takes off with Alice toward the Altar.  Running, they 
           pass MANY DOORS OF LIGHT, but one door’s symbol catches 
           Dorothy’s attention...

           TWIN DRAGONS ENCIRCLED TOGETHER - just like on Aunt Em’s 
           napkin.  Dorothy grabs Alice’s hand. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Follow me.

                                 ALICE
                        Follow you, where?

           Just like when Alice pulled Dorothy through the looking 
           glass...now Dorothy pulls Alice into...

           INT. TWIN DRAGON DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly, the girls are warmed by sunlight.  Gorgeous trees 
           and fields of flowers go on for miles in every direction.  
           It’s so beautiful, it could almost be the Garden of Eden.  
                                 ALICE
                        What is this place?

           Then, through the sunlight, the girls see...

           TWIN WHITE DRAGONS - sleeping under an ancient tree.  

           The dragon’s aren’t fully grown; each are about the size of a 
           small bus.  Dorothy’s eyes widen as she approaches them.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Wait.  Aren’t you supposed to let 
                        sleeping dragons lie?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Not this time.

           Fearlessly, Dorothy moves to the Dragons and places a hand on 
           each of their heads...  

           THE DRAGON’S EYES FLASH OPEN 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           From out of the door marked with THREE STARS - legions of 
           other DARK WARRIORS rush out to ready to fight.  The 
           Scarecrow and Tin Man see them coming. 

                                 SCARECROW
                        There’s too many of them!!

           The Red Queen takes the sword from her dead son’s hand. 

                                 RED QUEEN
                        You will be avenged tonight.  I 
                        swear it!

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the castle it’s a similar scene; battalions of dark 
           warriors CLASH with the soldiers from Oz and Wonderland. 

           In the conflict WE SEE: John and Michael fighting, with dead 
           and wounded soldiers falling around them. 

           MORE DARK WARRIORS charge out of the castle.  The White 
           Knight’s men stand against them, but they’re vastly 
           outnumbered.  They’re not getting out of this alive.

           Spilling into various rooms in the castle, the fighting rages 
           on. The LION does battle with enemy warriors when suddenly...

           The Red Queen comes up behind him.  She raises her sword - 
           just about stab him, when...

           A THUNDEROUS BELLOW ECHOES behind her.  Turning, she sees...

           DOROTHY RIDING ON ONE OF THE WHITE DRAGONS 

           Before the Red Queen can even react, the dragon breathes a 
           blast of FIRE, that totally consumes her.

                                 RED QUEEN
                        Ahhh!!!

           When the Dragon finishes with the Queen, it turns it’s fiery 
           assault on the DARK WARRIORS. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the fortress, the OTHER DRAGON (being ridden by 
           Alice) uses it’s fire, slashing claws, and fanged mouth to 
           fight.  The Army’s of Oz and Wonderland CHEER, watching the 
           powerful beast decimate the enemy.  

           Soon, THE GREAT BATTLE HAS ALL BUT ENEDED.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ENT. GLACIEM CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Atop the dragons, Dorothy and Alice enter the Queen’s 
           chambers.  Seeing the Red Queen’s CHARED REMAINS, Alice turns 
           to Dorothy.

                                 ALICE
                        Well played, witch slayer. 

           Behind them they hear footsteps.  Turning, they see MICHAEL 
           AND JOHN.  The girls dismount the dragons. 

                                 JOHN
                        Dorothy!

           Without thinking, he grabs her.  The two embrace.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?
                                 DOROTHY
                            (smiling)
                        I’m fine. 

           Out of the corner of her eye, Dorothy notices that... THE 
           DOORS OF LIGHT are beginning to fade; her eyes go to Alice. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                                 (frantic)
                        Alice! You were right about the 
                        stone...you can cross over to 
                        death!  I found my Aunt Emily, I 
                        even spoke to her!    

           Dorothy starts to go, but Alice stops her.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        We can find your sister... we just 
                        have to hurry! 

           Alice doesn’t move. 

                                 ALICE
                        Dorothy, even if I did find my 
                        sister behind one of those doors?  
                        I wouldn’t really have her back, 
                        not forever.   

           A teardrop falls from Alice’s eye. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        But the sister I have now--is 
                        here...and real.  

           Moved, Dorothy embraces her.  Alice smiles...she found what 
           she was looking for after all.  Behind them the pale moon 
           grows dim as... DAYBREAK NEARS.   

           Alice turns to Dorothy. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        The dragons... they’d better get 
                        back. 

           Knowingly, the dragons look up at Dorothy.  She motions for 
           them to enter...

           THE DOOR MARKED WITH THE TWIN DRAGON SYMBOL

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           They ROAR a response.  Then, as quickly as they came, they 
           slip through THE DOORWAY and vanish. 

           As the pale moon disappears, all of the doors of light 
           dematerialize. 
           SUNLIGHT FILLS GLACIEM CASTLE

           Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion enter the room.  Dorothy 
           rushes to them.  She hugs her lion--and smiles at the Tin 
           Man.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m so glad you’re not...

                                 TIN MAN 
                        ...frozen solid?  I guess I have 
                        you and the lightning to thank for 
                        that. 

           Soon, Dorothy is introducing her old friends to her new 
           ones... and telling tales of how she met each of them.  The 
           Scarecrow smiles.

                                 SCARECROW
                        I guess there’s just one thing left 
                        to do.

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s that?

                                 SCARECROW
                        Get you all back home.

           The DOORS OF THE EMERALD CITY open.  Making her way into the 
           main throne room, Dorothy is surrounded by her friends...new 
           and old.  

           OZMA AWAITS.  She smiles, seeing Dorothy approach. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ozma, I have the stone.

                        Yes, and I see you found Alice,

           Ozma reaches out and pets the Cheshire Cat in Alice’s arms.

                        John and Michael Darling?

           They lower their heads before her.

                        You know us, your Majesty? 

                                 OZMA
                        I’ve heard tale of your adventures

                        that your sister’s been lost for

           CRASH!  Dorothy, Alice and Cheshire skid out of the LOOKING 
           GLASS... sliding across the floor of the Hatter’s shop. 

           The Hatter (who was working on something on the other side of 
           the room), spins his head toward the commotion.  He sees 
           Dorothy first.

                                 THE HATTER
                        Dorothy?

           He sees Alice next.

                                 THE HATTER (CONT’D)
                        And Alice??

           Cheshire MEOWS loudly. 

                                 THE HATTER (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Cheshire, I see you, too.       
                        I see all of you! 

           He hurries over to them as they get up from the floor.  

                                 THE HATTER (CONT’D)
                        But is it really you?  Are you 
                        really back?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes, it’s really me.  

                                 THE MAD HATTER
                        And the stone...is it safe?

                                 ALICE
                        Quite safe.

           The Mad Hatter breathes a heavy sigh of relief. 

                                 THE HATTER
                        I knew the two of you would do 
                        it... I just knew it! 

           The Hatter turns and dances an Irish jig.  Watching him, the 
           girls turn to each other...having the same thought at once. 

                                 ALICE

                               ALICE
                        But we’ll be back!

           Charging up the stairs, Alice calls for her cat.

                                 ALICE
                        Cheshire, come! 

           Meowing, the cat runs up the stairs after them.  Watching 
           them go, the Mad Hatter tips his hat. 

                                 THE HATTER
                        Farewell Lasses, and may the road 
                        rise with you.

           Deep in Dr. Adler’s secret room, WE SEE John and Michael.  
           Slowly, they wake up in the SILVER RECLINING CHAIRS.  

           As Michael’s eyes open, he gazes over at John.

                                 MICHEAL
                        John, wake up.

           John’s eyelids raise.

                        Brother, we’re back. 

           As John sits up, removing the wires from his body.  Doing the 
           same, Michael sits up and sees...

           DARIUS AND DR. ADLER’S BODIES - IN THE OTHER SILVER CHAIRS 

                                 MICHEAL (CONT’D)
                        John, look.

           Turning, John sees the LIFELESS BODIES of the Doctor and 
           Darius, each of which is connected to the strange machine. 

           Dr. Adler’s remains are SCORCHED from the dragon fire.  
           Likewise, Darius’ body is SLASHED from the Lion’s attack.  
           After a moment of stunned silence, John speaks...

                                 JOHN
                        They must have sent themselves--
                        right after they sent us. 

           With that, FOOTSTEPS are heard.  It’s Dorothy and Alice.  
           They creak down the narrow steps that lead into... 

           THE STRANGE CAVE-LIKE ROOM 
           Seeing the girls, the brothers hurry to their feet.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Dorothy!  

           He takes her into his arms.  Michael, Alice, and Cheshire 
           reunite too.  Then, Alice looks around the room and SEES the 
           bodies.

                                 ALICE
                        Dear God, what happened?

           Studying their remains, Dorothy puts it together.

                                 DOROTHY
                        They were killed in the dream.

           Alice looks at Dr. Adler’s face. 

                                 ALICE
                        She said it herself... you die on 
                        the otherside, you die here too. 

                                 MICHEAL
                        We’d better call Scotland Yard.

                                 ALICE
                        And tell them what?

                                 JOHN
                        I suppose, the truth.  

                                 ALICE
                        Um.  That should go well. 

           A VOICE calls from the top of the stairwell.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello?  Is there someone down 
                        there?

                                 DOROTHY AND ALICE
                                  (at the same time)
                        Charlotte. 

           With that, Charlotte emerges at the bottom of the stairs. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What did I miss last night?  What 
                        is this place? 
                            (she sees the bodies)
                        Oh, my God!

                                 DOROTHY
                        We’re going to explain everything, 
                        okay?
           Charlotte panics, but Dorothy looks in her eyes. 

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Charlotte, I saw the garden, and 
                        the twin dragons.

                                 ALICE
                        We both did.  

           Charlotte’s eyes widen.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You did?

           Alice “nods.”

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sorry I doubted you. 

           Behind them, John and Michael place blankets over the bodies 
           of Dr. Adler and Darius.

                                 JOHN
                        I think it’s time we got out of 
                        here. 

                                 ALICE
                        Agreed. 

           One by one, each of the kids slowly make their way back up 
           the ancient staircase.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INSERT: TWO WEEKS LATER

           INT. LONDON CAFE - DAY

           Dressed very much like a young Londoner, Dorothy sits in a 
           cozy cafe sipping tea and writing a letter. 

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        Dear Uncle Henry... I’m so sorry 
                        it’s taken me this long to write to 
                        you, but I want you to know I’m 
                        doing well and growing quite fond 
                        of my new city.  

           Glancing at the time (on the face of BIG BEN outside a 
           window), Dorothy slips the letter in an envelope.  She seals 
           it, and puts a stamp on it. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. LONDON STREET - CONTINUOUS

           It’s an unusually sunny day for England, and everyone is out 
           to enjoy the weather.  

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        I’ve actually made new friends and 
                        had some amazing experiences... all 
                        in the short time I’ve been here.  

           Dorothy slinks her way through crowds, maneuvering through 
           the high streets of London. 

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        Of course I miss you and Toto, but  
                        for the first time, in a long time, 
                        I know I am exactly where I’m 
                        supposed to be-- and everything 
                        seems to be in it’s right place. 

           Something catches Dorothy’s attention.  A NEWS BOY holding up 
           A PAPER brandishing the headline...

           DREAM DOCTOR AND ASSISTANT DIE IN EXPERIMENT GONE WRONG  

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        I promise to write more soon, but I 
                        want you to know... I understand 
                        now, what you said about Aunt 
                        Emily.

           She EYES a MAIL BOX across the street, and goes to it. 

                                 DOROTHY (V.O.)
                        You were right, she never left us.  

           As she drops the letter in the mailbox, A VOICE calls to her 
           from down the street.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Dorothy, hurry!

           Dorothy looks...it’s Charlotte.  She’s with Alice, John and 
           Michael.  The four of them are standing in front of...  

           EXT. THE BRITISH MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

           Dorothy runs to them.  She greets each of her friends.  When 
           she sees John...there’s a certain spark between the two. 

           Moving on, the five of them slip into a long line under A 
           BANNER that reads... Exhibit: Lost Treasures of the Ancient 
           World.  Soon, the crowds are ushered into...
           INT. THE BRITISH MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

           Winding down wide hallways, the excited crowds take in rooms 
           filled with... 

           Egyptian treasures, unwrapped mummies, the golden head of a 
           Samaritan goddess, and thousands of other artifacts from 
           across the globe. 

           Later, the kids decide to split up.  The three girls take a 
           stroll through a room filled with 14th Century art, while the 
           brothers explore prehistoric relics. 

           Stepping away from Alice and Charlotte, Dorothy gazes at a 
           painting.  Unexpectedly, she hears A VOICE.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Dorothy, I’ve found her.

           At first she ignores it, but then she hears it again.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        She’s here.

           Dorothy turns around.  Alice is right behind her.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Find the staircase.

                                 ALICE
                        Did you hear that?

           Before Dorothy can respond, Charlotte grabs their hands.  
           Running, they hurry to a SPIRAL STAIRCASE and descend into... 

           THE BASEMENT 

           Dusty paintings (many still unboxed), fill the space.  A hand 
           lands on Dorothy’s shoulder.  Startled, she spins around, but 
           it’s only... JOHN AND MICHAEL.

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t mean to frighten you, it’s 
                        just we both...

                                 ALICE
                        Heard a voice, calling you down 
                        here?

           Both brothers “nod.”  After a moment of silence, THE VOICE 
           returns, but this time is audible in the room.  

                                 OZMA (V.O.)
                        I found her, I know where Wendy 
                        is... go to the Tower. 
                                 MICHEAL
                        John, did you just hear that?!

           Charlotte steps away from the others. 

                                 JOHN
                        I most certainly did.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Ozma?  Where are you?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey, over here!

           They walk over to where Charlotte is.  She stands in front of 
           a tall sinister painting of... A LONE DARK TOWER - on the 
           edge of a forest filled with black trees.

                                 JOHN
                        Dear God, is that where Wendy is?

           Before anyone can respond, the painting slowly and subtly 
           begins to CONSUME THE ROOM.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        What’s happening? 

           Somehow the picture they were just looking at... has become 
           their reality.  Strange animal sounds begin to echo.  

           PULLING BACK, we see that the kids are no longer in the 
           museum, but in a dark forest of DEAD TREES...that goes on for 
           miles in every direction. 

           FADE OUT
