           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA BACKYARD - SUNSET

           The last vestiges of sunlight shine towards us, blocked only 
           by a powerful, sturdy MAN holding a BASEBALL BAT in one hand 
           a GLOVE in the other, nearly silhouetted by the setting sun.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        When I was a kid, my father seemed 
                        like a giant.

           This man is JAMES JORDAN (38, black, stern and masculine). As 
           he walks into his vast rural backyard we PULL OUT TO REVEAL:

           YOUNG MICHAEL JORDAN (12, skinny, all limbs) and his brother 
           YOUNG LARRY (13, shorter with broader shoulders) locked in a 
           fierce game of basketball. Young Michael’s tongue wags.

                                 YOUNG LARRY
                        Your tongue’s sticking out. You 
                        look like a retarded puppy.

           Young Michael absorbs the taunt then scores on Larry.  

           SUPER: Wilmington, NC — 1975

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Boys!

           They stop playing basketball. Young Michael looks up to see 
           his father approaching with the bat and ball, grinning.

                                 JAMES JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Put that down. 

           A SHORT TIME LATER:

           Young Michael holds the bat, waiting for pitches from James, 
           who stands some forty feet away. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Pops’d give you these looks — a 
                        change in his brow could build you 
                        up or break you down in an instant.

           Young Michael’s eyes focus in concentration as the pitch 
           comes. Young Michael swings with all his might... and misses.

                                 YOUNG LARRY
                        You need Pops to put it on a tee 
                        for you?

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Man, shut your dumb face!
                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Michael! Focus!

           Michael turns back to face James. Gets in a batter’s stance.

                                 JAMES JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Eye on the ball. You ready?

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Yes, Sir. I’m ready.

           James winds up and throws. Michael winds up and CRACKS IT. 
           James beams at Young Michael. Young Michael beams right back, 
           then gazes up into the sky, WATCHING HIS BALL SAIL AWAY as we

           EXT. WOODED AREA OFF MAIN ROAD - DAY

           Two UNIFORMED COPS walk from the side of the road towards an 
           object we can’t yet fully see. It’s eerily quiet, with only 
           vaguely swampy sounds audible.

           SUPER: Fayetteville, NC — August 5, 1993

           As they get closer, we can identify the object: a stripped 
           red Lexus. The back window is smashed. The cops peer inside. 
           There’s blood on the seats.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION OFFICE - NIGHT

           Memorabilia highlights the career of Michael Jordan, NBA 
           legend. MVP trophies; Nike, Gatorade and McDonald’s 
           endorsement posters; NBA championship rings. There’s a framed 
           photo of #23 in the Bulls red and black uniform, holding a 
           championship trophy, hugging James Jordan, now in his 50s.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Pops didn’t give out praise easy — 
                        with him, you had to earn it.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           MICHAEL JORDAN (30, Chicago Bull, three-time NBA champion) is 
           in a fierce game of one-on-one with his baby-faced Bulls 
           teammate B.J. ARMSTRONG (26, black, droll and philosophical) 
           in his lavish private gym. 

           SUPER: Highland Park, IL

           Michael pulls a fadeaway jumper and scores on B.J. His 
           legendarily competitive nature in full effect.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You hit puberty, you’ll catch up.

           B. J. shakes his head and mutters something. Michael flashes 
           his world-famous smile — cocky as hell — and dunks over B.J.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        See that, B.J.? That’s the ‘91 
                        title right there.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        C’mon, man, we’re just shooting 
                        around. This is a friendly game.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No such thing.

           B.J. grits his teeth and drives towards the basket, then 
           pulls up for a shot but Michael stuffs him.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Whoop! That’s ‘92...

           B.J. rolls his eyes as Michael takes the ball back to the top 
           of the key. He hits a long-three pointer.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        And there’s ‘93. Three titles, 
                        three rings, baby!

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Fuck off, I have those same rings.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Got the MVPs to go with ‘em? They a 
                        matching set?
           Out of breath, B.J. scoffs at Michael’s trash-talking.  

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        All right, that’s game.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Oh, we’re not done...

           Before B.J. can respond with another quip, he notices something 
           behind Michael. Sensing this, Michael turns to see his wife, 
           JUANITA JORDAN (34, mixed Latina and black, dignified) standing 
           in the entrance to the gym. She has tears in her eyes. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        But when he was tough, he was tough 
                        for our own good. To prepare us for 
                        life.

           Horror slowly dawns on Michael’s face...

           I/E. SEDAN - DAY

           Michael and his family — Juanita, JEFFREY (5), MARCUS (3), and 
           one-year-old baby JASMINE — are all dressed in funeral clothes. 
           They’re driven by Michael’s driver GEORGE KOEHLER (30s, white). 

           SUPER: Wilmington, NC — August 15, 1993

                                 JEFFREY
                        We’re gonna see Grandma at church?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Yes.

                                 MARCUS
                        And Grandpa!

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... Grandpa’s gone, baby.

           The car pulls up to Rockfish Church. SCORES OF MOURNERS enter.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Because even if he had all the 
                        answers, he knew he wouldn’t always 
                        be around to tell me what they were.

           INT. ROCKFISH CHURCH - DAY

           Two hundred MOURNERS are packed into the pews. Michael, 
           Juanita and the kids, sit with his brother LARRY JORDAN (now 
           32, muscular, still shorter than Michael). 
           They’re with their sister SIS JORDAN (34, ragged, teary), 
           mother DELORIS JORDAN (53), oldest brother RONNIE JORDAN (37, 
           military officer) and baby sister ROSLYN JORDAN (29). 

           Michael speaks at the lectern. His voice now chokes with 
           emotion. We’ve been hearing his eulogy:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... He was five eleven. I’m six six 
                        now, but no matter how tall I 
                        get... He still seems taller.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Michael and his brothers carry their father’s casket. Michael 
           looks up to notice PAPARAZZI taking photos. For a moment, the 
           grief on his face turns to rage, before the photographers are 
           ushered away by other guests.

           INT. DELORIS JORDAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A smaller gathering of more intimate mourners — mostly family 
           and a few other guests — are splayed across couches and 
           chairs. Michael and Juanita are approached by B.J. Armstrong 
           and his agent DAVID FALK (44, white, bald, described once by 
           the New York Times as resembling “a very determined bird”). 

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        How you holding up? Got any sleep?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        We haven’t stopped since the cops 
                        found his car.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        You’ll be able to stop soon. But 
                        that’s what you gotta watch out for.

           Michael flashes Juanita a worried look as his older sibling 
           Sis Jordan wanders over, almost in a fog.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        B.J., David, this is Sis.

                                 DAVID FALK
                        I’m sorry for your loss. Unthinkable.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        But here we are, thinking it. 

           An awkward moment. David tries to smooth things over.
                                 DAVID FALK
                        That was a nice speech, Michael.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        It was great.

           Sis snorts a laughter, tinged by tears. She turns to Michael:

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        What house did you grow up in?

           David and B.J. make a discreet getaway.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael wasn’t trying to —

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        I’m sorry, did I ask for this gold-
                        digger to start lecturing me at my 
                        own father’s funeral?

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (O.S.)
                        Sis — that’s enough. You’re 
                        embarrassing yourself.

           They turn to see Michael’s mother Deloris Jordan — every bit 
           the tough, stoic matriarch — has approached. Sis seems to 
           shrink at her mother’s admonishment — then bursts out crying. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (off Sis crying)
                        You serious with this?

                                 DELORIS JORDAN
                        Michael, let her be. Go cool off.

           Michael looks at Juanita, who nods her agreement with Deloris. 

           INT. DELORIS JORDAN’S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael walks up the stairs, still incensed from his confrontation 
           with Sis. Walking by family photos, he spots his older brothers 
           Ronnie and Larry in an open bedroom — his old bedroom. 

                                 LARRY JORDAN
                        What’s going on down there?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Just Sis and her drama.

           Larry and Ronnie exchange a look: not a shock. 
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 RONNIE JORDAN
                        Your old trophies.

           Indeed, they’re looking at Michael’s impressive childhood 
           trophy collection. Michael looks at one that says “Mr. 
           Baseball” given by the Dixie Association in 1975. HOLD ON 
           MICHAEL’S FACE: something about this gnaws at him...

           INT. JORDAN MANSION LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael is now alone, his eyes glued to a news report. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... Speculation continues that James 
                        Jordan’s murder was retaliation for 
                        Michael Jordan’s gambling debts...

           Impetuously, Michael hurls the remote at the wall. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        James Jordan’s alleged killers have 
                        been apprehended and are awaiting 
                        trial. While there appears to be no 
                        evidence connecting their motives 
                        to Michael Jordan’s gambling, 
                        rumors still persist...

           Trembling slightly, he keeps watching. 

           INT. JORDAN MANSION BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael gives his young sons Jeffrey and Marcus a bath as he 
           sits on the edge of the tub. He’s distracted. Marcus splashes 
           Jeffrey. Some of it gets on Michael.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey hey, stop splashing now!

           Jeffrey splashes Marcus in retaliation. Michael snaps:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Dammit, what’d I just say?

           The kids look at Michael, scared at his outburst. Marcus 
           starts tearing up. Juanita appears in the doorway, holding 
           the baby. Michael looks at her, regret on his face.
                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael, it’s okay, I got it... Go 
                        clear your head, all right?

           INT. JORDAN MANSION BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Michael cuts a solitary figure in the private, regulation-
           size basketball court where he played with B.J. before. He 
           takes shots from around the key. INTERCUT WITH HIS SHOOTING, 
           we FLASH TO:

           - A news report with his father’s picture on screen.

           - His father’s red Lexus, its windshield shattered.

           - His father’s coffin lowered into the ground.

           BACK IN THE GYM: Michael shoots. The ball bangs off the rim. 
           He watches it go, but doesn’t chase after it. His mind is 
           somewhere else. He’s taking no comfort from this.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION PLAYROOM - DAY

           Michael watches the news, oblivious to Jeffrey and Marcus 
           playing with a small basketball, dunking it through the tiny 
           hoop. Juanita tickles baby Jasmine. Based on Michael’s haunted, 
           dazed expression, it is hard to tell how much time has passed.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... Daniel Andre Green and Larry 
                        Martin Demery, killers of James 
                        Jordan, remain in police custody.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael...?

           Michael is transfixed by the news, tuning her out.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Demrey and Green shot James Jordan 
                        before dumping his body in a swamp 
                        across the South Carolina border... 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael!
                             (points to the TV)
                        There’s nothing new on there.

           Michael is about to protest when he hears his kids playing:

                                 JEFFREY
                        I’m Daddy!
                                 MARCUS
                        No, I’m Daddy!

                                 JEFFREY
                        I’m B.J. then!

           CLOSE ON MICHAEL, his mind in decades past, watching his sons 
           in the present. Then he notices something else in the playroom 
           — a PLASTIC BASEBALL BAT AND WHIFFLE BALL. He grabs them.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Jeffrey! Marcus! Put that down.

           The kids drop the basketball. Michael shows them how to grip 
           the bat. As he begins tossing the baseball with his sons, a 
           lightness washes over him. Juanita watches them play, a 
           hopeful smile on her face.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Juanita brushes her teeth in the adjacent MASTER BATHROOM as 
           Michael sits up in bed, contemplative. Juanita clocks 
           Michael’s distraction, and tries to perk him up:

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Y’know, I’m optimistic — soon you’ll 
                        be back at training camp, back being 
                        the best in the world at something; 
                        how many people can say that?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I don’t think I can go back.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... To what?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        The Bulls. The league. Any of it.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Why?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’ve done everything I wanted to 
                        do. There’s nowhere new to go. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        What about a fourth championship?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I just can’t keep doing the same 
                        things. Something’s gotta change. I 
                        mean, I could die tomorrow. 
           She spits on the toothpaste and walks into the BEDROOM. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        People will say it was because of 
                        the gambling. That the NBA forced 
                        you out —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No one’ll believe that. The league’s 
                        making too much money off me. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        They’ll say you’re having a nervous 
                        breakdown —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Not wanting reporters following me 
                        around everywhere means I’m having 
                        a fucking breakdown?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Can you get onboard with this?

           Juanita takes a moment, then composes herself:

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael. I love you and I want you 
                        to be happy, and nothing makes you 
                        happier than playing basketball. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I don’t think that’s true anymore. 
                        I need something else. I need to 
                        reach for something else. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Okay. So what is that?

           Michael smiles but before he can explain we GO TO: 

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - NIGHT

           Michael — in jeans — walks out to throw out the ceremonial 
           first pitch against the Toronto Blue Jays. A wave of FRENZIED 
           APPLAUSE sweeps across the stands for their hometown hero.

           SUPER: American League Championship Series, Game 1: Chicago 
           White Sox vs. Toronto Blue Jays — October 5, 1993
           As Michael makes it to the pitcher’s mound, he smiles wide. 
           WE HOLD ON HIM, gripping the baseball. Grinning, he winds up 
           for the first pitch, and as he releases we GO TO:

           INT. JERRY REINSDORF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           JERRY REINSDORF (57), a portly Jewish kid from Brooklyn 
           turned accountant turned multiple-sports-franchise-owner, 
           watches the Sox game unfolding below. Jerry’s office is 
           covered in memorabilia showcasing his two teams: the Chicago 
           Bulls and the Chicago White Sox. 

           Michael enters, escorted by a TEAM OF SECURITY in gray White 
           Sox jackets. 

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        Nice arm down there.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I used to pitch.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        Mm. Is that right?
                             (to the Security detail)
                        Thanks, guys. Give us a minute?

           Security leaves. Michael and Jerry are alone. Jerry turns 
           intense — or at least his version of intense:

                                 JERRY REINSDORF (CONT’D)
                        You’re underpaid, yes, but not 
                        undervalued. When the next contract 
                        negotiation comes, I guarantee —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Jerry, it’s not about money. I want 
                        to be retired from basketball. 

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        Then what the hell do you want to 
                        do?

           Below, in the stadium, a White Sox player gets a hit. The 
           crowd ROARS below. Michael tilts his head towards the field.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        That. I want to do that.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        Go to ball games? You want to go 
                        White Sox games, believe me, I own 
                        the damn team, you can go to all 
                        the White Sox games you want.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I want to play baseball.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        You were serious about the pitching 
                        thing? I was joshing!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I wasn’t. Threw a no-hitter once.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        When?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        And when was the last time you 
                        played baseball in any kind of 
                        organized capacity?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        When I was sixteen.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        And not since?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Well, I’ve been busy.

           Jerry rubs his eyes: fair point. He looks out to the game below.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        This can’t be a total surprise. 
                        We’ve talked about baseball before.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        You also talked about playing pro 
                        football or pro golf, but I don't 
                        own any of those franchises. I mean, 
                        Christ, baseball? 

           Michael shrugs. He gives Jerry his elusive grin.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF (CONT’D)
                        No, no. I am sorry, but I refuse to 
                        let a basketball player of your 
                        caliber try his hand at —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m burnt out on basketball and I 
                        need a new challenge. All I’m asking 
                        for is a shot. And if you don’t give 
                        it to me —
                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        — Twenty-seven other teams will. 

           Jerry mutters a curse under his breath.

                                 JERRY REINSDORF (CONT’D)
                        Let’s keep baseball between us for 
                        now and get through the press 
                        conference tomorrow. Then we can 
                        talk about quietly getting you into 
                        some cages and go from there. Okay?

           Michael nods. Smiles. Good enough.

           INT. BERTO CENTER HALLWAY - DAY

           Michael — in a gray suit — and Juanita walk down the hallway. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Last chance: you could still call 
                        it off. Stay with your sport.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You with me here or what?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... I’m with you.

           Juanita takes his hand as they walk.

           SUPER: Berto Center Practice Facility — October 6, 1993

           They round a corner to see driver George Koehler, Jerry 
           Reinsdorf, agents David Falk and CURTIS POLK, and NBA 
           commissioner DAVID STERN. Among Michael’s teammates are B.J. 
           Armstrong, SCOTTIE PIPPEN, and TONI KUKOC. Head Coach PHIL 
           JACKSON (48, white, a 6’8” tower of a man, gravelly voice and 
           bushy mustache) with a calm serenity to him, approaches.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        Sure you won’t consider a 
                        sabbatical? 

           Michael laughs and embraces his now-former coach. As Phil chats 
           with Juanita, B.J. looks at Michael with a knowing smirk:

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        You’ll be back.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I won’t.
                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Then you got the two scariest things 
                        imaginable: all the money in the 
                        world, and all the time in the world.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Who said I have all the time?

           As B.J. looks at Michael slightly perplexed, Michael smiles at 
           him: he’s got a secret. But before B.J. can inquire further:

                                 DAVID FALK
                        Michael. They’re ready.

           INT. BERTO CENTER - DAY

           Michael walks with the throng of people out to the practice 
           floor where HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF THE PRESS have gathered in 
           a huge semi-circle. From Michael’s perspective, dozens of 
           flashes go off. WE HOLD ON MICHAEL, as he’s vaguely aware of 
           Jerry Reinsdorf speaking next to him to the assembled media:

                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                        Good morning. I just have a few words 
                        to say, then we’ll hear from Michael. 

           Jerked back to reality, Michael finds himself smiling. 

           I/E. LIMO - DAY

           Michael and Juanita ride away from the Berto Center. On the TV 
           limo TV, reporters recap footage of Michael’s retirement. 
           Juanita grips Michael’s hand. After a quiet moment:

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... “Cut some grass?”

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You said you were going to spend 
                        some time watching the grass grow 
                        and maybe cut it once in awhile.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Doesn’t sound like me.

           She playfully smacks his arm as she curls up to him.
                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        So you’re going to the Minor 
                        Leagues, huh?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (”who’re you talking to?”)
                        Minor Leagues?

           INT. JORDAN MANSION GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Michael lies in a bench press in his expansive home gym, his 
           personal trainer TIM GROVER (white, 30) spotting him.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I want a baseball body.

                                 TIM GROVER
                        Baseball body. Okay.

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - EARLY MORNING

           Michael drives through the private entrance to Comiskey Park. 
           He’s waved through by SECURITY. He’s smiling, almost giddy. 

           INT. COMISKEY PARK INDOOR FACILITY - DAY

           Michael hits alone in the indoor cages underneath Comiskey 
           Park. The Chicago winter is cold, but his mood is warm in 
           here. Aside from a TRAINER, it’s just him.

           FROM MICHAEL’S POV: speeding off the pitching machine, the 
           ball comes towards him. He swings and misses. No matter. But 
           now, it comes again, and as he CRACKS IT -

           — And we’re back in 1975, as Young Michael smiles approvingly 
           at his ball sailing into the pristine North Carolina sky... 

           INT. DELORIS JORDAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael’s mother Deloris Jordan folds up her late husband’s 
           clothes and places them into boxes as she hears a news report:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Wipe that smirk off your face, he’s 
                        not kidding: Michael Jordan is 
                        going to give baseball a shot.

           As Deloris looks up, stunned, we GO TO:
           INT. LARRY JORDAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Larry Jordan and his FAMILY watch TV in their solidly upper-
           middle-class home. They watch a different report.

                                 ANOTHER NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        — The basketball superstar has 
                        secretly been taking batting 
                        practice at Comiskey Park.

           Awed, Larry turns to his WIFE:

                                 LARRY JORDAN
                        ... He’s really doing it.

                                 LARRY’S WIFE
                        What do you think? 

                                 LARRY JORDAN
                        He’s lost his goddamn mind.

           INT. SIS JORDAN’S HOME - NIGHT

           FAVOR THE TV while in the background Sis Jordan argues with 
           her husband, RICK. 

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You telling me what I know is 
                        happening isn't happening? Run 
                        around on me, fine, but do me the 
                        courtesy of not lying about it!

           Sis is so consumed she isn’t even watching the news report:

                                 STILL ANOTHER NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        — Jordan has not formally been 
                        invited to spring training in 
                        Sarasota. White Sox General Manager 
                        Ron Schueler has this to say:

           ON SCREEN: RON SCHUELER (45, white, slightly put-upon 
           countenance) speaks to a gathered press conference, with a 
           CHYRON reading: “Ron Schueler – White Sox General Manager.”

                                 RON SCHUELER (ON TV)
                        Michael’s a remarkable athlete, but 
                        he hasn’t played baseball in 
                        sixteen years. Even if he’s invited 
                        to spring training, the odds of him 
                        making it to a Major League team 
                        are about a million to one. 

           Now we finally ARRIVE AT:
           INT. ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY GYM - DAY

           In contrast to the solitude of the batting cages, Michael now 
           practices in front of a packed media house. For the first 
           time, HE’S DRESSED IN A FULL WHITE SOX UNIFORM. 

           SUPER: Illinois Institute of Technology — February 2, 1994

           As he fields ground balls, we hear his voice:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (PRE-LAP)
                        This is no gimmick. I was a baseball 
                        player before I was a basketball 
                        player. It was my first love. 

           INT. ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY - LATER

           Still in uniform, Michael gives a press conference.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        My goal is to head to spring 
                        training and earn a spot on the 
                        White Sox roster. 

           BACK TO MICHAEL PRACTICING:

           As he hits lobs in netted cages for the gathered media horde, 
           we stay with TWO REPORTERS:

                                 FIRST REPORTER
                        Think the Sox’ll invite him down?

                                 SECOND REPORTER
                        Well, they're a professional sports 
                        organization, so they hate publicity.

           ANGLE ON MICHAEL: he catches the withering looks of the 
           reporters as he misses an easy lob. A look of determination 
           covers his face. As another pitch comes and Michael swings 
           and connects, we MOVE TO:

           EXT. SARASOTA AIRPORT - DAY

           The wheels of a private plane touch down on the runway. 

           SUPER: Sarasota, FL — February 15, 1994

           MOMENTS LATER: Michael gets out of the plane, his driver 
           George Koehler holding his bag. His smile is a mile wide.
           I/E. LIMO - DAY

           George Koehler drives Michael towards Ed Smith Stadium. 

                                 GEORGE KOEHLER
                        Nervous?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Not my first time in a locker room.

                                 GEORGE KOEHLER
                        First time in their locker room.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Just drive the damn car, George.

           George laughs as the car enters the training complex.

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael walks through the clubhouse where the players dress. 
           A few other WHITE SOX PLAYERS have arrived. He nods some 
           greetings. Finally, he arrives at his locker. Inside, his 
           pressed uniform on a hanger — NUMBER 45. He puts it on.

           But as more players enter the clubhouse in sweats and T-
           shirts, and aren’t changing, he realizes: he’s the only 
           player in the clubhouse wearing the full White Sox uniform. 
           It’s like some sort of grade school nightmare come to life. 
           He hears SNICKERING. He looks around, over his shoulder, but 
           can’t spot the source. Then:

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        Yo MJ, can I have your autograph?

           Michael turns to see shortstop OZZIE GUILLEN (30, Venezuelan, 
           compact but sturdy build, heavy accent). Like all the other 
           players, he’s not wearing the full Sox uniform yet.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Ozzie, right? Got something to sign? 

           Ozzie grins and hands him a baseball and pen. Michael signs.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, uh, how come no one else is 
                        wearing their uniform?

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        We just work out first day. No one 
                        told you?

           Michael shakes his head “no” as he hands him back the ball.
                                 OZZIE GUILLEN (CONT’D)
                        All good. You eager to play. So why 
                        you wearing number 45? I thought you 
                        were all number 23 all the way. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        45’s my baseball number. From when 
                        I last played.

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        Yeah. Long time ago, right?

           Ozzie smiles and him and winks as he leaves. While outwardly 
           friendly, the exchange still feels foreboding...

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY

           The White Sox — Major Leaguers and prospects alike — take the 
           field to find the ubiquitous media waiting. 55 cameras, over 
           300 print media and thirteen satellite trucks.

           When Michael emerges from the clubhouse and trots onto the 
           field — now in sweats like everyone else — the FANS lose their 
           minds. There’s signs. There’s screaming. People hold out 
           pictures and balls to autograph. People shout “I want to be 
           like Mike!” There’s crying. It’s Elvis gyrating. It’s a 
           Beatles concert.

           On Michael’s face: “shit.”

           INT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY - THE NEXT DAY

           Now in uniform, Michael is in the outfield, doing fielding 
           drills with the rest of the team, watched by the RABID AND 
           ADORING CROWD. A routine fly ball is hit towards him. Michael 
           gets under it, extends his glove... Waits for it... And 
           catches it.

           The crowd goes BALLISTIC. NBA Finals ballistic. During a 
           drill. Michael catches Ozzie Guillen’s eye. Ozzie calls over:

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        You should take a shit on second 
                        base; they’ll all be like “Look how 
                        amazing that shit is!” 

           A FEMALE FAN climbs over the wall and runs out to the field. 

                                 FEMALE FAN
                        Michael I love you!!!
           Instinctively, Michael steps away from the crazed fan. 
           SECURITY chases her. The rest of the Sox watch and laugh.

           Finally, security catches her. They drag her off, screaming. 
           Michael tries to ignore the spectacle, and spies General 
           Manager Ron Schueler — now in the flesh — with Manager GENE 
           LAMONT (48, white, Sox uniform like his players) watching him 
           from near the dugout. But he can’t hear them say:

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Gene, I want you to give him a lot 
                        of playing time.

                                 GENE LAMONT
                        Why?

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        So he can fail quickly and this 
                        charade can end.

           Ron gives Michael a wave. Michael nods back — able to imagine 
           what they’ve been saying — and recedes to right field, where 
           he tosses a ball back and forth with the center fielder. 

           A BIT LATER, BACK WITH MICHAEL: doing drills like everyone 
           else, he starts to brighten. Then he spots a figure marching 
           towards him from the dugout: hitting coach WALT HRINIAK (white, 
           Sox uniform, looks like he cuts his own hair, thirty seasons’ 
           worth of sun cracking his leathery face). 

           ON SCHUELER AND LAMONT: watching Walt stride towards Jordan.

                                 RON SCHUELER (CONT’D)
                        Christ. Walt’s got thoughts.

                                 GENE LAMONT
                        Well, this should be entertaining.

           IN THE OUTFIELD: Walt marches right up to Michael: 

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        I’m Walt Hriniak. Batting coach. I 
                        don’t know you from a hole in the 
                        wall, and I don’t give a soggy fuck 
                        about basketball or Nike sneakers 
                        or Gatorade soda or any of that 
                        crap. Just one thing I gotta ask 
                        you: are you serious about this?

           Michael looks around the field, at the players watching him, 
           the fans cheering, the doubting Ron Schueler and Gene Lamont. 
           Resolute, he looks Walt straight in the eyes.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Dead. Dead serious.

           Walt sizes him up. After a moment:

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        Got time for you at six AM before 
                        practice. You're late, you don't 
                        hit.

           Walt marches off. Michael shakes his head: “what a kook.”

           INT. SARASOTA BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Michael’s alarm goes off. 5 AM. He gets out of bed.

           INT. SARASOTA KITCHEN - MORNING

           Michael pours himself some cereal and grabs a few donuts. He 
           looks outside at the Florida landscape. Hears the sounds of 
           birds CHIRPING. The sun peeks out over the horizon.

           I/E. MICHAEL’S CORVETTE - MORNING

           Michael drives down the mostly empty road. It’s lighter now, 
           but his headlights are still on. He turns on the radio.

                                 FIRST DJ (ON RADIO)
                        ... 5:38 in the morning here in 
                        Sarasota. Still a few weeks off 
                        from him playing any exhibition 
                        games, but what do you think of the 
                        “Jord-gasm,” Dave?

                                 SECOND DJ (ON RADIO)
                        It’s crazy! He hasn’t played this 
                        sport in fifteen years! Why does 
                        this guy think he can do it?

           Michael listens to the radio and smiles. They doubt him? 
           Good. He pulls to a stop at a red light and catches something 
           in the reflection of the window:

           A double reflection of Michael. But for a split second, it 
           looks like a reflection of Michael and his father James. 

           For a moment, he’s overcome with emotion. The light goes 
           green and Michael drives, choking it back. The double 
           reflection disappears as he moves along the road.
           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM BATTING CAGES - DAY

           Michael and Walt Hriniak are in the covered batting shed. 
           Walt lobs balls to Michael from behind a protected cage:

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        Why aren’t you connecting?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m swinging underneath.

           Walt throws again. Michael connects now, but barely.

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        Your body wants your foot to go 
                        that way. Don’t listen to it or 
                        you’re fucked on the pitch.

           Michael nods, still unsure if he’s got it right. 

                                 WALT HRINIAK (CONT’D)
                        How’s it going with the other guys?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... They’ll be cool when my skills 
                        catch up.

           Walt scoffs as he throws the ball again: he’s not so sure.

           INT. GECKO’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Michael sits in a window booth eating a BLT, SECURITY DETAIL 
           nearby. He's studying the White Sox media guide to learn 
           everyone's name. He puts the book down as he quizzes himself.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Robin Ventura, third base... Jack 
                        McDowell, pitcher...

           REVEAL: People are lined up with their faces pressed to the 
           glass. Some have cameras. Michael does his best to ignore them.

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael walks through the clubhouse, greeting his potential 
           teammates by name as he passes them:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What up Julio?... How’s it going, 
                        Lance? 
           He spots manager Gene Lamont tacking up the STARTING LINEUP 
           FOR THE INTERSQUAD SCRIMMAGE. American League MVP FRANK THOMAS 
           (26, black) and Ozzie Guillen walk by, not bothering to look, 
           knowing their names are on it.

           Michael nervously approaches the list. He scans it for his name. 
           He doesn’t see it. Swallows. This is new for him. He moves to 
           approach Gene Lamont, but nearly runs into someone else looking 
           at the list: Minor League prospect CHARLES POE (23, black, his 
           impressive size offset by an innate vulnerability). 

                                 CHARLES POE
                        You’re not starting either?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Guess not...
                             (trying to recollect the name)
                        ... Charles Poe.

                                 CHARLES POE
                             (”OMG you know my name”)
                        You can call me Charlie, everyone 
                        does. I mean, my friends do. So you 
                        can call me Charlie, if you want.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Okay, Charlie.

                                 CHARLES POE
                        Figured they’d start you, ‘cause 
                        you’re, well, you. Me, I’m happy 
                        just to be here. Got my sights set 
                        on Double A ball in Birmingham. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You were in the Minors last season?

                                 CHARLES POE
                        Yeah. Where we all start, right?

           Michael shrugs, not willing to acknowledge that rule yet. 

                                 CHARLES POE (CONT’D)
                        When was the last time your name 
                        wasn’t on one of those lists?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Sophomore year of high school. Didn’t 
                        make my varsity basketball team.

                                 CHARLES POE
                        Oh yeah, I know. I mean, everyone 
                        knows that story... 
           Michael pounds his glove, psyching himself up.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        And everyone remembers what 
                        happened next.

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY

           Michael has drawn a walk. He’s on first base. As the pitcher 
           throws, Michael hesitates before trying to steal second, but 
           the catcher throws to Ozzie before Michael can make it.

           Awkwardly, Michael tries to dart back to first, but he’s 
           uncertain and gangly, and Ozzie is waiting. Michael leaps 
           into the air, trying to pivot his body, but Ozzie makes the 
           tag easily as Michael’s jump lands him in the dirt.

                                 FIRST BASE UMPIRE
                        Out!

           Michael picks himself up and dusts off his uniform. As Ozzie 
           throws the ball back to the pitcher, he can’t resist:

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        Yo, Air Jordan over here trying to 
                        jump over me like you a Nike logo! 

           Frank Thomas, at first base, shakes his head at Ozzie’s 
           antics. Used to trash-talk, Michael forces a grin. It’s all 
           in good fun... Right?

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - SHOWERS - EVENING

           Michael washes up in the communal clubhouse showers, wincing 
           as he removes bandages from his blistered hands. Ozzie 
           enters. He sees Michael and starts laughing. He sticks out 
           his tongue, emulates the Air Jordan symbol. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Enjoy this now, motherfucker. Next 
                        time I’ll make it back safe.

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        Step onto my diamond, see what 
                        happens. You not gonna be safe for 
                        a long time. 

           Michael eyes Ozzie: enough is enough.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... All right, let’s hear it.
                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        What?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Your beef with me.

           On Ozzie’s face: “fuck it.”

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        ... Why the fuck you here, man? 
                        Baseball some sort of hobby to you?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m serious about this —

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        I’ve been serious about this my 
                        whole life. I work years — decades 
                        — to hit a baseball right. And you 
                        come in and think you can just do 
                        it like it’s fucking fantasy camp 
                        for NBA superstars? You disrespect 
                        my game. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You know what I did for basketball? 
                        Drills. Practice. Conditioning. 
                        Same as here. I know what it takes 
                        to get to where I need to go. 

           Ozzie’s anger turns to a condescending laughter.

                                 OZZIE GUILLEN
                        You know how to win, huh? You gonna 
                        help the White Sox win? 
                             (off Michael’s glare)
                        Fans coming soon. We see if Air 
                        Jordan can still get off the ground.

           Michael brushes by Ozzie, more unnerved than he wishes.

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY

           Tickets are being ripped as fans take their seats. It’s the 
           first full game for paying attendees. Nike products and 
           Jordan gear are being sold in the stands. The ever-present 
           media line the field. Everyone is there to watch Michael 
           Jordan play his first game. 

           SUPER: Ed Smith Stadium, Sarasota FL — March 3, 1994
                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        ... And now batting number 45, 
                        Michael Jordan.

           Michael emerges in uniform, two bats over his shoulder. 
           Again, the crowd goes nuts. For a moment, he seems to get 
           lost in the memories of his basketball days...

                                 UMPIRE
                        45, you’re up.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Thanks, Ref.

           The CATCHER laughs at his flub. Michael notes a REPORTER 
           scribbling notes in the stands. He tosses a bat aside and 
           walks up to the plate. Readies his stance. The pitcher 
           releases. Michael swings, and...

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike one!

           Michael readies again. Fans shriek for him. The pitch comes.

                                 UMPIRE (CONT’D)
                        Strike two!

           Michael looks into the dugout, sees Ozzie’s glare. He shakes it 
           off. Mentally prepares. Eyes on the pitcher and nothing else. 
           The ball comes at him, there for the taking, he swings and...

                                 UMPIRE (CONT’D)
                        Strike three!

           Michael walks towards the dugout. Struck out, but cheered 
           anyway. As he sits down, he sees his teammates whispering 
           with manager Gene Lamont, avoiding eye contact. They quiet 
           down when Michael sits.

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - LATER

           Michael is in right field. Fans scream for him. He watches 
           the pitcher in the distance. The pitch comes —

           CRACK! The batter connects and sends the ball sailing into 
           right field, coming right towards him... Michael gets under 
           it. Holds up his glove. Ready to make the catch and...

           ... He drops it, famous tongue sticking out. He fumbles with 
           the ball. It takes an eternity. Endless cameras click. 
           Finally, miraculously, he manages to throw it to the second. 
                                 JEFFREY (PRE-LAP)
                        Daddy, it’s you.

           Michael tries to ignore the endless camera clicks as we GO TO:

           INT. SARASOTA KITCHEN - EVENING

           Michael and his family — down to Florida for a visit — eat 
           takeout around the sparsely decorated rental. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Look!

           Jeffrey holds the March 14, 1994 Sports Illustrated with 
           Michael flailing at the plate. The text reads “Bag It Michael! 
           Jordan and The White Sox Are Embarrassing Baseball.” As 
           Michael looks at the magazine, we HOLD ON HIS FACE —

           — Then he snatches the magazine away from Jeffrey and angrily 
           hurls it across the kitchen. The baby starts crying. His sons 
           are terrified. Michael immediately regrets his outburst, but 
           the apology lodges in his throat. He hurries outside.

           EXT. SARASOTA PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael stumbles outside, trembling slightly, heart racing. 
           After a beat, Juanita joins him.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        He is five. How old are you? And 
                        who are you so mad at? 

           Michael winces with unarticulated self-disgust.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’ll talk to him — 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You stay. I’ll put the boys down.

           She goes back inside. Michael looks through his kitchen 
           window as Juanita gathers up the kids. They’re scared of him.

           INT. SARASOTA BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael is shirtless. Juanita shaves his head. Their routine.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        When you come back to Chicago with 
                        the Sox, you’ll be around the kids 
                        more. Get used to each other again. 
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m not gonna make the roster.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        But there’s still a month of spring 
                        training left —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I haven’t gotten a hit yet. Half 
                        those guys are watching me waiting 
                        to be amazed; other half’s just 
                        waiting for me to quit.

           She starts to respond sympathetically, but bursts out laughing.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                             (imitates him earlier)
                        “Minor Leagues? I’m not playing in 
                        the Minor Leagues with the common 
                        folk.”

           Michael doesn’t enjoy the razzing but takes it in stride. Her 
           laughter trails off as she grows more contemplative.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you still feel like this is 
                        something you have to do? Baseball 
                        is still the challenge you need?
                             (off his nod “yes”)
                        Then you can’t back down just ‘cause 
                        it’s not like basketball yet.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        If I go to the Minors... I wouldn’t 
                        be based in Chicago. I’d be in 
                        Nashville, maybe Birmingham...

           Not the news she wanted. She focuses on shaving his head.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... Hold still.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No one cares about Minor League 
                        baseball. It’s like it won’t matter.

           Juanita sighs. Swallows her own disappointment:
                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        It’ll matter to you. Matters enough 
                        for you to uproot your life and 
                        disappoint millions of people, and 
                        test the understanding of your very 
                        patient wife. And it’s just for the 
                        summer, right?

           Michael looks up at her in the mirror. They share a smile.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You’re a wise older woman.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Four years! Four years older!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Just like talking to my mama.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        I’m holding a razor and I’ll use it.

           They laugh. He playfully grabs the razor away. 

           INT. SARASOTA HOUSE - JEFFREY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael enters the room. His son Jeffrey is curled up in bed, 
           asleep. He sits on the bed and speaks quietly.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m sorry about before... I know 
                        you think I’m real strong, but I’m 
                        scared every day out there.

           INT. ED SMITH STADIUM BATTING CAGES - EARLY MORNING

           As the sun rises, Michael continues his work with Walt. 

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael changes out of uniform. Ron Schueler calls over:

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Hey Michael? Got a minute?

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

           Michael makes his way to his red Corvette. He throws his 
           duffel bag in the back seat, where he sees Charles Poe, 
           getting into his broken-down 1984 Ford.
                                 CHARLES POE
                        Double A?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah. Birmingham Barons. 

                                 CHARLES POE
                        Uh huh. What’d you hit last year?
                             (off Michael’s confusion)
                        I hit .249 with eleven home runs in 
                        the Florida State League. Slated to 
                        move up to Birmingham this season. 
                        They’re sending you instead. So I 
                        wanna know: what did you hit last 
                        year?

           Michael pauses: shit. How to handle this?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Look Charlie, you and me? We’re the 
                        same; we’re both just trying to 
                        make it to the Majors.

                                 CHARLES POE
                        You really believe that? You’re just 
                        one of the guys? You don’t make it, 
                        you still got a private plane. I 
                        don’t make it, I’m working at Arby’s.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... What can I say? It’s business.

                                 CHARLES POE
                        Business isn’t fair. Life’s not 
                        fair. Sports are supposed to be.

           Charlie walks to his car. Before he gets in his car: 

                                 CHARLES POE (CONT’D)
                        You act like Double A is some kinda 
                        demotion. How do you think the guys 
                        in Birmingham will feel about that?

           Michael watches Charlie drive off.

           A SHORT TIME LATER:

           Michael sits in his car, apprehensive. He opens up the White 
           Sox media guide he was studying earlier to the page that says 
           “Double A Affiliate Birmingham Barons.” There’s a picture of 
           the Barons’ manager: Terry Francona. Now we GO TO MEET HIM:
           EXT. MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE - DAY

           We recognize TERRY “TITO” FRANCONA from the media guide. He’s 
           35, white, humble and self-deprecating. South Dakotan accent, 
           but really, he just sounds like “baseball.” He’s about to 
           become very important to this story. 

           Right now he’s in full Barons uniform, carrying a boxed 
           birthday cake. He moves with obvious pain in his legs and 
           back as he hustles into the house.

           INT. MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Terry enters carrying the cake to find a living room full of 
           seven-year-olds, rushing around, playing games. An array of 
           presents are in a pile. His daughter ALYSSA (7) sprints to him.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Daddy!

           As Alyssa jumps up on him, Terry winces from the strain on 
           his back. Still, he’s genial as he picks her up.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        How’s my birthday girl?

           He spots his wife JACQUE FRANCONA (35, white, blonde, 
           multitasker, not easily rattled), appearing from the kitchen 
           holding a baby. She looks at him, a bit exasperated. 

           INT. FRANCONA KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           With the sound of KIDS running around in the living room, 
           Terry and Jacque huddle over the cake, putting in candles.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Sorry I’m late - line at the bakery 
                        took forever, then I forgot to grab 
                        the candles and - 

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA
                             (”not the first time”)
                        Practice went late.

           Terry hesitates. Busted. The phone RINGS. He reaches for it, 
           but she gently pushes his hand away. They light the candles.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... It’s my second season, I gotta 
                        deliver. Team’s not looking strong. 
                                 JACQUE FRANCONA
                        It’s Double A. Half your team 
                        disappears every year. No one’ll 
                        hold a bad showing against you.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Just worried I’m one lousy record 
                        away from selling real estate.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA
                        Whatever this season throws at you, 
                        you can handle it. Okay?

           He nods, clearly not convinced. The phone RINGS again. He 
           moves to answer it, but she stops him.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        Terry. Let it be. Go enjoy your 
                        daughter’s birthday.

           They peck on the lips. Terry carries the cake into the LIVING 
           ROOM, turning the lights off when we hears the phone RING 
           again and Jacque answering. But now all the kids have 
           gathered, and they all start signing:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA/KIDS
                        Happy birthday to you / Happy 
                        birthday to you...

           But Terry trails off when he sees Jacque has entered, holding 
           the receiver, her previously assured face now turned white. 
           The rest of the kids keep singing as Terry looks at his wife, 
           not yet knowing how his life is about to change...

           I/E. MICHAEL’S PORSCHE - DAY

           Michael drives his car through Birmingham. He passes a road 
           sign that reads “Bible Outlet — 50% Off!”

           SUPER: Birmingham, AL — April 8, 1994

           Michael’s car approaches the Barons’ stadium, the Hoover Met. 
           He sees the fans lined up around the block for tickets. 
           LEGIONS OF PRESS wait as well, cameras snapping pictures of 
           Michael in his car as he goes by.

           INT. BARONS CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael walks into the Minor League clubhouse — while not 
           quite a rinky dink high school team’s locker room, it’s a far 
           cry from the Major League digs at Ed Smith Stadium. 
           The eyes on him are less the “you’re an interloper” vibe he 
           got in Sarasota, and more young men, some barely out of high 
           school, staring at him with full on “Holy shit” expressions. 

           Michael greets outfielder KERRY VALRIE (26, black, stocky, a 
           devoted athlete who just wants to play) and pitcher SCOTT 
           TEDDER (27, white, first baseman, nerdy and wholesome). 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How’re y’all doing?

           He extends his hand for a shake. Kerry takes it and tries to 
           talk but can’t. Scott just starts nervously giggling. 

           INT. TERRY FRANCONA’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Down the hallway, we find Terry with Barons General Manager 
           BILL HARDEKOPF (late 30s, white, clean-cut, currently nervous 
           but trying not to show it). They talk quietly, looking 
           surreptitiously at Michael meeting the Barons down the hall.

                                 BILL HARDEKOPF
                        — And he can’t bat ninth. That 
                        comes from the top.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Uh huh.

           Bill leans in, more than a hint of menace in his voice:

                                 BILL HARDEKOPF
                        You had a good season last year, 
                        Tito. I want you to have a lot more 
                        of them. But that's Michael Jordan, 
                        so let's hope he has no complaints. 
                        You got me?

           Terry nods again. Bill pats his back and heads out. Terry 
           takes a deep breath.

           INT. BARONS CLUBHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Back to Michael, with the stupefied Barons. Scott Tedder 
           attempts small talk:

                                 SCOTT TEDDER
                        You know, I, uh, I played 
                        basketball in college, too.

           They are interrupted by the approach of Terry and his firm 
           handshake.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA 
                        Hey Michael, I’m Terry Francona. 
                        Welcome to Birmingham. Mind if we 
                        chat for a minute in my office?

           INT. TERRY FRANCONA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Michael and Terry enter his office. Michael notices Terry’s 
           wallet, stuffed with cash, sitting on the desk.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Ever worry someone’ll take that?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Double A players earn $850 a month. 
                        Someone needs a little help, they 
                        always put it back. Managers don’t 
                        make much more, so it’s mostly just 
                        ones in there. But, uh, if you need 
                        some cash...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah, man, I’m all right.

           They take a seat. A moment goes by. Terry is nervous.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        So, uh, you settling in all right?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah. Family’s moving down soon.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Great. Great. So, I, uh, I’m not 
                        gonna ask why you’re here — I 
                        figure you’re getting that question 
                        a lot and it’s not my business — 
                        but I am gonna have to treat you 
                        like everyone else. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Good. That’s what I want. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Okay. Any other questions for me?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How do we travel?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        From game to game?
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I was looking at the schedule, some 
                        stadiums are six, seven hundred 
                        miles away. Do we fly?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        We take the bus.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Is it a nice bus?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Not really. Breaks down a lot. Whole 
                        thing kinda smells like the bathroom.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hmm.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Not what you’re used to.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No, but... Maybe there’s something 
                        we could do about that?

           EXT. HOOVER MET PARKING LOT - THE NEXT DAY

           Michael, Terry, and the other 25 BARONS watch as FOUR 
           DIFFERENT LUXURY BUSES pull up into the parking lot. Most of 
           the players remain starstruck around Michael.

           MOMENTS LATER: Bus company owner JIM THRASHER shows off the 
           buses. He points to the fanciest bus.

                                 JIM THRASHER
                        This is the model the rock bands use.

           Michael steps in and motions to Terry to join him IN THE BUS. 
           Two luxurious seats in front, with another ten seats in back. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What do you think?
                             (off Terry’s raised eyebrow)
                        Hey man, it’s a bus, right?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I know where you’d sit. Not sure if 
                        the rest of the team fits.

           As Michael contemplates this concern, we GO TO:
           INT. BARONS BUS - DAY

           A nice but not extravagant bus. Enough seats for the whole 
           team. Four TVs. Room to stretch out. A definite upgrade from 
           usual Minor League travel. Michael and Terry stand in front.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How about this?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Doesn’t smell like shit, so yeah, 
                        checks all my boxes.

           Michael chuckles. He likes this guy. 

           I/E. BARONS BUS - DAY

           Michael sits in the bus playing poker with Kerry Valrie, Scott 
           Tedder, and shortstop GLENN DISARCINA (23, white, ambitious, 
           brother is a Major Leaguer), and pitcher BARRY JOHNSON (26, 
           white, angular, chip on his shoulder). About $20 in the pot. 

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        - My brother plays for the Angels 
                        and even he’s jealous of this bus.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        I’ll raise. Two bucks.

           Barry throws some more money in. Michael doesn’t hesitate.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Another four on top.

           IN FRONT OF THE BUSS:

           Terry sits next to hitting coach MIKE BARNETT (40, white, 
           seasoned, earnest) as he counts out bills.

                                 MIKE BARNETT
                        Looking to get in on that action?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Ha. Per diems...
                             (eyes Michael)
                        Looks like he’s fitting in okay...

                                 MIKE BARNETT
                        Uh huh...

           As Terry stands up to distribute the per diems, we 

           RETURN TO MICHAEL AND THE CARD GAME:
           Michael shows his cards:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Straight to the King.

           Glenn and Kerry throw down their cards. Scott is sheepish.

                                 SCOTT TEDDER
                        Uh... I got a flush. Sorry?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Oh kiss my ass, motherfucker!

           Scott isn’t sure what to do, still nervous around Michael.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, go on! Fucking take it!

           Scott collects the money. Terry walks by, distributing 
           envelopes. He hands them to everyone, including Michael.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Your per diem. Sixteen bucks.

           Terry continues on the bus, distributing the envelopes.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        Well, that cleans me out...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Oh, we’re not done. 

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                             (terse)
                        He doesn’t have any more money —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (intensely competitive)
                        We’re not done. This bus ride’s 
                        another five hours, and y’all need to 
                        give me a shot to win back my money.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Not if he doesn’t want to.

           Barry won’t back down. Michael looks at him, surprised, a 
           moment away from pissed. Glenn tries to make peace:

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        Let’s keep playing. Kerry, I’ll 
                        spot you.

           Michael stares down Barry. Okay, so this is how it is.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I can spot him. 

           Michael reaches in his wallet — besides his per diem, all he 
           has is hundreds; literally thousands in cash. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... Can anyone make change?

           The other player’s eyes bulge. Michael realizes his faux pas 
           a moment too late. 

           ANGLE ON TERRY: he catches this moment. Mike Barnett noticed, 
           too. Mike raises an eyebrow: “is this Michael fitting in?”

           EXT. LA QUINTA MOTEL - NIGHT

           The Barons Bus pulls up to the motel parking lot. The players 
           get off, carrying their own bags, Michael among them. Some 
           PRESS are already waiting, shoving a mic in Michael’s face: 

                                 REPORTER
                        Michael! How’s staying in motels?

                                 ANOTHER REPORTER
                        Did you really buy the team the 
                        Jordan Cruiser? We hear that’s what 
                        you’re calling it.

           Some of the Barons - including Barry - eye the press warily. 
           Michael barely acknowledges them as he heads inside.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Just trying to get some sleep, fellas.

           INT. LA QUINTA MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael walks into his motel room. Tosses his bag on the floor. 

           IN THE BATHROOM:

           Michael gets in the shower. Turns it on. The water is 
           freezing. Michael YELPS and nearly falls over.

           BACK IN THE ROOM: 

           Michael lies back on the bed — at 6’6”, his feet hang over 
           the edge. He turns on a baseball game. Watches intently.

                                 FANS (PRE-LAP)
                        We want Michael! We want Michael!
           EXT. JOE ENGEL STADIUM - DAY

           The park is packed. FANS line the stands, as well as the 
           omnipresent NEWS MEDIA. Michael takes the plate to CHEERING... 
           And one HECKLER, who calls to him:

                                 HECKLER
                        You betting on this game, Michael?

           Michael ignores the taunt. He stares down the Lookouts’ 
           pitcher, JOHN COURTRIGHT (23, white). Flop-sweating like 
           crazy. The pitch goes off course and nearly hits Michael and 
           sends him sprawling to the dirt.

                                 JOHN COURTRIGHT
                        Oh no! Oh no! I’m sorry!

           Michael shakes it off, and prepares himself to hit again. 
           Courtright throws again, Michael swings, and —

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike one! 

           The catcher throws back. Michael tries to block out the noise 
           of the fans. Courtright comes in with a fastball and —

                                 UMPIRE (CONT’D)
                        Strike two!

           Michael looks into the dugout, sees his new manager Terry 
           Francona. Terry gives him an encouraging nod.

           The count is 1-2. Courtright throws again and — 

           CONTACT! A drive down the third base line. Michael runs to 
           first base, beating the throw. He suppresses a smile, trying 
           not to show his pride or relief amidst the CHEERS.

           IN THE DUGOUT: One of the players, Barry Johnson watches the 
           ecstatic reception Michael’s getting and mutters to Terry:

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        This is a circus. He’s undermining -

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        That’s five dollars.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        What? C’mon, Tito —

           Terry addresses the whole team:
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Anyone uses the word “circus” in 
                        regards to our right fielder owes 
                        me five dollars!

           ON MICHAEL: Photos flash of him on base. But as he looks over 
           at the dugout, he senses he’s not beloved by his teammates...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael folds his long legs in the tub as he talks on the phone. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Tell Marcus to wash his neck.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. JORDAN MANSION BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Juanita gives her sons a bath as she talks on the phone.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Daddy says wash your neck.

                                 MARCUS
                        Is Daddy washing his?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        He wants to make sure he’s not 
                        alone.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Marcus! This is the sound of me 
                        setting a good example!

           Separated by hundreds of miles, the family laughs together.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Now the Jordans in both time zones have gotten out of the 
           tub. Michael sits in a towel, while Juanita puts pajamas on 
           the boys. Marcus holds up the phone as Michael talks:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        You hear about your Daddy’s hitting 
                        streak? Seven games and counting.

                                 MARCUS
                        We had bubbles in the tub!
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah, but Marcus: .327, that’s like 
                        getting a hit one every three at-
                        bats, that’s real hard to do.

                                 MARCUS
                        Jeffrey still has bubbles on him!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (sighs)
                        Put your big brother on.

           Marcus passes the phone to Jeffrey.

                                 JEFFREY
                        We’re going to the zoo tomorrow. 
                        Can you come?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Aw, Jeff, I got a game. But you guys 
                        will be coming down here and I’ll 
                        take you to the zoo in Birmingham.

           Jeffrey seems unsettled by this. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        We’re moving to Birmingham?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You understand why, right?

                                 JEFFREY
                        ... You gotta play baseball.

           Watching Jeffrey struggle to be tough, Juanita’s heart breaks.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Now, thing about my strike zone is —

                                 JEFFREY
                        — Here’s Mom.

           Jeffrey hands the phone back to his mother.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You sure they have a zoo in 
                        Birmingham?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        They couldn’t get enough baseball 
                        when we were playing before. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Easier if you’re in the same room.
           An awkward silence as Juanita struggles to put the PJs on.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        So, uh, how’s it going with the 
                        guys on the team?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Good. Real good.

           We move from Michael’s lie over to:

           INT. CAROLINA MUDCATS CLUBHOUSE - TERRY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Terry has the lineup and notes on the table, but his 
           attention is focused on a tiny television:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Reports are coming in that the Jordan 
                        Cruiser costs upwards of $350,000. 
                        Many are asking: is this extravagant 
                        bus just another example of Jordan 
                        not being a fit for baseball?

           Terry spots Michael walking through the clubhouse, and sticks 
           his head out:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Hey, 45? You missed the weight 
                        training session today.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Sorry. Had a call with Nike.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Yeah, I gotta fine you $25.

           Is Terry joking? He’s not. Michael reaches for his wallet.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Anyone notice I wasn’t there?

           Terry hesitates. Michael winces, frustrated with himself. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Apologies if I’m overstepping, 
                        but... if you want to be a regular 
                        guy on the team, maybe buying a new 
                        bus and calling it the “Jordan 
                        Cruiser” isn’t the way to go.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I didn’t come up with that name, the 
                        papers did. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT'D)
                        And I don’t want to be on some old 
                        bus that breaks down by the side of 
                        the road. In the South.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I get that, I do, but... Half these 
                        guys had posters of you in their 
                        bedrooms growing up. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        That doesn’t matter here.

           Terry looks at him: “of course it does.”

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        They’re not just gonna forget who 
                        you are. At least not right away.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        So what am I supposed to do about it?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Don’t try to make ‘em.

           ON MICHAEL, absorbing Terry’s sentiment. 

           INT. CAROLINA MUDCATS CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           Their uniforms dirty, the Barons undress by their lockers as 
           Michael listens as catcher ROGELIO NUNEZ (23, Dominican, 
           broken English, worn-out cleats) describes the Barons’ plight: 

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        He... throw curve... No hit...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You got a dictionary, Rogelio?

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        ... Si?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Study up on baseball terms. Every 
                        one you spell right, that’s $100.

           Some of the player laugh. Rogelio’s eyes light up.

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        What word I learn spell money with?

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        How about “cleats?” Like, “Rogelio’s 
                        got some sorry-looking cleats.”
           Michael notices Rogelio’s shoes — they do look worn.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How ‘bout “streak?” As in, “we’re 
                        on a losing streak.”

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        Or, “45’s on a hitting streak.”

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Tell that to Sports Illustrated. So 
                        we all chip in? $100 per word?

           Now the Barons look nervous. Barry’s first to speak up:

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        $100 is a lot of money to us.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m fucking with you all.

           Relieved laughter from the Barons. Michael turns to Rogelio:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Streak. S-T-R-E-A-K.

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        S-T-R-E-A-K. “Streak.”

           Michael pats Rogelio’s shoulder. As he walks away, he notices 
           the worn-out cleats in Rogelio’s locker. Gets an idea...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (PRE-LAP)
                        I need 26 pairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           A baseball game is on TV. Michael cradles the phone:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        All black Air Jordan cleats... Yeah, 
                        sent to Orlando. Thanks, Fred.

           He hangs up. Smiles. Watches the baseball game. We MOVE TO:

           INT. ORLANDO CUBS CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael, his uniform dirty from the game they just played, 
           enters the clubhouse to find his teammates all trying on 
           their new Air Jordans. All eyes go to Michael.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’ve been saying, I’m just like all 
                        of you.

           Looks of confusion. He points to his Air Jordan shoes.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Got the same kicks and everything.

           A confused silence. No one knows what to say. Then:

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        I like my shoes just fine.

           Barry stares down Michael, who looks away: was this a mistake?

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        Well I think these are a fuck-ton 
                        nicer than my shitty shoes.

           Scott Tedder starts laughing, but soon the rest of the 
           players join in. Glenn DiSarcina laces up his shoes and heads 
           back out towards the field.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Game’s over... Where are you going? 

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        To try ‘em out.

           Glenn grabs his glove and gestures to the team — wearing 
           their new cleats, THE WHOLE TEAM happily all run towards the 
           exit, still wearing their dirty game uniforms. Barry Johnson 
           lingers, then reluctantly follows.

           EXT. TINKER FIELD - NIGHT

           Michael watches as the entirety of the Birmingham Barons 
           spills into the dark and nearly empty ballpark...

           - A player practices a slide into second base, testing out 
           the new cleats.

           - A bat materializes in Kerry Valrie’s hand as catcher 
           Rogelio Nunez crouches behind home plate. 

           - Someone finds the lighting booth and turns on the 
           floodlights, to cheers from the teammates.

           - Players instinctively find their positions on the field. A 
           scrimmage commences, almost out of nowhere.

           At the sidelines, Michael turns to Terry:
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Guess they really like those 
                        cleats, huh?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        They just want an excuse to play.

           Michael watches the younger players, awed and inspired.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        ... Go ahead.

           Michael smiles and runs to join his teammates on the field.

           I/E. BARONS BUS - EVENING

           The bus speeds down another long highway drive. Michael 
           debates Glenn DiSarcina, Scott Tedder and Rogelio Nunez (who 
           is excited to participate despite his limited vocabulary). 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Larry Bird? Larry Bird is the greatest 
                        basketball player of all time? 

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        Pound for pound Bird could play!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah, I actually played him!

           As Michael emphatically leaps up to make his point, his head 
           blocks the TV (playing Friends or something else very 1994.)

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                             (calls out)
                        Yo, move your big-ass head, rookie! 
                        You’re blocking the TV!

           Jordan squats down and returns to the conversation.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No disrespect to Larry, but —

                                 SCOTT TEDDER
                        I think 45’s jealous ‘cause Bird 
                        and the Celtics beat him in ‘86.

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        He beat you, yes!

           Michael pops up again, passionately:
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I scored 63 points that game!

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                             (calls out to Michael)
                        — Yo, rookie! Sit the fuck down —

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        — You lost! ‘Cause you didn’t pass!

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        Eres el mejor jugador de baloncesto 
                        del mundo pero no recuerdas los 
                        fundamentos!

           On the TV, the famously cheesy “Be Like Mike” Gatorade 
           commercial starring Michael Jordan comes on. 

                                 GATORADE COMMERCIAL (ON TV)
                        Sometimes I dream / That he is me / 
                        You've got to see that's how I 
                        dream to be

           The already rowdy crowd EXPLODES WITH LAUGHTER. Michael is 
           cracking up as he yells to no one in particular:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        All right, turn this shit off!

           Through riotous giggles, Glenn and Larry chime in:

                                 GLENN DISARCINA/SCOTT TEDDER
                        I dream I move, I dream I groove / 
                        Like Mike / If I could Be Like Mike

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Ah fuuuuuuckk! Fuck all of you!!!

           This commercial works great for a family-friendly image, but 
           not as well for a horde of rowdy, beer-swilling ballplayers. ON 
           TV, Michael joyously dribbles basketballs with kids. All the 
           ruckus wakes Terry, who’d been napping in front of the bus:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... What? What’s happening?

                                 GLENN/SCOTT/KERRY VALRIE
                        I wanna be like Mike! Be like Mike! 
                        Be like Mike!

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        I want be like Mike!

           Crying with laughter, Michael pleads to Terry across the bus:
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Terry, man, c’mon!

                                 WHOLE TEAM
                        Again I try / Just need to fly / For 
                        just one day if I could be that way 

           But Terry grins and just sings with the rest of them. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA & TEAM
                        I dream I move / I dream I groove / 
                        Like Mike / If I could be Like Mike!

           Finally beaten, Michael joins in, singing louder than anyone:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN & TEAM
                        I wanna be, I wanna be Like Mike!

           The rowdiness, already at a ten, goes to an eleven:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN & TEAM (CONT’D)
                        Like Mike, if I could be Like Mike

           Filled with happy laughter, the bus rides the empty highway.

           I/E. BARONS BUS - NIGHT

           Hours after the “Like Mike” sing-along, the bus is now quiet. 
           Dark miles of empty roads ahead of them. Players sleep or 
           listen to CD players. Michael and Terry play Yahtzee up front.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Why do they call you Tito?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        That’s my dad’s name. He played in 
                        the Majors. When I came up, that’s 
                        what everyone called me. I still 
                        introduce myself as Terry, but my 
                        friends call me Tito.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You don’t mind?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        No. He’s a great dad and was a hell 
                        of a ballplayer. It’s an honor.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        My father played ball, too. Just a 
                        short time in semi-pro. Probably why 
                        he started me on baseball so young.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        He wanted you to follow in his 
                        footsteps, huh?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Oh yeah. Same with yours?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        No, he never pushed me. Taught me 
                        everything, though. He took me on 
                        the road when I was eleven. I met 
                        all kinds of folks; Ted Williams, 
                        Reggie Jackson. Best summer of my 
                        life. After that, pretty much all I 
                        ever wanted was to play baseball.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Were you any good?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... Nothing to write home about. 
                        Hit .274, bounced around a few 
                        teams for a few years. Journeyman, 
                        really. Got sent down to Triple A, 
                        that was it. I was taking classes 
                        to sell real estate, but then thank 
                        God a few years ago the White Sox 
                        called saying they needed a hitting 
                        instructor for the Gulf Coast 
                        League. Now I’m about to be 
                        interviewed by Tom Brokaw on NBC 
                        next week.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        So what’s next? Manage in the 
                        Majors? Win a World Series?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Uh... One thing at a time.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Well, Tito... I guess this is your 
                        shot.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Yours too, Michael.

           Michael nods. A nice moment. Then:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get some sleep.
           Terry closes his eyes and leans on the window. Michael 
           remains awake. He pulls out a crossword puzzle. He starts 
           working on it, but then he LOOKS AGAIN AT TERRY AS WE 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BALLPARK - DAY - 1975

           JAMES JORDAN. He sits in the stands of a Little League 
           stadium, the only black parent amongst a sea of white ones. 

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Which one is yours?

           The White Parent, not eager to talk to James, points to one 
           of the kids on the field.

           Young Michael, in uniform, jogs over to James. James uses the 
           opportunity to exit the non-conversation with his neighbor.

           SUPER: Little League World Series, Georgia — 1975

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        They said anyone who hits a home 
                        run gets a steak.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        You hit a home run, I’ll buy you 
                        another one. Earn yourself two steaks.

           Young Michael beams — he loves the approval from his father.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Yes, Sir!

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BALLPARK - DAY - LATER - 1975

           The pitcher throws. Young Michael swings and: 

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike two!

           Young Michael steps back. Looks at his father in the stands. 
           His father nods at him: “You can do this.” Young Michael nods 
           back. The pitcher winds up and throws and —

           CRACK — the ball sails through the sky; going, going, gone! 

           Young Michael rounds the bases, the hero of his team, and sees 
           his father beaming. James turns to the White Parent next to him:
                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        That’s my son!

           The White Parent slaps James on the back. On the diamond, 
           Young Michael happily points to his father in the stands as 
           we hear the stately voice of NBC anchor TOM BROKAW:

                                 TOM BROKAW (PRE-LAP)
                        Some people would say, Michael 
                        Jordan, given all that you've 
                        achieved, what you're doing now is 
                        just running away from 
                        responsibility, running away from 
                        the idea of growing up. 

           EXT. HOOVER MET STADIUM - DAY

           Michael — wearing stylish-for-the-90s overalls — sits with 
           NBC Now anchor Tom Brokaw in the middle of the field. Terry 
           and some players linger, watching the spectacle. 

                                 TOM BROKAW
                        You're gonna always have to play a 
                        boy's game the rest of your life.

           Michael glances over to his teammates watching him.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        We’re all kids within ourselves. 
                        I'm trying to fulfill the last kid 
                        thing I have inside of me. After 
                        this, I'm going to live through my 
                        kids as my father lived through me.

                                 TOM BROKAW
                        You ever shoot hoops anymore?

           As Michael contemplates his response, MOVE AHEAD IN TIME TO:

           INT. GREYSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (ON TV)
                        I really don't get the urge to. 

           Michael and Juanita — in town for a visit — watch the NBC 
           interview on their couch. Terry — enjoying himself but 
           slightly awed — sits on a chair. There are empty soul food 
           containers. They all have beers.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Aw, look at those overalls! You 
                        look just like a huge Marcus!
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You dissing my wardrobe?!

           He tickles her affectionately.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Stop! You’re gonna make me miss it!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You see me on TV enough!

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        But I haven’t seen Terry yet!

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You wouldn’t miss much, believe me.

           Terry smiles, watching them. Juanita checks her watch.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Shoot, I’m gonna miss the plane. 
                        Terry, glad to meet you. You really 
                        put a dent in those greens.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        My greatest talent...

           Juanita and Terry shake hands, but Michael wraps his arms 
           around her waist.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Your mom can take the kids another 
                        day...

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Michael...

           The playful mood dissipates.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Don’t know why we’re even arguing 
                        over a couple hours. You all 
                        should’ve moved out here by now. 
                        That’s why I got this big house.

           Terry and Juanita share a brief moment of eye contact.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I should get going, too...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No one has to go anywhere.
                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Can we talk about this later?

           Michael’s face says no. Juanita pulls Michael aside. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... I can't move the kids to 
                        Birmingham. My family’s in Chicago. 
                        Our lives are there. This isn’t like 
                        the NBA, where you’re only gone for 
                        a night or two. You're on the road 
                        for weeks, on a bus twelve, fourteen 
                        hours a stretch.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        The other wives do it. They move 
                        here, take jobs at the mall.

           She looks at him: “C’mon.” He looks at Terry, who’s now 
           squirming. Michael grows embarrassed as he harshly whispers: 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        This is bullshit. I had this worked 
                        out —

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You think the world will 
                        accommodate everything you want 
                        just 'cause you want it?

           She leans over, kisses his forehead. He walks her to the door.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call when I’m back in Chicago.
                             (louder)
                        Bye, Terry. Nice meeting you.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You, too.

           She kisses Michael goodbye. He takes her bags outside. Terry is 
           still watching TV, which he hears coming from the other room:

                                 TOM BROKAW (ON TV)
                        Although he is a big draw, not 
                        everyone is happy about Jordan’s 
                        presence — including some of his 
                        teammates.

           He comes back to the TV: Barry Johnson in the locker room.
                                 BARRY JOHNSON (ON TV)
                        I work my whole life for this, then a 
                        guy can come right in and get the same 
                        opportunities just ‘cause he’s famous?

           Michael’s blood boils. Terry sighs and shakes his head.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        His hits are weak, little dribbles 
                        barely hits at all. The pitchers are 
                        starstruck. What happens when 
                        they're not anymore? 

           I/E. MICHAEL’S PORSCHE - DAY

           Michael, pissed, drives to the stadium. Storm clouds are 
           gathering. The ubiquitous MEDIA are in raincoats and hold 
           umbrellas at the ready. 

           INT. BARONS CLUBHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael enters the clubhouse. Rogelio approaches, excited:

                                 ROGELIO NUNEZ
                        Streak. S-T-R-E-A-K. Streak. 

           Quiet, Michael hands Rogelio $100 from his wallet. He spots 
           Barry Johnson changing. Locks eyes with him. Michael marches 
           over to Barry, angry as hell.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Look, 45, I didn’t —

           Michael SLAMS Barry into a locker. Scott Tedder looks up:

                                 SCOTT TEDDER
                        Whoa!

           Barry charges back at Michael, and before long, the two are 
           brawling in the locker room. Kerry Valrie, Glenn DiSarcina 
           and Terry pull them apart, ad-libbing “stop,” “don’t,” etc.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Michael! My office.

           INT. TERRY FRANCONA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael is still shaking with anger. Terry is pissed, too.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You saw what he said about me!
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Press has been saying that for 
                        months! Barry Johnson’s not the 
                        first! Who the hell you so mad at?

           Michael simmers.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        You’re the biggest star in the world 
                        and you got reporters camped out every 
                        day waiting for you to give them a 
                        story. You can’t be throwing punches 
                        in the clubhouse. Looks bad for you.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You mean bad for you.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Damn right! You’re not only one with 
                        something to lose, here! Someone 
                        writes this up, talks to the press, 
                        who you think is gonna answer for it 
                        with the Barons? The living legend 
                        or the washed-up ballplayer? 

           Outside the window, it’s starting to rain. Terry softens.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        Look, Barry’s your teammate. He 
                        shouldn’t be spewing that crap on 
                        TV. But you’re on a thirteen-game 
                        hitting streak. Keep it up, prove 
                        ‘em wrong. 

           Michael nods. The rain starts coming harder.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        They’re gonna call a rain delay. 
                        We’ll be here awhile.

           ON MICHAEL’S FACE: a sense of foreboding. Terry’s words seem 
           like an ominous harbinger...

                                                           BEGIN SEQUENCE: 

           VARIOUS BALLPARKS: Over a number of different games in 
           different Minor League ballparks, wearing home and away 
           uniforms, Michael strikes out. Again and again. Over and 
           over. A bat goes flying after a bad swing. The repetitive 
           nature of this sequence goes on longer than it should. 
           Imagine how he feels.

           IN A DUGOUT: Terry and batting coach Mike Barnett watch 
           Michael strike out.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        They figured out he can’t hit a 
                        curveball.

           VARIOUS BALLPARKS: Strikeouts. Errors in right field. Batting 
           practice. Blistered hands and bloody bandages. Cow-milking 
           contests between innings. MASCOTS in ragged outfits.

           VARIOUS MOTELS: Shitty continental breakfasts. Dreary 
           curtains. Gawking and double-takes from MOTEL STAFF. Saggy 
           mattresses, cheap bed-frames. Showers without hot water.

           BARONS BUS: Long nights. Michael more isolated from 
           teammates. Watching the highway go by from bus windows. 

           VARIOUS BALLPARKS: More strikeouts. Over and over. In the 
           stands, fewer and fewer fans turn out. More empty seats.

           IN ANOTHER DUGOUT: Terry and Mike watch Michael at the plate.

                                 MIKE BARNETT
                        Figured out he can’t hit a breaking 
                        ball either.

           VARIOUS CLUBHOUSES: Michael talks to the gathered PRESS as 
           his teammates look on, more used to the everyday hoopla.

           YET ANOTHER DUGOUT: Mike and Terry watch Michael struggling.

                                 MIKE BARNETT (CONT’D)
                        Think it’s Barry that rattled him?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        No, something else. Something deeper. 

           VARIOUS BALLPARKS: We watch more of Michael’s strikeouts as 
           we hear Terry and Mike discussing him:

                                 MIKE BARNETT (V.O.)
                        He’s in the cage every morning, 
                        then the curveball machine, then 
                        team BP, then cages again before 
                        and after the game. What more are 
                        we supposed to do for this guy?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (V.O.)
                        He needs something we can’t give him.

           BACK TO TERRY AND MIKE IN THE DUGOUT:

                                 MIKE BARNETT
                        What’s that?
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Time.

           ON MICHAEL: He strikes out again. Throws his bat in frustration.

                                                               END SEQUENCE

           EXT. HOOVER MET STADIUM - EARLY MORNING

           Michael emerges from the dugout and walks towards the cages. 
           From a distance, he spots a lone figure inside, decisively 
           driving the balls into the net from the pitching machine: 

           It’s TERRY. Michael approaches the cages, impressed by this 
           display. Terry notices Michael approaching and exits the cage.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You always get here early and I 
                        wanted to check in. Been kind of a 
                        slog lately. 

           Dour, Michael enters the cage with his bat. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        I know they’ve kicked you around in 
                        the papers.

           The balls start coming. Michael swings as he talks:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Someone’s always saying I can’t do 
                        something. Said I couldn't win 
                        championships because I didn't make 
                        my team better? Got us three rings. 
                        Said I was only offense? Made the 
                        All Defensive team six years 
                        straight. Someone says no, I make it 
                        yes. I may be a rookie but I still 
                        bet on me every time. You feel me?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Yeah, yep, I feel you.
                             (mumbles)
                        ... Didn’t ask for one of your Nike 
                        commercials, but...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What was that?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You started the season off pretty 
                        hot. If you got spooked, that happens 
                        sometimes —
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You saying it’s mental? I’m honing 
                        my mind/body connection. At first, 
                        when I saw a ball come off the bat, 
                        I spent too long — even a fraction 
                        of a second — deciding how to chase 
                        it. Now I know what to do. My 
                        batting average doesn’t matter. I 
                        don’t even know it anymore. My 
                        mental game’s where I need it to be.  

           Michael swings again. He misses. Frustration bubbling...

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Just saying it’d be understandable. 
                        No other Minor Leaguer has ever 
                        faced this kind of pressure. I 
                        understand as much as anyone 
                        wanting to do right by your dad, 
                        but —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You talking about my father?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I just meant —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I can handle pressure. Who are you, 
                        anyway? Some washed up ballplayer? 
                        Some Double A fucking manager?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... Pretty much, yeah.

           Michael returns to hitting, indicating that their “chat” is 
           over. Terry hesitates uncomfortably before walking off.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey, Terry? I don’t need your pity.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You don’t have it.

           Michael watches him go, then goes back to hitting.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael soaks his sore elbow in ice. He looks at the clock: 
           4:13 AM. He can’t sleep. Impetuously, he grabs his phone and 
           dials as we CUT TO:
           INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

           A snooty CONCIERGE answers the phone.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Ritz Carlton New York... I’m sorry, 
                        Sir, I cannot confirm that the 
                        Bulls or Mr. Armstrong are here...
                             (slightly testy)
                        And who would I say is calling?
                             (his face goes white)
                        ... One moment, Mr. Jordan.

           INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           B.J. Armstrong, asleep in a luxury king bed, is groggy:

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        ... Hello?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           We notice the alarm clock now reads 5:03 AM. Michael and B.J. 
           talk from their very different hotel rooms.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        ... You playing Scottie’s charity 
                        game in November? 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You’re just trying to get me to come 
                        back so you can prove me wrong.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        I said you’d come back to the league. 
                        I’m talking Chicago Stadium’s last 
                        game before they tear it down. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        United Center looks like a mall.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Exactly. Gotta send your old haunt 
                        out in style. Remind yourself what 
                        winning big feels like.

           Michael considers, tempted. Then: 
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I don’t know what I’d get outta 
                        putting on basketball shorts again. 
                        Seriously, you should see these 
                        Minor League guys. Most of them 
                        won’t make the Majors, they’re just 
                        doing it for love of the game. 
                        Playing with them, I’m having the 
                        time of my life. 

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        So why you calling me at 4 AM when 
                        I got a playoff game the next day?

           ON MICHAEL: he doesn’t have a good answer.

           INT. MEMPHIS CHICKS CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           As Michael and the Barons get ready, they watch the Chicago 
           Bulls in the playoffs with the New York Knicks. The distinct 
           voice of NBC announcer Marv Albert blares from the TV:

                                 MARV ALBERT (ON TV)
                        ... Pippen for three! No! Down to 
                        twenty seconds, with New York 
                        leading by ten...

           Michael winces, watching his former teammates lose. 

                                 MARV ALBERT (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        It has been a wonderful run for the 
                        Chicago Bulls franchise this season 
                        despite the loss of Michael Jordan...

           ON THE TV, Michael watches his friend B.J. Armstrong walk off 
           the court. All eyes in the clubhouse are on him. Michael 
           shakes his head, frustrated. Then he turns off the TV.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        All right, y’all. Game time.

           Off Michael’s emboldened face, we GO TO:

           EXT. TIM MCCARVER STADIUM - NIGHT

           Michael swings and misses.

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike two!

           SUPER: Tim McCarver Stadium, Birmingham Barons vs. Memphis 
           Chicks — May 22, 1994
           Michael checks his bat. Looks at the scoreboard. The Chicks 
           are up by a run. From the stands near the plate, he hears an 
           OLDER FEMALE FAN say to her COMPANION:

                                 OLDER FEMALE FAN 
                        His skin is darker than I realized.

           Michel ignores her. He waits for the pitch. Swings, and then —

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike three!

           Screams of “We love you Michael!” From the stands. Frustrated, 
           Michael heads back to the VISITOR’S DUGOUT. He takes a seat 
           next to Kerry Valrie. They listen in silence to the cheers. 
           Michael does not look happy to hear them.

           EXT. TIM MCCARVER STADIUM - NIGHT - LATER

           This game is a knuckle-biter. The announcer describes:

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        Bottom of the ninth, Chicks up by 
                        one. Two outs, with runners on first 
                        and third in scoring position... 
                        Next up, number 45, Michael Jordan.

           IN THE VISITOR’S DUGOUT:

           Michael stands and walks towards the plate. Terry stops him.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Hey, Michael...

           Some discomfort lingers between them. Then:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        We just need a base hit. 
                             (off Michael’s nod)
                        It’s mental. You know what to do.

           Michael struts onto the field, out of earshot from the dugout. 
           Terry watches, tense, when he hears Barry Johnson mutter:

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Well, that’s it. Game’s done.
                             (off Terry’s glare)
                        What? I didn’t say “circus.”

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Don’t fucking test me.

           Terry shakes his head, and turns back to focus on:
           HOME PLATE: 

           Michael waits for the pitch. Here it comes. He swings, and — 

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike one!

           Michael looks back to Terry in the dugout. Terry nods, 
           encouraging. The pitcher throws again. Michael swings, and:

                                 UMPIRE (CONT’D)
                        Strike two!

           Michael closes his eyes. Opens them again, AND EVERYTHING 
           SLOWS DOWN. Michael holds the bat in his hand. He looks at the 
           players on first and third. He can do this. The ball sails 
           towards him, big and fat, begging to be hit. He swings and — 

                                 UMPIRE (CONT’D)
                        Strike three!

           Game over. Michael stands at the plate. Above him, FIREWORKS 
           GO OFF. He doesn’t move.

           INT. CHICKS VISITING CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           The clubhouse mood is somber. The Barons dress in silence. 
           Michael enters, seething. Impetuously picks up a ping pong 
           paddle and SLAMS it into the table.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Fuck! Goddamn motherfucker!!!

           No one knows what to do, seeing such a raw moment from a 
           celebrity. Michael keeps BASHING THE TABLE, pent-up anger and 
           self-loathing coming out. His teammates watch, frozen. 

           Finally, Michael stops. Quietly, Terry approaches Mike Barnett.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        How about you take everyone on the 
                        bus? I’ll hang back here a minute.

           Barnett leads the team out, leaving Michael and Terry alone. 
           Michael tosses the broken paddle on the ground. After a beat:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        That was a tough out. You hate 
                        losing. I hate it, too. But you’re 
                        doing good. You’re focusing on your 
                        skills, not on the stats —
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m hitting .186.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I thought you didn’t know.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Four hits in my last forty-four at-
                        bats.
                             (then)
                        Charles Poe would’ve done better.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Who?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        This was his spot. I took it.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I don’t know Charles Poe. But if a 
                        player's good enough to play in the 
                        Majors, he'll find a way to get there. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What about me? 

           Terry tries to pick his words carefully - he's a Double-A 
           manager talking to the world's greatest athlete, but right 
           now, he's the one with power and knowledge.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... It’s too soon to say.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I need you to tell me what to do. 
                        You say walk away, I’ll walk away.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Michael... There’s no substitute for 
                        experience, and you don’t have any. 
                        You won’t know in 300 at-bats if 
                        you’ll get there. You want to find 
                        out, you gotta just keep going.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m thirty-one years old. How many 
                        more at-bats will I get?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Enough to get a better idea.

           Michael nods. The clubhouse is quiet. Terry checks his watch. 
                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        It’s late and we got a long drive.

           Michael looks at the ping pong table he broke.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I should get them a new table.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You can afford it.

           I/E. BARONS BUS - NIGHT

           Another late night bus ride. Almost everyone else is asleep. 
           Michael listens to his teammates debate behind him.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        ... I dunno. Striking seems drastic.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        How do you think laborers got fair 
                        wages during the industrial 
                        revolution?

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        What the hell you going on about 
                        with the industrial revolution? 
                        You’re talking about overpaid 
                        owners putting salary caps on 
                        overpaid Major League players.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Same principle applies.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        I am too hungry for your bullshit 
                        right now. When we gonna eat?

           Michael, lost in thought, looks out the window as we GO TO:

           INT. STEAKHOUSE - EVENING - 1975

           Young Michael and James sit in an upscale steakhouse. A WAITER 
           serves their steaks. James takes a celebratory sip of bourbon. 
           He’s not drunk, but he’s loose. Young Michael is distracted.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        What’s the matter?

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        We didn’t win.
                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        But you hit a home run. You’re 
                        gonna play a lot more games, gonna 
                        get a lot more chances to win. 

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Yeah, in basketball, for sure; kinda 
                        like a home run in every game —

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        You don’t have the height for 
                        basketball. 

           Young Michael looks quiet; holds back a thought.

                                 JAMES JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        All the other kids on the baseball 
                        team are white.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Listen to me: if you make it on a 
                        baseball team, you can make it 
                        anywhere. You excel at baseball, 
                        people will only pay attention to 
                        your skills, not your skin. And 
                        you, son, have the skills to make 
                        it to the Majors. More talent than 
                        I ever had.

           Young Michael’s face lights up. James gestures to the steak.

                                 JAMES JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Now dig in. You got a whole other 
                        steak to get through. Keep hitting 
                        those home runs, you should get 
                        used to fine dining.

           Young Michael happily eats his steak as we CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. MCDONALD’S PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The familiar Golden Arches. The Barons Bus pulls into a 
           McDonald's parking lot somewhere in the middle of Alabama.

           INT. MCDONALD’S - NIGHT

           Michael and the Barons enter. Michael walks to the counter. 
           He looks over and sees an advertisement of Michael Jordan on 
           the wall, enjoying some McDonald’s French fries. 
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Can I get a Big Mac?

                                 MCDONALD’S WORKER
                             (Holy shit this is happening)
                        ... Uh... One Big Mike.
                             (off Michael’s look)
                        Sorry, Big Mike.
                             (it’s a tick)
                        Big Mike.
                             (oh God can he stop?)
                        Big Mike.
                             (Oh God, he can’t stop)
                        Big Mac...
                             (he did it!)
                        ... One Big Mike.

           The Barons crack up, but Michael is too weary to be amused.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Michael sits on the bed in yet another motel room. It’s 
           raining hard outside. A dreary day. 

           IN THE BATHROOM: He shaves his head alone.

           IN THE ROOM: He’s watching the last scene of Field of Dreams 
           on TV. His eyes are streaked with tears. 

                                 KEVIN COSTNER (ON TV)
                        Hey Dad...? You wanna have a catch?

           As the music on TV swells, Michael cries like a baby, then 
           laughs at himself for crying, then cries again.

           LATER: He calls a number, TAKING US TO:

           INT. LARRY JORDAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The house is empty. We HOLD ON an answering machine.

                                 LARRY JORDAN’S VOICE
                        You’ve reached Larry. No one is 
                        here to take your call, so —

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Michael hangs up. He dials another number and we MOVE TO:
           INT. DELORIS JORDAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Family photos of all the Jordan children. A phone RINGS. Then:

                                 DELORIS JORDAN’S VOICE
                        This is Deloris. I’m not here so —

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Michael grows frustrated. He paces his room, then he pauses. 
           Realizes there’s someone else he can call. He sighs, then dials.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SIS JORDAN’S HOME - DAY

           Sis sits at her kitchen table, a notebook in front of her. 
           She’s writing furiously when her phone RINGS. She answers.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Hello?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey, it’s Michael.

           Sis is clearly thrown — his calls are a rare occasion.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s just a rainy day here in — I 
                        don’t know where the hell I am 
                        right now — but I wanted to say hi.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Who else in the family did you call 
                        first?

           Michael pauses; doesn’t want the typical fight.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        .... Mom. Larry.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        I’m the last resort, huh? 

           She chuckles. He joins in.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Guess so. How’re things with you?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Okay. Getting some writing in.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How’s uh, how’s...?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Rick? Rick is... indisposed.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What does that mean?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        It means... You’re not the only one 
                        who finds me difficult.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey, I called you, didn’t I?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You did. You did.
                             (then)
                        How’s your baseball experiment going?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You know... It’s always good to 
                        come back to your first love...

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Baseball? That was your first love? 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ‘Course it was. 

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You were always playing basketball. 
                        Daddy loved baseball. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... And I loved it, too.

           Sis starts laughing. Michael grows annoyed.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You know, people act like you’re 
                        some kinda god, but in some ways you 
                        get by just like anyone else. We 
                        remember what we want to remember. 
                        We make ourselves forget the rest.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I remember everything. Just ‘cause I 
                        took something different from you 
                        doesn’t mean I forgot.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Okay. Whatever you say.
           This feels loaded. Michael squirms, uncomfortable.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        We’re about to head to practice, so —

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Thought you said it was raining.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        But I’ll see you at Christmas? 
                        Whole family is coming. Pops would 
                        want us all together.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Still gotta do what he wants, huh?

           There’s a derisive note in her tone. He pushes back his anger. 

                                 SIS JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        I... I’ll try to make it up.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        All right. Take care.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Bye, Michael.

           He hangs up. Outside, it continues to rain. He doesn’t move.

           EXT. HOOVER MET BATTING CAGES - EARLY MORNING

           Michael hits in the batting cages alone. Still at it.

           INT. TERRY FRANCONA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Terry sits at his desk, reading the Chicago Tribune. There’s 
           an article with James Jordan’s picture with the headline: 
           “The Ups and Downs of Michael Jordan: A Year After His 
           Father’s Death, He Moves On.”

           Michael knocks on the door and sticks his head in. Terry 
           discreetly puts some player charts over his paper.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What’s this I hear about them 
                        broadcasting our games on TV?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Owners aren’t budging on the salary 
                        cap. Looking like the Major Leaguers 
                        are really gonna strike. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT'D)
                        If that happens, baseball’s gotta 
                        show something on television.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Even me staying south of .200?

           Terry waves him off. Michael turns to head out, when:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        So, the White Sox asked me to 
                        manage you in the Arizona Fall 
                        League for the Scottsdale 
                        Scorpions. Wanted to run it by you, 
                        make sure you’re good with it.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Fall league’s for top prospects. 
                        I’m not taking someone else’s spot.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Most teams get six players. Sox’ll 
                        get seven. They made a special 
                        exception in your case. 

           Michael winces at the words “special exception.” He turns to 
           go, but Terry’s words stop him.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        Hey Michael. I saw it’s been a year 
                        since... Just wanted to say I’m sorry.

           Michael eyes the newspaper.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You saw in there tomorrow would’ve 
                        been his birthday?

           Terry nods. Not much else to say.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Get a hitter’s count tonight. Make 
                        them throw you fastballs.

           Michael nods and starts to leave. Then: 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey, Tito? I am good with it.

           Michael goes. We hold on Terry for a moment, who contemplates 
           something, then picks up his phone. Dials.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        It’s Terry. Can I make a song request?
           EXT. HOOVER MET STADIUM - NIGHT

           Michael walks up to the plate, gripping his bat.

           SUPER: Hoover Met, Birmingham Barons vs. Carolina Mudcats — 
           July 30, 1994

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        Barons down by one, in the bottom 
                        of the sixth. Now batting, number 
                        45, Michael Jordan.

           But as Michael steps up to the plate, he hears familiar music 
           fill the stadium: it’s the Alan Parson Project’s song “Sirius.” 
           Confused, he looks at Terry in the dugout. Terry shrugs.

           IN THE DUGOUT: The Barons get a sense something weird is 
           happening with the music. Terry smiles to himself.

                                 SCOTT TEDDER
                        What is this...?

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        My brother and I saw him play at 
                        Chicago Stadium once. It’s the intro 
                        music they use for Bulls games.

           BACK AT HOME PLATE: The music washes over Michael. He looks 
           at his arm: he’s getting goosebumps. Time slows down...

           Then he readies himself for the pitch. He doesn’t swing. Ball 
           one. The pitcher throws and TIME SLOWS AGAIN...

           CRACK! The ball connects, rocketing further and further into 
           left field, and Michael runs —

           — The crowd is on their feet —

           — Terry and the Barons are watching —

           — Michael watches as it’s going, going... Gone.

           Michael’s run slows to a jog. He rounds the bases, the magic 
           of the moment surging through him, the crowd on their feet. 

           ... As he comes home, he points to the sky.

           He crosses home plate, the cheers echoing through the ballpark 
           where his teammates — even Barry Johnson — embrace him.

           Barry pats him on the back, their beef buried in this moment. 
           Terry, all smiles, emerges from the dugout, joining them.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Now how’d that fucking feel?!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Just like I remembered.

           CLOSE ON MICHAEL’S SMILE: it turns nostalgic as the cheers 
           engulf him, the sound almost impossibly far away.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - NIGHT

           Michael is driven through downtown Chicago. He gazes at the 
           iconic skyline. The city seems to beckon. 

           EXT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT

           Escorted by YELLOW-JACKETED COPS through Gate 3 1/2, Michael 
           hears the screams of Bulls fans who have not forgotten him.

           SUPER: Chicago Stadium, Scottie Pippen All-Star Classic 
           Charity Basketball Game — September 9, 1994

           INT. CHICAGO STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael puts on the charity basketball uniform. He catches 
           his reflection in the mirror, wearing a jersey and shorts. 
           B.J. Armstrong is with him, changing as well. 

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Glad you found a reason to wear those.

           Michael studies himself in the mirror as we GO TO: 

           INT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT - SEQUENCE

           Michael Jordan plays basketball again. Streaked with sweat, 
           he cuts through the opposing team, seeming more like a ballet 
           dancer than basketball player, as he effortlessly glides and 
           zig-zags across the court. It's a sanctuary. 

           Michael moves in SLOW MOTION, and we can practically hear “Ave 
           Maria.” Actually, maybe we do hear “Ave Maria,” because 
           judging from the expressions on the fans' faces, this is a 
           religious experience. They are witnessing an athlete at the 
           height of his powers, dominating other All-Stars with ease. 

           As Michael flies through the air, ball in hand, we GO TO:

           THE END OF THE GAME: The crowd’s on their feet. Michael looks 
           at the scoreboard: he’s scored 52 points. His team has won. 
           He's caked in sweat as he looks at the filled stadium, the 
           jubilant crowd on their feet, along with Juanita and his kids. 

           It's like the home run, but easier. He waves to the crowd...

           ... Then he leans down and kisses the Bull logo on the floor 
           goodbye. We HOLD ON THE CHICAGO BULL as Ave Maria or whatever 
           finishes, and Michael disappears from the court. 

           INT. BERTO CENTER - DAY

           Bulls Coach Phil Jackson shoots baskets in sweats as Michael 
           comes to meet him before a team practice. Michael enters in a 
           suit. He approaches Phil and hugs him as they talk.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        Little one on one?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m not really dressed for it.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        You seen the statue they’re 
                        building outside the new stadium? 
                        They’re calling it “The Spirit.”

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Makes it sound like I’m already 
                        dead. What, am I gonna haunt the 
                        United Center?

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        Or you could play in it. Your 
                        baseball season’s over, right?

           Phil passes Michael the ball. Michael shoots — swish.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Summer League’s over. I’m going to 
                        the Scottsdale Scorpions. Arizona 
                        Fall League. For the top prospects.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        You could come back after, play the 
                        second half of the season.

           Michael’s about to protest, but can’t help himself:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... How many games is that?

           Phil pauses before shooting; he doesn’t want to seem too eager.
                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        If you come back in January? Maybe 
                        fifty?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        That’s — that’s too many.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        How about February?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I got spring training. 

           Phil passes the ball to Michael, who takes a shot.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        And then you make the Majors?
                             (off Michael’s silence)
                        I will never coach a player of your 
                        abilities again. But this isn’t 
                        about me — you’re depriving 
                        millions of fans of a unique gift 
                        you very clearly still possess.
                             (digging in)
                        C’mon, Michael. You kissed the floor.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (hardening)
                        Kissed it goodbye.

           Phil’s look: “You sure about that?”

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t try to get in my head, Phil.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        You’re really gonna let them retire 
                        your number next month? Because if 
                        it goes up to the rafters, that’s 
                        it. You’re history.

           Phil takes a shot. On Michael, reflecting on that sentiment...

           INT. UNITED CENTER - DAY

           A lavish ceremony at the pristine new United Center. 

           SUPER: United Center, November 1, 1994

           Michael holds his daughter Jasmine on his lap. Juanita and 
           Deloris are there as well. Michael, Jeffrey and Marcus pull 
           the rope lifting the banner into the air. It reads: 
                               “Michael Jordan: 1984-1993” 

           Michael looks up at the banner. There it is. History.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        I’m never coming back to basketball.

           EXT. UNITED CENTER - NIGHT

           Michael, his family, and gathered PRESS watch as Jerry 
           Reinsdorf pulls the tarp off a covered statue: it’s of Jordan 
           ascending, ball in outstretched arm, resembling the iconic Nike 
           logo, flying past an abstract opponent. On the base it reads: 

                  “The Best There Ever Was, The Best There Ever Will Be.” 

           More applause. Michael looks up at the statue, vaguely unsettled.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        I told the fans I’d be playing 
                        baseball in Arizona, and that’s 
                        what I’m gonna do.  

           LATER: We catch up with Michael giving an interview with a 
           REPORTER, with his family. He looks a little irritated.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I let them retire the number. What 
                        more do you all need to be convinced?

           I/E. LIMO - NIGHT

           George Koehler drives the Jordan family back to Highland 
           Park. The kids are asleep. Michael and Juanita are quiet.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... I like the statue.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Do I look like a statue to you?

           The edge in his voice is unmistakable. She doesn’t reply.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION - NIGHT

           As the family enters, Michael carries a groggy Marcus inside.

                                 MARCUS
                        Daddy, can we go to the zoo 
                        tomorrow?
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m sorry, little man, I —

                                 JEFFREY
                             (to Marcus)
                        He can’t go. He has to play baseball.

                                 MARCUS
                        No, I want you to come! I want you 
                        to come!

           As Marcus melts down, Juanita takes him in her arms. Michael 
           watches his son scream and cry. Then he looks at Jeffrey, 
           resolving to be strong, internalizing Michael’s absence.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael splashes water on his face, preparing for bed. He 
           looks in the mirror. Irritable. Weary. Juanita enters, spent.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Is he down?

           Juanita nods, a bit icy. He picks up on it.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        I didn’t say a word.

           She starts brushing her teeth, quiet and avoiding eye contact.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Something you want to talk about?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        It’s a special night for you, and I 
                        don’t want to spend it... Let’s 
                        have a nice time before you leave.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m sorry I have to go to Arizona. 
                        That’s where my job is right now.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Your family is here. You don’t have 
                        to play Minor League baseball. That’s 
                        your choice.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You were the one who told me to go 
                        to the Minors!
                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Yes, to Birmingham! ‘Cause I wasn’t 
                        going to stand in the way of what 
                        you wanted. But did I tell you to 
                        go to Scottsdale and leave me alone 
                        with three children for another two 
                        months? Did we even discuss it?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I think you’re mad ‘cause you didn’t 
                        marry some Minor League country boy 
                        from North Carolina. You married 
                        Michael Jordan. 

           A beat. He’s crossed a line, but is too hot to apologize.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        I knew I wasn’t getting an equal 
                        partner. Not really. I signed up for 
                        it. I love our life and I won’t 
                        apologize for that. But I wanted you 
                        on the Chicago White Sox because they 
                        are in Chicago. So I’m not gonna let 
                        you make me the bad guy in your 
                        story. I am not some fan. I am not 
                        the media. I am the mother of your 
                        children and you will treat me as 
                        such, even if you don’t give leaving 
                        those children a second thought.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You don’t think I miss them? You 
                        don’t think this tears me up? I 
                        told you to move them down!

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        But their life is here — our life  
                        is here. 
                             (driving it home)
                        Just ‘cause you lost your daddy 
                        means they have to lose theirs, 
                        too?

           She walks out, leaving him alone with no response.

           EXT. SCOTTSDALE STADIUM - NIGHT

           Michael stands in right field, bundled up in the November 
           chilliness in a uniform for his new team, the SCOTTSDALE 
           SCORPIONS. He is still, lonely, maybe a little bored. 

           We hear the sound of RINGING, and then the phone conversation 
           between Michael and his mother. He sounds weary.
                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Hey, Mama.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Michael! How is Arizona treating you?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        It’s all right. Colder, though.

           I/E. BUS - NIGHT

           Still in uniform, Michael and the Scorpions ride the bus. 

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Still on that famous bus of yours?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Nah. All the teams are in Arizona, 
                        so we only travel an hour or so. We 
                        ride the bus in our uniforms.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        You know anyone on the new team?

           INT. SCOTTSDALE STADIUM DUGOUT - DAY

           Terry, in a Scottsdale uniform as well, chews gum, then spits.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Terry’s managing here too. And 
                        there’s a few guys from Birmingham. 
                        Good guys, good players.

           In the field, kids do a “Dizzy Bat Race.” They place their 
           foreheads on the knob, spinning around until it’s time to race.

           INT. SCORPIONS CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           His teammates play poker. Michael plays solitaire in the corner.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        How are you playing?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        I hit at .260 the last month in 
                        Birmingham. Doing about that here.
           New Scorpions teammate NEAL DUSEDAU (24, white, nervous) 
           approaches Michael. He holds up a magazine with the ad 
           Michael did for the Barons bus. Michael relaxing on the 
           Jordan Cruiser and grinning. He holds out a pen, expectantly.

                                 NEAL DUSEDAU
                        Would you mind? 

           Michael takes the pen and signs.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Michael eats in a diner, flanked by SECURITY. People walk by 
           on the street and freak out when they see him.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        .260 is very respectable.

           INT. ARIZONA BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael watches TV in yet another rented house. He flips past 
           a baseball game. Then he arrives on a Bulls game.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        ... You there, Michael?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        Yeah, sorry, just a little tired.

           Michael watches his old teammates, eyes glued to the TV.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN (V.O.)
                        I know, baby. Christmas will be 
                        here before you know it.

           I/E. BUS - NIGHT

           Michael rides in uniform. He plays solitaire on his computer 
           and sits next to NOMAR GARCIAPARRA (21, Latino, confident). 
           The mood is rowdy, as a few rows down Terry tells a story:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        — They had these healthy popsicles in 
                        the fridge. One night I had a bunch 
                        of ‘em. Lost count of how many. Woke 
                        up 4 AM, just lay there for an hour 
                        thinking, “Don’t throw up, don’t 
                        throw up.” Shoulda thrown up.

           Nomar laughs at the story and nods his head towards Terry:
                                 NOMAR GARCIAPARRA
                        That goofball scares me every time I 
                        look at him. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Why?

                                 NOMAR GARCIAPARRA
                        He shoulda had a great career.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (protective of Terry)
                        He’s not done. He could still 
                        manage in the Bigs. 

                                 NOMAR GARCIAPARRA
                        No, I mean as a player.

           Michael looks at Nomar, confused. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        He said he was a a journeyman.

                                 NOMAR GARCIAPARRA
                        Tito was the best player in college 
                        ball. If he hadn’t got hurt, he’d 
                        have been a Boggs or a Ripken. Had 
                        his rookie card when I was a kid. 
                        Thought I was gonna be rich.

           Michael watches Terry continue telling his silly anecdote:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... Then I woke up in the morning 
                        and I started counting the sticks. 
                        I ate seventeen. Guess I figured if 
                        one’s healthy, seventeen’s gotta be 
                        real healthy, you know?

           Michael watches Terry as if seeing him for the first time.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Michael, Terry and White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler are 
           on the golf course. Ron drives the ball of the tee; watches 
           his drive go off-course, and says:

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Get it together, Ron.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Looks like old Ronny’s gonna owe me 
                        another $150 for this hole.
                                 RON SCHUELER
                        I’m done betting on golf with you.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        So why play at all? Tito, you’re 
                        up.

           Terry places his ball on the tee. Ron pipes up:

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Terry — I hear Buddy Bell over at 
                        the Tigers is sniffing around you 
                        for a third base coach.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Buddy’s considering a bunch of 
                        guys. It’s not gonna happen.

           Terry swings; a good drive. Michael watches Terry closely.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You got all kinds of skills, huh?

           Terry is a bit confused by Michael’s statement, but lets it go.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Eh, just got lucky.
                             (to Ron)
                        So, Ron, how’re your Arizona 
                        prospects looking?

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Don’t know if they’re all ready for 
                        Major League baseball, but they may 
                        have to play it anyway.

           Michael ignores this and places his golf ball on the tee.

                                 RON SCHUELER (CONT’D)
                        What do you think, Michael? 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I think putting on a Major League 
                        uniform because the Major Leaguers 
                        are striking sounds like a shortcut.

           Michael takes a swing.

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        There’s gonna be replacement games 
                        next season. Someone’s gonna play 
                        in ‘em.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m a player’s rep in another sport. 
                        I’m not crossing any picket lines.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Michael, you’re up. Next hole.

           Michael leaves them behind, walking away from Ron. As he goes, 
           we hear the pubescent voice of a kid named DAVID BRIDGERS:

                                 DAVID BRIDGERS (PRE-LAP)
                        Hey Michael — what sport you 
                        playing right now?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRASK MIDDLE SCHOOL LAWN - DAY - 1975

           Young Michael plays catch with his friend DAVID BRIDGERS (12, 
           white) on the lawn of the school. But Young Michael is 
           distracted watching a nearby pickup basketball game. One of 
           the young players is leaving, making the teams uneven.

                                 DAVID BRIDGERS
                        Michael!

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Huh?

           David throws Michael the baseball.

                                 DAVID BRIDGERS
                        Just tag in, man.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Nah, I’m good here. 

           Young Michael throws David the ball. David turns and throws 
           it over a fence, in the opposite direction from Michael.

                                 DAVID BRIDGERS
                        Oops. 

           Michael grins and tosses his glove aside. He jogs over to the 
           pickup game. His spirits perk up as he heads to the court. 

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Let me get next!

           Young Michael gets the basketball. OFF HIS DRIBBLING, WE 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. ARIZONA HOUSE - DAY

           A basketball game is on TV: an NBA player is dribbling.  
           Michael watches it actively, bouncing around the living room 
           while talking into his phone. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Now Grant Hill, is he living up to 
                        the hype? What’s it like playing him?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BERTO CENTER HALLWAY - DAY

           B.J. Armstrong talks on his cell to Michael, watching his 
           teammates start practice with Phil Jackson. 

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Michael, I gotta go —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        And Shaq? Guy shoots free throws 
                        like he’s trying to chip paint off 
                        the rim —

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Practice is starting —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How’s Phil doing with the new guys?

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Wouldn’t know, ‘cause I’m talking to 
                        you instead of in there with them —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You gotta make them earn your 
                        respect, make them work for it —

           B.J. hangs up on Michael. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... Hello?... B.J.?

           Alone in his room, Michael looks at his phone. He grumbles:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Pre-pubsecent-looking-motherfucker 
                        gonna hang up on me...

           Michael realizes he’s not talking to anyone. He returns his 
           avid attention to the basketball game on TV. 
           INT. SCORPIONS CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael changes after a game. Terry emerges from his office.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Michael! Phone.

           Michael enters TERRY’S OFFICE. Terry hands him the phone:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        It’s Ron Schueler. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (into phone)
                        This is Michael.
                             (listens, but doesn’t react)
                        ... Okay. Thanks.

           Michael hangs up. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        What did he say?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m moving up to Triple A next 
                        season. Nashville Sounds.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Hey, how about that! Congrats! 

           Michael nods. He seems oddly unmoved. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        You’ve played well here. You earned 
                        it. You should celebrate.

           A smile starts to form on Michael’s face as we MOVE TO:

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           Michael, Terry, and some other PLAYERS and STAFF play a pickup 
           game outside an apartment complex. Among them we recognize 
           Neal Dusedau, the Scorpion who asked for Michael’s autograph.

           Unlike the visual poetry of the Pippen charity game, when 
           Michael plays here it’s a predator toying with his prey; 
           he’ll dunk over two defender’s heads; he’ll unleash an array 
           of moves that have thrilled crowds around the world.

           As the game progresses, more ON-LOOKERS arrive. Video cameras 
           are whipped out. 
           Terry is on Michael’s team, and when Michael is being 
           quadruple-teamed, he throws Terry a perfect pass under the 
           hoop. Terry misses the catch and YELPS like he may have 
           dislocated his finger. 

           LATER: After nearly an hour of play, Terry can barely move. 
           He takes a heave from beyond the three-point line and then 
           heads for the bench. Angry, Michael kicks the ball. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey! I always shoot last!

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        This isn’t the goddamn NBA Finals!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        That’s not the point! I always 
                        shoot last! You fucked it up!

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Now you know how I feel watching 
                        you trying to hit a curveball!

           Michael is about to yell back, but instead cracks up and falls 
           to the floor. Terry joins him in laughing, until they notice 
           Neal Dusedau is breathing way too heavily...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Is he having a heart attack?

                                                          AND WE GO TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Michael sits in the waiting room, getting all the looks from 
           HOSPITAL STAFF and PATIENTS you’d expect. Terry sits down.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You don’t have to wait here.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I want to know if I killed the guy.

           Michael watches Terry, then broaches the subject:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What was your batting average in 
                        the show?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Thought I told you. .274.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What’d you hit in college?

           Terry hesitates. Caught. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        .400 something or other.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        How about high school?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA

           Michael can’t believe it. That’s preposterously good. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        So what happened when you got to 
                        the Big Leagues?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... I was hitting .321 my first 
                        season. 

           As Terry talks, we FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. BUSCH STADIUM - DAY - 1982

           Terry, 22 and in a Montreal Expos uniform, follows a fly ball 
           back towards the wall. It’s the same SLOW-MO we’ve seen Michael 
           experience when he played the charity game — the same sanctuary 
           of an exceptional athlete knowing exactly what to do.

           SUPER: Busch Stadium, St. Louis, MO — 1982

           As Terry runs back, we hear his voice:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (V.O.)
                        Julio Gonzalez hit a long drive to 
                        left field. I went back, past the 
                        warning track and jumped...

           And right before the point of contact, we GO BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Momentum took me into the base of 
                        the wall. Felt my knee explode. 
                        They had to peel me off like I was 
                        a cartoon character.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT'D)
                        My wife says childbirth is bad, but 
                        she didn’t leave half her knee on 
                        the Busch Stadium outfield. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        They couldn’t fix it?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Nah. I’ve had more surgeries than 
                        you’ve had hits. Somehow hung 
                        around for nine years.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Was it worth it? What it did to 
                        your body?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                             (considers)
                        ... Yeeeeeah. I played every day I 
                        could, and maybe a few when I 
                        couldn’t. My brain still knew what 
                        to do, but my body — my body 
                        wouldn’t comply. You find something 
                        you love that much, hard to let go. 

           As Michael considers this, a very embarrassed Neal Dusedau 
           being led into the room by a DOCTOR.

                                 DOCTOR
                        He’s fine. Just a little over-excited.

           Michael approaches Neal: 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You okay?

                                 NEAL DUSEDAU
                        Yeah. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Good. Also, I’m never playing 
                        basketball with you again.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Michael and Terry walk towards the car. Terry is preoccupied.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        This thing with you and the Tigers 
                        — anything I can do to help?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I appreciate it, but that’s a reach.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You shoulda made the Hall of Fame as 
                        a player. Okay, your knee’s blown, 
                        you get in as a manager.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Maybe... Maybe you only get to be 
                        great at one thing.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Bullshit! You love something, you 
                        work and push and you make it 
                        happen. Do you love being a manager?

           Terry nods, almost vulnerable.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, there you go.

           Michael walks over to his car. Terry hesitates, preoccupied.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Michael... Do you really love this? 
                        Being a baseball player?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Of course. It’s my dream.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Look, I’m not your manager anymore, 
                        so I’m saying this as your friend... 
                        You celebrated moving up to Triple A 
                        by playing another sport.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (simmering)
                        You gonna say this is about my 
                        father again?

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        You say baseball is your dream. 
                        Maybe it’s not. Maybe it’s his.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        When we first met, you said my 
                        reasons for playing were none of 
                        your business. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Sure, but, I thought we’d kinda 
                        progressed beyond that point —
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No, you’re right: you’re not my 
                        manager anymore. So we’re done.

           Michael stomps to his car. Terry’s had it:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Hey Michael: How many friends — 
                        real friends - do you have, that 
                        you can afford to push them away?

           Michael hesitates, but then gets in his car and leaves.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION - DAY

           Michael and his immediate family — Juanita, Jeffrey, Marcus 
           and Jasmine — are in Christmas garb. KIDS and COUSINS run 
           around and decorate the massive tree. We recognize his mother 
           Deloris, brothers Larry and Ronnie (with their FAMILIES), and 
           sister Roslyn. 

           The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael answers: it’s Sis, looking a 
           little frayed. They hug, a bit uncomfortably.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Merry Christmas. Sorry I’m late... 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Merry Christmas... Where’s Rick?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        He... couldn’t make it. 
                             (looking around)
                        Always forget how big this place is.

           Juanita approaches, gracefully interrupting the awkward moment.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Sis! Good to see you!

           Juanita ushers Sis in. Michael lingers behind. 

           INT. JORDAN MANSION - NIGHT

           Christmas dinner. Kids run around and play while the adults 
           sit around the dining room table. 

                                 LARRY JORDAN
                        What’s this I hear about them 
                        building a park for Pops in 
                        Birmingham?
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        It’s not happening now. 

                                 RONNIE JORDAN
                        How come?

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        The Barons wanted to honor Michael’s 
                        time in Birmingham and thought it’d 
                        be nice to fix up an old Little 
                        League field and name it after Pops.

           Sis laughs. The bitterness of it does not go unnoticed.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Some local folks got upset because 
                        he hadn’t spent much time in 
                        Birmingham and...

           But she is interrupted by Sis’ laughter. Michael is annoyed:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What is so damn funny?

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Sorry, did Daddy spend any time in 
                        Birmingham, Alabama?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Anyway, we’ll do something with the 
                        Boys and Girls Club here in Chicago, 
                        find something some other way for 
                        the Barons to honor him...

           Sis laughs again; an angry laughter. Discomfort all around.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN
                        Sis, control yourself.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        I’m not a child anymore, Mama.

                                 DELORIS JORDAN
                        So stop acting like one.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        No one agrees this is all crazy? 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        — Did everyone get enough food —
                                 SIS JORDAN
                        — Everyone’s always trying to 
                        capitalize on Michael, now they’re 
                        dragging Daddy into it, acting like 
                        he was some sorta saint just ‘cause  
                        he’s passed on —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey! Show some respect — 

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You know how long he was missing 
                        before anyone noticed? Two weeks. 
                        We don’t talk about how he hadn’t 
                        paid anyone at his business in 
                        weeks. Or his paternity suit from 
                        that woman in Chicago.

           Deloris is dangerously close to losing her customary cool:

                                 DELORIS JORDAN
                        Sis, you are being hysterical —

                                 SIS JORDAN
                             (to Deloris)
                        When we were kids you were fighting 
                        so bad you nearly crashed the car. 
                        We all thought you’d kill each 
                        other. Now that he’s dead we gotta 
                        pretend like you didn’t hate him?

           Deloris SLAPS Sis across the face. No one speaks. Then Sis 
           gets up and runs out. Michael follows her, apoplectic.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Upset, Sis marches into her room and starts throwing clothes 
           in her suitcase as Michael follows her in.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Just ‘cause you got some sort of 
                        fucked up ax to grind with Pops, 
                        and you want to shit all over our 
                        childhood - that doesn’t make you 
                        some kind of prophet. Just makes 
                        you a loser. A loser who never did 
                        anything with herself, loser who 
                        can’t keep her man from leaving.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        See this - this is why I don’t come 
                        here for Christmas.

                                 SIS JORDAN (CONT'D)
                        Come to this castle to be lectured 
                        by my little brother who knows 
                        nothing about himself or his family 
                        but thinks he’s God’s gift because 
                        he happens to be real good at 
                        basketball.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You’re jealous - that he and I were 
                        close, that I made him proud - 

           Michael and Sis don’t notice Juanita silently entering the 
           corner of the room, and watching, unsure of what to say.

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        You made him proud? Only time he 
                        liked you was when you were playing 
                        baseball. 

           Michael grabs her suitcase and hurls it at the wall. This 
           display is scary for her, but she doesn’t back down. 

                                 SIS JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        But before that, before you became 
                        somebody doing a sport that wasn’t 
                        his? What did he really think of 
                        you then? 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        He loved me! Everything he did he 
                        did because he loved me! 

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        Blowing up your life with this 
                        tribute, this apology, whatever it 
                        is — he doesn’t deserve it. You 
                        know that. You remember.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                             (starting to crack)
                        Sis. Stop. Please. 

           He’s almost like a boy, pleading. Sis looks up at her little 
           brother, towering above her but seeming young once again. 

                                 SIS JORDAN
                        ... All right, Michael. All right.

           Juanita finally speaks up.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        ... Sis? Michael? How about you 
                        both come back to dinner?
           Michael doesn’t move. Sis walks towards the doorway. She 
           turns back and looks at Michael. HOLD ON SIS’S FACE AS WE

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. TRASK MIDDLE SCHOOL BASKETBALL COURT - EVENING - 1975

           YOUNG SIS JORDAN (16, already world-weary) stands with a crowd 
           of kids watching the basketball game. She motions him over.

           REVEAL: Young Michael, sweaty and joyous from the same 
           basketball game we saw earlier, still going strong. He calls 
           time and trots over to her.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Sis! You see that shot?

                                 YOUNG SIS
                        You’re late. Daddy’ll want us home.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        We’re tied up.

           Young Sis looks nervous as Young Michael rejoins the game. As 
           the game continues, James Jordan walks over to the crowd 
           watching, a flask in his hand. He doesn’t look pleased. 

           Young Michael does a fast break and scores. His team wins. As 
           high-fives are exchanged, he spots his father standing next 
           to his sister. James takes a swig from a flask.

           EXT. TRASK MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT - 1975

           An excited Young Michael walks towards the family car with his 
           father and sister. James looks stern, Young Sis nervous. 

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        You see that last shot? I was all 
                        fake left, fast break right —

           He mimes his own move. James is conspicuously silent as they 
           arrive at the car, out of view from other students.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Pops? Did you see it?

           Angrily, James grabs Young Michael’s arm.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Do I look like I give a damn about 
                        your fast break? 
                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Sorry, I -

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        We were supposed to work on your 
                        fielding at home.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry — You’re hurting my arm —

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Your left arm. You throw right.

                                 YOUNG SIS
                        He didn’t mean —

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                             (to Young Michael)
                        You’ve never been worth a damn 
                        except for one thing. One. Thing.

           James twists Young Michael’s arm. He cries out. 

                                 YOUNG SIS
                        Daddy, let him go —

           Young Sis rushes to pull James off of her brother, but James 
           throws her to the car. She CRIES OUT in pain. For a moment, 
           all are too shocked by James’s actions to say anything. Young 
           Michael starts to tear up. 

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Here you go, crying like a girl.

           Young Michael bites his lip, forcing the tears away. James 
           looks regretful, but unable to apologize. All he says is:

                                 JAMES JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Both of you get in the car. 

           Trembling, Young Michael and Young Sis get in the car.

           I/E. JAMES JORDAN’S CAR - NIGHT

           James drives. Young Michael and Young Sis are silent. Young 
           Michael looks out the window. His arm throbs. He looks out 
           the window, at the night sky. We PAN OVER TO THE NIGHT SKY. 
           After a moment, WE PAN BACK TO FIND WE’RE IN:
           INT. JORDAN MANSION BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael lies in bed, in the same position as nineteen years ago. 
           He looks out the window, on the cusp of acknowledging something 
           he doesn’t want to acknowledge. Suddenly he starts breathing 
           quickly - is he having a panic attack? Juanita stirs. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You okay?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Breathe.

           Michael breathes. He calms down. After a moment:

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        I heard you and Sis.

           Michael says nothing. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe... Maybe that’s enough? Maybe 
                        you can stop now?

           HOLD ON MICHAEL, torn, before we 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SARASOTA AIRPORT - DAY

           Like last year, the wheels of a private plane touch down. 

           SUPER: Sarasota, FL — February 17, 1995

           MOMENTS LATER: Michael gets out of the plane, his driver George 
           Koehler following with his bags. Whereas last year Michael’s 
           smile was a mile wide, now his expression is neutral. Resigned. 

           I/E. MICHAEL’S CORVETTE - DAY

           George Koehler drives Michael towards the Ed Smith Stadium in 
           Sarasota. The radio is on: 

                                 DJ (ON RADIO)
                        ... Baseball strike continues as 
                        potential replacement players begin 
                        spring training here in Sarasota...
           Like last year, the PRESS IS WAITING, shouting questions 
           about whether Michael will play in the exhibition games. 
           George drives the car into the training complex. 

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael walks through the clubhouse. This year he’s in sweats 
           like everyone else. A young PROSPECT is dressed in the full 
           uniform, like Michael was last year. The Prospect looks 
           around, embarrassed. Michael watches him, remembering. He 
           looks worn out, and spring training’s only on day one.

           INT. ED SMITH STADIUM BATTING CAGES - DAY

           Michael takes swings with Walt Hriniak, another year more 
           grizzled. Walt observes Michael in the cage.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Kinda empty without everyone here.

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        Fucking strike’ll kill this game.

           Another pitch comes. Michael swings again. 

                                 WALT HRINIAK (CONT’D)
                        Swing looks better.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’ve been keeping both hands on the 
                        bat during the release — trying to 
                        create more bat speed.

                                 WALT HRINIAK
                        You’re a good student. You honor our 
                        game with your effort. 
                             (Michael is touched)
                        Another three, four years... You 
                        might make it up.

           Michael’s face falls. Three or four years is a long time.

           INT. ED SMITH STADIUM CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael changes out of his uniform when he hears:

                                 KERRY VALRIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, aren’t you a basketball player?

           Michael turns to see some familiar faces from the Barons: 
           Kerry Valrie, Barry Johnson, and Glenn DiSarcina. He grins. 
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Michael, Kerry, Glenn and Barry have a drink. They’re in mid-
           conversation, reminiscing and laughing:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        — Two thousand dollars?

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        Yep.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I gave Rogelio Nunez two thousand 
                        dollars last summer? Were you all 
                        coaching him on the words?

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Yeah, but he probably needed the 
                        money more than you.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        We all need it more than you.

           The mood turns slightly more serious. Barry turns to Kerry:

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Look: if we play those exhibition 
                        games, we’re limiting our future 
                        revenues playing in the Bigs.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        Why are you always talking about 
                        shit like that? I want to play 
                        baseball. We’re not even in the 
                        Major League union...

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        And we’re never gonna be if we’re 
                        scabs. The Sox charge fans for those 
                        games. 

                                 GLENN DISARCINA
                        My brother said that if we play, 
                        union will have us pegged as scabs 
                        before we start. 

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        Man, everyone is sick of hearing 
                        about your damn brother —

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        If I get to the Majors, I want it 
                        to be because I earned it, not 
                        because I crossed the picket line.
                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        No one’s said that we’d be crossing 
                        the picket line if we play —

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        They’ll say it soon.

           Michael has been quiet throughout this exchange.

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        What about you, 45? 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Same thing I’ve always said: told 
                        them I won’t play the games.

           Kerry deflates, feeling the judgement coming from everyone. 
           The previously jovial environment has now turned tense. 

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        See you all at practice.

           Kerry throws some cash on the table and starts to leave, when:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Kerry, I can’t tell you what to do. 
                        I can’t tell any of you what to do. 
                        I may ride the same buses as you, 
                        stay in the same motels, but I’m 
                        not the same. 

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        Yeah. You’re a lot more visible.

           Barry tosses him a program for exhibition games featuring 
           replacement players: Michael’s on the cover. His blood boils.

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY

           Michael — in Sox uniform — marches onto the field, holding 
           the exhibition game replacement player program. He watches 
           Ron talk to some GATHERED PRESS on the field before practice.

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        ... Guys, baseball’s been around a 
                        hundred years, some contract 
                        negotiations aren’t gonna kill it. 

           The Press immediately spot Michael and start in with him:

                                 REPORTER
                        Michael! Will you play the games?
                                 ANOTHER REPORTER
                        Are you getting special treatment 
                        not to play?

           Michael ignores them and pulls Ron aside. Out of earshot from 
           the reporters, but still visible. He holds up the program:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I thought I made myself clear in 
                        Arizona. I’m not here so you can 
                        sell tickets to exhibition games.

                                 RON SCHUELER
                             (re: the press)
                        Careful...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        That’s your problem.

           Ron looks over at the press smiles. Then to Michael:

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        You need as many at-bats as you can 
                        get if you still want to go to 
                        Triple A. You’re 32 and your clock 
                        is ticking.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        A year ago you couldn’t get me out 
                        here fast enough. 

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        You wanna prove you’re a baseball 
                        player? Play baseball.

           A stare-down. Michael’s frustration builds.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You better hope this strike ends soon. 

           Michael joins the other players as they start their drills.

           INT. SARASOTA KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Michael eats takeout while he watches TV in the kitchen. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... Players rep Don Fehr is now 
                        formally stating that anyone 
                        playing in an exhibition game is 
                        considered a strikebreaker. Fehr is 
                        dubbing it “The Jordan Rule.”
           Michael quietly curses, the walls closing in on him...

           INT. WHITE SOX CLUBHOUSE - DAY

           Michael comes in while the rest of the players stand around 
           pensively. Something is up. He turns to Kerry:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What’s happening?

                                 KERRY VALRIE
                        Barry’s in there with Schueler. He 
                        won’t play the games.

           Michael looks down the hallway. After a moment, Ron’s door 
           opens, and Barry Johnson walks out, shaken but defiant. Ron 
           goes the opposite way, but Barry joins his fellow players.

                                 BARRY JOHNSON
                        They’re making an example out of 
                        me. Sending me home. 

           Barry turns to Michael. 

                                 BARRY JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Everyone’s gonna be looking to you.

           Michael extends his hand towards Barry. Barry takes it. 

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM BATTING CAGES - EVENING

           Michael works the cages alone after team practice. BAM — he 
           sends one of the pitches out of the park. Then another. 

           ON MICHAEL’S FACE: he seems distracted. He's getting what he 
           wants, but does he still want it? Then he’s startled by a 
           familiar voice behind him:

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (O.S.)
                        Pretty good for the cages...

           Michael turns to see Terry approaching on the empty field. 
           Given their last interaction, their dynamic is uncertain.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        How’re you doing with live 
                        pitching?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You’re not a pitcher.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I threw a few games when the bench 
                        was thin. “Journeyman,” remember?

           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - NIGHT

           Michael stands at home plate. Terry stands on the pitcher’s 
           mound, a bucket of baseballs next to him. He throws a pitch. 
           Michael sends it rocketing.

           Terry grins and throws another. Again, Michael cracks it. We 
           watch the ball go sailing into the outfield. We follow it to:

           LATER:

           The two sit in the outfield. Now Terry has a cooler of beers. 
           They each have one and sit silently, looking at the field. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        I called Buddy Bell in Detroit. 
                        Told him I wanted the third base 
                        coach job. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        They’d be lucky.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        We’ll see. We’ll see.
                             (then)
                        You’ve gotten better.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Didn’t get there alone.
                             (then)
                        Tito, I... I’m not always so good 
                        at admitting when I’m wrong.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Getting better at that, too.

           They sip their beers. A moment of contemplative silence.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I hit a home run in the Little 
                        League Championships when I was 
                        twelve. My dad bought me two 
                        steaks. But then next year, when I 
                        was thirteen, I went to the Babe 
                        Ruth League for older kids. 

           FLASH TO 1976: Young Michael, at shortstop, throws a grounder 
           to first base. The throw falls short. The runner scores. 
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The diamond was bigger. All of a 
                        sudden I couldn’t make the throws. 

           FLASH TO 1976: Young Michael sits on the bench. He looks into 
           the stands. Sees his father James, with disappointment etched 
           across his face. Something has changed between them. Young 
           Michael looks away. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (V.O.)
                        I started riding the bench. I 
                        started focusing on other things. 
                        My dad, he hated that...

           BACK TO THE PRESENT: 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Couple years ago, I think 1990, he 
                        saw Bo Jackson doing two sports; 
                        said there was no reason I couldn’t 
                        do that too. I said I couldn’t 
                        leave basketball - I hadn’t won a 
                        championship yet. He brought it up 
                        after every season. Even with 
                        everything I accomplished, he still 
                        acted like he knew better.

           Something almost like bitterness has crept into his voice. 
           But it’s replaced by a deep sadness:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        When he passed, I thought I could 
                        fix it. For him. Thought I could 
                        get there.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Where was “there?”

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Be the best baseball player of all 
                        time.

           Terry chuckles. 

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Why’d he focus so much on baseball?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        It was just his game. His way.

           Terry nods. They sip their beers.
                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        ... When I was a freshman in 
                        college, there was this girl in my 
                        math class. Face like something 
                        from an art history book. I wanted 
                        to ask her out, but if all you know 
                        about is baseball, you’re worthless 
                        with girls. So freshman year I 
                        don’t do anything. Sophomore year, 
                        still nothing. But I was still 
                        thinking about her. Finally junior 
                        year comes and I work up the nerve. 
                        A year later we were engaged. Had 
                        our fourth kid last year.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m very happy for you.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Point is, I couldn’t get her out of 
                        my system. We can love a lot of 
                        things in life. Some are people. 
                        Some are children’s games. 

           Michael soaks it in.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        What I was trying to say before, 
                        back in Scottsdale is... You’ve 
                        come a long way as a ballplayer. 
                        You’re a hell of a lot better now 
                        than during that early streak. 
                        Better at fielding, better at 
                        running the bases, better bat-
                        speed, instincts, all of it. No one 
                        wants to see more than me how good 
                        you might get...
                             (looks him right in the eye)
                        But you'll never be... Look, I've 
                        seen you be super-human. Not just 
                        on TV — I’m talking banging up my 
                        hand with a pass too perfect to 
                        catch. And for you to go back to 
                        that perfection, for as long as you 
                        still can... Well, that's about the 
                        most human thing I can imagine.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Still might get there, Tito. 

           They sip their beers in silence. 
           EXT. ED SMITH STADIUM - DAY

           Team practice. Michael fields grounders and throws them back. 
           Ron Schueler is on the sidelines and waves him over.

           SUPER: March 2, 1995

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Michael. Can I have a minute?

           Michael tosses the ball to his teammate and approaches Ron.

                                 RON SCHUELER (CONT’D)
                        Minor Leaguers who won’t play 
                        exhibition games can’t park in our 
                        lot. And they go to the Minor 
                        League clubhouse. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I spent last summer on a bus. I can 
                        handle the fucking B-list clubhouse. 

           He starts to head back to the field. 

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        You’re getting squeezed from both 
                        sides. I get it. But if this strike 
                        keeps up, baseball will be in 
                        irreparable trouble, and I'm doing 
                        everything I can not to let that 
                        happen. We need something to keep 
                        people interested and right now 
                        you’re the best we got. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What happens if I play? What if the 
                        guys here follow my lead? Every Major 
                        Leaguer will know they were scabs.

           Michael looks over at his teammates, doing their drills. Then 
           back at Ron: a hitherto unseen vulnerability in the GM. Ron 
           sighs and kind of shrugs: he doesn’t have an answer.

                                 RON SCHUELER
                        Shit, you love this sport, right? 
                        You really done with it?

           Michael looks up at the perfect blue Sarasota sky, looks down 
           at the glove on his hand... All goes quiet...

           And he starts walking towards the clubhouse. Vaguely he’s 
           aware of Ron behind him, SHOUTING for him to come back. But 
           now Michael’s picking up speed as we MOVE TO:
           INT. JORDAN MANSION BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An exhausted Michael climbs into bed with Juanita.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Feel like cutting some grass?

           He looks at her. They laugh. 

           I/E. MICHAEL’S MINIVAN - DAY

           Michael, dressed in a suit, drives Jeffrey and Marcus to 
           school. They’re bundled up for the March Chicago weather.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You got everything? Hats? Lunches?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yeah...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Have a good day. Daddy loves you. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Bye!

           He kisses his sons goodbye and watches as they run towards 
           their school. After a moment, he takes out his phone and dials.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey. You want to get breakfast?

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Michael and B.J. Armstrong (in warm-up clothes) sit in back. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You know what I really miss? 
                        Playing with those guys. No 
                        endorsements or contracts, just 
                        love for their game.

           A WAITER brings their food and sets it down.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        I think about quitting sometimes. 
                        When all the bullshit surrounding 
                        the sport outweighs the joy of 
                        playing it in the first place. But 
                        then I drive by a playground and 
                        watch these kids still going even 
                        when it’s almost too dark to see. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG (CONT'D)
                        They’re just hoping to keep playing 
                        as long as possible. And then I 
                        show up to practice the next day. 
                        They remind me of something.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What’s that?

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Innocence. Only way you can play.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... You think that’s why I left the 
                        NBA? That I “lost my innocence?”

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Shit, I don’t know, you figure I just 
                        spend all day thinking about you?

           Michael chuckles. Then he grows contemplative as B.J. eats.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m not coming back to basketball.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Okay. So what are you gonna do now?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I don’t know.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Michael and B.J. walk to their cars after breakfast.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        You got practice?

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Yeah, in an hour.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        All right. Take care.

           They hug goodbye. Michael watches B.J. go to his car. Then:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... You want to shoot around first?

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Friendly game of H.O.R.S.E., huh?
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Friendly game of H.O.R.S.E. That’s 
                        it.

           B.J. smirks: he can see the writing on the wall.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        ... Yeah, all right.

           INT. BERTO CENTER - DAY

           Michael — still in his suit — shoots a jumper from three-
           point range. Doesn’t go in. B.J. is in his practice gear.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Someone lost the touch... 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Oh, we’re not done. 

           B.J. takes the same shot Michael missed. It goes in. Then 
           B.J. goes to the side of the court and hits another shot. 
           Michael goes to the same spot, and sinks it.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Think you can still guard me?

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Think you can still guard me?

                                                                CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER: Michael — still in his suit — plays B.J. one-
           on-one. Michael has the ball with B.J. on defense.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        You know I was an All-Star last 
                        year, right?

           Michael fakes left, then twists around and goes right, scoring.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Wanna compare highlight reels?

           B.J. starts dribbling towards the basket.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        You at least gonna get some shoes?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No, this is good. Don’t stop.
           LATER: Michael defends B.J. Now his suit jacket is off and his 
           tie is loosened. They’re now both covered in sweat, talking 
           trash. B.J. goes up to score and BLAM — Michael blocks him. 

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        Foul!

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        What?

           LATER: Now even sweatier, his sleeves rolled up, his loafers 
           still on, Michael has the ball. He takes a drive towards the 
           basket and soars in the air, putting in a perfect layup.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s game. 
                             (laughs)
                        You still can’t guard me. 

           They’re both out of breath, Michael grinning.

                                 B.J. ARMSTRONG
                        C’mon, 10-7, that’s respectable —

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        — And I had loafers on.

           They hear the CHATTER of teammates, and look up to see Phil 
           Jackson and the Chicago Bulls, all in workout gear, arriving.

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        Hey, Michael.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey.

           A moment where no one quite knows what to say. 

                                 PHIL JACKSON
                        So you gonna change or what?

           Michael beams, almost giddy.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Michael lies in a bench press in his expansive home gym, his 
           personal trainer Tim Grover once again spotting him.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Basketball body.

                                 TIM GROVER
                        Basketball body. Okay.
           INT. JORDAN MANSION - NIGHT

           Michael, sweaty from his workout, lets Tim out of the house.

                                 TIM GROVER
                        Same time tomorrow?

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Yeah, after practice.

           Michael lets Tim out. He hears the TELEVISION on in the 
           living room. He enters to find Juanita watching the news.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... After attending Bulls practices 
                        over the past week, the entire 
                        country is waiting to see if Michael 
                        Jordan is returning to basketball.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I’m just messing around with the 
                        team. I’m not even sure what I'm 
                        gonna do.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        Yeah, you are. You’ve known since 
                        Christmas. Maybe you’re a little 
                        grateful for that baseball strike?

           Michael looks at her about to protest, but then watches the 
           TV: crowds have gathered outside the United Center statue.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... Dozens of fans are camped out 
                        at the United Center by the Jordan 
                        statue in a week-long vigil...

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I can’t go back. They put up a 
                        statue. They retired the number.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        So what? It’s what you want to do.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I'd be going back on everything I said. 

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        You don’t have to explain yourself 
                        to anyone. You can be proud. You 
                        know he loved you, right? 

           Michael grows quiet and vulnerable.
                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... I’m not a baseball player. Why did 
                        I think - why did I think I could -

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        - You were a good son. This past 
                        year a half? That was for him. But 
                        this? This is for you. 

           Michael contemplates as the TV news about him continues.

           INT. JORDAN MANSION - DAY

           Michael opens the door to his home, revealing his agents David 
           Falk and Curtis Polk. They look at him expectantly. 

           SUPER: March 18, 1995

           INT. JORDAN MANSION OFFICE - DAY

           Michael sits with David and Curtis. No one speaks for a beat.

                                 DAVID FALK
                        ... Your legacy wasn't in danger 
                        with baseball. But if you come 
                        back, and you're not, well, Michael 
                        Jordan... 

           Michael looks at the surrounding trophies and memorabilia. 

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        They want legacy, they can have the 
                        statue. I don't give a shit. 

                                 DAVID FALK
                        ... Well, I guess we can un-retire 23 
                        and bring it down from the rafters.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        No. Not 23.

                                 CURTIS POLK
                        Then what?

           David smiles, one second ahead of Curtis as we GO TO:

           INT. JERRY REINSDORF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jerry Reinsdorf is on the phone with David and Curtis, 
           although we only see his side of the conversation.
                                 JERRY REINSDORF
                             (into phone)
                        He’ll wear number 45?... Well, I’m 
                        pleased, too... Okay, David. We'll 
                        speak soon.

           He hangs up the phone. Looks at his ASSISTANT. 

                                 JERRY REINSDORF (CONT’D)
                        You want to know one good thing to 
                        come out of this fakakta strike?

           INT. JORDAN MANSION OFFICE - DAY - LATER

           David sits at the desk, pen in hand, as Curtis stands over 
           him. Michael paces off to the side. David reads from the page:

                                 DAVID FALK
                        “Michael Jordan is announcing that 
                        effective immediately he is 
                        rejoining the Chicago Bulls. Michael 
                        enjoyed his time in baseball 
                        immensely, which has reawakened his 
                        desire to play his favorite sport.”

                                 CURTIS POLK
                        I think the second one was stronger. 
                        Maybe “chosen sport” sounds better?

           Michael approaches the desk. Grabs a pen and paper.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        We don’t have to justify it. We’re 
                        giving everybody what they want.

           Michael leans over and writes something on the piece of 
           paper. It doesn’t take him long. We don’t yet see the words.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... There you go.

           David and Curtis look at Michael’s unseen statement. They smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CLOSE-UP OF THE HEADLINE. It simply reads:

                                        “I’m back.”

                                                AND WE REVEAL WE’RE IN:
           INT. TERRY FRANCONA’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Terry sits at his breakfast table, in Barons uniform, his 
           newspaper open to the picture of his friend Michael Jordan. 
           His wife Jacque enters carrying their baby, hectic.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA
                        Can you take the baby?

           She hands Terry the baby. He looks at the headline, then back 
           at her, a goofy, romantic, sentimental grin on his face.

                                 TERRY FRANCONA
                        Hey. I love you.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA
                        Why are you being weird?

           He keeps grinning at her. The baby laughs.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        ... I love you, too.

           He pulls Jacque onto his lap. They look at the paper together. 
           The phone RINGS. Jacque answers:

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Jacque’s eyes widen. She covers the phone.

                                 JACQUE FRANCONA (CONT’D)
                        It’s Buddy Bell in Detroit. 

           OFF TERRY, his life about to change once again, we GO TO:

           INT. JORDAN MANSION PLAYROOM - DAY

           Michael plays basketball with his sons Jeffrey and Marcus. 
           He’s on his knees as they both defend him.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        It’s Bulls versus Pacers, first 
                        game back... Daddy’s going for the 
                        basket... He shoots...

           Michael shoots a hook shot into the small basket. The kids 
           SHRIEK HAPPILY and chase the ball. Juanita enters.

                                 JUANITA JORDAN
                        George called from the car. He’ll 
                        be in here five minutes. 
           Michael turns to his sons:

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        Hey guys, I gotta go in a minute.

           The kids stop playing. They look at Michael, worried.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        ... But I’ll be back in a couple of 
                        days, all right?

           The kids smile and return to playing. He watches them dribble 
           the ball. And as we focus on the ball being shot, we GO TO: 

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY - 1976

           Young Michael shoots baskets alone. James comes out, carrying 
           baseball gear. Michael eyes his father but keeps shooting. 

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        We got work to do. The Babe Ruth 
                        League’s been rough, no question, 
                        but with some more focus on the 
                        fundamentals I think we can —

           Young Michael shoots. Swish.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        I’m busy.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Son, I’m sorry, but you don’t have 
                        the height for basketball. No one 
                        in our family’s over six feet.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Then I’ll make myself grow. 

           Young Michael shoots. The ball bounces to James, who grabs it. 

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Give me the ball.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                             (stern)
                        I’m your father. Show respect, now.

                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        Give me the ball. Sir.

                                 JAMES JORDAN
                        Michael, you can be mad at me your 
                        whole life, won’t do you any good.
                                 YOUNG MICHAEL
                        It’s not about you.

           Prolonged eye-contact. And then James passes the ball back to 
           his son. Defiantly, Young Michael shoots a basket. Defeated 
           and resigned, James turns and leaves with the baseball gear. 

           Young Michael watches him go, debating whether to say 
           anything. But then he turns back, begins dribbling towards 
           the basket, and as he pulls up for a jumper, we GO TO:

           I/E. MICHAEL’S PRIVATE PLANE - DAY

           Michael sits alone on his private plane, lost in thought.

                                 CAPTAIN (OVER P.A.)
                        Mr. Jordan, we’ll be landing in 
                        Indianapolis shortly.

           As the plane descends, Michael looks out the window. He 
           catches his own reflection — for a moment, it doubles, as 
           though it’s him and his father James; the way it had in the 
           car when he was driving to baseball practice a year ago...

           ... But this time, Michael doesn’t smile. He watches the 
           double reflection as the plane lands. Impetuously, he punches 
           the seat in front of him. Tears well up and pour down his 
           face. He punches the seat over and over again.

           Finally, he gathers himself and stops crying. Wipes the tears 
           from his eyes. The plane has landed. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT enters. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Mr. Jordan, we’ve arrived.

           Michael is silent, almost disoriented. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Jordan... Are you ready?

           Michael takes a moment. Recovers. Remembers where he is.

                                 MICHAEL JORDAN
                        ... Yeah. I’m ready.

           INT. MARKET SQUARE ARENA VISITING LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON: MICHAEL’S BARE TORSO, as he places the red visiting 
           Bulls jersey, #45, on his back.

           — March 19, 1995
           REVEAL that Michael is one of many players and coaches in the 
           locker room. We stay with Michael as he greets his teammates. 
           We notice B.J. Armstrong, Toni Kukoc and Scottie Pippen. 

           Phil Jackson approaches Michael with a clipboard. As Phil 
           explains a play, Michael pulls up his warm-up pants. As the 
           team and coaches exit the locker room WE FOLLOW THEM INTO:

           INT. MARKET SQUARE ARENA TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           We STAY WITH MICHAEL as the Bulls head towards the arena. 

           TITLE: Michael Jordan returned to number 23 on his 23rd game 
           back in the NBA, five weeks after the end of the Major League

           TITLE: The following season, he led the Chicago Bulls to the 
           best record in NBA history and the first of three more 
           consecutive titles. They won their first championship of 
           Jordan's second NBA career on June 16, 1996; Father's Day.

           Michael and the team disappear through the entrance into:

           INT. MARKET SQUARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Michael and the Bulls head to the visiting team section. They 
           sit on the chairs in their warm-up gear.

           TITLE: Michael Jordan won the league MVP twice after his 
           return, and the NBA Finals MVP three more times. 

           The Bulls non-starters line up on the court in two lines 
           preparing for the starters’ introductions.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        This is the starting lineup for 
                        today's visitors, the Chicago Bulls.

           TITLE: Terry Francona became the third base coach for the 
           Detroit Tigers in 1996, then manager of the Philadelphia 
           Phillies in 1997 following Jordan’s call of recommendation. In 
           2004, Francona steered the Boston Red Sox to their first World 
           Series win in 86 years, followed by a second title in 2007. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) (CONT’D)
                        At one forward, six seven from 
                        Central Arkansas, number 33, 
                        Scottie Pippen...
           Michael watches as Scottie Pippen stands up and runs between 
           the two lines of teammates, slapping high fives with them.

           TITLE: Francona currently manages the Cleveland Indians, where 
           he was named American League Manager of the Year in 2013. He 
           took the Indians to the World Series in 2016.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) (CONT’D)
                        At the other forward, six eleven from 
                        Croatia, number seven, Toni Kukoc...  

           Toni Kukoc runs through the two lines of teammates.

           TITLE: Michael Jordan was inducted to the Naismith Basketball 
           Hall of Fame on September 11, 2009. He is currently the owner

                        Vanderbilt, number 32, Will Perdue...

           Michael watches Will Perdue runs through the two lines of 
           teammates, slapping them high-fives.

           TITLE: Michael Jordan widely remains considered the greatest 
           basketball player of all time. 

           B.J. Armstrong runs through the lines, but we’re CLOSE ON 
           MICHAEL again, his face focused.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) (CONT’D)
                        At one guard, six two from Iowa, 
                        number ten, B.J. Armstrong...

           TITLE: In 1994 he hit .202 with 3 home runs and 51 RBIs for 
           the Birmingham Barons and .252 for the Scottsdale Scorpions. 

           CLOSE ON MICHAEL’S FACE: He grows more determined, more 
           concentrated. The cheers are so loud now we can barely hear:

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) (CONT’D)
                        At the other guard, six six from 
                        North Carolina, number 45, Michael 
                        Jordan.

           Michael leaps up from the chair and into his future.

                                                                 BLACK.
