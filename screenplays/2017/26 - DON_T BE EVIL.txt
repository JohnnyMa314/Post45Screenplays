                        Hey, Edison, I think I can improve your 
                        motors and generators in a really cool way 
                        and it’ll be super great for humanity.

                        Well, we can’t just do it ourselves. 

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Why not?

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        You mean start a company?

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Yeah. 

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        Because corporations are evil.

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Not all corporations.

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        Just successful ones.

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        It’s not enough to invent things if 
                        nobody uses them.

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        Corporations are at odds with the public 
                        good. Look at Standard Oil. Microsoft. 
                        Monsanto. 

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Someday everyone will get information 
                        from the Internet. Whoever controls 
                        search is going to control access. Who 
                        would you rather trust with that 
                        responsibility? Some suit? Some 
                        government official? Or us?

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        Definitely us. But can a company, any 
                        company, whose sole reason for existence 
                        is growth and profit, be trustworthy? 
                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Why not? 

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        Other than the fact that it’s never been 
                        done? How about organizational theory?

           Larry gives him a look.

                                 SERGEY ‘97 (CONT’D)
                        Bureaucratic bullshit. 

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Look at grad school. Stanford takes a cut 
                        of the profits of innovation they 
                        subsidize and they use that money to 
                        subsidize more innovation. Why can’t we 
                        use that model for a business?

           The idealism hangs in the air for a moment.

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        You really want to give up on our PhDs?

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        Not give up. Just... postpone. Once the 
                        business is up and running we’ll come 
                        back and finish.

                                 SERGEY ‘97
                        A company that values morals over profits.

                                 LARRY ‘97
                        A force for good in the world.

                                 SERGEY ‘97

                                 LARRY ‘97

                        We don't know yet. It looks like the

                        accessed a computer here in Mountain View

           Everyone in the room looks at RANI LAI (20s), fresh out of 
           law school suddenly thrust in the middle of an

           Marissa reaches into the refrigerator but stops. There is 
           a piece of chocolate cake with a note on it that says, 
           “Don’t Be Evil.”

                        Agreed. It’s degrading to the company. 
                        Their record on human rights is abysmal, 
                        and they’d force us to censor our own

           WIDER. Larry in foreground. A whiteboard is wheeled in

                        It’s easy to know that you shouldn’t eat 
                        someone else’s cake. But what if the cake 
                        has been there for a few days. What if 
                        that person quit and will never see that 
                        cake again?

           David draws two columns and writes “To be in China” 
           /”or”/ “Not to be in China.”

                        is the least evil, we accept the 
                        collateral damage.

            The board is now filled with pros and cons.

                        The Chinese Government’s Great Firewall 
                        is sophisticated enough that it blocks 
                        the connection to roughly fifty percent 
                        of people trying to access Google dot com 
                        from China.

                                 ERIC ‘04
                        So you can mark that as ‘more information 
                        to Chinese web users’ if we are operating 
                        there with Chinese Government permission.

           David ‘04 writes it on the whiteboard.

                                 LARRY ‘04
                        And the Chinese schools can’t afford 
                        international bandwidth so if we were in 
                        China...

                        ultimately give Chinese users more 
                        information and make China more open.

                        If we’re operating there, we can put 
                        pressure on the government to loosen 
                        censorship rules. Google can change China.

                        To be fair, you said it was evil to do 
                        business with the Chinese government, not 
                        that it would lead to them hacking us.

                        This laptop is just a foothold into other 
                        parts of our network. If they know we’re 
                        on to them, they’ll cover their tracks 
                        and burrow deeper.

                        Or they lay dormant for months, years maybe, 
                        and strike us when we least expect it.

                        What if it was just a normal hacker who 
                        got lucky?

                                 HEATHER
                        Not likely. This wasn’t a botnet spamming a 
                        minefield across the Internet that some 
                        employee just happened to stumble upon. It 
                        was a surgical attack. They targeted Xumei 
                        because she has useful access credentials 
                        and a permeable social network.

                                 DAVID
                        Hold on. You’re suggesting we just leave 
                        the hackers in our system?

           There is a general shifting in seats and several people 
           start to talk but have nothing to say.

                                 HEATHER
                        Yes. And we set up a blackbox recorder to 
                        monitor the attack in progress.

                                 LARRY
                        But what about protecting our code?

                        It’s too late, Larry. They’re through the

                        Heather’s team got to work analyzing the 
                        network breach.

           INT. FOUNDER’S LOFT - 2009 - DAY

           Dorm room meets The National Air & Space Museum. Ping-
           pong table, astronaut’s suit, AstroTurf flooring, 
           electronic-gadgets. Sergey on the phone.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        While Sergey called every cyber security 
                        expert in the world himself...

           INT. MORGAN MAYHEM’S APARTMENT - NEW ZEALAND - 2009 - DAY

           A dingy warehouse apartment with far too many blinking 
           lights and whirring things. Death metal plays. 

           A phone rings.
           MORGAN MARQUIS-BOIRE “MAYHEM” (29), dressed in black with 
           multiple hoop earrings and a do-rag over dreadlocks, stops 
           making a sandwich and answers his phone.

                                 MORGAN
                                (Kiwi accent)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH: Sergey in Founder’s Loft.

                                 SERGEY
                        Hello, may I please speak to Morgan 
                        Marquis-Boire aka Morgan Mayhem?

                                 MORGAN
                        Never heard of him.

                                 SERGEY
                        This is Sergey Brin from Google.

           Morgan hangs up his phone.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Morgan takes his sandwich and walks OFF CAMERA.

           INT. FOUNDER’S LOFT - 2009 - CONTINUED FROM BEFORE

           Sergey talks on the phone while operations moves his 
           elliptical resistance pedals out from under his table.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        Sergey took a particular interest in the 
                        project, moving his workstation from the 
                        Founder’s Loft...

           INT. WAR BUILDING - 2009 - DAY

           Operations sets up Sergey’s pedals under a desk and he puts 
           a laptop on it. He’s still talking on the phone.

                                 SERGEY
                        We’re offering a one-hundred-thousand 
                        dollar signing bonus.

                                (to CAMERA)
                        To the new war room. War Building, I should 
                        say. Housing the biggest security team a 
                        fortune 500 company ever put together.
           The war building goes from being empty to full of the 
           growing SECURITY TEAM typing furiously at workstations. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        Here they are conducting systems 
                        forensics, back-tracing event logs, and 
                        doing malware analysis. 

           Pause. The Security Team stares intently at their 
           computer screens behind him. Silence, except for the 
           rhythmic clacking of keys.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        Not exactly the most cinematic thing in the 
                        world but... uh... trust me, a lot is 
                        happening right now. Really exciting stuff.

           Another pause.

                        We’ll check back with them later. 

           INT. GOOGLE RECEPTION - 2009 - DAY

           JACKIE RUIZ (30s), giving off a real Agent Scully-vibe, sits 
           stiffly on an exercise ball, waiting. 

           FREEZE FRAME:

           A GOOGLE FACIAL RECOGNITION CIRCLE pops up and identifies her.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                        This is Jaqueline Ruiz. NSA. 

           UNFREEZE.

           WIDER. Jackie sits on a red couch. Larry stands next to her. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        She’s completely fictional because there’s 
                        no way anyone is giving the screenwriters 
                        any information about Google’s very real 
                        relationship with the NSA.

           CAMERA WIDENS to reveal NSA AGENT X.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        This is Jackie’s partner. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        He’s also fictional but totally 
                        unimportant to our narrative so he has no 
                        name.

           Agent X frowns.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        In fact, I’m not sure what he’s doing in 
                        this scene. There are enough white dudes 
                        in this story without giving lines to 
                        fictional ones. 

           NSA Agent X throws his hands up in the air in irritation 
           and disappears in a VFX puff of smoke.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                                (to CAMERA)
                        Here at Google we’re committed to 
                        diversity, both in our company and movies 
                        about our company.

           Jackie does a so-so gesture with her hand and scrunches 
           her face a little. 

                                 HEATHER (O.S.)
                        Sorry to keep you waiting. 

           Jackie turns to see Heather approaching (Narrator Larry 
           has disappeared). She stands and shakes her hand. 

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Heather Adkins, head of Google 
                        Information Security.

                                 JACKIE
                        Jackie Ruiz, NSA.

                                 HEATHER
                        Where’s your partner?

                                 JACKIE
                        He had to go.

                                 HEATHER
                        All right. Why don’t you come on back and 
                        we’ll get you briefed.

           INT. WAR BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - 2009 - LATER

           Jackie talks to Heather and David. 
                                 DAVID
                        So you’re suggesting it’s the Chinese 
                        spying on Chinese spies? 

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s right.

                                 DAVID
                        Why would they do that?

                                 JACKIE
                        Preemptive counterintelligence. They were 
                        searching for court orders authorizing 
                        surveillance on their agents with gmail 
                        accounts. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Ah. So if there was a court order they’d 
                        know their agent was blown? 

                                 JACKIE
                        Yep. They could destroy any evidence and 
                        get that agent out of the country before 
                        the process got any further along. 

                                 DAVID
                        Well, it’s certainly--

           Sergey enters the room in spandex bike shorts and 
           mirrored sunglasses.

                                 SERGEY
                        Hey. Sorry I’m late. Sergey Brin.

           Jackie forces a smile.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        What’d I miss?

                                 HEATHER
                        Agent Ruiz was just giving us her analysis.

                                 SERGEY
                        Uh-huh. It’s the Chinese, right?

                                 JACKIE
                        Well, as I was telling your colleagues--

           Sergey starts stretching.

                                 SERGEY
                        You mind if I stretch?

           Sergey bends over in front of her, showing her his ass.
                                 JACKIE
                        Sure.

                                 SERGEY
                        You were saying?

           Jackie turns back to David and Heather.

                                 JACKIE
                        If you want to find out if your agents 
                        have been discovered, you have two 
                        choices: one, try and hack into the FBI 
                        or NSA networks, pretty hard to do and 
                        there are diplomatic repercussions...

                                 DAVID
                        Or break into companies holding data on 
                        people the courts have served paper on.

                                 JACKIE
                        Not as hard to do. No offense.

                                 HEATHER
                        Hard to take offense. Considering.

                                 JACKIE
                        It's rather ingenious when you think 
                        about it.

           This gets looks from everyone.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        From an academic point of view.

                                 SERGEY
                        So it’s definitely the Chinese then.

                                 JACKIE
                        Most likely. But we won't be able to 
                        determine that for sure until we get a 
                        good look at your network.

           Sergey laughs. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Well, that's not happening.

           Silence.

                                 DAVID
                        What I think Sergey’s trying to say is we 
                        welcome the NSA’s assistance in assessing 
                        the breach of our Law Enforcement Request 
                        System, Agent Ruiz.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        And as this is obviously a National 
                        Security issue we will of course be 
                        keeping you briefed on our own internal 
                        investigation.

                                 JACKIE
                        With all due respect, this is bigger than 
                        Google. This is about the safety of the 
                        Internet.

                                 SERGEY
                        What was your GPA?

                                 JACKIE
                        I'm sorry? 

                                 SERGEY
                        Your grade point average. In high school. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes, I know what a GPA is. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Also, your SAT scores would be helpful. 
                        You’re asking to work with us. It’s an 
                        important data point to determine how 
                        hard you work. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not applying for a job, Mr. Brin. I’m 
                        here as a representative of the United 
                        States government offering to help you 
                        fight a military-grade cyber attack.

                                 SERGEY
                        Yeah, but there's no way in hell we're 
                        giving the NSA access to our network. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Very well then. Here’s my card.

           He doesn’t take it. She puts it down on the table.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        When you change your mind, give me a call.

           Jackie walks to the door.

                                 HEATHER
                        Thank you for your time, Agent Ruiz.

                                 JACKIE
                        We all want the same thing: to protect 
                        your users.
                                 SERGEY
                        Sure. And any domestic surveillance 
                        you’re able to squeeze in is just icing 
                        on the cake.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ll walk you out.

                        But we also have a very stringent 
                        screening process here at Google...

           Stacy pulls a foam core presentation board on new hire metrics 
           from behind the founders loft space suit and holds it up for 
           Larry to point to.

                        We measure a number of metrics to

           INTERCUT WITH:
           INT. GOOGLE JET - 2009 - DAY

           Eric’s on a satellite phone, drinking a cocktail. He has note 
           cards for a speech he’s giving laid out in front of him. The 
           card we can see best says: “21st Century Statecraft.”

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean?

                        What’s our response gonna be?

                                 ERIC
                        Our response? We’re a company, not a 
                        nation state. Not yet, anyway.

           He crosses something out on one of the cards, rewrites it.

                                 SERGEY
                        I think we should publicly rebuke the 
                        Chinese government and stop censoring 
                        search results on Google dot cn.

                                 SERGEY
                        Why not?

                                 ERIC
                        You know why not, Sergey. If we stop 
                        filtering on Google dot cn the Chinese 
                        government will shut us down.

                                 SERGEY
                        So?

                                 SERGEY
                        All the evidence points to the Chinese.

                                 SERGEY
                        Of course we don’t have anything definitive. 
                        That would be next to impossible.

                                 LARRY
                        Well, we can’t go public if we don’t have 
                        proof.

                                 ERIC
                        This is the cost of doing business in China, 
                        Sergey. Let’s assess the damage and figure 
                        out how to patch the hole and move on.

           Sergey gives Larry a look. Larry shrugs.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        All right, boys. Good talk. I’ll see you 
                        when I get back from Washington.

           Eric hangs up.

                                 SERGEY
                        Asshole.

           On the Google Jet, Eric crunches his ice, and goes back 
           to his cards.

                        revenues.

                        Come on, Larry, let’s be serious.

                                 LARRY ‘99
                        I am being serious.

                        Yahoo isn’t even at one billion in revenue.

                        Soon every human being in the world will 
                        be on the web. Billions of people 
                        connected. Talking. Shopping. Learning. 

                                 LARRY ‘99
                        Eventually everything people do offline, 
                        they’ll do online. 

                                 SERGEY ‘99
                        As the web grows more and more complex, 
                        people will need a simpler way to get 
                        useful information. 

                                 LARRY ‘99
                        The Internet is chaos. And we’ve given 
                        everyone a map. 

           Doerr shakes his head.

                                 JOHN DOERR
                        Bullshit. 

                                 MIKE MORITZ
                        But I do believe in the Internet...

                                 JOHN DOERR
                        But I’ll bet big on any technology that 
                        makes the Internet work better. 

                                 MIKE MORITZ
                        I’m in.

                        Let’s do it.

                        No way. Look what happened to Steve Jobs. 

                                 SERGEY ‘99
                        Yeah, but we’re dead in the water without 
                        them. 

                                 LARRY ‘99
                        We don’t need to hire a CEO. We can run

           Sergey, wearing a Santa hat, drinks whiskey out of the 
           bottle and talks on the phone. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Yeah. As soon as Eric’s off the jet I 
                        want you back in Mountain View... Uh-
                        huh... thanks.

           Heather comes in.

                                 HEATHER
                        Going somewhere?

                                 SERGEY
                        No, I just want Eric to have to fly

                                 HEATHER
                        Real mature.

                                 SERGEY
                        I’m nothing if not mature.

           Heather sits down. She looks haggard.
                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        You look haggard.

                                 HEATHER
                        Thanks. You too.

           He pushes an old pizza box toward her.

                        Cold pizza du jour?

           She takes a slice.

                                 HEATHER
                        Merry fucking Christmas.

                                 SERGEY
                        It’s not Christmas, is it?

           She gives him a look.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        Weird. I should probably call my wife.

                                 HEATHER
                        Probably.

           He doesn’t call his wife.

                                 SERGEY
                        I meant in general, not right this second.

           She nods.

                                 HEATHER
                        So we should talk at some point about 
                        what we’re going to do once this current 
                        crisis is under control.

                                 SERGEY
                        What do you mean?

                                 HEATHER
                        Well, obviously I’m going to resign.

                                 SERGEY
                        Why would you do that?

                                 HEATHER
                        This happened on my watch.

                                 SERGEY
                        None of us saw this coming.
                                 HEATHER
                        I should have. That’s my job.

                                 SERGEY
                                (shrugs)
                        We were all naive. Now we’re not.
                        Besides, if you quit, we’d have to hire 
                        the best person in the business to 
                        replace you and that person is you so 
                        we’d waste a lot of time having you go 
                        through the hiring process again.

           She smiles. They share a moment. Broken by Sergey 
           breaking out into a loud yawn and stretch.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        Ah, man. How are we going to get 
                        definitive proof it was the Chinese?

                                 HEATHER
                        I don’t know. It’s not like we can hack 
                        the servers in Taiwan.

           They look at each other. Can they?

                                 SERGEY
                        Why can’t we?

                                 HEATHER
                        Hack the servers?

                                 SERGEY
                        Yeah.

                                 HEATHER
                        Technically or legally?

                                 SERGEY
                        What's the issue? It's our data.

                                 HEATHER
                        On a foreign company's server.

                                 SERGEY
                        What if we just looked? They won't even 
                        know we're there. At least we could see 
                        what's been stolen.

                                 HEATHER
                        Just look and don't delete anything?
                                 SERGEY
                        Yes. We just document the evidence. Hell, 
                        we can even copy the data, it's our 
                        friggin data. Right?

           Heather shrugs like, “I guess???”

                                 HEATHER
                        If we’re going to do this let’s be 
                        discrete about it.

                                 SERGEY
                        So don’t tell David.

                                 HEATHER
                        Definitely don’t tell David. Only tell 
                        your lawyer after you commit a crime, 
                        never before.

           Morgan makes a face.

                        With us. That did not sound how I 
                        intended it to. But our cafeteria is--

                                 MORGAN
                        Nah. I know, that’s cool, but there’s nothing 
                        you can say to make me work for Google.

                                 SERGEY
                        I want you to hack the Chinese government.

                                 MORGAN
                        All right. I’m in.

                        Actually, Morgan had already been working 
                        for us for a year in Zurich but that 
                        seemed like a better scene than this.

           INT. GOOGLE ZURICH - 2009 - DAY

           Morgan plays video games on his laptop. A SWISS GOOGLER 
           walks up to him.

                        If movies about hacking have taught us 
                        anything, it’s that hacking is a very 
                        difficult thing to make visually 
                        interesting. 

           We see the exact SHOTS Larry mentions of Morgan hacking.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        You add camera pans. Close-ups of code. 
                        You use clunky techno-babble to explain 
                        what’s going on even though everyone in 
                        the movie would already know what you 
                        were doing.

                        Most malware, even written by the best 
                        hackers, is sloppy code. So I sent the 
                        GUI (gooey) a shit-ton of random commands 
                        and found an overflow bug to install our 
                        own trojan on their server.

                        Followed by a simplified explanation for 
                        the benefit of the audience.

                                 HEATHER
                        So you reverse-engineered the hack?

                                 MORGAN
                        Exactly.

           The trojan control panel installation finishes.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, here we go.

                                 HEATHER
                        Point of no return.

                                 SERGEY
                        Do it.

           Morgan pushes a button and pulls up the trojan horse control 
           panel. He’s in.

                                 MORGAN

                        Pwned. That’s totally something hackers 
                        say, right? They’re so jacked in. In any 
                        case, we hacked our hackers, copied all 
                        the data they’d stolen...

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        But the party had to end sometime...

                                 MIKE MORITZ
                        Seventy-five thousand dollars for beer 
                        and liquor, a private chef, and a 
                        masseuse for a goddamn ski trip? 

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        We have the very smartest computer 
                        scientists in the world working for 
                        Google, a startup. 

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        They could be making more money 
                        elsewhere, but they love working for 
                        Google because of the culture and perks.

                                 JOHN
                        Where are you with the CEO search?

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        Actually, Sergey and I have been thinking 
                        about it...
                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Yeah. We’ve been thinking about it and... 
                        uh ...the thing is... we were thinking.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        Yeah. We’ve come to the conclusion that 
                        we think we can run the company.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        By ourselves.

           Mike and John sit quietly for a moment. Then...

                                 JOHN
                        We had a very clear understanding.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        But we feel with the Netscape and Yahoo 
                        deals we’ve proven ourselves.

                                 MIKE MORITZ
                        The deals are good but you still need 
                        adult supervision.

                                 JOHN
                                (flips through cash flow )
                        You’re projecting about nineteen million in 
                        revenue this year. But look at these 
                        operation costs, over thirty-three million. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re going to run out of cash.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        We just don’t think we need to bring 
                        someone in.

           Mike gets up.

                                 MIKE MORITZ
                        Listen you little shits, you’re looking 
                        at over fourteen million in losses. If 
                        you don’t honor your commitment to hire a 
                        CEO, I’ll sue your pasty elitist J.R.R. 
                        Tolkien-reading asses for the twelve-
                        point-five-million dollars I gave you and 
                        throw your dead carcasses in a mass grave 
                        with the rest of the festering failed dot 
                        coms littering the Valley.

           Mike slams the door on his way out. Beat.
                                 JOHN
                        Here’s an idea. I’ll set up meetings for 
                        you with a few of the best CEOs in the 
                        industry so you can see what a battle-
                        scarred CEO can offer. After that, if you 
                        still want to call off the hunt we can all 
                        see each other in court. How’s that sound?

           Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 look to each other, a telepathic 
           decision.

                        companies on the Taiwan server. At least. 

                                 SERGEY
                        You’re kidding.

                                 SERGEY
                        Wow.

                        And that’s not the worst of it.

                                 SERGEY
                        What’s the worst of it?

           INT. DAVID DRUMMOND’S OFFICE - 2009 - DAY

           Sergey bursts in with a laptop, sets it down in front of David. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Google user accounts have been hacked.

                                 DAVID
                        Good morning, Sergey. How are you today?

           Sergey puts the laptop down on David’s desk. There’s a 
           picture and bio of TENZIN SELDON (early 20s) on a website 
           for Students for a Free Tibet. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Tenzin Seldon. She’s a student at Stanford 
                        and a Chinese Human Rights activist.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus.
                                 SERGEY
                        She’s one of two hacked users that we’ve 
                        found so far. 

           David gets his phone out.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll call the President of Stanford. 
                        We’ll find Ms. Seldon. See if we can 
                        analyze her laptop.

           David places a call, holds the phone to his ear.

                                 SERGEY
                        I want a security team sent to make sure 
                        she’s okay.

                                 DAVID
                        How did you guys find this out?

                                 SERGEY
                        We may have done some light hacking of 
                        the Taiwanese servers that the hackers 
                        are using.

           David covers his face with his hands.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, God. Sergey, tell me you didn’t.

                                 SERGEY
                        It’s like following a burglar back to his 
                        apartment and breaking in to get your 
                        stuff back.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s not legal either. Like at all. 
                        Don’t tell me anything else. And don’t do 
                        anything else.

                        Get the Operating Committee in here now. 
                        I’m calling an emergency meeting.

           INT. STEVE JOBS’ OFFICE, APPLE HQ - 2001 - DAY

           STEVE JOBS (yes, that Steve Jobs) rhapsodizes. Larry ‘01 
           and Sergey ‘01 in awe.
                                 STEVE JOBS
                        Whatchya gotta look out for is the B 
                        players. They attract more B players. 
                        Before you know it you’ve got C players 
                        dragging you down. 

           FREEZE FRAME:

           A GOOGLE FACIAL RECOGNITION CIRCLE pops up and identifies him as 
           Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple.

           Larry turns around and looks at the camera.

                                 LARRY
                                (to CAMERA)
                        Yeah. I get it. You’re tired of watching 
                        white dudes in turtlenecks pretending to 
                        be Steve Jobs. But this was seriously a 
                        life-changing moment for Sergey and me. 
                        Don’t worry. He’s only in this one scene.

           UNFREEZE.

           Steve continues.

                                 STEVE JOBS
                        If you pay attention, ask questions and put 
                        in the work, you can pick up running a 
                        business pretty easy. But the right CEO can 
                        grow your company a hundred percent faster 
                        with ninety percent fewer mistakes.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        But what about losing control?

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        We’ve heard the stories.

                                 STEVE JOBS 
                        My story. 

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Yeah.

                                 STEVE JOBS
                        You’re lucky to come after. Learn from my 
                        mistakes. I hired the wrong guy. He 
                        destroyed everything I spent a decade 
                        building, including me.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        That’s what we’re afraid of.
                                 STEVE JOBS
                        So don’t give up control. And remember 
                        product is everything. Sculley was a 
                        marketing guy. After I left, Apple didn't 
                        invent anything new. It happened at Xerox 
                        too. And IBM...

           Larry, eating it up, looks to Sergey.

                                 STEVE JOBS (CONT’D)
                        Companies as they grow somehow insert 
                        layers of management between the people 
                        running the company and the people with 
                        the vision doing the work. That’s what’ll 
                        kill your company. 

           Larry and Sergey are totally enamoured. 

           INT. JOHN DOERR’S OFFICE, KLEINER PERKINS - 2001 - DAY

           A repentant Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 sit across from John.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Upon reflection, we have come to see the 
                        value of hiring a veteran CEO.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        Yes.

                                 JOHN DOER
                        Did you have anyone in mind?

           Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 look at each other and back to John.

                        LARRY ‘01
                                                    SERGEY ‘01
           Steve Jobs.
                                            Steve Jobs.

           John bursts out laughing.

                                 JOHN DOER 
                        Ah-hahahahaha! 
                                (realizes they’re serious)
                        You’re serious? Well, that’s not 
                        happening. But I’m sure we can find 
                        someone almost as good...

           He is being projected onto the wall of-- 

           INT. GOOGLE BOARDROOM - 2009 - NIGHT

           The GOOGLE OPERATING COMMITTEE is convened. Looking at Eric 
           on the wall, it's hard not to think of Big Brother in “1984.”

                                 ERIC

                        We have important new developments

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 SERGEY
                        We should tell the other breached companies.

                        And if the information leaks?

                        We’re in possession of stolen data. It might 
                        be difficult to explain how we got it.

                        What would we want the other companies to 
                        do if the situation were reversed?

           Everyone thinks about this.

                                 LARRY
                        I agree with Sergey on this.

                        All right. Fine. But let’s proceed with 
                        caution. Anything else?

                                 SERGEY
                        Yes. At least two Google user accounts, 
                        Chinese human rights activists by the 
                        way, were accessed through our network.

                                 SERGEY
                        We need to go public with this.

                                 ERIC
                        No way, Sergey.

                                 SERGEY
                        Rebuke the Chinese government. And refuse 
                        to continue censorship on Google dot cn.

                        Sergey, firstly stopping the filtering is not 
                        a proportionate response to being hacked.

           Sergey looks to Larry for help. Larry doesn’t speak.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Secondly if we stopped filtering, the 
                        government would revoke our license to

                        was... you know... sleeping.

                        it?

                                 JACKIE
                        No, it’s fine.

                                 SERGEY
                        It’s one here... which isn’t any better.

                        I’m always up at this hour. It’s one of 
                        the seven habits that make me a highly 
                        effective person. What did you say? About 
                        the Chinese?

                                 SERGEY
                        I need proof the Chinese government is 
                        behind the attack.

                                 JACKIE
                        And what do I get in return?

                        My undying love and gratitude?

                        How about a bribe? I am currently one of

                                 JACKIE
                        You realize I work for an agency that 
                        monitors phone calls, right?

                                 SERGEY
                        So no bribe?
                                 JACKIE
                        Oh, I’m up for a bribe. Just not over the 
                        phone. Look, why don’t you come to 
                        Washington for a day? We'll get you a 
                        temporary security clearance. You can sit 
                        in on classified threat briefings. We can 
                        talk bribe amounts in person.

                                 SERGEY

                                (to CAMERA)
                        Meanwhile, Heather was meeting with the 
                        security heads of the other companies 
                        compromised in the attack.

           INT. WAR BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - 2009 - DAY

           The Security Head sits across from Heather. She’s about 
           to speak when...

                                 ERIC (PRE-LAP)
                        Larry?
           INT. GOOGLE X - 2009 - DAY

           It looks like the lair of a Bond villain designed by 
           Disney Imagineers. Larry has a wire sticking out of his 
           eye running to a laptop on the workbench. 

           Eric approaches and rubs his eyes, grossed out.

                                 ERIC
                        Jesus, Larry. Sorry, to interrupt... Got 
                        a minute?

           Larry removes a contact lens with the wire and a 
           microchip attached and nods to a TECH who starts 
           adjusting something on it with a micro welding tool.

                                 LARRY
                        Weren't you just in Washington?

                                 ERIC
                        Compression of time.

           Larry nods. Eric picks up and examines the “Project Loon” 
           balloon antenna prototype.

                                 LARRY
                        It’s an antenna. We’re going to deliver 
                        cheap Internet access to areas that don’t 
                        have it via balloons in the stratosphere.

                                 ERIC
                        How do you steer the balloons?

                                 LARRY
                        We change the altitude to catch different 
                        wind currents. They travel the world like

                                 LARRY
                        He’s taking the hack very personally.

                                 ERIC
                        He’s going to keep pushing for us to 
                        leave China.

                                 LARRY
                        This is news?

                                 ERIC
                        We need to maintain a united front on this. 
                                 LARRY
                        My position is what it’s always been: go 
                        where the data tells us to go. If Sergey 
                        gets more data, I’ll consider it.

                                 ERIC
                        You know it doesn’t matter who hacked us, 
                        right? We need to stay in China.

                                 LARRY
                        Why?

                                 ERIC
                        How much is this balloon project costing us?

           Larry shrugs.

                                 LARRY
                        Not that much. They’re balloons, Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        But it’s a long shot that may never turn 
                        a profit.

           Eric gestures to all the Google X moonshots around the room.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        We need profits to subsidize these 
                        moonshots of yours. Otherwise we’re Nikola 
                        Tesla inventing things that no one uses.

           This lands with Larry.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        You’re the visionary Larry. You’re always 
                        looking forward. We need that. But my job 
                        is to turn your visions into viable 
                        businesses to pay for more visions. Let 
                        me do my job. Don’t give up on a market 
                        with four-hundred-million potential 
                        users. Think of what it costs to grow the 
                        market by that amount.

           Eric leaves blinking and rubbing his eyes. Larry watches 
           him go. He gives the CAMERA some side eye.

           INT. OLD PRO BAR, PALO ALTO - 2001 - CONTINUED FROM BEFORE

           Campbell, still frozen mid-hamburger chew.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        Anyway, Bill Campbell. He refused to take 
                        more than one dollar a year from us for 
                        his services.

           UNFREEZE. 

           Campbell talks with food in his mouth.

                                 COACH CAMBELL
                        You know, the pact you three either make 
                        or don’t make tonight, will determine 
                        whether Google succeeds or fails.

           Now a swig of Bud Light to wash it down.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        Ya got two scenarios: one, you figure out 
                        a system that works for you with checks 
                        and balances; or two, like a bunch of 
                        goddamn politicians, you devolve into 
                        partisan infighting and destroy the thing 
                        you were trying to build. 

           Larry ‘01, Sergey ‘01, and Eric ‘01 look uncomfortably at 
           each other.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s stop messing around. Larry and 
                        Sergey, you think Larry should be CEO and 
                        that the VC’s forced you into bringing 
                        Eric on board.

           Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 stammer.

                                 COACH CAMBELL (CONT’D)
                        Come on, cut the shit.

                        LARRY ‘01
                                                    SERGEY ‘01
           Yes.
                                            Yeah.

                                 COACH CAMBELL 
                        Good! Honesty.
           Coach Campbell gives Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 high fives. 
           It’s a bit awkward.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        Eric you feel like Larry and Sergey are 
                        actively working against you. 

                                 ERIC ‘01
                        Yes.

                                 COACH CAMBELL
                        Well, all right.

           Campbell high fives Eric ‘01.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        Larry and Sergey, what do you most enjoy 
                        doing?

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        Developing products. 

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Yes. But marketing decisions, strategy 
                        and management are important to us too.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        Okay. Now what do you want from Eric?
                               (blank looks from Sergey & Larry)
                        What do you least enjoy?

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Legal. Sales.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        There. That’s where Eric takes the lead. 
                        Eric, what’s the most interesting problem 
                        facing Google?

                                 ERIC ‘01
                        Revenue.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Agreed.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        Eric, that means spending time with the 
                        ads team, so people know what the 
                        priority is.
                                 LARRY ‘01
                        But we have lots of priorities that are 
                        important. I want to digitize all the 
                        books in the world--

           Larry ‘01 and Marissa ‘01, bored, scan books page by

                        Larry, Larry, Larry. You gotta crawl 
                        before you walk, buddy. Search engine pun 
                        intended. Get one fucking business running 
                        before you start another. Eric, what else?

                                 ERIC ‘01
                        I need to build a management team.

                                 LARRY ‘01
                        We don’t want a bunch of business managers 
                        telling the engineers what to do.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        I agree. You don’t want to make engineers 
                        beholden to a buncha product-marketing 
                        people. No great technological idea is 
                        going to come from management.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        Exactly.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        But if the goal is to empower engineers, 
                        you need managers who deeply understand 
                        the product and will let the engineers 
                        take the technological lead.

                                 ERIC ‘01
                        I agree with that.
                                 LARRY ‘01
                        So do we.

           Another high five for Larry ‘01.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        Then boys, let Eric build a management team 
                        and you help him draft the players. Next we 
                        gotta define the decision-making process. 
                        You have to workout issues privately, and 
                        then present decisions as a united front. 
                        And every voice must have a chance to 
                        express dissent.

                                 SERGEY ‘01
                        But opinions, even experienced opinions, 
                        mean nothing to us without data to back 
                        them up.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        So lobby each other with data, then vote. 
                        Majority rules.
                                (to Eric)
                        Now that means you might lose an unfair 
                        share of these votes.

                                 ERIC ‘01
                        I don’t mind losing as long as I’m heard.

                                 COACH CAMPBELL
                        That’s why you’re the right guy for the job.

           Coach Campbell gives Eric ‘01 a big bear hug. 

                                 COACH CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                                (to Larry and Sergey)
                        Get over here guys and seal this pact.

           Larry ‘01 and Sergey ‘01 join this bizarre football-
           locker-room-man-love covenant. 

                                 COACH CAMBELL (CONT’D)
                        Long live the triumvirate.

           INT. NSA HEADQUARTERS - 2009 - DAY

           Jackie introduces Sergey and David to NSA PERSONNEL. 
           Sergey is given some papers to sign.

                                 SERGEY
                        What’s this?
                                 JACKIE
                        It’s an agreement saying you won’t disclose 
                        anything you learn in the briefing. 

           Sergey looks at the agreement. 

                                 DAVID
                        Basically, it says if you talk, you’ll be 
                        tried, convicted, and sentenced to life 
                        in a secret prison. 

                                 SERGEY
                        Should you be making secret prison jokes 
                        to a Russian? 

                                 DAVID
                        Not sure it was a joke. And as a Russian 
                        I thought you’d appreciate it more. 

                                 JACKIE
                        If you make secret prison jokes around 
                        the CIA guys they just get real quiet. 

           Sergey and David get uncomfortable, not sure if she’s 
           joking, not sure if they are either. 

           TIME CUT:

           Jackie leads Sergey into the... 

           INT. INFORMATION DOMINANCE CENTER - 2009 - CONTINUOUS

           It looks mostly like the bridge of the “Enterprise NX-01” 
           from Star Trek Enterprise. NSA AGENTS bustle about. Cyber 
           threats are projected onto a large screen in front of them.

                        Wow. I heard you modeled it after the 
                        bridge of the Starship Enterprise.

                        We can’t know for sure what the NSA said 
                        to Sergey during that briefing. It’s 
                        classified. But let’s just say, it was 
                        something exactly like this...

           Orange.” Sergey is in a straightjacket strapped to a 
           chair. His false eyelash-covered eyes are held open and 
           he’s forced to watch images of ultraviolence.

                        Needless to say, it scared the shit out

           Sergey and Jackie sit at a back table, sipping their drinks.

                                 SERGEY
                        So how did you end up at the NSA?

                        My secret agent father was killed by

                        Sounds a little far-fetched.

                                 JACKIE
                        Nope. All women in law enforcement have 
                        similar backstories. Don't you watch

                                 SERGEY
                        Is avoiding questions part of your training 
                        or a built-in trait they screen for?

                        You know, it’s funny, when we started in 
                        China, the government didn’t tell us what to 
                        censor. We were just expected to anticipate 
                        what they’d object to and censor ourselves. 
                        So we did what we do best... we innovated. 
                        Fed millions of search queries into our 
                        competitors search tools to see what they 
                        blocked so our system learned what was 
                        objectionable. We created an algorithm that 
                        would censor faster and more efficiently 
                        than real-life Chinese censors.

                        Is this the part where you say, “We 
                        thought we could change China... but 
                        China changed us.”

                        You know this is just the beginning, 
                        right? Everyone’s living on the Internet 
                        but the Internet’s not a safe place. 
                        China. Russia. North Korea. Al-Qaeda. Us. 
                        I’m not just talking about corporate IP 
                        and grandma’s credit card. Or even nuclear 
                        power plants. It’s the subtle things. 
                        Little hacks that go by almost unnoticed, 
                        but have big consequences. A political 
                        campaign gets hacked. Voter rolls are 
                        stolen. Elections are nudged and suddenly 
                        a whole region that was stable for decades 
                        is in chaos. And not just in the Middle 
                        East. What happens when a foreign 
                        government installs their candidate of 
                        choice in 10 Downing Street? In The 
                        Whitehouse? It's possible. I’m talking 
                        about the destabilization of the world. 
                        For oil. For influence. For money. For the 
                        caliphate. For some machismo power 
                        bullshit.

                        hacker wants to prove they can. We can’t 
                        protect America alone. We need the help of 
                        our technology partners.

                        we can build systems to detect and disable

                        That’s our unofficial motto at Google.

                        An internal motto until now.

                                 ERIC ‘04
                        The idea is we don’t quite know what evil 
                        is, but if we have a rule that says don’t 
                        be evil, employees can say, I think 
                        that’s evil. Right, Larry?

                                 LARRY ‘04
                        Sort of.

                                 ERIC ‘04
                        Now, when I showed up, I thought this was 
                        the stupidest rule ever.

           Larry cringes.

                                 ERIC ‘04 (CONT’D)
                        Because there’s no book about evil. Except 
                        maybe, you know, the Bible or something. 
                        But it’s worked for us. In the end, it’s 
                        about serving the user, right Larry?

                        So we refused to do it.

                        Well, I’m just the adult supervision. 
                        Larry and Sergey are young, but they’re 
                        really, really smart. “I just keep the 
                        trains running on time.”

                        So he wears a suit and sometimes un-
                        ironicaly references fascist dictators but 
                        hiring Eric was the best decision I ever 
                        made as CEO. I used to be in meetings like 
                        this all day long.

           Larry gets up and walks out of the meeting.

           Larry turns to see Sergey. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s okay. I was pretty much out of 
                        relevant backstory anyway.

                        I got it. Proof that China was behind the

                        I’m calling another meeting of the

           Larry has zero desire to talk about this.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        If we continue to do business in China, 
                        I’m out.

                        What do you mean “out?”

                                 SERGEY
                        I’ll resign.

                                 LARRY
                        You’re serious?

           He’s serious.
                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        You do realize China’s just a blip in our 
                        company history, right?

                                 SERGEY
                        Doing evil in China makes it easier to do evil 
                        somewhere else. One blip. Two blips. Pretty 
                        soon it’ll be death by a thousand blips. 

                                 LARRY
                        If I side with you it’s basically a vote 
                        of no confidence against Eric. 

                                 SERGEY
                        So? Then we push him out and you take 
                        back CEO. Wasn’t that always the plan?

                                 LARRY
                        I’m not sure I want to be CEO again.

                                 SERGEY
                        Of course you want to be CEO again. 
                        You’re like Kirk at the beginning of Star 
                        Trek II. It’s the only thing you’ve 
                        wanted since Eric took over but you’re 
                        too goddamned frightened you’re going to 
                        fuck it up to take it back.

                                 LARRY
                        I think I’m more of a Spock.

                                 SERGEY
                        This is your company, Larry. Sure I founded 
                        it with you and I helped but it’s your 
                        vision. And I get it. You want to be Tesla 
                        and hide in your secret lab inventing 
                        driverless cars while Eric handles the 
                        interviews and government regulator 
                        bullshit. But Eric’s a suit. He’s always 
                        been a suit. And maybe we needed that for a 
                        while but we don’t anymore. 

           Larry agrees but doesn’t want to give up his toys.

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        We started this company to give conventional 
                        corporate values the middle finger. But 
                        we’re not unconventional anymore. We are 
                        becoming so very, very conventional. 

           That was just about the worst thing you could say to Larry.

           Conversations die down and everyone looks to Sergey. Sergey 
           looks at Larry staring at his phone. Larry finally looks up.

                        We have a big decision to make, a

                        Spoiler alert: I think we should get out.
           Sergey glances at Larry. Larry looks away, but sees Eric 
           glance at him too. Larry looks down at his phone to avoid 
           them both.

                        As you know, last month Google discovered a 
                        highly sophisticated and coordinated attack 
                        from hackers who’ve been in our source code 
                        and network since April of last year. The 
                        word “Aurora” is in the malware code so 
                        we’re calling it “Operation Aurora” because 
                        everyone’s seen a lot of spy movies I 
                        guess. So what did they get? Morgan?

           NEXT SLIDE: A list of Google’s hacked systems. 

           Larry looks back up from his phone.

                                 MORGAN
                        Well, you already know about the breach of 
                        LERS. That’s how we discovered they were 
                        there. There’s also the two user accounts 
                        of the Chinese Human Rights Activists. Not 
                        good. Also not good, they used our 
                        corporate directory to nick the names of 
                        top software developers working on the 
                        single-password management system for 
                        gmail, search, and all our other apps. 

           Worried looks from Operating Committee members. 

           Larry watches each person as they ask questions and 
           listens to the answers, taking in the data.

                                 MARISSA
                        Did they get user passwords?

                        But you know there’s a warehouse full of 
                        Chinese hackers almost as good as me 
                        scouring the source code for a way in. 
                        Just a matter of time.
                                 SERGEY
                        It’ll need a complete overhaul.

                                 SUSAN WOJCICKI
                        What about the rest of our source code?

                                 SERGEY
                        Compromised. They used a bunch of fancy 
                        hacker moves to gain access through the 
                        SCMs to our source code repositories. 
                        Maybe if you buy Morgan a drink he’ll 
                        explain it to you. 

           Morgan holds up two fingers and mouths “two” to indicate that 
           it would take at least two drinks for him to reveal this.

                        If you buy Morgan two drinks.

           Eric sighs impatiently. Larry doesn’t look at him but he 
           hears it.

                                 MARISSA
                        Has any of our code been altered?

                                 MORGAN
                        Not that we can tell... 

                                 SERGEY
                        But that’s not all.

                        The Adversary, that’s the evil super-
                        villain name the intelligence community 
                        has for these guys--
                                (looks at Marissa)
                        Or girls. Ladies. They could be lady 
                        hackers.

                        Anyway, the Adversary used DNS queries to 
                        look for our signing certificates.

                        With those they’d be able to impersonate 
                        us online. Websites. Software. Financial 
                        transactions. The whole shebang.

                        Thankfully, we keep those offline in an air-
                        gapped network so they weren’t accessible.

                                 SERGEY
                        But remember Google was only one facet of 
                        this attack, over thirty-three other 
                        companies were compromised.

                                 SUSAN WOJCICKI
                        Do we know what data of theirs was 
                        compromised?

                                 SERGEY
                        No. It’s not our data so we haven’t been 
                        analyzing it. Heather’s been meeting with 
                        the security heads of those companies to 
                        tell them about the breach and help in 
                        assessing the damage if they’ll let us.

           Sergey looks to the door.

                        She should be here any second. But 
                        according to our intelligence partner 
                        that’s just the tip of the iceberg. It’s 
                        not just thirty-three companies 
                        compromised or fifty or sixty. There are 
                        thousands of compromised companies. 
                        Actively, right now. In attacks we don’t 
                        even know about.

                        Sergey, this is all very interesting and 
                        scary but you said there was evidence 
                        actually implicating the Chinese government?

                        Ah! Here. Meet Li Changchun. A very senior 
                        leader of the Communist Party of China and

           On Li’s screen is a Google results page with articles

                        We’ve traced the attackers’ IP addresses to

                        The school’s network is operated by a an 
                        associate of, guess who, our biggest

                                 SERGEY
                        Our intelligence partners were tipped off 
                        that the Chinese Government demanded access 
                        to malware tools developed by a Chinese 
                        civilian researcher.  The tools used on us 
                        are almost identical. 

           Sergey looks directly at Larry for his summation.  

                                 SERGEY (CONT’D)
                        I think we can conclude without a doubt 
                        that the attack on our network and 
                        probably the other companies was conducted 
                        by the People’s Republic of China or at 
                        the very least with PRC approval. 

           Larry inputs Sergey’s argument. Eric notices.

                        Also, we thought we were changing China 
                        but China changed us.

                                 ERIC
                        Right. Got it. Thank you. Sincerely, thank 
                        you to you and your entire team for your 
                        tireless efforts. Although it may not be 
                        indisputable evidence of PRC involvement, I 
                        agree that it is conclusive. 

           Sergey is surprised by this concession.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        However, many of us here feel that our 
                        continuing in China is the only option.

                                 SERGEY
                        So it never mattered to you who was 
                        behind the attacks?

                        Stopping filter-- er --censoring on 
                        Google dot cn isn’t a reasonable response 
                        to an attack on our network. It’s 
                        abandoning hundreds of millions of Google 
                        users, six hundred million in revenues 
                        this year alone, and billions upon 
                        billions in the future, the sunk costs of 
                        our very hard-won thirty-three percent 
                        market share. How many times do we have 
                        to have this discussion?

                                 SERGEY
                        Our physical presence in China gave 
                        government hackers access to our global 
                        network. Those government hackers stole 
                        our source code. Those government hackers 
                        breached user data, users whose lives and 
                        liberty are now at risk because of our 
                        greed and need for a thirty-three percent 
                        market share. 

           Eric has no defense for this. Sergey turns to Larry.

                        censorship degrades the peoples’ trust in us. 
                        It makes us unreliable. It makes us evil.

                        equality, opportunity, and human rights.

                        Even if we’re not providing the free and

                        lot more information than if Google wasn’t 
                        in China at all. And what other company is 
                        going to be strong enough or have the 
                        inclination to put pressure on the Chinese 
                        government to push it towards openness?

           Heather Adkins slips into the back of the conference room.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)

                        people. Many of them are clamoring for access 
                        to objective outside news, surveillance free 
                        communication, and for tools that give them 
                        the ability to organize against their 
                        government. And the one’s who aren’t clamoring

                        Our retreat would make them think they were 
                        right. And other authoritarian regimes 
                        would know we can be intimidated with a 
                        hack. We can’t just stand by while China 
                        cements its authoritarian surveillance 
                        state on the internet. This is a 21st 
                        Century technological-arms race. Our 
                        retreat is not an option...

                        I’m sorry, Eric. But I have some information 
                        I think the committee should know about.

                        What?

                                 HEATHER
                        Well, I haven’t talked to all of the 
                        companies compromised in the breach but 
                        it seems that many of them were already 
                        aware.

                        They knew their networks had been breached 
                        but didn’t notify their users or any other 
                        companies who might be vulnerable.

           Larry is shell-shocked. How could they keep it to themselves? 
           We stay on him, dazed, as everyone talks around him.

                        If even one of these companies had come 
                        forward, we might have discovered the 
                        breach sooner... or prevented it.

                        I wouldn’t recommend that. It would open 
                        us up to all kinds of lawsuits.

                        be a number one priority for us. Not just 
                        because our business model relies on it,

                        We have to engage countries like China to

                        We have discovered that at least twenty 
                        other large companies from a wide range of 
                        businesses have been similarly targeted.

           INT. STANFORD COFFEE SHOP - 2010 - DAY

           Tenzin Seldon reads the blog on her laptop in a coffee shop. 

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        A primary goal of the attackers was to 
                        access the Gmail accounts of Chinese 
                        human rights activists.

           She looks out the window. Is there a man watching her 
           across the street? She covers the “Free Tibet” sticker on 
           her laptop with her coffee cup.

           INT. CHARLIE’S CAFE - JANUARY 15, 2010 - EVENING

           A full audience of Googlers. War whoops and high-fives, 
           as Larry, Sergey, and Eric take the stage. 

           They’re all smiles, some more forced than others. 

           Eric steps aside so Sergey can take a bow. The crowd 
           gives him a standing ovation.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        Sergey got a standing ovation at that 
                        week’s TGIF meeting.

           Sergey’s overwhelmed with emotion. It’s been a long road. 

           Sergey pulls Larry alongside him.  Larry gives waves and 
           the cheers surge. The Googlers love these guys.

           Larry looks back at Eric awkwardly standing alone. It’s 
           only a matter of time.

                                 LARRY
                                (to CAMERA)
                        Later that year, we announced that I 
                        would be taking over from Eric as CEO.

           Eric tweets: “Day-to-day adult supervision no longer needed!”

           He looks at the tweet rather wistfully before pushing send.
                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        Don’t feel too bad for him. He’s worth 
                        eleven point five billion dollars....

                        The day we wrote the blog post, the NSA 
                        lawyers cooked up a deal to help us build 
                        a defensive system for our network in 
                        exchange for some of our information.

                        Well, your information.

           INT. WAR BUILDING - JACKIE’S OFFICE - 2010 - DAY

           Jackie looks around to see if anyone is watching her. She 
           pulls out a yellow Post-it and scribbles down notes for 
           what will become known as the MUSCULAR program disclosed 
           by Edward Snowden.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        We soon discovered the NSA used their 
                        intimate knowledge of our system to hack our 
                        network and collect massive amounts of user 
                        data including data belonging to Americans.

           Sergey comes in, all smiles. Jackie covers the Post-it.

                                 SERGEY
                        You wanna grab a drink with me? 

                                 JACKIE
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

                                 SERGEY
                        But how will I make an awkward pass at 
                        you if you won’t have a drink with me?

                                 JACKIE
                        I think you just did.

                                 SERGEY
                        Right.

           She grabs her files and heads for the door.
                                 JACKIE
                                (close to him)
                        Besides, we’re already in bed together... 
                        metaphorically. Professionally.

           She’s out the door. He watches her go.

                                 SERGEY
                        All right. Rain check on the clichéd 
                        advances then.

                                 JACKIE
                                (turning back)
                        You wanted to know the reason I joined the 
                        NSA... When I interviewed with you six years 
                        ago I was told I wasn't Googley enough.

           Dumbfounded, he watches her walk away.

                        Since those hacks we’ve taken the lead in 
                        cyber security worldwide. We have the 
                        largest security staff of any non security

           Xumei and some CHINESE GOOGLE USERS put flowers around the 
           Google sign in front of the Google offices like a grave.

                                 LARRY (V.O.)
                        We tried to work it out with the Chinese

                        Fifty years from now computers will be as

                        And because of all the data we collect on

           A flying car careens out of control and crashes into the 
           wall. The bio engineers drop the vial, panic, and run.

                        Probably.

           A Terminator-like AI walks by shooting a laser cannon.

                        But maybe the cost of sweeping, 
                        revolutionary change...

           Larry passes a NORTH KOREAN HACKER, a RUSSIAN HACKER, and 
           Chinese Hacker #1 with little flags on their desk typing wildly 
           on their computers.

                        Is sweeping, revolutionary consequences.

           Larry walks past an elephant tied to electrodes and over to an 
           electric switch. Sergey hands him a pair of protective goggles.

                        But no matter what we do, no matter how 
                        alarming and reckless it may seem...

                        Rest assured, we’ve weighed the pros and 
                        cons.

                        And chosen the least evil thing to do.

           Sergey flips some switches. Larry puts on the goggles.

                                 SERGEY
                        Good and Evil.

           He flips the switch. Electricity flashes. David Bowie’s 
           “Big Brother” kicks in as we...
