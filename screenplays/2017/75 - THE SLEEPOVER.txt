           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dark. Quiet. Only the faint glow of streetlights through the 
           bay windows illuminate our way through a cozy, suburban home.

           Framed pictures smile back at us. Remnants of homework and 
           dinner spill across the kitchen table. A few discarded toys 
           litter the stairs as we climb up to...

           INT. SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Passing a dimly-lit bathroom, door cracked, night-lite burns. 
           Stopping at an open bedroom door.  

           WE PUSH IN ON A SLEEPING BOY. 

           This is LEWIS KHAROUD, (10), curly black hair, tiny bird-
           chest rising and falling in concert with his sharp nose-
           whistle. He tightly clutches the ratty, well-loved shrapnel 
           of what was once a baby blanket.  

           His spindly legs twitch as he is no doubt slaying dragons in 
           his dreams... if nowhere else. Yet. 

           All is still and peacefu--

           EEEEEEE! EEEEEEE! EEEEEE! A SHRILL ALARM PIERCES THE QUIET. 
           He bolts up. Fuzzy. Trying to clear the heavy fog of sleep.  

           EEEEEE! EEEEEE! A terrible, incessant WHINE alerts us to what 
           must be some ominous presence.

           MR. AND MRS. KHAROUD (40s, Punjabi) stumble in, flip on the 
           light. A blur of fuzzy robes and disheveled hair. Concerned, 
           hushed tones.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        See? I told you he’s not ready.

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        I might have given him a little 
                        almond milk... after six.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        After six? Are you insane?! 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        It was only a sip! He was thirsty! 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD/MR. KHAROUD
                        Great. That’s just great./ What was 
                        I supposed to do?
                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        You know what Dr. Yoshi said. If we 
                        don’t nip this in the bud, he’ll be 
                        relegated to an adolescence of  
                        isolation and torment by his peers!
                             (softly)
                        Lewis honey. Nothing to be scared 
                        of. It’s just time to eliminate. 

           She pulls back the blankets, revealing plastic sheets and A 
           BED-WETTING ALARM clipped to his underpants. (Yes these 
           exist. I mean, you know, I’ve heard.) 

           A dark spot blooms across the front of his tiny briefs. Lewis 
           looks down, realizing. Crushed. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I think I... had an accident.

           Mrs. Kharoud kneels down, hands on his slumped shoulders.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Sweetheart. This is not your fault. 
                             (then, glaring)
                        It’s Daddy’s. 

           EXT. CAPE VINCENT - MORNING

           Charming, seaside town in Upstate New York, on the banks of 
           Lake Ontario. Where parents escape the city to raise their 
           kids, and kids just can’t wait to escape.

           CLOSE ON A CHUBBY, DARK-HAIRED, RUDDY-CHEEKED BOY. 

                                 CHUBBY BOY
                        So then my grandfather was the only 
                        one left. Alone, scared, injured.  
                        In space. And the only way he could 
                        survive until his crew came back to 
                        rescue him was by growing 
                        vegetables... in his own poop.   

           PULL OUT TO REVEAL: HE STANDS IN FRONT OF A CLASSROOM OF 
           FIFTH-GRADERS. Wide-eyed, riveted. A COLLECTIVE EEEWWWWWW!

           INT. CAPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           KEVIN FINCH, (10), our masterful story-teller, smiles. Kevin 
           has been on some really fantastic adventures... on his iPad. 

           What? Outside has like, bugs and no chocolate milk.
           Their TEACHER, MRS. WESTENFELDT sits, a skeptical frown. 

                                 KEVIN
                        So he waited ‘til he had to po--

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        Okay Kevin! I’m going to stop you 
                        right there. I’m having a hard time 
                        believing all of this is true.   

           He SCOFFS, mouth open, feigning extreme insult.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Mrs. Westenfeldt. I’m not gonna 
                        lie, that stings. I don’t know what 
                        would make you think-- 

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        Well, for one thing, it’s the plot 
                        of THE MARTIAN.

           Beat. All eyes on Kevin... waiting.

                                 KEVIN
                        Where do you think they got the 
                        idea?

           INT. BOY’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Kevin washes his hands at the sink. Adjusts a stubborn 
           cowlick in the mirror. He stares at himself. Glances around-- 
           no one else there. Does a quick dance move. Then...

           Breaks out into a full hip hop routine. Pop and Lock. A 
           little Robot. Was that the Charleston? It’s not bad. Not 
           great, but we admire his commitment. He stops, out of breath. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (in the mirror)
                        Oh that? Just a little something 
                        I’ve been working on. Whatever. No 
                        big deal. America’s Got Talent? 
                        Nah. I guess I never really thought 
                        about it. Yeah, I sing a little 
                        too. No... I couldn’t. Right now? 

           He takes a deep breath. Starts SINGING a pop song. Maybe it’s 
           Bieber. We’d prefer the dancing. He stops, feigns shock. 

                                 KEVIN (IN MIRROR) (CONT’D)
                        What? I... love you too.

           He leans in close, lips puckered, like he’s going to... 
           POV: SHAKY IPHONE VIDEO. LAUGHTER. Kevin whips around to face 
           the stalls. A TOILET FLUSHES. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: JEREMY, dickhead eighth-grader, still 
           filming Kevin’s horrified face on his phone. A devilish grin.  

           EXT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Lunchtime. KIDS mill around the cafeteria. Kevin bursts out 
           of the bathroom. Jeremy on his heels, still filming.  

                                 JEREMY
                        Where ya going? C’mon, give me one 
                        more move. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I knew you were there the whole 
                        time. It was just a joke. 

           JEREMY’S FRIENDS block Kevin’s escape, sensing weak prey. 

                                 JEREMY (FILMING)
                        You’re gonna be so famous kid.   

           THEY ALL LAUGH. A WOMAN, MARGOT (40) walks into frame. Her 
           mom jeans and ponytail belie the spark still somewhere down 
           in there. She wears a sticker that says: LUNCH DUTY 
           VOLUNTEER. And a delicate, gold locket around her neck. 

                                 MARGOT (ON FILM)
                        Everything okay here boys? 

           Jeremy stops filming. Passes the phone discreetly to his 
           FRIEND, who starts typing away. Big fake smile. 

                                 JEREMY
                        Yep. All good. 

           Margot looks at Kevin, assessing. His eyes downcast. Upset.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Okay. Well, why don’t you head back 
                        to lunch then.

           Kevin hurries off. They other boys start to leave. Watching 
           the video, laughing. A FAMILIAR WHOOSH SOUND as they launch 
           it into the Cybersphere.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Not so fast you three.

           They all turn, rolling their eyes. Loud preteen sighs. Jeremy 
           shoves the phone in his back pocket.
                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        You’re eighth graders. You should 
                        be setting an example, right?   

                                 DICKHEAD FRIEND
                        We were just messing with him. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s not nice to pick on kids that 
                        are smaller than you though, is it?  

                                 JEREMY
                        What are you gonna do about it, 
                        lunch lady? 

           Margot reacts, surprised. Thinks a beat. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well, gosh, let’s see. First I 
                        guess, I’d find out who your 
                        parents are. 

           He snorts. Big deal. Familiar territory. Margot leans down, 
           putting an arm around him. Quieter--

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Then I’d find out where they live. 
                        And one night, long after you’ve 
                        forgotten about me and that kid you 
                        were just bullying, I’d come over 
                        when you’re all sound asleep in 
                        your little beds, and I’d cut a 
                        small hole in the brake lines of 
                        their cars. Not cut them clean 
                        through-- they always do that in 
                        movies but it doesn’t really work 
                        like that. See, you’d notice right 
                        away there was no pressure. But a 
                        small hole? It leaks out slowly, 
                        over time, so one minute you have 
                        brakes, and the next, you roll 
                        through a stop sign and get smashed 
                        to little unrecognizable pieces by 
                        oncoming traffic.  

           Jeremy stares at her, eyes wide. Did she just say that? THE 
           BELL RINGS. He jumps. She smiles, pats him on the back. Hard. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Oops, looks like you missed lunch. 
                        Don’t be late for class now.   

           They all hurry off, freaked out. Margot smiles. Looks down at 
           Jeremy’s cell phone she just pick-pocketed. 
           EXT. CAPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Margot walks away from the building. Pulls out Jeremy’s cell. 
           Dialing quickly from memory. RINGING. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Hello? Hello? 

           She hangs up. A car drives past, crunching gravel. Margot 
           waits a beat, WHIPS the phone skillfully underneath the back 
           tire. It SMASHES into a million pieces.

           INT. BAND ROOM - DAY

           A GROUP OF BAND GEEKS who will someday run the world fumble 
           their way through Bach’s Cello Suite One. 

           CLANCY FINCH, (15), plays the cello light years better than 
           the rest. The first thing we notice about her is her deep red 
           hair. She hates it. Her forearm cuts back and forth across 
           the strings, carving a beautiful sound out of the sharp, 
           pitchy noise that is everyone else.  

           BELL RINGS. Kids pack up their instruments. The very astute 
           will notice SOME KIDS looking at their phones. Laughing. MORE 
           DINGS AND WHOOSH SOUNDS. THE MUSIC TEACHER approaches Clancy. 

                                 MUSIC TEACHER
                        Great job today Clancy. I can tell 
                        you’ve really been practicing that 
                        opening arrangement. Flawless. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Oh. Thanks. 

                                 MUSIC TEACHER
                        Have you thought anymore about this 
                        summer? We really need to get that 
                        application in if you’re
                        interested. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Yes. I am, I just... still have to 
                        talk to my parents. 

                                 MUSIC TEACHER
                        You have an amazing gift. Don’t 
                        wait too much longer, okay? 

                                 CLANCY
                             (unsure, flustered)
                        Oh. Okay, I won’t. 
           INT. CAPE VINCENT HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           HORMONALLY-IMBALANCED TEENAGERS jockey for position, each 
           trying to be cooler than the other. Clancy navigates the 
           crowd, eyes down, trying desperately to blend.  

           She opens her locker, using it as a shield to sneak a glimpse 
           of HIM. Tall, lanky, wears t-shirts for bands he’s never 
           heard. He looks over her way, they might make eye contact...

           A GROUP OF THREE MEAN GIRLS, ruthless online-assassins 
           disguised in lip gloss and glitter, block her line of sight.   

                                 MEAN GIRL
                        I used to have a dog named Clancy, 
                        isn’t that so funny? Every time I 
                        hear it I just think of a dog, you 
                        know? Here, smile. 

           HER IPHONE’S POV: the SnapChat feature turns Clancy’s face 
           into a cartoon dog with a slobbery tongue. They all LAUGH. 

                                 MEAN GIRL (CONT’D)
                        So cute. Give me your username and 
                        I’ll send it to you.

                                 CLANCY
                        Oh, um, I... don’t have that. 

                                 SHALLOW GIRL
                        You don’t have Snapchat? What about 
                        Kik? You have to have Instagram.  

                                 CLANCY
                        No, I’m... not really allowed to do 
                        that stuff. My mom won’t let me. 
                        I... don’t have my own phone. 

           A COLLECTIVE GASP OF PURE HORROR. 

                                 DITZY GIRL
                        But how do you like... live? 

                                 CLANCY
                        My mom thinks the internet is where 
                        serial killers and college 
                        admissions departments get all 
                        their information about you.

                                 MEAN GIRL
                        Wow. That is SO lame. Sucks for you 
                        ‘cuz some seniors are having a pop-
                        up party tonight. Everyone is 
                        going.

                             (catching Clancy looking)
                        Travis will be there. They SnapChat 
                        the address right before so no one 
                        knows where it is. Maybe we’ll send 
                        you a smoke signal instead. 

           They LAUGH and walk off. We hear whispers of FIRE-CROTCH and 
           FREAK. Clancy watches them go, holding back tears.

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           GLEN FINCH, (40s) sings along to the radio. He’s a one man 
           band of passionate finger-drumming and enthusiastic vocals 
           combined with zero actual talent. 

           The light turns yellow. He eases his van, NICE BUNS BAKERY, 
           to a stop a full five seconds before it turns red. 
           BEEEEEEEEEP! The truck behind him lays on the horn. REVS the 
           engine. Glen looks in the rearview, hands up, whaddaya want? 

                                 GLEN
                        Yellow light buddy! We’re in a 
                        school zone. That’s a hefty ticket! 
                             (off his gesturing)
                        Okay that’s not... that’s uncalled 
                        for. Really? I don’t even know what 
                        that one means, so joke’s on you 
                        pal. Oh if you wanna go, we can go.  

           SOUNDS OF HIS VAN DOORS LOCKING REPEATEDLY. 

           EXT. CAPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Cars wind around the maze of school pick-up. Clancy and Kevin 
           converge on the minivan from opposite directions. 

           INT/EXT. NICE BUNS BAKERY VAN - DAY

           Glen smiles at them in the rearview. 

                                 GLEN
                        Hey guys! TGIF! How was school?

                           KEVIN
                                                         CLANCY
           Fine.
                                              Fine.

                                 GLEN
                        Anything interesting happen? 

                           KEVIN
                                                         CLANCY
           No.
                                              No. 
                                 GLEN
                        Clance. You ready for this? Guess 
                        what I heard on the rad--

           Clancy slips her earbuds in, MUSIC PLAYING. BACK TO GLEN. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        --and now the wolf and the bear are 
                        just like best friends. Isn’t that 
                        amazing? Nature!

                                 KEVIN
                        She’s gone dark dad.

           Glen frowns, spins around to see her staring out the window.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I would say don’t take it 
                        personally, but I’m pretty sure 
                        it’s aimed right at you.  

           He takes a swig of chocolate milk. The van door slides opens. 
           Kevin looks, SNARFS, droplets spraying. Coughing, choking.    

           MIM, (MIRIAM) 15, beautiful Asian girl, stands there. Pink 
           extensions in her hair, glitter tattoos on her arms. She’s 
           like most young girls her age-- frenetic moths attracted to 
           the shiny sparkle of marketing. She takes a quick selfie. 

                                 MIM
                        That was just like the best 
                        lighting ever for my OOTD.  

                                 GLEN
                        Hi Miriam. I don’t know what any of 
                        those letters mean. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I said we could give Mim a ride. 
                             (off Kevin, frozen)
                        Move over weirdo! 

           Mim hops over Kevin. Sitting in the middle. Right next to 
           him. Like her leg is touching his leg. A jolt of electricity 
           shoots through his body. Mim turns to him, smiles. 

           His eyes go wide, did she just feel it too, that spark of--

                                 MIM
                        You have chocolate milk on your 
                        nose. 

           He quickly paws at his nose.  
                                 GLEN
                        You excited for your big sleepover 
                        tonight buddy? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Dad, it’s not a sleepover. Lewis is 
                        just coming over to hang out and 
                        chill. And then when the time 
                        comes, yes we will go to bed. But 
                        it’s not like, a big deal. 

           He looks in the side mirror to make sure his face is clean... 
           and sees Mrs. Westenfeldt charging toward their car. 

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Welp, looks like we’re all here. So 
                        let’s hit it dad!

                                 GLEN
                             (gesturing to cars)
                        We can’t line jump, Kev. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeaaa it’s just, sitting here 
                        idling like this? Super bad for the 
                        environment. With greenhouse gases 
                        and... the Ozarks... and whatnot. 

           QUICK GLANCE IN THE MIRROR REVEALS: she’s almost there. 

                                 GLEN
                        I think you mean ozone buddy. Oh, 
                        is this because... do you have to 
                        go number two? 

           Kevin’s eyes go wide with horror. He sneaks a look at Mim-- 
           she and Clancy giggling and whispering about something.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Dad! What? No!

                                 GLEN
                        What? I know how you don’t like to 
                        go at school. You had that incident 
                        last year where you held it for a 
                        week, and we had to go to the ER--

                                 KEVIN
                        DAD. You are KILLING me. 

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        Mr. Finch? 

           Too late. She made it. Leaning in the passenger window. 
                                 GLEN
                        Hey Mrs. W! I just realized W and 
                        Westenfeldt have exactly the same 
                        amount of syllables so I’m actually 
                        not saving any time with that nick--

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        Mr. Finch, Kevin gave a very 
                        interesting oral presentation in 
                        social studies class today. 

                                 GLEN
                        Really? Kev, you didn’t mention any 
                        presentation today.

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh y’know, it was one of those spur 
                        of the moment, off-the-cuff things--

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        It’s actually 30% of their final 
                        grade. It’s a project on their 
                        family history. The students have 
                        spent weeks preparing for these. Or 
                        at least they should have. Kevin 
                        had a lot of fascinating things to 
                        say about your family.

                                 GLEN
                        Really? Grandpa Carl and Grandma 
                        June in Cincin--

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        And how they were a troupe of 
                        traveling Russian acrobats turned 
                        astronauts that NASA trained for 
                        secret space missions. 

                                 GLEN
                        --natti. Huh. 

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        I think we can both agree, Kevin 
                        has a very vivid imagination. 

                                 GLEN
                        I’ll say. Grandpa Carl has had two 
                        hip replacements. He can barely 
                        bend at the waist. 

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        He tends to live in his own little 
                        imaginary worlds, which can be 
                        great...

                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT (CONT'D)
                        except when it comes at the expense 
                        of participating in real life. I 
                        think Kevin might benefit from 
                        directing his creative energies 
                        somewhere more appropriate, like a 
                        school club? In the meantime, I’ll 
                        give him the weekend to redo his 
                        project. He can turn it in Monday.

                                 GLEN
                        Yes, thank you. We will talk to hi--

           But she’s already walking away. Glen glares at Kevin. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay, but you have to admit, 
                        Grandma June is surprisingly 
                        flexible for her age. 

           EXT/INT. FINCH HOUSE - DAY

           The kids walk in, shedding the detritus of the day. A tornado 
           of backpacks, jackets, shoes. ANGUS, their HUGE GERMAN 
           SHEPHERD, jumps on them. Tail wagging, knocking things over. 

           Margot enters. Their mom. They head off to raid the kitchen. 
           Glen gives her a kiss.    

                                 GLEN
                        Hey hon. How was lunch duty today?  

           Kevin looks over at her. Margot doesn’t miss a beat. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Same as usual. Oh some eighth 
                        grader lost his phone and was 
                        freaking out. I guess they found it 
                        smashed to bits in the parking lot.   

           She meets Kevin’s gaze, winks. He looks down, smiles.     

                                 GLEN
                        Kids can never keep track of their 
                        stuff. 
                             (as Kevin passes)
                        Bup bup ba. Not so fast. Why don’t 
                        you tell mom about your little 
                        presentation on our family today. 

                                 KEVIN 
                        Uggh okaaay. So, um, I may have 
                        used a little creative license with 
                        my social studies project. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Well that sounds cool--

                                 GLEN
                        He made up the entire thing. Yep, 
                        lied about everything. Biiig liar. 
                        Mrs. Westenfeldt was not happy. He 
                        has to redo the whole project.  

           Clancy walks back in, bag of chips in hand. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I need a phone. 

                                 MARGOT
                        What, why?

                                 CLANCY
                        Because I’m fifteen now and 
                        everyone else has one! I’m the ONLY 
                        ONE in my entire grade without a 
                        phone. And it’s SO UNFAIR. I’m a 
                        TOTAL FREAK. 

                                 GLEN
                        C’mon, not having your own phone 
                        doesn’t make you a freak--

           Mim drapes herself across the couch, crunching chips.

                                 MIM
                             (not so fast)
                        Mmmm... not like “sit with the 
                        school counselor at lunch because 
                        you stink like cheese” freak? But 
                        not having an online presence is 
                        pretty much a slow social death. 

                                 MARGOT
                        No, I meant Kevin, why did you lie 
                        on your project? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Because our family history is sooo 
                        boring! Mom’s parents died when she 
                        was a kid. Grandpa Carl and Grandma 
                        June live in a retirement home in 
                        Ohio. Both of you were weird only 
                        children-- you give me nothing to 
                        work with! Patrick Waldron has an 
                        uncle in jail. He’s been living off 
                        that for weeks.
                                 GLEN
                        Well as exciting as that sounds, 
                        you can’t just make stuff up about 
                        your life whenever it’s convenient 
                        for you. That’s not the way it 
                        works. Tell him, honey.

                                 CLANCY
                        MOM. Focus. Can we please discuss 
                        the phone situation? I’m really 
                        going to need one... 
                             (rushed, muffled)
                        especially if I’m going to spend 
                        the summer in New York City.

                                 MARGOT
                        And why on earth would you be 
                        spending the summer in the city?

                                 CLANCY
                        Before you freak out and say no, 
                        just listen. Mr. Campbell thinks I 
                        could get accepted into the summer 
                        workshop program at Julliard. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Lucas Shank’s uncle ate a hot dog 
                        from a cart in New York City once 
                        and got a tapeworm the length of a 
                        city bus. Now he has to go number 
                        two in a bag. 

                                 GLEN
                             (re Clancy)
                        Wow, really? 

                                 KEVIN
                        No. That’s a lie. See? I can’t help 
                        it. It’s like a sickness.

                                 MARGOT
                        Clancy, that’s amazing.

                                 CLANCY
                        So I can go?!

           Margot steels herself. Knows what’s coming. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Honey... I’m so proud of you. But 
                        you’re fifteen. You can’t live in 
                        New York City for three months by 
                        yourself. And Daddy and I can’t go 
                        with you--
                                 CLANCY
                        It’s for school! You don’t have to 
                        go. There will be teachers there. 
                        I’ll be in the same state.

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s six hours away with no 
                        traffic. If something happened--

                                 CLANCY
                        Nothing’s ever going to happen! 
                        Because you never let me do 
                        anything! I hate it here. I can’t 
                        wait to get out of this stupid, 
                        boring town. You guys treat me like 
                        such a baby and I’m not! 

           She STORMS OFF. Mim on her heels. Kevin shakes his head. 

                                 KEVIN
                        And yet all we’re hearing is “waaah 
                        waaah waaah,” am I right guys?
                             (off their looks)
                        Sooo... I’ll just be in my room 
                        getting a head start on that 
                        project ‘til Lewis gets here.

           He leaves. Margot sits on the couch, with a sigh. Upset. 
           Stares out the window. Glen puts an arm around her, squeezes. 

                                 GLEN
                        This morning she told me the sound 
                        of my voice gives her hives. Kids 
                        say mean crap all the time. They 
                        don’t mean it.  

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t know. I said the same thing 
                        to my parents, and I meant it.
                        I even ran away once...
                             (chuckling, remembering)
                        My dad drove behind me for six 
                        miles. I refused to get in. Said I 
                        was going to live at the beach. 

           She fingers her locket, thoughtfully. Glen snorts a laugh.

                                 GLEN
                        Well that would have been a far 
                        walk. Not many beaches in Nebraska. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Right, yeah. I was a dumb kid. 
                                 GLEN
                        You never talk about your parents. 
                        It’s nice to hear you open up--

           She stands abruptly. 

                                 MARGOT
                        No point in talking about it. 
                        Ancient history, right?    

           She walks out. He stares after her, rejected.

           INT. CLANCY’S ROOM - DAY

           Clancy slams the door. Flops facedown on her bed.   

                                 CLANCY
                        She is ruining my life! 

                                 MIM
                        Parents don’t get it. They just 
                        don’t deal in reality--
                             (checking phone, GASP)
                        I already have 98 likes on my KOTD! 

                                 CLANCY
                        She never lets me go anywhere or do 
                        anything! She’s SO ANNOYING.  

                                 MIM
                        Look, the world is a scary place 
                        for our parents. They grew up in 
                        the old days, when there were only 
                        two genders and no streaming. My 
                        parents still think Facebook is 
                        cool and watch things on 
                        television. Like one show a week.  
                        Hello? They’re dinosaurs. They 
                        don’t know any better. 

                                 CLANCY
                        She just doesn’t want me to get 
                        accepted to Julliard cuz’ she wants 
                        me to stay in Cape Vincent forever 
                        like her. She’s SO BORING. 

                                 MIM
                        All parents are boring. Think about 
                        it. All the good, exciting stuff in 
                        their lives has already happened. 
                        What’s left for them to do but like 
                        watch the news and worry about 
                        their cholesterol?     
                                 CLANCY
                        There’s this pop-up party tonight. 
                        Everyone is going. We have to sneak 
                        out and go.  

                                 MIM
                        Everyone? Or Travis Shultz? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Shut up! Nooo. Whatever.

                                 MIM
                        If you had Instagram you could 
                        totally stalk him on social media 
                        like a normal person, instead of 
                        just eye-banging him in the 
                        hallways. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I know. My mom is such a psycho 
                        about me “putting my personal 
                        information on the internet.”

                                 MIM
                        It’s 2017. Everyone’s personal 
                        information is on the internet. 
                        Seriously? Like what’s the worst 
                        that could happen? 

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a doughy, middle-aged GUY at his desk. 

           Stacks of papers, empty coffee cups, tie askew. This is HENRY 
           GIBBS, and he’s currently watching a kitten try to make its 
           way out of a paper bag on YouTube. He giggles. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s just adorable. 
                             (calling out the door)
                        That was a good one Mullens! The 
                        kitten ones get me every time. 

           He chuckles to himself, about to click off when something 
           catches his eye... 

           ON HIS COMPUTER: currently trending YouTube videos. There’s a 
           freeze-frame of Kevin, mid-dance move, eyes closed. NERD 
           BREAK DANCES IN BATHROOM. 22.2k views and counting... 

           Henry squints, leaning closer. Clicks on it. We watch his 
           expression as IT PLAYS. There’s a TECHNO REMIX VERSION at 
           this point. Then, Margot’s voice--
                                 MARGOT (ON FILM)
                        Everything okay here boys? 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh. Crap. 

           INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

           A KNOCK. Angus BARKS like crazy. Glen opens the door. 
           Revealing Mrs. Kharoud and Lewis, holding a small backpack.  

                                 GLEN
                        Hey bud! Kev’s really excited about 
                        tonight.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Thanks so much for inviting him. 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh no problem. We love Lewis. He’s 
                        so easy--

           She hands over another HUGE BAG of supplies.  

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        So here are his allergy 
                        medications, his vitamins, his 
                        probiotics, his humidifier, his 
                        security blanket, his toothpaste... 

                                 GLEN
                        Well we do have toothpaste. That I 
                        know for sure. 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Without sodium fluoride? Because 
                        that’s also one of the main 
                        ingredients found in rat poison. 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh. Um. Margot usually does the 
                        shopping, but she probably gets the 
                        one... without the poison.

           Kevin runs up, breathless. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Dude. I just got 160 coins! We can 
                        buy some incense.

           Lewis’ eyes go wide with this information that makes no sense 
           to us yet. He tries to follow Kevin... but his mom holds onto 
           his shoulders. Tightly.
                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        He’s just a little nervous. It’s 
                        his very first sleepover. 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh he’ll be fine. Won’t you bud? 

           Glen pats his back, slowly trying to pry him away. After a 
           moment, she releases him. He darts off.  

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        No foods with red dye #40-- well 
                        I’m sure you’ve heard. 

                                 GLEN
                             (nope)
                        Yes! Yep. Terrible what’s 
                        happening... with number 40. It’s 
                        an outrage really--

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        And no caffeine. He operates best 
                        on twelve hours of sleep so he 
                        should really get to bed by eight.

                                 GLEN
                        Well that’s perfect. Because Margot 
                        and I start pushing the furniture 
                        against the wall at 8:30 and the 
                        rave usually starts around 9.
                             (off her horrified stare)
                        That was a joke. We don’t... rave. 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Please don’t say “rave” around 
                        Lewis. 

                                 GLEN
                        No, of course. I’m... sorry. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Glen walks in. Kevin and Lewis sit side by side, each playing 
           on an iPad. Not speaking. He looks at them. Beat.

                                 GLEN
                        Why don’t you guys play together? 

                                 KEVIN
                             (not looking up)
                        We are. 
                                 LEWIS
                        I just elevated my Squirtle!

                                 KEVIN
                        We just dropped some incense to 
                        attract wild Pokemons, which is 
                        like a Lure Module, except you have 
                        to go to a Pokestop for those--

                                 GLEN
                        Kevin, this is what Mrs. W was 
                        talking about. You spend way too 
                        much time in these little imaginary 
                        worlds. What about playing a normal 
                        game? Outside. Like soccer. Or 
                        baseball. 

           Kevin reacts, stung. 

                                 KEVIN
                        But I’m not good at soccer. 

                                 LEWIS
                        My mom says youth team sports 
                        perpetuate psychosocial behaviors. 
                        Oh, here Mr. Finch. 

           Lewis pulls a piece of paper out of his backpack. 

                                 GLEN
                        What’s this?

                                 LEWIS
                        A list of my known allergens. It’s 
                        laminated for protection. My mom 
                        was really concerned about your 
                        cavalier parenting style. I googled 
                        it. It means showing a lack of 
                        proper concern.  

                                 GLEN
                             (reading)
                        For the record, I don’t even think 
                        #17 exists in the United States.
                        Alright then, how about I just 
                        order a pizza for dinner?  

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to have processed 
                        cheeses. 

                                 GLEN
                        It’ll be our secret. 
                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to have secrets. 

                                 GLEN
                        It’s gonna be a long night. 

           INT. CLANCY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Margot knocks on the door. Sounds of hushed giggling.

                                 MARGOT
                        Can I come in?

                                 CLANCY (O.S.)
                        It’s a free country. So I’ve heard. 

           She opens the door. The girls are on the bed, innocent looks.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Mim I just saw your mom’s car pull 
                        in the driveway. She’ll be 
                        wondering where you are.  

                                 MIM
                        Okay. See you later Clance. Y’know 
                        like tomorrow. Not later tonight, 
                        because I’ll be sleeping later so 
                        that’d be weird. Okayseeyabye!

           Mim winks at Clancy and hurries out. Margot sits on the bed. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Look. I know you’re upset about New 
                        York. But it’s my job to protect 
                        you. You don’t know all the bad 
                        things in this world that can harm 
                        you--

                                 CLANCY
                        Like cell phones and hair dye? Oooh 
                        scary. You won’t even let me color 
                        my stupid hair. For no reason.

                                 MARGOT
                        Your hair is beautiful! People 
                        would kill for your hair. Why do 
                        you want to--

                                 CLANCY
                        It’s UGLY. And I’m the only one in 
                        our family with stupid red hair! 
                        Like some kind of freak.  
                                 MARGOT
                        Wha-- did someone call you that? Is 
                        everything okay at school? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Ugggh. Just forget it. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Honey. I know you think I don’t get 
                        it, but I was fifteen once too. And 
                        I didn’t have a lot of friends. In 
                        fact, I used to ride my bike to--

                                 CLANCY
                        The library and stay until they 
                        kicked you out because books were 
                        your only friends and let you know 
                        you could be anyone you wanted to 
                        be. I knooow. You’ve told me like 
                        ten zillion times. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well it was a special place for me. 
                        You that would judge me, do not 
                        judge alone this book or that, come 
                        to this hallowed place where my 
                        friends’ portraits hang and look 
                        thereon. William Butler Yeats. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Thanks for the pep talk mom. 
                        Suuuper helpful advice from some 
                        dead guy a hundred years ago. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Honey. I know this Julliard program 
                        is important to you--

                                 CLANCY
                        Then why don’t you trust me enough 
                        to let me go? 

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s not that I don’t trust you. I 
                        can’t just send you off to a huge 
                        city by yourself. 

                                 CLANCY
                             (mumbled)
                        Maybe if you had your own life, you 
                        wouldn’t be so worried about mine.  

                                 MARGOT
                        And what’s that supposed to mean? 
                                 CLANCY
                        I’m just saying maybe if you had a 
                        job or something you wouldn’t sit 
                        around all day and worry about me. 
                        Mim’s mom is too busy at work to 
                        care if she puts a stupid picture 
                        on the internet! And guess what? No 
                        boogeyman have come to get her. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Once you put something on the 
                        internet it stays there forever--

                                 CLANCY
                        UGH! It’s not a big deal. Nobody 
                        else’s mom even cares! 

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m not everyone else’s mom.

                                 CLANCY
                        Well I wish you weren’t mine 
                        either! You just want me to have a 
                        boring, pathetic life like you!

           Margot absorbs the hit. It stings. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well guess what? It just got even 
                        more boring. You’re grounded. No 
                        TV, no internet, no Mim. Two weeks. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I HATE YOU! Why can’t you just go 
                        away and leave me alone? You’re the 
                        worst mom in the entire world! 

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah well, you’re not exactly 
                        daughter of the year.

           Margot walks out, SLAMS THE DOOR.

           INT. FINCH HOUSE - EVENING

           A KNOCK. Glen opens the door to THE PIZZA GUY, (African-
           American, 20s) hat, headphones. Angus charges, BARKING. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Whoa whoa!

                                 GLEN
                        Angus no! Sorry. 
           Pizza Guy reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a small dog 
           treat. Angus scarfs it down. Pizza Guy shrugs. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Always be prepared. Boy Scout.

                                 GLEN
                        Hear that Kev? Boy Scouts. There’s 
                        a fun outdoor activity you could do 
                        with real-world applications. 

           Kevin rolls his eyes, retreating with the pizza. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        How much do I owe you?

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Oh, uh-- (looking) $18.45.

           Margot walks past. Pizza Guy eyes her appreciatively. 

                                 GLEN
                        Shoot. I only have a twenty. Well 
                        that’s a crappy tip, isn’t it. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Don’t sweat it--

                                 GLEN
                        No no, now hold on a sec. Here. 
                             (handing him a card)
                        I own the bakery on Windhurst. Come 
                        by, check out my buns. Anything you 
                        want, on the house. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Riiight. Thanks... 

           INT/EXT. PIZZA DELIVERY VAN - LATER 

           Pizza Guy takes his hat off. Throws it in the backseat. Where 
           it lands on the REAL PIZZA DELIVERY KID, slumped over, out 
           cold. He pulls out A PHOTO OF A YOUNG MARGOT. Dials his cell. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                             (British accent)
                        It’s her. 

           EXT. TREEHOUSE - FINCH BACKYARD - LATER

           The creaky wooden trapdoor swings open in the floor of the 
           treehouse. Glen’s head pops through.  
                                 GLEN
                        See? Look how cool this is!

           He climbs through, followed by a scowling Kevin and scared 
           Lewis-- in pj’s, carrying rolled-up sleeping bags. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I just don’t understand why we’re 
                        being punished. 

                                 GLEN
                        It’s not punishment. It’s fun!

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to play in 
                        unfamiliar rural settings 
                        unsupervised.  

                                 GLEN
                        It’s our backyard, Lewis. There’s a 
                        fence. You’ll be fine. 

           Kevin scurries around, frantically holding up his iPad. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I can’t get Wifi. DAD. THERE’S NO 
                        WIFI.

                                 GLEN
                        That’s the point. It’s adventure. 

           He unfurls a sleeping bag. Dust particles explode in the air. 
           They all COUGH. 

                                 LEWIS
                        My mom says I have pre-scoliosis so 
                        I have to sleep on firm surfaces. 

                                 GLEN
                             (stomping on the floor)
                        Wood’s pretty firm. C’mon Kev-- the 
                        treehouse! You haven’t been out 
                        here in ages. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, because it sucks. And there’s 
                        bugs everywhere.

                                 GLEN
                        There’s no bugs in he--

           He turns to face A HUGE SPIDER WEB with a GIANT SPIDER  
           hanging in a corner. He SCREAMS! Regains his composure-- 
                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                             (terrified)
                        It’s fine. Nothing to worry about. 
                        They’re more afraid of you than you 
                        are of them.  
                             (handing them flashlights)
                        You boys have some fun out here! 

           He climbs back down the ladder. They look at each other. 

                                 KEVIN
                        How? 

           EXT. TREEHOUSE - FINCH BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Kevin and Lewis sit, wrapped in sleeping bags, their cheeks 
           puffed out. Finally Kevin exhales a rush of air, gasping.    

                                 KEVIN
                        You win. What now?

                                 LEWIS
                        We could tell stories. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay. You go first.  

                                 LEWIS
                        New, potentially dangerous 
                        bacteria, viruses and parasites 
                        such as SARS emerge every year.   

                                 KEVIN
                        What kind of story is that!?

                                 LEWIS
                        It was the top story last night on 
                        CNN. My parents make me watch the 
                        news so I’m aware of what I’m up 
                        against. 

           A LOUD, SCRAPING NOISE. The boys exchange worried looks.  

                                 KEVIN
                        What was that? 

                                 LEWIS
                        Some kind of rabid, wild animal 
                        foraging for food, or an escaped 
                        convict looking for shelter who’s 
                        gonna murder us!
                                 KEVIN
                        What?! You’re supposed to say the 
                        wind! Or it’s probably nothing to 
                        worry about! What’s wrong with you?

           The trapdoor SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. THEY SCREAM-- high pitched. 
           Mim pokes her head in. Laughs. Filming on her phone.  

                                 MIM
                        Omg, you should see your faces! 
                        What are you turds doing out here?

           Kevin looks even more terrified now if that’s possible. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Sss... leeping in the treehouse. 

                                 MIM
                        Duh. Why?

                                 KEVIN
                        My dad thinks it’s good for me? 

                                 MIM
                        Parents are so weird.  

                                 KEVIN
                        What are... what are you doing?

                                 MIM
                        Sneaking out, duh. Nice jammies. 

           Kevin looks down at his monster truck pjs, embarrassed.  

           INT. CLANCY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Clancy carefully tucks her pillows under her blankets to look 
           like a body. Quick glance at her clock: 10 pm. She peeks out 
           her door. Slips out, pads down the stairs. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

           She tiptoes through the dining room, silently. 

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        Busted. 

           She whips around to find her dad standing in the kitchen.

                                 CLANCY
                        Dad! I was just...
                                 GLEN
                        I know what you were doing. 
                        Sneaking out... for one of these. 

           He holds up a plate of freshly frosted cupcakes. She relaxes. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Every time I bake tester recipes, I 
                        always find one or two missing in 
                        the morning. All this time I 
                        thought it was Kevin. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Oh... yep. It’s me. You caught me. 

                                 GLEN
                        Brown sugar banana with avocado 
                        frosting. I know, a little wild. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Wow dad. Yeah, getting crazy.

           He closes the distance, holds one out. They chew in silence.

                                 GLEN
                        You were kinda tough on mom 
                        tonight.   

                                 CLANCY
                        Tough on her?! She grounded me for 
                        NO REASON. 
                             (off his look)
                        Dad it’s true. She just wants any 
                        excuse to keep me home in a little 
                        bubble because she’s scared of 
                        everything in the world. 

                                 GLEN
                        Mom wants what’s best for you. 
                        You’re getting older. You’ll be off 
                        to college in a few years. She’s 
                        not always gonna be around to make 
                        sure you’re doing the right thing.   

                                 CLANCY
                        Thank god for that. 

                                 GLEN
                        You don’t mean that. You might not 
                        get it now, but trust me, you’d be 
                        lost without mom. You two are more 
                        alike than you know. 

           She rolls her eyes. 
                                 CLANCY
                        UGH. We are NOTHING alike. 

                                 GLEN
                        Don’t stay up too late. 

           He kisses her head, walks upstairs. She waits to hear the 
           sound of footsteps to his bedroom, then the door close. She 
           tiptoes past a sleeping Angus. TYPES IN THE CODE TO DISARM 
           THEIR ALARM. Slips out into the night. 

           EXT. TREEHOUSE - FINCH BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Mim pulls a Gatorade out of her backpack. Takes a long swig. 
           Kevin stares at her, enamored. Lewis stares at the Gatorade, 
           equally enthralled. Both boys biting their lips.  

                                 KEVIN
                        So sneaking out huh? Is it with a 
                        group of girls, or like a big mish 
                        mash of girls and... boys?

                                 CLANCY (O.S.)
                        Don’t tell him anything! He’s just 
                        gonna tell on me. He’s a total 
                        tattle tale. 

           Clancy climbs through the trapdoor. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I am not! I am not a tattle tale. 
                        And I sneak out all the time.

                                 CLANCY
                        Such a lie. You’d never sneak out.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Yuh huh! You just don’t know 
                        because you’re asleep.  

                                 CLANCY
                        You’re too scared of the dark. 
                        That’s why you have a night light.

                                 KEVIN
                        I do not have a night light! 
                             (beat)
                        It’s an area illuminator in case I 
                        have to pee or get a drink in the 
                        middle of the night. I have dry 
                        mouth. It’s a very serious 
                        condition. 
                                 CLANCY
                        It is not. He makes stuff up all 
                        the time. He’s such a liar.

                                 KEVIN
                        I do not! I’m telling mom you 
                        called me a liar. Which sounds like 
                        being a tattle tale, but there’s a 
                        very clear distinction...

                                 CLANCY/KEVIN
                        You’re SO annoying!/YOU’RE 
                        annoying!

           Mim takes another sip. Lewis jumps up, can’t take it anymore.

                                 LEWIS
                        I HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM!

           They all stare at him. He hurries to climb out the trapdoor. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lewis scurries across the lawn to the back door of the house. 
           A black car, lights off, rolls up slowly in front. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           TWO DARK FIGURES move in the shadows. Stealthy, silent, with 
           practiced precision. ONE peers in the front window.  

                                 DARK FIGURE
                        Dog? 

           The OTHER turns. We recognize our Pizza Guy, BAXTER. 

                                 BAXTER
                        Neutralized.  

           He jimmies open the door. The alarm gives a harmless beep. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - SAME

           Light off. Lewis hovers over the toilet. Nothing. Sighs. 

                                 LEWIS (IN THE MIRROR)
                        Come on Lewis. You can DO this-- 

           A flicker of something in the mirror catches his eye. He 
           leans out the door. Sees A FIGURE IN BLACK creeping up the 
           stairs. His eyes go wide, horrified.  
           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Margot tosses and turns. Sighs. Glen rolls over.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Clancy hates me.   

                                 GLEN
                        Aw honey. She’s a teenager. To be 
                        fair, she hates everything. It’s 
                        their mandate. 

                                 MARGOT
                        She thinks I have a boring pathetic 
                        life. I dunno... is she right?  

                                 GLEN
                        They’re kids. They’re never right. 
                        If they aren’t being bombarded with 
                        constant stimulation 24/7, they 
                        whine that they’re bored. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I said something mean to her.  

                                 GLEN
                        Oh I do that all the time. I 
                        usually wait for her to turn around 
                        and then I whisper it angrily to 
                        her back. Oddly, it gives the same 
                        feeling of satisfaction. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I just... really miss her. I feel 
                        like we’re not connecting anymore. 

                                 GLEN
                        I try not to make too much eye 
                        contact. I find it antagonizes her. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m just gonna check on her. 

           INT. CLANCY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Margot cracks opens the door, peeking in. BAXTER STANDS OVER 
           CLANCY’S BED, covers pulled back, revealing the pillows. 
           Margot freezes, horrified. She locks eyes with him. He grins. 

                                 BAXTER
                        Like mother, like daughter eh? 

           And just like that, her face changes from fear to focus. 
           She slams the door shut. Runs down the stairs two at a time. 
           The door bursts open. He hurdles the railing and easily drops 
           down to the first floor. In front of her... 

           She kicks over an end table, sending it exploding into his 
           shin. A vase of flowers and broken wood SHATTERS on the 
           floor. She dodges his outstretched hand, running into the...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           She slides across the kitchen island, putting it between 
           them. Knocking over a bag of flour. He’s right behind her. 
           The only thing in reach is a plate of cupcakes. She grabs it.

                                 BAXTER
                        Gonna kill me with frosting? 

           She tilts the plate so the cupcakes fall off. WHIPS the heavy 
           glass plate like a frisbee directly into his throat. He falls 
           to his knees, gasping. Momentarily stunned. 

                                 BAXTER (CONT’D)
                        I heard you were feisty. 

                                 MARGOT
                        You should have brought back up. 

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        Honey? 

                                 BAXTER
                        I did. 

           She looks up to see Glen, terrified. Our OTHER DARK FIGURE, a 
           beautiful woman, ELISE, holds a knife to his neck. Glen 
           recognizes the Pizza Guy. 

                                 GLEN
                        Is this about the tip?!

                                 ELISE
                        Hello Mairéad. 

                                 GLEN
                        Mairéad? Who’s Mair-- okay, see, 
                        there we go. Knew it. This is 
                        obviously a big misunderstanding-- 

                                 ELISE
                        Jean-Paul wanted us to swing by, 
                        get the band back together. One 
                        more job for old time’s sake. Your 
                        old stomping grounds. You owe him.   
                                 MARGOT
                        No thanks. I’m not big on reunions. 

           Margot’s hand drops below the island, pulling open a drawer.   

                                 GLEN
                        Um, hon. You know these people? 

                                 ELISE
                        Oh good. The hard way. I was 
                        worried after fifteen years of 
                        Tupperware parties and clipping 
                        coupons, you wouldn’t be fun 
                        anymore.  

           Elise presses the knife hard into Glen’s neck. A thin line of 
           blood appears. Margot’s hand runs over utensils, searching...

                                 MARGOT
                        Go ahead. He’s just a cover anyway. 
                        You’d be doing me a favor. His 
                        constant whining drives me insane. 

           Glen GASPS! Her fingers close around the handle of a large 
           steel meat mallet. Starts to pull it out... 

                                 BAXTER
                        That’s a shame. Without you, your 
                        old partner isn’t much use to us. 
                        Too bad for him.  
                             (off her stunned look)
                        That’s right. We found him too. 

                                 ELISE
                        We thought you might need a little 
                        convincing. Such a dilemma. Save 
                        yourself or save your old friend.   

           Margot hesitates. Assessing. Elise looks around at their 
           house: pictures, laundry, backpacks. Shudders.  

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Your testimonies may have sent Jean-
                        Paul to prison, but I’m starting to 
                        think he got the better deal. 
                        Time’s up, what’s it gonna be?  

           Margot drops the mallet. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Alright. I’m... in.  

           Her hand moves quickly across the counter-- as though writing 
           something. If you blink you’ll miss it.  
                                 GLEN
                        Wha-- in? Okay, I think for me 
                        though guys it’s a firm out. 

           She discreetly pulls the locket off her neck, crushes it with 
           her heel as she walks out from behind the counter. Baxter 
           grabs her, stabbing her in the neck with a large needle. She 
           collapses into his arms. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Margot!

                                 ELISE
                        Relax. It’s just a short term 
                        sedative. Your wife is a very 
                        dangerous woman, Mr. Finch. At 
                        least, she used to be.  

           Baxter moves toward them, holding the needle. Glen cowers. 

                                 GLEN
                        No please--

           They both LAUGH LOUDLY. He shoves the needle in his pocket.  

                                 BAXTER
                        I think we can handle you. 

           Glen straightens up, offended. Looks around. Beat. Grabs a 
           heavy book off the coffee table-- throwing it at him! 

           It hits the wall two feet next to Baxter’s head, falling 
           harmlessly to the floor, pages FWAPPING. Glen turns to run, 
           trips and falls over the broken end-table shards, hitting his 
           head on the corner of the couch. Knocking himself out. 

           They stare at his contorted body.  

                                 ELISE
                        Good grief. Now we have to drag 
                        both of them to the car. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lewis cowers, terrified. Shaking. Huddled in the darkness, 
           straining to hear any sounds. Two black boots stop in front 
           of him. Elise crouches down. Smiles. 

                                 ELISE
                        I thought I heard a little mouse. 

           Lewis can’t speak. Can hardly breathe. 
                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        I like mice. They’re very quiet and 
                        they run away and hide when the 
                        lights come on. Because they know 
                        if they make a lot of noise, that’s 
                        when they get squashed. 

           She SMACKS her hand on the floor for effect. Lewis jumps.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t want anything bad to 
                        happen to Mr. and Mrs. Finch do 
                        you?
                             (off his head shake)
                        So can you be a quiet little mouse? 

           Lewis nods. She walks away. SOUND of the door closing. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lewis scampers across the backyard, hyperventilating. HIGH-
           PITCHED WHISPER-SHOUTING.

                                 LEWIS
                        Guys! Guys! GUYS!

           All three of their faces appear in the treehouse window. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Shhhh! Are you insane? You’ll wake 
                        up my parents!

                                 LEWIS
                        They’ve been kidnapped... adult-
                        napped... NINJA’S JUST STOLE YOUR 
                        PARENTS!

           INT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           The kids take in the state of the house, stunned. Kevin 
           hovers over a woozy Angus. Mim films on her phone.  

                                 CLANCY 
                        MOM?! DAD? They’re not upstairs 
                        either. 

                                 KEVIN
                        They did something to Angus! 

                                 MIM
                        Why would someone kidnap your 
                        parents? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIM (CONT'D)
                        No offense but your dad owns a 
                        bakery and your mom’s a housewife. 
                        Not exactly thrilling.

                                 LEWIS
                        That’s what I’ve been saying! I 
                        don’t think your mom is really... 
                        your mom. She was like, the head 
                        ninja. They said she was a very 
                        dangerous woman. And they kept 
                        calling her Mairéad.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Her code name. I knew something was 
                        up with her. Have you seen the way 
                        she drives? Total road rage.

                                 CLANCY
                        She doesn’t have a code name! Our 
                        mom is not a ninja! She won’t even 
                        go into the basement because she’s 
                        afraid of the jumpy crickets.

                                 KEVIN
                        That doesn’t mean anything! 
                        Everyone’s afraid of those! They 
                        jump directly at you. What’s wrong 
                        with them? Jump away!

                                 CLANCY
                        We have to call the police. 

                                 LEWIS
                        No! They said if we told anyone... 
                        bad things would happen. 

           They all exchange looks as the gravity sets in. TWO 
           HEADLIGHTS SHINE OUTSIDE. They scramble, peeking through the 
           window, to see a car pull up out front. Lewis GASPS.

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        They’re back!

           Kevin opens the hall closet. Coats, old toys, decorations.   

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah but this time, we’re ready. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Henry Gibbs, plain clothes, gets out of his unmarked car. 
           Surveys the dark house. 
           He peers in a front window, sees the mess. Checks the handle 
           on the front door-- broken open. He cautiously steps inside. 

           INT. FINCH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. He silently maneuvers around the broken pieces of 
           table. Kevin steps out of the kitchen holding a light saber.

                                 HENRY
                        Heeey Kevin. I’m not here to hurt 
                        you, bud. I’m a friend of your 
                        mom’s. Remember me? Henry?  

           Kevin turns on the light saber. GOOOOSH! It lights up red. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        That’s pretty cool. Did you get 
                        that on your Disney cruise last 
                        summer? Are you home alone, or is 
                        your mom here? Or your dad? Clancy? 

           He walks toward Kevin. Kevin waves the light saber, ZZZZZ! 

                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t move or I’ll be forced to use 
                        this.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re really brave, but we both 
                        know that’s not a real ligh--

           Kevin throws it as hard as he can, hitting Henry in the face 
           with the hard plastic handle. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        OWW! Sonofa-- 

           He grabs his nose. The others jump out of the hall closet 
           with A YELL! Tackling him to the ground and out of frame. 

           INT. FINCH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: the kids’ pensive faces. Studying something.

                                 MIM
                        He looks way too fat to be a ninja.

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Henry tied to a kitchen chair with 
           Christmas lights, a garden hose and masking tape. A set of 
           earmuffs over his ears and a sleep mask over his eyes. 
                                 HENRY
                        Okay I can still hear you with 
                        these things on. They just keep 
                        your ears warm. They don’t prevent 
                        sound from getting through. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Where are our parents?

           Beat as he weighs options, deciding. Then, he sighs.

                                 HENRY
                        Kids, listen. What I’m about to 
                        tell you might sound confusing and 
                        a little scary. My name is Henry 
                        Gibbs and I am a US Marshall. I 
                        work in a division called WITSEC. 
                        You might know it as Witness 
                        Protection. About fifteen years 
                        ago, your mom entered our program. 

           The kids REACT, stunned! Kevin rips off the eye mask. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Our mom is in Witness Protection?! 
                        Like what they do with Mob guys? 

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to sleep over at 
                        people’s houses who are in Witness 
                        Protection. 

                                 HENRY
                        A long time ago your mother had... 
                        a friend. And this friend got them 
                        involved in some bad things with 
                        very bad people. They were going to 
                        go to jail but we convinced them to 
                        tell on the bad people instead. We 
                        had to give them new identities to 
                        protect them. It’s my job to help 
                        keep your mom safe, but a video 
                        with her face got on the internet. 
                        It went viral and the bad guys saw 
                        it. They tracked her down. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Let me get this straight. Our mom 
                        had a totally different life?! So 
                        then what’s her real name? 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry Kevin. But that’s 
                        classified informa--
                                 MIM
                        Mairéad Tremblay. Born November 7, 
                        1976. Ontario, Canada--  

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re freaking CANADIAN?!

           They look over to Mim, reading off a phone.

                                 HENRY
                        How did you-- is that my phone?!
                        How did you get my passcode?

                                 MIM
                             (holding up his badge)
                        The first four digits of your badge 
                        number? Yeah that was a tough code 
                        to crack. I’m thinking security 
                        isn’t really your specialty, Henry. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Wait, what video? Mom would never 
                        put anything on the internet.

                                 HENRY
                        Kevin dancing in the bathroom? So 
                        funny. Got like a million hits.

                                 KEVIN
                        Dancing in the--
                             (realizing, A SCREAM!)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. What video? It wasn’t me.  

                                 MIM
                             (reading phone)
                        Fiancé: Leo Beauchamp. Born May 11, 
                        1974. WHOA check out this hottie.   

                                 CLANCY
                        She had a fiancé?!

           Clancy takes the phone. A PICTURE OF LEO, 40s, handsome, 
           rakish. Strawberry blonde hair.  She draws in a sharp breath.

                                 CLANCY (CONT’D)
                        How... long ago? 

                                 HENRY
                        A long time ago. Before you were 
                        even born. And kids, your mom was a 
                        completely different person then-- 
                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, she was some Canadian named 
                        Mairéad! Now, about this video that 
                        may or may not be me. How would we 
                        get it off the internet, 
                        hypothetically speaking? 

                                 CLANCY
                        What kind of bad things did she do? 

                                 HENRY
                        She... stole some things. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I knew it! She always takes the 
                        free samples at the grocery store. 
                        And not just one, like an entire 
                        handful. It always makes me 
                        uncomfortable!

                                 MIM
                        But what do they want with her now? 
                        She’s old and boring. She won’t 
                        even let them drink soda.

                                 LEWIS
                             (remembering, frantic)
                        They said they found her old 
                        partner and they were getting the 
                        band back together. Some big job on 
                        her old stomping grounds. And then 
                        your mom said she was in. 
                             (beat, hesitant)
                        She said your dad was... just a 
                        cover. And that he whines a lot. 

           Beat as they absorb the implications. 

                                 HENRY
                        Guys. I know this is confusing. But 
                        your mom loves you--

                                 KEVIN
                        Mom? Who’s mom? Is she even our 
                        real mom? Is anything real? My 
                        whole life has been a lie! 
                        Canadian? I hate hockey! And maple 
                        syrup! WAY too sweet.

                                 HENRY
                        Kevin--

                                 KEVIN
                        Is that even my real name?!
           Clancy looks down at her feet. On the floor, her mom’s 
           locket. Smashed. A tiny picture of their family. She GASPS.  

                                 CLANCY
                        I said terrible, mean things to 
                        her. That I hated her and wished 
                        she wasn’t my mom. I wished she 
                        would go away and leave me alone. 
                        That’s why she left. She went back 
                        to her old life because of me. 

           She picks up the necklace. Inside the broken pieces: a small 
           key. She reacts, surprised. Confused.   

                                 MIM (O.S.)
                        Guys come look at this! 

           ANGLE ON MIM POINTING at the kitchen counter. Numbers 
           scrawled in spilled flour. 74119. Then below it, EZ8. 

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s some kind of code! Okay, don’t 
                        worry, I can crack this. I saw this 
                        on Gameshakers once. Every number 
                        stands for a letter--

                                 CLANCY
                        It’s all our birthdays. Mine, 
                        yours, mom and dad’s. But the EZ 
                        eight... I’m not sure. 

                                 LEWIS
                        1234 and birthdays are the most 
                        common PIN numbers or codes for 
                        combination locks. Y’know, for 
                        things like home safe’s and-- 

                                 KEVIN
                             (a realization)
                        Storage lockers? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Mom doesn’t have a storage locker. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yu huh! I heard dad ask her about 
                        it once when he found a bill from 
                        EZ Storage. Storage unit eight. She 
                        said it was for some of Nana and 
                        Grampy’s old furniture. 

                                 HENRY
                        Hold on now kids. Whatever you’re 
                        thinking of doing--
           Clancy looks at them. Pleading. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Guys. We have to go get mom and dad 
                        back. This is all my fault. And 
                        whatever’s in this storage locker 
                        might help us find them. 

           They exchange looks. Kevin takes a deep breath, nods. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay but when we find Dad and Fake 
                        Mom, I want it on record: Clancy 
                        admitted this is all her fault. 

                                 HENRY
                        NO WAY. These are extremely 
                        dangerous people. Please let me and 
                        the proper authorities handle this--

                                 MIM
                        Because you’re doing such a stellar 
                        job so far? You’re tied to a chair 
                        with Christmas lights. 

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, yes, granted, it’s been 
                        awhile since I’ve been in the 
                        field. I’ve been recovering from 
                        ACL surgery, the pounds creep up on 
                        you! Kids! Wait! You can’t just 
                        leave me tied up in the dark!

           Mim plugs in the Christmas lights around Henry as they run 
           out. They blink to the tune of We Wish You A Merry Christmas. 

                                 MIM 
                        Watch him, Angus!

           Angus, now fully awake, sits in front of Henry. GROWLS. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           A car with the familiar UBER INSIGNIA pulls up. The window 
           slides down. CLOSE ON: The frowning face of our DRIVER.  

                                 DRIVER
                        Miriam?

                                 MIM
                        Yep! That’s me. 

           Mim walks over, hand on the door. It’s still locked. 
                                 DRIVER
                        It’s the middle of the night. Do 
                        your parents know you’re out here?  

                                 CLANCY/KEVIN/MIM/LEWIS
                        Yep/Of course/Uh huh/They joined a 
                        gang of ninjas.

                                 DRIVER
                        Aw man. Is this something weird? Am 
                        I gonna get in trouble for this? 

                                 MIM
                        Look dude. We just need a ride. 
                        Don’t make me give you the one-star 
                        rating. I’ll do it.

           Beat. A sigh. Then, SOUND OF DOORS UNLOCKING. Mim and Clancy 
           jump in. Lewis hesitates. Looks at Kevin. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to drive without a 
                        booster seat. I have a small frame. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Lewis. This is our chance. To be 
                        real heroes for once. Out here. Not 
                        just on our iPads. But I can’t do 
                        it without you. I need you. C’mon. 
                        Let’s go save my parents.   

           Beat. Lewis takes a deep breath. Gets in the car. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Okay. But my mom says excessive 
                        exercise can stunt my growth. I’m 
                        only four feet. I’m at a serious 
                        crossroads.  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Baxter and Elise march Glen and Margot through heavy woods at 
           gunpoint. Margot still groggy from the sedative. GIGGLY. 

                                 GLEN
                        Witness Protection?! I can’t 
                        believe you didn’t tell me. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well honey. That’s kind of the 
                        point of Witness Protection. You’re 
                        not supposed to tell. It’s sort of 
                        the number one rule. 
                                 GLEN
                        So, what? You were loosely 
                        associated with bad people who were 
                        involved in criminal activities?

                                 MARGOT
                        Mmm. Yeah, let’s go with that. 

                                 GLEN
                        So you’re not really from Nebraska?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes. 

                                 GLEN
                        Okay. Alright, so at least 
                        something was true. 

                                 MARGOT
                        No. I meant yes I am not from 
                        Nebraska.  

                                 GLEN
                        But that Corn Huskers T-shirt you 
                        always wear--

                                 MARGOT
                        They gave it to me. I don’t even 
                        really... like football. 

                                 GLEN
                        Great. Thaaat’s super. I put them 
                        in my pool every year for you and 
                        they are NOT what they used to be.

                                 ELISE
                        SHUT UP before I kill you both! 

           A small river cuts a winding path in front of them. On the 
           opposite bank-- a modest log cabin. Margot freezes. Elise 
           prods her forward. Holds the gun to Glen. 

           Margot takes a deep breath. Heads toward the little house.

           EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT

           A motion detector turns on, flooding the front walk with 
           light. A DOG BARKS. AN OLD GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG wiggles out of 
           the dog door, hobbling with age and hip dysplasia. Margot 
           inhales a sharp breath, drops to one knee.

                                 MARGOT
                        Angus?
           The dog hesitates. Then a flicker of recognition. Runs over, 
           tail wagging, licking. She buries her face in his fur.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        You’re an old man now buddy. I 
                        guess it’s been a long time.

                                 LEO (O.S.)
                        Mairéad?  

           She looks up. Even in the dark you can see how handsome this 
           guy is. LEO (40s) bare-chested and boxers, holding a baseball 
           bat, stands over top of her. Shocked. 

           BACK TO GLEN, WATCHING IN THE WOODS... in his silk pajamas.  

                                 GLEN
                        Who the hell is that?

                                 BAXTER
                        Her fiancé.

                                 GLEN
                        HER WHAT?!

           ON MARGOT AND LEO. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Hi... Leo. 

           He closes the distance. GRABS HER IN A HUGE KISS. 

           ON GLEN:

                                 GLEN
                        Oh that’s, well that’s just great. 
                        Thaaat’s really nice. 

           Glen lunges for the gun. Baxter swats his hand away.

           BACK TO THAT KISS.

           Margot breaks it. Steps back, hand to her lips. Frazzled. 

                                 LEO
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m... sorry. 

                                 LEO
                        For what? 
                                 ELISE
                        For this. 

           She steps out of the shadows. Gun raised. 

           INT. LEO’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Margot and Leo sit on the couch. Leo’s still bare-chested, 
           but wearing jeans. Elise drops a photo on the table in front 
           of them. A BEAUTIFUL GOLD AND JADE CROWN. 

                                 ELISE
                        The royal crown of Bhutan. Dates 
                        back to early 14th Century. 
                        Priceless. On display tonight at 
                        the Luminato Festival Gala. You two 
                        are going to steal it. 

           Old Angus, sitting at their feet, GROWLS. Margot calms him. 

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        I can’t believe you got the exact 
                        same dog with the exact same name.  

           They all look over. Glen pouts on a chair, arms crossed. 
           Won’t make eye contact. Margot sighs. Through gritted teeth--

                                 MARGOT
                        They wouldn’t let me bring my puppy 
                        into the program. We had just 
                        gotten him. I was lonely. 

                                 GLEN
                        Well is there a second set of 
                        identical kids somewhere I should 
                        know about? 

                                 LEO
                        You have kids? No of course you do. 
                        I just... wow. You’re a mom. I 
                        guess I just never found... the 
                        right person. Y’know, after... 

           It hangs for a beat. Glen snorts. 

                                 GLEN
                        You know what else you couldn’t 
                        seem to find Leo? A shirt. 

           Leo turns to Elise. Shoves the photo away. 

                                 LEO
                        The answer is no. We won’t do it. 
                                 ELISE
                        Then we have no use for you. 

           She raises the gun at Leo. Margot jumps up, blocking him. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Wait! 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh well you were A LOT quicker on 
                        the draw with that one weren’t you!

                                 MARGOT
                        If we steal this, that’s it. We’re 
                        done. Even. You’ll leave us alone? 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh “us?” We’re an “us” now? Super. 

                                 ELISE
                        Think of it as a retirement gift. 
                        You’re not the only one getting out 
                        of the game. We disappear, those 
                        kids of yours will be safe and 
                        sound, and you can go back to your 
                        pathetic little existence in 
                        suburbia.  
                             (re Leo, a smirk)
                        If you still want to, that is. 

           Glen GASPS! Offended at the implication. Leo turns to Margot. 

                                 LEO
                        It’s too dangerous. You know what 
                        they said. If you get caught 
                        committing a crime in the program, 
                        you go to jail for a long time. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Well then, we just won’t get 
                        caught. 

                                 ELISE
                        Oh one more thing. It will be on 
                        the head of Queen Jetsun Pema. 

           She drops another photo. THE BEAUTIFUL QUEEN OF BHUTAN 
           surrounded by FIERCE BODYGUARDS.

           EXT. EZ STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           The Uber pulls up to an Industrial park. The kids hop out. 
           Rows of storage units, enclosed by a fence. Gate locked. 
           Mim and Clancy start to scale the fence. Kevin hesitates at 
           the bottom. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Ooh climbing? Maybe I’ll just wait 
                        here. Pulled a hammy yesterday in 
                        gym. Pretty serious dodge ball game-

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to engage in any 
                        outdoor physical activities without 
                        my allergy medication. Pollen can 
                        cause my windpipe to narrow. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Would you two come on? It’s not 
                        exactly Fort Knox. 

           Kevin struggles to climb, Lewis behind him. Not graceful. 
           They HUFF, GRUNTING, pulling themselves awkwardly over the 
           fence. Lewis falls the last foot to the ground. They dust 
           themselves off, hurry to catch up.

           Clancy stands in front of storage unit eight. A large padlock 
           hangs from a thick chain. She spins the code in the lock. IT 
           OPENS. She lifts the door. SHRILL SOUND OF SCRAPING METAL. 

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

           Darkness. Clancy flicks a light switch on the wall, flooding 
           the space with artificial light. THEY ALL GASP. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: A BLACK TRION NEMESIS RR. (Badass 
           SuperCar. Google it. Yaaasss.) Kevin runs his hand down the 
           shiny black metal hood. In awe. 

                                 KEVIN
                        WHOOA. I saw this on Forza Horizon! 
                        It’s like the rarest car you can 
                        ever get. YonyPony88’s the only one 
                        that has it, and he’s number one 
                        all-time on the leaderboard. This 
                        was Nana and Grampy’s?!

           Clancy opens the door. It lifts up with a HISS. ON THE SEAT: 
           A black leather moto jacket. She pulls it out. Mim gapes. 

                                 MIM
                        Okay your mom is getting cooler by 
                        like the second.  

           Clancy puts it on, reaches in the pockets. On one side, she 
           pulls out car keys. On the other, a book of matches. 
           CLOSE ON MATCHES: ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON PUB. 127 St. 
           George Street, Toronto. 

           She flicks it open. The name WILLIAM scrawled in pen on the 
           inside flap and the number: 302.230085

                                 MIM (CONT’D)
                        Who’s William? 

                                 CLANCY
                        I don’t know. But it’s missing the 
                        last digit of his phone number. We 
                        need to find him. Here. This place.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Toronto? How the heck are we 
                        supposed to get there? It’s like an 
                        eight hour drive!

                                 LEWIS
                        But it’s only fifty nautical miles. 

                                 MIM
                        The ferry runs til midnight on 
                        weekends. 
                             (looking at her phone)
                        It’s 11:52. We won’t make it.  

                                 CLANCY
                        We’ll make it. Get in. 

           INT. TRION NEMESIS - SAME

           They pile in. The inside is even cooler if that’s possible. A 
           sleek dashboard of super high tech gadgets and buttons. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you sure you can drive this? 
                        You don’t even have your permit.

                                 CLANCY
                        Dad let me practice driving the van 
                        in the parking lot once. How much 
                        different can it be? 

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s this button do? 

           Before they can stop him, he reaches out and HITS THE BUTTON 
           MARKED PREDATOR MODE. (Yes, this is a real button.)

           THEY ALL SCREAM as the suspension drops lower, the interior 
           lights change color and ENGINE ROARS! A COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
                                 CAR VOICE
                        Welcome back, Mairéad. Please input 
                        your destination. 

           A NAVIGATION screen lights up. 

                                 MIM
                        Okay seriously? WHO IS YOUR MOM?

           Clancy grins. Runs her hands over the steering wheel.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mr. Kharoud SNORES SOFTLY. Mrs. Kharoud lies awake, eyes wide 
           open. She looks at the clock: 11:30. Elbows her husband. He 
           stirs, waking. 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        Whatsamatter, whahappened? 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        I can’t sleep. I’m worried about 
                        Lewis. Do you think he’s okay? 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        Honey, it’s almost midnight. He’s 
                        sound asleep.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        I just know they gave him caffeine. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Quiet. Deserted. Just the occasional chirp of crick-- ZOOOOM! 
           THE NEMESIS BLOWS BY DOING A COOL 120 mph. 

           INT. NEMESIS - NIGHT

           EVERYONE’S SCREAMING! Clancy white-knuckles the wheel at ten 
           and two. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Slow down!

                                 CLANCY
                        It’s not me! It’s like driving 
                        itself!

                                 LEWIS
                        I’M NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE IN 
                        PREDATOR MODE!
           EXT. HORNE’S FERRY MARINA - NIGHT

           The car SCREECHES to a stop. Doors lift-- kids jump out. 
           Lewis crawls out of the back seat. Falls on the ground in the 
           fetal position. LOUD FOG HORN BLOWS. They watch the last 
           ferry of the night already sailing a hundred yards offshore.

                                 MIM
                        We’re too late. 

           LOUD MUSIC, LAUGHTER filters through the woods by the docks. 
           Clancy points to Kevin and Lewis. 

                                 CLANCY
                        You two stay here. 

           EXT. WOODS/DOCKS - NIGHT

           The Pop-up Party. HIGH SCHOOL KIDS talk and laugh, and other 
           things parents wouldn’t approve of under the cover of night.  

           A GROUP OF KIDS sit on the pier. A small whaler bobs in the 
           water beside them. Clancy sees HIM: Travis. She inhales a 
           sharp breath. Mim spots him too.   

                                 MIM
                        Well well. Look who it is. C’mon! 

                                 CLANCY
                        No! Mim-- don’t!

           But she’s already making her way through the crowded party.  

           INT/EXT. NEMESIS - SAME

           Kevin sits in the driver’s seat, pretending to drive. Making 
           CAR NOISES. Lewis sits beside him, thoughtful. Quiet.  

                                 LEWIS
                        I saw my life flash before my eyes 
                        back there. Kev? It was really 
                        short. And really boring. 

           TALKING AND LAUGHING. Jeremy and his Dickhead friends emerge 
           from the woods by the Nemesis. The red glow of a cigarette 
           being passed around. Kevin’s eyes light up. A wicked grin.  

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s about to get a lot better.

           He swipes the touchscreen on the dash. Hits intercom. 
           EXT. MARINA - SAME

           Jeremy and Friends rough house, laugh. Nemesis HIGH BEAMS 
           FLICK ON, illuminating their surprised faces. SHORT BLEEP OF 
           A SIREN. THEN, ON SPEAKER:

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                             (deep voice)
                        FBI. Freeze. 

           They all stare. Deer in headlights. Jeremy turns to run.

                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do it, Jeremy Wachter. Turn 
                        around. That’s right. Put your 
                        hands up. Do you brainless mouth-
                        breathers know what you’ve done? 
                        You’ve just walked into the middle 
                        of a sting operation. You’ve 
                        compromised everything. 

                                 JEREMY
                             (hands raised)
                        I’m sorry sir, we were just--

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        I’ll do the talking you steaming 
                        pile of dog vomit! KGB snipers are 
                        everywhere out here! They probably 
                        have you in their crosshairs right 
                        now. 

           They look around the dark woods, terrified. A TWIG SNAPS. 
           They WHIMPER. 

                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Empty your pockets! Everything! 

           They unload their pockets: loose change, gum, cell phones. 

                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now. Take off your clothes. 

           A GIGGLE comes through the intercom. It shuts off abruptly. 
           Jeremy and friends exchange worried looks, what the--? 

           INTERCOM CUTS BACK ON. HALF-GIGGLE, A SHUSH SOUND, THEN 
           THROAT CLEARING--

                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What are you waiting for? You could 
                        be bugged. Take off your clothes. 
                             (off their hesitation)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You wanna spend the rest of your 
                        pathetic, wastoid lives in a 
                        Siberian Gulag?  

           They quickly disrobe. Standing in their undies. Super Hero 
           boxers. Jeremy’s in tightie-whities. They squirm, nervous.  

                                 KEVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now... sing. 

                                 JEREMY
                        Sing? Um... sir?

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        It scrambles their signal. SING!

                                 JEREMY
                        But what do we--

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Anything! Just hurry up!

           They start SINGING. Each one a different song. Tentative. 
           Terrible, off-key. Eyes closed, they start to sway a little. 

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        No dancing! What is this, a 
                        Broadway musical? 
                             (then)
                        Alright, that’s enough. NOW GET 
                        OUTTA HERE! GO! MOVE IT!
                             (as they grab clothes)
                        LEAVE THEM! THERE’S NO TIME!

           They sprint off. Kevin and Lewis tumble out of the car, 
           laughing. Standing over their new pile of treasures. 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Jeremy and gang sprint through the party in their underwear. 
           YELLING ABOUT KGB! PEOPLE laugh, filming on their phones.    
           Mim and Clancy approach the GROUP OF KIDS on the pier. 

                                 MIM
                        We like, need to get to Canada. 

           They all stop talking. Huh? One of them leans closer, wobbly. 
           We recognize her as our Mean Girl/Emma. Her glazed eyes and 
           red Solo cup hint at things still foreign to Clancy. 

                                 MEAN GIRL/EMMA
                        OMG, Clancy Finch? Fire Crotch is 
                        that you? 
                                 CLANCY
                        Ha, um, yeah. Hey Emma.  

                                 EMMA
                        Wow, I didn’t know you had it in 
                        you to sneak out. Bravo. Here.  

           She holds out a cup. Less an invitation than a dare. Foamy 
           liquid sloshes as she wobbles.  

                                 CLANCY
                        Um, no thanks. 

                                 EMMA
                        Once a band nerd, always a band 
                        nerd, right?  

           Emma LAUGHS, obnoxious. SOME KIDS join in. Not Travis. Kevin 
           and Lewis run up, breathless. Laughing. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Clancy! Guess what we just did--

                                 EMMA
                        Ohmygod, did you bring your little 
                        brother to a party? That is so 
                        weird. How’d you guys get here, 
                        horse and buggy?

           Some in the group laugh. Kevin watches Clancy’s face fall. 

                                 KEVIN
                        No! She drove us in an awesome spy 
                        car in predator mode. It has lasers 
                        that can melt your stupid face off! 

           They all LAUGH. Clancy flushes, even more embarrassed. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Kevin! That’s not true. Sorry, he’s 
                        such a little weirdo. 

           Kevin wilts, stung by her words. Emma smirks. 

                                 EMMA
                        Guess freak runs in the family. 

                                 MIM
                        Look we need to get across the 
                        lake. To Toronto. It’s like urgent.  

                                 EMMA
                        You can’t just drive across the 
                        lake. Border Patrol will catch you. 
           ANOTHER OLDER KID, JOEY, sits up. 

                                 JOEY
                        Nu uh. Me and my brothers sneak 
                        across all the time to go fishing 
                        and never get busted. It’s easy. I 
                        know a spot you won’t get caught. 

           Travis smiles at Clancy. She flushes, quickly looks at her 
           feet. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        We could take you. Right Joey? This 
                        party’s kinda lame anyways.  

           Joy shrugs, up for the adventure. Emma SCOFFS.  

                                 EMMA
                        NO WAY. I am NOT going to Canada in 
                        a tiny boat. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        I know. It’s only a six-seater. You 
                        can’t fit.   

           Mim laughs. Emma reacts, offended.  

                                 EMMA
                        Whatever. Have fun getting busted 
                        with Band Nerd and her freak fest.    

           Emma and her Mean Friends stomp off down the pier. Clancy 
           burns red. Travis rolls his eyes, smiles at her.  

                                 TRAVIS
                        Don’t worry about them. They’re 
                        annoying. I’ve seen you at school. 
                        I remember your red hair. You’re a 
                        freshman, right?  

                                 CLANCY
                        Oh. Um. Yeah. Clancy.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Cool name.  

           She hides a smile. As he turns to untie the boat, she locks 
           eyes with Mim, who mouths “OHMYGOD.” They stifle giggles. 
           Lewis looks at the small boat. Nervous.   

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed aboard water craft 
                        without a proper life preserver.
           INT. LEO’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Maps, weapons, gadgets spread across the table-- a makeshift 
           situation room. Elise drops a bag of clothes and a dossier. 

                                 ELISE
                        Baxter and I run intel. You two, 
                        Count and Countess Van Der Holt of 
                        Wales, secure the crown. 
                             (to Margot)
                        I heard you were the best. I guess 
                        that was before the muffin top. 

           Margot ignores her. Studies the blueprint. Points to a spot. 

                                 MARGOT
                        There. Escape route is the vents in

           ON IDENTICAL SPOTS ON THEIR HANDS: He has an eternity symbol. 
           She has a faded, discolored mark of similar size. Margot 
           draws her hand back quickly. Glen GASPS, horrified.

                                 GLEN
                        You said that was a birthmark.

                                 ELISE
                        Get ready. Wheels up in ten. 

           She leaves. Leo and Margot go into work mode. She steps 
           behind the door to undress. He preps tools and gadgets. Uses 
           tweezers to hold up a thin, translucent paper. Packs it very 
           carefully into their bag.

                        Glen. Don’t blame her. Everything 
                        was my fault. We were dumb, broke 
                        kids who wanted to have a bigger 
                        life. But I wanted it the easy way. 
                        I got us involved with Jean-Paul 
                        Gagnon. A very dangerous, connected 
                        man. He was ex-CIA turned big time 
                        smuggler, trafficker.

                        And your testimony put a very 
                        powerful, dangerous man behind 
                        bars. You did the right thing. 

           Margot steps back into the room. Wearing a GORGEOUS GOWN. She 
           looks stunning. Both Leo and Glen draw in a breath.  

                                 LEO
                        But it cost me everything. 

           Glen looks back and forth between them, staring at each 
           other. WTF?! He stands up, pissed. 

                                 GLEN
                        Okay. I’m coming with you.

           Margot SCOFFS, dismissive. Packing supplies. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous. 

                                 LEO
                        He could be useful. For diversion. 
                        If we had a situation like Romania.  

           Glen reacts, Romania?! Grabs the bag with the clothes, starts 
           rifling through. SOUND OF A CHOPPER OUTSIDE. 

                                 MARGOT
                        See? We’re going on a helo and you 
                        don’t have your Dramamine. What 
                        about your motion sickness?

           Glen starts undressing, hesitates. Looks at Leo, who’s still 
           bare-chested. He steps behind the door where Margot changed. 

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        I do not get motion sickness.

                                 MARGOT
                        You were stuck in the cabin 
                        throwing up for four days on the 
                        Disney Cruise last summer--

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        For the last time, it was Pluto’s 
                        potato salad. You can’t leave 
                        mayonnaise products on a buffet for 
                        six hours and expect no 
                        repercussions! 

           EXT. LAKE ONTARIO - NIGHT

           The kids’ whaler cuts through the choppy black water. Mim and 
           Clancy bounce in their seats, waves spray up around them. 
           Lewis sits, life vest secured tightly around him.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Hey kid! You okay?

           WIDER REVEALS: Kevin, almost green, leaning over the side of 
           the boat. Mouth hanging open, water spraying on his face. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh yeah! I’m great. Love the open 
                        water. Only water as faaaar as the 
                        eye can see. 

                                 CLANCY
                        He gets sea sick like my dad. 
                                 KEVIN
                             (eyes closed, dying)
                        Do not. That was food poisoning 
                        from the buffet.  

           IN THE FAR DISTANCE: LIGHTS SWIRL ON A COASTAL INTERCEPTOR. A 
           STERN VOICE OVER THE VHF RADIO.    

                                 VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        US BORDER PATROL. Please be advised 
                        you are crossing International 
                        waters. Cut your engine and prepare 
                        for immediate boarding.  

           The kids react, scared. Joey cuts the engine.  

                                 CLANCY
                        What do we do? 

           They drift a few hundred yards from the grassy shoreline.   

                                 TRAVIS
                        Joey and I can stall them, say we 
                        were just messing around and got 
                        lost. You guys could swim. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m sorry, what?  

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to swim at public 
                        beaches that haven’t had their 
                        bacteria levels recently tested.

                                 TRAVIS
                        It’s not that far. You can make it.  
                        It’s dark enough that they won’t 
                        see you. But you gotta hurry. 

                                 MIM
                             (looks in the dark water)
                        Swim? Like in the water? Where 
                        things... live? Like sharks. 

                                 JOEY
                        There’s nothing in there except 
                        some Lake Sturgeon and maybe a 
                        coupla’ Northern Water snakes. 

                                 MIM
                        Snakes? Nu uh! NO WAY.  

           Travis pulls out a waterproof sack. Handing it to Clancy.   
                                 TRAVIS
                        Put your clothes and stuff in this 
                        water bag. But you guys have to go 
                        now if you’re gonna go! 

           Clancy takes it, hesitates. Travis smiles, turns his head. 

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        We won’t look. 

           He punches Joey in the arm, who turns away. Clancy and Mim 
           hurry and undress, down to their underwear. 

           Kevin sneaks a look at Mim. Heart undies. He turns away, face 
           red, eyes wide, mind exploding. He reaches for his shirt, 
           then hesitates. Not wanting to take it off. Embarrassed. 

                                 KEVIN
                        So, um, this might be the end of 
                        the line for me. Maybe I’ll stay 
                        with the guys here, throw these 
                        cops off the scent--

           A SPLASH as Clancy jumps in. Starts swimming. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Kevin, GET IN HERE! 

           He glances at Mim, who sticks a foot in the water, and 
           SQUEALS. Travis notices Kevin watching her, flustered. 

                                 TRAVIS
                             (whisper)
                        Hey bud. For what it’s worth? 
                        Chicks dig confidence. 

           Kevin steels himself. Hurries to take his shirt and pants 
           off, and awkwardly cannonballs in. When he surfaces, we see 
           the determination on his face NOT TO FREAK OUT.  

                                 KEVIN
                             (terrified, to Mim)
                        See? Not scary at all. Snakes are 
                        more afraid of you than you are of-- 
                             (squeals)
                        Something touched my leg. No, it’s 
                        fine. Probably just some seaweed. 
                        Nothing to AAHHH! Okay there it was 
                        again. But it’s totally gone now.  

           Lewis, blindingly white torso, holds his nose and falls in. 

           Mim cautiously slips off the side of the boat. Starts to 
           FREAK OUT IN THE WATER! SPLASHING, SCREAMING! They SHUSH her!
           The Interceptor is almost within range. A spotlight darts 
           around the dark water beside their boat. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Dude! You have to chill, they’re 
                        gonna catch you!

           Kevin swims over to Mim. Grabs her hand. Calmly. 

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s okay. Don’t be scared. Here, 
                        get on my back. I’ll swim with you. 

           She wraps her arms around his neck tightly. Clinging. 

                                 MIM
                        Is that too tight? 

                                 KEVIN
                             (hiding a smile)
                        No. It’s... good. 

           Travis winks at Kevin. Tosses the bag of clothes to Clancy.  

                                 TRAVIS
                        Hey! Good luck with... whatever you 
                        guys are doing. And... I lied. 
                             (smiles at Clancy)
                        I peeked. 

           INT. FINCH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Henry, still tied to the chair, sings along to the tune--

                                 HENRY
                        “We won’t go until we get some, so 
                        bring them right here!” I never 
                        understood that one, you know? They 
                        show up to sing carols, but then 
                        demand cookies and won’t leave 
                        until they get some? How is that 
                        Christmas spirit? That’s just plain 
                        extortion. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Angus sitting in front of him. GROWLS.  

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Angus. Listen buddy. You and I? We 
                        want the same things here. How can 
                        I get through to y--

           His eyes fall on the cupcakes, scattered on the floor. He 
           very slowly starts to scoot his chair backwards. 
           INT/EXT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Elise drives. Baxter watches live feed of security cameras on 
           his laptop. Margot and Leo, now looking like Jason Statham in 
           a tux, sit together. He pulls out the translucent paper. 

                                 ELISE
                        There will be a receiving line for 
                        King Jigme and Queen Pema in the 
                        Grand Ballroom. Once you touch her 
                        hand, the oils will absorb into her 
                        skin. You’ll have approximately 
                        three minutes before she gets sick 
                        and retires to the closest 
                        bathroom, in the east wing. 

           Margot carefully places her hand on the paper, peeling off a 
           thin film that covers her entire palm. She holds it out, 
           careful not to touch anything. Looks over her shoulder. Sigh.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Are you okay? I told you the helo 
                        was a bad idea. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Glen, in an ugly brown, ill-fitting suit, 
           struggles to sit upright in his seat. Flop sweat almost 
           soaking through his shirt. Green. 

                                 GLEN
                        Nope, I’m good. Totally fi-- 
                             (dry heave)
                        Swallowed it. Maybe I just need 
                        some bread to settle my stomach. 
                        They’ll probably have food there. 

                                 LEO
                        We’re not really gonna have a lot 
                        of time to eat, Glen.

                                 GLEN
                        I wasn’t suggesting a sit-down 
                        dinner, Leo. I was talking some 
                        apps, maybe a dip. Y’know it’s so 
                        interesting that you found such a 
                        sleek tux in that bag- what is 
                        that, Tom Ford? But all that was 
                        left for me was this thing.

           A closer look at his suit: polyester. Pants end well above 
           his ankles. Suit jacket too tight, arms too short.  

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        What is it made out of, Berber 
                        carpet? Retains a lot of heat-- 
                                 LEO
                        Well next time the three of us plan 
                        a heist, I’ll make sure they pack 
                        more options for you, Glen--   

                                 MARGOT
                        Both of you shut up. 

                                 GLEN
                        He started it.

           EXT. ROYAL CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC - TORONTO - NIGHT

           One of the largest, most distinguished musical institutions 
           in the world. SPARKLE OF FLASHBULBS as HIGH-SOCIETY GUESTS 
           and FOREIGN DIGNITARIES filter into the glamorous party.    

           INT/EXT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Elise, dressed as the driver, opens the door. 

                                 ELISE
                        In and out. Baxter has eyes on you. 
                        Don’t get cute.  

           Leo, Margot and Glen walk toward the entrance. A PHOTOGRAPHER 
           steps in front, camera raised. Leo pulls Margot to him-- 
           obscures their faces WITH A KISS. Photog snaps a pic, moves 
           on. Glen’s mouth drops, horrified. 

                                 LEO
                        Sorry Glen. Can’t have pictures.

                        And I’d say less like a secretary, 
                        and more like a bodyguard. Highly 
                        trained, lethal. 

           He makes a karate chop move. Knocking over an expensive-
           looking sculpture. IT SHATTERS. Everyone stares, horrified.

                             (re Leo)
                        He will be happy to pay for that. 
                        He’s a Count, so, he’s extremely 
                        wealthy. Put it on his tab, ha! No, 
                        but my deepest apologies. 

           SECURITY motions to another GUARD. He escorts Glen to the 
           side for a thorough pat down. 

                                 SECURITY
                        Just a precaution, sir. He’s not on 
                        the list. 

                                 LEO
                        Of course. Please. 

           Margot sighs, rolls her eyes, as they wait.  

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Four soggy, waterlogged bodies heave themselves onto the 
           sand. Kevin lies, one cheek on the sand, breathing hard. 
           Clancy and Mim pop up, run up the beach to change. 

           Lewis drags himself next to Kevin, coughing. Spitting out sea 
           water. Exhausted. 

                                 LEWIS
                        There have been forty cases of 
                        brain-eating amoeba’s infecting 
                        people through unsanitary water. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Lewis. I felt... boob on my back. 

           Lewis’s eyes go wide. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I think that’s first base. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Totally worth it. 

           They grin. Try to high-five, but can’t move their tired arms. 
           ANGLE ON CLANCY AND MIM, GETTING DRESSED. THE SOUND OF LOUD, 
           PROLONGED SCREAMING. THEY FREEZE, SCARED. 

                                 MIM
                        What do they do to people in 
                        Canada?!

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The four kids push through heavy brush, fearful. To find... 

           EXT. CENTREVILLE AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           An old-time children’s amusement park at the edge of downtown 
           Toronto. CARNIVAL MUSIC. HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS as a roller 
           coaster roars past overhead. 

           AN EMPLOYEE drives up on A GOLF CART, loaded with carnival 
           food and prizes. He jumps off, carrying a crate of candy into 
           a tent. Clancy watches him disappear inside, a grin. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN TORONTO - NIGHT

           VARIOUS POSTERS AND BANNERS TOUT THE 2017 LUMINATO FESTIVAL. 
           A huge celebration of arts and music that overtakes downtown 
           Toronto for ten days. LOUD MUSIC, LAUGHTER fills the streets. 

           DRUNKEN PARTIERS spill out onto the streets from bars and 
           exhibits.  Clancy drives through the crowded masses IN THE 
           STOLEN GOLF CART. HUGE STUFFED TOYS hang out the back. Mim 
           stares at the GPS map on her phone. 

                                 SIRI (ON PHONE)
                        You have reached your destination. 

           ACROSS THE STREET: PILSKY’S DRY CLEANING. 127 St. George 
           street. Clancy looks at the matchbook. 127 St. George Street.  

                                 CLANCY
                        There must be some mistake. You two 
                        stay here.

           Clancy and Mim run across the street, leaving the boys. 

           EXT. GOLF CART - NIGHT

           TWO SLOPPY DRUNK GIRLS stagger up. Plop down in the front 
           seats. ONE GIRL SOBS. THE OTHER WOBBLY ONE comforts her. 

           Kevin and Lewis, eating carnival popcorn, exchange looks.
                                 WOBBLY GIRL
                        Forget him. He doesn’t deserve you. 

                                 SOBBING GIRL
                        It’s me. It’s because I’m not 
                        pretty enough. Isn’t it? 

           She looks back at Lewis. Mascara running, snot streaming, 
           hair wild. HER POV: three of his blurry faces. Then, crazy--  

                                 SOBBING GIRL (CONT’D)
                        ISN’T IT? 

           Lewis jumps, spilling his popcorn. Scared. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Me? No! You’re... really pretty. 
                        Don’t cry. 

           He hands her a STUFFED UNICORN from the back. 

                                 SOBBING GIRL
                        Ohmygod. Really? That is SO SWEET. 
                             (then, leaning closer)
                        You’re super cute. 

                                 WOBBLY GIRL
                             (hissing in her ear)
                        No way Amanda. He looks really 
                        short. 

           She touches Lewis’s arm, flirty. His eyes go wide, nervous. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m not allowed to talk to overly-
                        emotional, provocatively-dressed 
                        women.

                                 SOBBING GIRL
                        You are so funny! I’m Amanda. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m Lew--

           She leans over, PLANTS A KISS ON HIM. Pulls back, giggling.  
           Then leans over and THROWS UP EVERYWHERE. Even on the 
           unicorn. 

                                 WOBBLY GIRL
                        There you go. Good girl. Let it all 
                        out. That’s it.

           Lewis breaks out into a huge smile. Kevin dry heaves, 
           spitting out popcorn.
                                 KEVIN
                        The sound of barf makes me barf!

           EXT. PILSKY’S DRY CLEANING - NIGHT

           Clancy and Mim peek inside the store. Lights off, CLOSED sign 
           on the door. A GROUP OF PARTYING GUYS walk past. 

                                 MIM
                        Excuse me, do you know where St. 
                        George and the Dragon pub is?

                                 PARTYING GUY
                        This used to be it. It burned down 
                        like six years ago. 

                                 MIM
                        So what do we do now?

                                 CLANCY
                        I... don’t know. 

           Clancy turns back to the golf cart. Deflated. She’s now 
           facing directly across the street. Her eyes light up. 

           EXT. GOLF CART - NIGHT

           Clancy and Mim race back to Kevin and Lewis. Our Drunk girls 
           stumble off down the street. Lewis still GRINNING BROADLY.  

                                 MIM
                        What’s he so happy about? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Kev, what is that thing mom’s 
                        always saying?

                                 KEVIN
                        Stop wiping boogers on the couch?

                                 CLANCY
                        No. The other thing. 

           Beat, thinking. 

                                 KEVIN
                        The library? She’s always talking 
                        about how she used to go there all 
                        the time because she had no 
                        friends, just to try and trick us 
                        into reading stupid books. I’m not 
                        falling for it. 
                                 CLANCY
                             (holding up matchbook)
                        This isn’t a phone number. It’s the 
                        dewey decimal system. A call number 
                        for a library book! William is that 
                        dead poet guy she’s always quoting.
                             (pointing behind them)
                        Look!

           THE THOMAS FISHER RARE BOOK LIBRARY. PEOPLE climb the tall 
           steps, filtering in and out of the open Festival Exhibit.  

                                 MIM
                        People still go to libraries? Isn’t 
                        that what kindles are for? Duh.

           INT. THOMAS FISHER RARE BOOK LIBRARY - NIGHT

           A massive atrium rises up seven stories. Hundreds of 
           thousands of dusty books. A SIGN WELCOMES THE FREE ART 
           INSTALLATION. VISITORS mill around, admiring the pieces.

           Clancy scans the directory, hits the elevator button. Lewis 
           gawks at an impressive wooden structure, roped off.  

                                 LEWIS
                        I think this is a real Gutenberg!

                                 MIM
                        A what?

                                 LEWIS
                        A printing press? 

                                 MIM
                        A what? 

           The elevator DINGS. Doors slide open. 

           INT. LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

           The elevator spits them out into the LITERATURE section. 

           Clancy winds around the huge shelves, scanning the call 
           numbers. She pulls out the matchbook, running her finger 
           along the books to find the exact number-- there. She pulls 
           out COLLECTED POEMS of William Butler Yeats.  

                                 CLANCY
                        This is it. 

           She quickly thumbs through the book, searching. But nothing. 
           She flips it over, looking at the back cover, the spine. It’s 
           just a book. She looks up, confused. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Try all of them.

           They pull all the Yeats books down off the shelf. A huge pile 
           on the floor. They tear through it-- rifling through pages, 
           shaking them, feverishly searching... 

           Nothing. Clancy tosses the last book. Deflated. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I don’t get it. This should be it. 
                        Something should be here. 

                                 KEVIN
                        It was a good guess. Mom’s aaalways 
                        saying that thing, “Don’t judge me 
                        or my books, or something bla bla,” 
                        I dunno, I wasn’t really listening. 

                                 MIM
                        Clancy. I think we gotta call the 
                        police now. This is waay over our 
                        heads, y’know? Clance?   

           But she’s walking toward the wall, where LARGE FRAMED 
           PICTURES OF AUTHORS stare back at her. 

                                 CLANCY
                        “Come to this hallowed place where 
                        my friends’ portraits hang...”

           She stops in front of a life-sized portrait of WILLIAM BUTLER 
           YEATS 1865-1939. He appears to be looking right at her. 

           She reaches out... and starts to yank it off the wall. It’s 
           too heavy. She strains, grunting.  

                                 CLANCY (CONT’D)
                        Give me a hand.

           They hurry over to help. It takes all four of them to pull it 
           off the wall. It CRASHES to the ground with a THUD. 

           Revealing a small, hidden door. 

           They all react, GASPS of surprise! Clancy reaches out, twists 
           the handle. Locked. She reaches into her pocket, remembering.   
           And pulls out the key from her mother’s locket. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Where did you get that? 
                                 CLANCY
                        The locket mom always wears. 

           She turns the key, unlocking it. Pushes at the heavy wooden 
           door, and it slowly creaks open. REVEALING STEPS TO A DARK 
           UNDERGROUND TUNNEL. Mim peers over her shoulder.  

                                 MIM
                        Nope. No way. Not taking the dark, 
                        scary stairs of doom to our deaths.  

                                 CLANCY
                        Whatever’s down here is gonna lead 
                        to my mom.  

                                 MIM
                        Right. Or to zombies ripping our 
                        faces off and eating our brains. 
                        Seriously? It’s like you don’t even 
                        have Netflix. 

                                 LEWIS
                        The city of Toronto built an entire 
                        underground network called the 
                        PATH. It’s a series of tunnels and 
                        walkways linking the buildings 
                        downtown so people can stay out of 
                        the cold. There’s supposed to be 
                        shops and restaurants down there 
                        too. Almost like a shopping mall. 

                                 MIM
                        Yeah. Because that looks like it 
                        leads to the mall. 

                                 LEWIS
                        There’s tons of urban myths and 
                        stories about old, long lost secret 
                        passageways in the PATH. They even 
                        say some organized crime use them 
                        to hide from police.  

           A LIBRARY EMPLOYEE comes around the corner. 

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Hey! You kids can’t be down here--
                        What the? What did you do?! That’s 
                        just great. Stay right there! HEY!

                                 CLANCY
                        Come on!

           She shoves them through the door, locking it behind them. 
           Employee BANGS on the door, pushing. It won’t budge. 
           INT. ROYAL CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

           A FORMAL BALL. AN ORCHESTRA plays while GUESTS dance and 
           mingle. SOME wait in a receiving line to greet KING JIGME 
           KHESAR NAMGYEL WANGCHUCK and QUEEN JETSUN PEMA, young royalty 
           considered the Will and Kate of the Himalayas.

           CLOSE ON: A HEAVY-SET WOMAN dripping in expensive jewelry. 
           She suddenly frowns, turning sharply. Revealing Margot behind 
           her. Holding a cellphone. Beat. Margot smiles, holds it out 
           for the woman. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I think you dropped your phone. 

           Heavy Woman gives her a tight-lipped smile. Takes the phone 
           back, pulling her purse tightly to her. Leo laughs softly. 

                                 LEO
                        A little out of practice? 

           Margot scans the room, taking a quick inventory.  

                                 MARGOT
                        I need a way to reach out to Henry--

                                 LEO
                        Too risky. If we just give them 
                        what they want, they’ll disappear 
                        for good. Your family will be safe. 

           WIDER REVEALS GLEN: holding a plate of tiny appetizers. Still 
           sweating, but looking a little better. 

                                 GLEN
                        Who’s Henry? Wait, Henry your best 
                        friend from college? 
                             (off her look)
                        Lemme guess. Not from college. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh, honey. He’s... the US Marshall 
                        assigned to my case. 

                                 GLEN
                             (whisper-shout)
                        He came for Thanksgiving! I baked 
                        cranberry corn bread because you 
                        said it was his favorite. 

                                 MARGOT
                        It was a pre-scheduled home visit. 
                        He loved the bread. We all did.
           SECURITY ushers them forward in line. It’s their turn to 
           greet the GORGEOUS YOUNG KING AND QUEEN OF BHUTAN. Leo bows 
           deeply. 

                                 LEO
                        Your Excellencies. My wife, 
                        Countess Van Der Holt. 

           King Jigme smiles, nods. 

                                 KING JIGME
                        Very beautiful. 

           Leo takes Margot’s (safe) hand. KISSES IT. Looks at her. 

                                 LEO
                        Yes. I’m a very lucky man. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve never forgotten that. 

           Glen hands his plate to a WAITER. Fuming. He’s had it. 

                                 GLEN
                        Okay, I’m sorry. That’s it. That. 
                        Is. It. I will not stand here and--

           HE GRABS MARGOT’S OTHER HAND. She jerks it back. She and Leo 
           react, stunned. Glen realizes what he’s done, GASPS!

           PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH. THEN GASPS AGAIN! Throwing 
           his hands out like jazz hands. SPITTING! FREAKING OUT!

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        I think it got in my mouth! What 
                        happens if it gets in my mouth? 

           SECURITY CIRCLES tightly, not sure what’s happening. OTHERS 
           look over, noticing the commotion.  

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Should I have milk?! Remember when 
                        Kevin drank that glow stick in 
                        second grade to make his insides 
                        light up? Poison Control said to 
                        drink milk! SOMEONE GET A GLASS OF 
                        MILK!

                                 LEO
                             (trying to save it)
                        Please excuse our assistant, he 
                        hasn’t been feeling well--

                                 MARGOT
                        It might be some food poisoning--
                                 GLEN
                        Okay, I don’t think anything’s 
                        happening. I feel okay. I think I’m 
                        okay. Maybe I’m immune. I have a 
                        pretty solid immune sys--

           HE TURNS AND VOMITS ALL OVER THE QUEEN’S DRESS. HORRIFIED 
           GASPS. SHRIEKS! ROYAL SECURITY SEIZES THE THREE OF THEM. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND PATH - NIGHT

           Dark, eerie. The kids walk down the old tracks of a forgotten 
           subway station. Mim uses the flashlight app on her phone to 
           light the way. Kevin and Clancy a few steps behind.  

                                 KEVIN
                        That party at the docks, that was 
                        the party you were sneaking out to? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Wha? Yeah. I guess. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Who was that girl? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Just my friend, Emma.  

                                 KEVIN
                        She didn’t seem very... nice.

                                 CLANCY
                        She was just joking around. That’s 
                        how we are with each other. You 
                        just don’t get it. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh, okay. It’s just, she sounded 
                        kinda mean. My friends would never 
                        talk to me like that--

                                 CLANCY
                        That’s because you’re dorks. Dorks 
                        are super nice all the time because 
                        they have to be. Popular kids are 
                        mean, because they can be. But it’s 
                        funny. It’s not a big deal.   

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh. 
                             (beat, processing)
                        So in high school, people like the 
                        mean kids but not the nice kids? 
                                 CLANCY
                        No, yes. It’s hard to explain. Just 
                        stop asking so many dumb questions! 

           ANGLE ON: Mim and Lewis, a few paces ahead. Lewis WHEEZES. 

                                 MIM
                        Are you okay? 

                                 LEWIS
                        Yeah.  

           HOARSE, PERSISTENT COUGHING. DRY HACKING.

                                 MIM
                        Are you sure? You kind of sound 
                        like you’re dying. Do you have 
                        asthma or something? 

                                 LEWIS
                        No. I’m just really thirsty. I’m 
                        not allowed to have any liquids 
                        after six o’clock. 

           As soon as it comes out, he regrets it. She laughs. 

                                 MIM
                        Why not? 

           His cheeks burn bright red. He fidgets, embarrassed. 

                                 LEWIS
                        No, it’s nothing. You wouldn’t 
                        understand. 

                                 MIM
                        Try me. 

                                 LEWIS
                        It’s... embarrassing. 

           They walk for a beat. Then--

                                 MIM
                        Do you know why I take videos of 
                        myself all the time for my 
                        Instagram page and my YouTube 
                        channel and stuff? 

                                 LEWIS
                        The pressure to be socially 
                        accepted causes you to seek 
                        validation and connectivity online? 
                             (off her look)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEWIS (CONT'D)
                        My mom made me watch an Anderson 
                        Cooper special last night about the 
                        dangers of the internet. 

                                 MIM
                        You say weird things, you know 
                        that?

                                 LEWIS
                        Yeah. 

                                 MIM
                        Okay maybe a little bit of that 
                        stuff now. But I used to stutter 
                        when I was your age. Like really 
                        bad. Like no one could understand 
                        me and people used to make fun of 
                        me and call me MamamamaMim.

                                 LEWIS
                        Really? 

                                 MIM
                        Yeah. I had to go to a speech 
                        therapist and everything. It made 
                        me really shy and not want to talk 
                        to people.

                                 LEWIS
                        I get it. So after you fixed your 
                        stutter, you got your confidence 
                        back. And now you have the ability 
                        to talk to the world.   

                                 MIM
                        Wrong smarty-pants. I started all 
                        that stuff when I still had my 
                        stutter. Speaking on camera alone 
                        in my room all the time, instead of 
                        in front of people, helped me get 
                        more comfortable. Then my stutter 
                        got better and better until one day 
                        it was just gone. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Wow. Really? That’s cool. 

                                 MIM
                        My point is, everyone has something 
                        they’re embarrassed about. Just 
                        don’t let it keep you from doing 
                        stuff you want to do. Because, 
                        you’re a cool kid. In like, you’re 
                        own super weird way. 
           Lewis swells with pride at this unexpected knighting. Beat.

                                 LEWIS
                        You’re cool too. And not just the 
                        online Mim. I mean, the real Mim. 
                             (off her dismissive scoff)
                        I’m not the only one who thinks so. 

           She follows his gaze to Kevin, carrying the backpack. He’s 
           staring at her. Smiles and waves-- THEN PROCEEDS TO FREAK 
           OUT. Waving his arms frantically, SPITTING, SHRIEKING, 
           grabbing at invisible things on his face.

           After thirty seconds of this dance, he stops. Calls over--

                                 KEVIN
                        Spider web! Walked into a spider 
                        web. That was huge. Hate to see the 
                        spider that made that man-catching 
                        net! No I’m cool now. 
                             (pointing ahead)
                        What’s that? 

           An ABANDONED SUBWAY CAR sits idle on the tracks. All the 
           windows covered. They walk closer, cautious.

                                 CLANCY
                        Let’s find out. 

                                 MIM
                        Oh, “let’s find out.” Cut to, 
                        zombie-aliens munching on our 
                        flesh. HAVE YOU NOT SEEN EVERY 
                        HORROR MOVIE EVER? Seriously!

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Doors open, revealing our kids’ tentative faces. Eyes wide. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: a make-shift office. Wall to wall stuff. 
           Papers, furniture, books, antiques, electronics. Some things 
           look brand new, some ancient. They start to pick through the 
           junk. Kevin holds up AN OLD-SCHOOL PAGER. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Look at all this crap. What’s this? 

                                 LEWIS
                        Our parents used them to 
                        communicate in the old days. You 
                        called the pager, typed in a phone 
                        number and they called you back 
                        from a payphone--
                                 KEVIN
                        What the heck’s a payphone?

                                 LEWIS
                        Or they used a specific code where
                        each letter was represented by a 
                        number or series of numbers. It was 
                        like ancient texting. 

                                 MIM
                        The olden days were so tragic. How 
                        did anyone ever communicate? 

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Um, guys? 

           A DIRTY, HOMELESS-LOOKING MAN dressed in rags, carrying a 
           large sack over his shoulder, holds a terrified Kevin, one 
           arm around his neck. They all freeze.  

                                 SCARY MAN
                        I’m going to ask you some 
                        questions, and for every answer I 
                        don’t like, I’m going to cut off a 
                        finger. Starting with his pinky. 

           He holds out a LARGE HUNTING KNIFE. They REACT!  

                                 SCARY MAN (CONT’D)
                        How did you find this place?  

                                 KEVIN 
                        Our mom gave us a key! Margot 
                        Finch!

                                 SCARY MAN
                        Don’t know her. Wrong answer. 

           He extends Kevin’s pinky, holds the knife up to it. They all 
           SCREAM! Kevin squeezes his eyes shut, terrified. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Not my pinky! I need that one! It’s 
                        a very important and undervalued 
                        finger!

                                 MIM
                        Not Margot Finch, he means Mairéad 
                        Tremblay!

           Scary Man stops. Assessing them. Skeptical.  

                                 SCARY MAN
                        How do you know Mairéad? 
                                 CLANCY
                        She’s our mom! 

           He looks closely at Clancy. Studying her face. A flicker of 
           recognition. He drops Kevin, who scrambles away, freaking.    

                                 SCARY MAN
                        You have her eyes. 

                                 CLANCY
                        You... know her? 

                                 SCARY MAN
                        Knew her. A very long time ago. 

           Scary man sets his large bag down. Starts disrobing. Reaches 
           up, AND STARTS PEELING OFF HIS FACE. THEY ALL SCREAM AGAIN!

                                 MIM
                        SEE?! Why doesn’t anyone listen to 
                        me?!

           “He” pulls off a latex mask, to reveal A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, 
           40s, African-American. THIS IS JAY. She throws the mask in a 
           drawer of OTHER DISGUISES. Steps out of the ragged overcoat. 

           They stare, stunned. Mouths hanging open. 

                                 JAY
                        Your mom and I were friends a 
                        lifetime ago. We used to... work 
                        together.    

           Something GLOWS from inside Jay’s bag. Kevin peeks inside. 

                                 KEVIN
                        What did you guys do? 

           She snaps the bag shut, pulls it away from him. A glare. 

                                 JAY
                        Stuff. Until she got mixed up with 
                        some people I didn’t like. Some big-
                        time bad guy. I told her he was 
                        trouble. And I don’t work for 
                        anybody but myself. Haven’t seen 
                        her in almost twenty years. 

           She rifles through a few drawers, searching. Pulls out an OLD 
           PHOTO. Tosses it down: YOUNG MAIREAD and JAY, 20s. Dyed hair, 
           90s grunge, a cigarette dangles out of Mairead’s mouth.  

                                 CLANCY
                        She had purple hair?
                                 KEVIN
                        Mom smoked?! That is SO BAD. I’m 
                        telling dad. 

           Jay looks over at him, eyebrows raised. Seriously? 

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, because that was the worst 
                        thing she ever did. 

           Mim looks around, shudders. 

                                 MIM
                        What did you guys do down here? 

                                 JAY
                        This was our place. To escape. I 
                        dunno, I guess neither of us really 
                        fit in very well anywhere else. She 
                        used to come down here all the 
                        time, play music, write her songs. 
                        Those old tapes are hers. 

           She points to a box of OLD MIX TAPES amidst the junk. The 
           kids rifle through. Hold them up like ancient artifacts. 
           Kevin pulls the string of tape out of the casette. 

                                 KEVIN
                        What are-- how are you even 
                        supposed to listen to these things? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Wait, she wrote songs?  

                                 JAY
                        You guys don’t really know a lot 
                        about your own mom do you?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes we do! We know everything about 
                        her! She loves to do mom stuff. 
                        Like folding laundry and making 
                        lunches, cleaning. She does that 
                        stuff ALL THE TIME.  

                                 CLANCY
                        Look, you gotta help us find her. 
                        We know she used to steal stuff, 
                        and do bad things. That bad guy you 
                        were talking about came back, and 
                        they’re planning some big job. She 
                        left... and it’s my fault.
                                 JAY
                        How do you know she wants to be 
                        found? You guys seem like a bunch 
                        of whiny pains in the asses to me.  

                                 CLANCY
                        I told her I wished she would leave 
                        because I didn’t need her. And I... 
                        was wrong. I do need her. She’s our 
                        mom. She belongs at home... with 
                        us. I just want a chance to tell 
                        her that. Tell her I’m sorry. 

           She wipes at her eyes. Mim puts a hand on her friend’s 
           shoulder. Kevin watches, clears his throat-- 

                                 KEVIN
                        And not to beat a dead horse, but 
                        we’re all in agreement here. This 
                        was allll Clancy’s fault. 

           Jay sizes them up. Considering. Then, softening--

                                 JAY
                        You’re never too old to need your 
                        mom. Alright, I’ll help you. 
                             (off their reactions)
                        BUT you give me that key and you 
                        never come down here again. Got it? 

                                 MIM
                        Uh DUH. No problem lady. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/PATH - NIGHT

           Jay shows them a hidden door in the wall. It opens to THE 
           REAL UNDERGROUND PATH: a series of color-coded walkways and 
           subway stops running under the city. Deserted in the warmer 
           months. 

                                 JAY
                        I’ve heard things around town. The 
                        Luminato Gala. Lots of very 
                        important, very wealthy people 
                        there tonight. Something’s going 
                        down. If they’re pulling a job, 
                        that’s where. Follow the blue path 
                        to the Royal Music Conservatory.

                                 CLANCY
                        Thanks. 

           She hands Jay the key. Tries to give back the old photo. 
                                 JAY
                        Keep it. A reminder there’s a lot 
                        more to your mom than just laundry 
                        and school lunches.  

           Clancy smiles, nods. Shoves it in her pocket. They run off, 
           following the walkway marked blue. Lewis turns back--

                                 LEWIS
                        Full disclosure, we may have 
                        accidentally let everyone know the 
                        location of your secret hideout. 

                                 JAY
                        What?!

           EXT. ROYAL CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC - NIGHT

           The kids run up the subway steps to the street level. Stare 
           up at the massive, imposing building jutting into the night 
           sky. SECURITY GUARDS THE ENTRANCE.  

                                 MIM
                        How are we gonna get in?  

           On the side of the building, a narrow window on the fourth 
           floor, cracked open. Just enough room for a very small body 
           to fit through. A tree branch scrapes just below the window.

                                 CLANCY
                        There. 

           She hurries over. Starts to climb the tree. Lewis stops her. 

                                 LEWIS
                        You’ll never fit. I’ll do it. 

           They all look at him, surprised. Clancy frowns. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Doesn’t your mom have a rule 
                        against climbing trees to break 
                        into buildings in the middle of the 
                        night or something? 

           Lewis looks at her, steely-eyed. Determined.   

                                 LEWIS
                        My mom’s not here. 

           They react, impressed. Lewis marches over to the tree. Takes 
           a deep breath. This is his moment. He goes for it... 
           Aaaand this kid has never climbed a tree in his life. 

           He wraps his arms around the trunk, giving pathetic little 
           jumps. He lifts one leg, his sneakers slide off. He takes a 
           running jump, his tiny body bouncing off the trunk.  

           After a few moments of sad struggle, he leans over, hands on 
           his knees, panting. Looks over at them. 

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        Well I mean you can give me a hand 
                        with this part. 

                                 KEVIN/CLANCY/MIM
                        Oh right!/Sure/Sorry about that.

           Together they hoist him to the first branch. He crouches low, 
           wobbly. Slowly pulls himself up the tree. Finally reaching 
           the branch near the window. He slowly shimmies out toward the 
           building. The branch lightly bounces under his weight. He’s 
           almost there...

           A PIGEON takes off from the cornice, WINGS FLAPPING. 
           Startling him! He loses his grip, falling. They all GASP! He 
           clings tightly with his legs-- bouncing up and down. Eyes 
           squeezed shut. The bouncing slows... then stops.

           He rights himself. Looks at them, eyes wide. WHOA. Starts 
           inching out slowly. Closer, almost there. Reaches out, grabs 
           the windowsill, slides through and disappears inside.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The kids wait anxiously under the tree. A side service 
           entrance door bursts open, revealing Lewis’ smiling face. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Nice job Lewis.

           She rushes past, inside. Lewis looks at Kevin. Huge grin. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Your sister’s never said my name 
                        before. 

           They high-five. And miss.  

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           LOUD HUM OF ACTIVITY. STAFF busies about preparing food, 
           YELLING TO WAITERS, rushing in and out with plates of hors 
           d'oeuvres. Our kids sneak through the orchestrated chaos. 
                                 STERN VOICE
                        Hey! What are you doing back here? 

           THE HEAD WAITER stands over them, frowning. They all look at 
           each other, busted. Kevin steps forward. Confident smile. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh thank god. We’ve been wandering 
                        around this place forever. Took a 
                        wrong turn at the bathrooms. So 
                        which way to the stage? We just 
                        need to set up and then we’re good 
                        to go. Just flew in from Denver. 
                        What a cluster that airport is, am 
                        I right? Got diverted from O’Hare. 
                        Some kind of freak hail storm. 
                        That’s why we’re late.
                             (off his skeptical look)
                        We’re the kid musical ensemble they 
                        booked for tonight? Purple Pikachu. 
                        Never heard of us? We’re pretty 
                        huge on YouTube. Mim? Show him the 
                        video. You know the viral one. 

           Mim realizes, pulls her phone out, calls up Kevin’s video. 
           Kevin holds it out so Head Waiter can see a glimpse of his 
           dancing, hear the REMIX MUSIC. Pulls it back quickly.  

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Two million hits and climbing. 
                        Would I say internet sensation? It 
                        is how Bieber got his start. 

           Head Waiter sizes them up. LOUD YELLING/ARGUING from the 
           CHEFS-- a food crisis in the background. He rubs his head, 
           sighs. Doesn’t have time for this. Kevin smiles, innocent. 

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. What else would four 
                        unsupervised kids be doing 
                        wandering around here alone in the 
                        middle of the night? Come on. 

           INT. GRAND BALLROOM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Head Waiter leads them on stage. Curtain closed, empty seats 
           as the ORCHESTRA takes a break. He waits, arms crossed. 
           Expectant. Beat. Kevin looks around, claps his hands 
           together. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Great! So... we’ll just get warmed 
                        up then. Ready guys? 
           He sits at FIRST VIOLIN CHAIR. Deep breath, picks up the 
           instrument. A LOUD HORRIBLE WHINE as he drags the bow across. 

           Lewis TAPS timidly at the drums. No rhythm. SMASHES A CYMBAL. 
           Mim blows half-heartedly into a flute. SHARP, STACCATO TOOTS. 

           Head Waiter sighs, reaching for his walkie-talkie. 

                                 HEAD WAITER
                        I knew it. I knew what you guys 
                        were doing. Kid musical ensemble. 
                        I’ve seen Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

                                 KEVIN
                        Ferris what? Obviously this is just 
                        our warm-up--

                                 HEAD WAITER
                             (into walkie)
                        Yeah, I have a situation in the 
                        ballroom--

                                 CLANCY
                        Wait!

           She sits at FIRST CELLIST POSITION. Grabs the bow. 

           INT. ROYAL CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

           Margot and Leo sit in the empty concert hall, hands bound, 
           surrounded by ROYAL BODYGUARDS. SECURITY rechecks their 
           credentials, conferring with each other.   

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        Seriously. I’m much better now. 

           WIDER REVEALS: Glen, sitting in the corner. Vomit dribbles 
           down his shirt, the corners of his mouth. Hair wild, eyes 
           glassy. He looks terrible. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        I think that was everything--
                             (DRY HEAVE)
                        Yep, all done. Must’ve been the 
                        seafood dip. Did you guys have any? 
                        No? Well steer clear. 
                             (LOUD STOMACH GURGLE)
                        I’m just glad it didn’t come out of 
                        both ends! Right? Ha! No, but I’m 
                        glad it didn’t.  

                                 HEAD SECURITY
                        What happened to your accent?
           Glen stutters, then FEIGNS SHOCK. 

                                 GLEN
                             (terrible accent)
                        What? That is-- I am offended. It’s 
                        an outrage how we’re being treated. 
                        These are members of the royal--

                                 HEAD SECURITY
                        Save it. We placed a call to your 
                        Consulate. These are fake. There is 
                        no Count and Countess Van Der Holt. 

           Beat. 

                                 GLEN
                        What number did you call? Did you 
                        get the right office? Because it 
                        can be a real shitshow over there 
                        on the weekends--

           Margot gives her most charming smile. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I assure you, this is just a simple 
                        mistake. 

           Leo says something low to Margot IN FRENCH. She responds. 
           Glen turns to them, annoyed. 

                                 GLEN
                        Oh so now you two have a secret 
                        little language? Your own code 
                        language? Perfect. What does that 
                        mean--

                                 LEO
                        Duck. 

           Leo shoves Glen out of the way with his shoulder, knocking 
           him to the ground. As Margot HEAD BUTTS A GUARD, then 
           delivers A REVERSE ROUNDHOUSE KICK to knock him out. 

           PRELAP: BACH’S CELLO SUITE ONE IN G (FULL). 

           INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Clancy PLAYS THE CELLO BEAUTIFULLY. HAUNTING. Kevin opens the 
           curtain, shoots Head Waiter a look: Told you. GUESTS stop 
           talking, turn to watch, impressed. 

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. CONCERT HALL - SAME

           MORE BODYGUARDS descend on them. OVER CLANCY’S MUSIC in the 
           bg, Leo and Margot WORK IN TANDEM to dispatch them. 

           They use precise, expertly-executed MARTIAL ARTS MOVES 
           WITHOUT THEIR HANDS. MARGOT ROLLS OFF LEO’S BACK, DELIVERING 
           CRUSHING HEAD KICKS. STOMPING ON FEET, SMASHING KNEE CAPS...

           Anticipating the other’s every movement, moving perfectly in 
           sync. Glen watches, crouched in the corner. Amazed. After the 
           final GUY drops, Glen looks around at the carnage, stands up. 

                                 GLEN
                        Where the heck did you learn to--

           A HIDDEN BODYGUARD grabs Glen from behind in a choke hold. 
           Gun to his temple. Margot grabs a fallen Bodyguard’s knife. 
           THROWS IT into his thigh. Glen SHRIEKS! 

           Bodyguard bends over, grabbing his wounded leg. Margot KICKS 
           HIM IN THE THROAT, finishing him off. He falls over. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Come on!

           She grabs a stunned Glen, and they race out the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           They run down the hallway. Glen freaking out.     

                                 GLEN
                        Did you just kill that guy with 
                        your feet?! 

                                 MARGOT
                        What? No! I just... crushed his 
                        wind pipe a little bit. He’ll be 
                        fine... with immediate medical 
                        attention. 

                                 GLEN
                        Crushed his-- well have you ever 
                        killed anyone?!

                                 MARGOT
                        No. 
                             (off his relief)
                        Our Black Ops training taught us 
                        how to neutralize a target in under 
                        four seconds using mostly non-fatal 
                        tactics. 
                                 GLEN
                        BLACK OPS TRAINING? MOSTLY Non-
                        fatal tactics?! Just last week I 
                        had to open a jar of mustard for 
                        you!
                             (off her guilty look)
                        You faked that? IS NOTHING IN OUR 
                        LIVES REAL?!

                                 LEO
                        And not to split hairs, but there 
                        was that guy in Tanzania.

                                 MARGOT
                        He had a pre-existing heart 
                        condition!

           MORE BODYGUARDS come running down the hall after them. Glen 
           SHRIEKS! They duck back into the Grand Ballroom. 

           INT. GRAND BALLROOM - SAME

           Guests watch Clancy play, enthralled. Margot, Leo and Glen 
           run in. Margot sees Clancy. Stops short. Stunned. Watches her 
           daughter playing, eyes closed, absorbed in the music. 

           YELLING/COMMOTION as Security rushes in. Guests SCREAM! A 
           GUARD grabs Margot from behind. 

                                 KEVIN
                        MOM! 

           Margot FLINGS HIM OVER HER SHOULDER, twisting his arm with a 
           LOUD CRACK. Kevin cringes horrified. And impressed...

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        MOM?!

           Kevin jumps off the stage to run to her. Leo, fights off more 
           SECURITY-- overturning tables, dishes SMASHING. CHAOS ERUPTS 
           AMONGST THE GUESTS. RUNNING, YELLING. A frenzied stampede for 
           the exits. A GUARD corners Glen. Glen looks around for any 
           kind of weapon... nothing. 

                                 LEWIS (O.S.)
                        Mr. Finch!

           Lewis tosses Glen a drumstick from the stage. Glen catches 
           it. HITS THE GUARD SHARPLY ON THE ARM. They look at each 
           other a beat, seriously? Glen shrugs, sheepish.  

                                 GLEN
                        I’ve never actually been in a fight-
           SMASH! Guard falls, leaving Mim standing over him with two 
           large cymbals. 

                                 MIM
                        You okay Mr. Finch? Come on!

           ANGLE ON LEO

           ROYAL GUARDS form a buttress around the King and Queen, 
           trying to usher them to safety past the stage. Leo FENDS OFF 
           BODY GUARD AFTER BODYGUARD. Clancy watches him fight, 
           enthralled, still perched center stage. 

           Leo looks up, locks eyes with Clancy. Calls out--

                                 LEO
                        The crown!

           She looks down, as the Queen hurries past, right below her 
           reach. Clancy instinctively reaches her bow down, FLICKS THE 
           CROWN OFF HER HEAD UP INTO THE AIR. Catches it. Leo grins. 

           GUARDS now set their sights on Clancy, starting to climb the 
           up the stage. She looks around, panicked! 

           Leo waves her on, “I’ll catch you.” She takes a deep breath, 
           one last look at the guards coming for her-- then takes a 
           running leap AND STAGE DIVES INTO LEO’S WAITING ARMS.   

           He sets her down, gently. They look at each other for a long 
           moment. Studying each other intently. He smiles.   

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        You look just like her. Except that 
                        beautiful red hair. 

                                 MARGOT (O.S.)
                        This way!

           They look over. Margot waves them out an exit door. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN TORONTO - NIGHT

           They all sprint through the streets, SWALLOWED UP IN THE 
           CROWD OF REVELERS. They race down the steps to the subway.

           EXT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           They push their way through the large crowd waiting for a 
           train. 
                                 GLEN
                        What are you kids doing!? 

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re saving you! Mom. WHO ARE YOU?

                                 MARGOT
                        But how did you get here?!

           All at once, a jumble of explanations:

                                                          KEVIN
                                              Then we had to pretty much 
                                              swim the entire way across 
                                              Lake Ontario, trek through an 
                                              underground city--
                          CLANCY
           We figured out the code you 
           left, which took us to that 
           car. Mom is that gonna be my 
           car? Can I PLEASE learn to 
           drive on it--

                                                          LEWIS
                                              I had my first kiss. With an 
                                              older woman.  
                            MIM
           We met your old, crazy friend 
           from back in the day who, 
           FYI, is still totes crazy-- 

           They all stare at him. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Okay. Let’s... not tell your 
                        parents that part. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Mom. I... know you left because of 
                        what I said. We had to come get you 
                        back. I’m sorry. Please don’t go. 

           Margot looks at her daughter, stunned. Hugs her.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Honey. I would never leave you. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Mom, CANADIAN?! How could you keep 
                        something like that from us?!

                                 CLANCY
                        Dad? What happened to you? What is 
                        that smell? 

           They take a good look at Glen now. He looks AWFUL.

                                 GLEN
                        That is vomit. I was poisoned. 

           A COLLECTIVE EWWWWWWWW! As the kids all step away from Glen. 
           THE SUBWAY CAR ROARS UP THROUGH THE TUNNEL. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Let’s just get somewhere safe where 
                        I can call Henry. 

                                 LEO
                        I have somewhere we can go. 

           Glen SIGHS LOUDLY, annoyed. Folds his arms with a HUFF.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A million-dollar, panoramic view of the city. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: The kids have their faces pressed against 
           the floor-to-ceiling glass windows. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DOWNTOWN TORONTO - NIGHT

           A sleek, modern apartment full of steel, chrome and leather.  
           Clancy looks down at the city lights. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Wow. You live here? Right in the 
                        city? 

                                 LEO
                        It’s more of a safe house I keep 
                        for emergencies.

                                 MIM
                        That is so cool! 

                                 LEWIS
                        Like a spy. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Dad isn’t that cool? 

           WIDER REVEALS: Glen sitting in a small, uncomfortable chair. 
           A towel underneath him. Holding his arm gingerly. He shrugs. 

                                 GLEN
                        Well, I don’t know that it’s 
                        fiscally responsible. Rents in the 
                        city must be sky high. For what? 
                        One or two days a month? 

                                 LEO
                        Thanks for sitting on the towel 
                        Glen. I just wouldn’t want to get 
                        vomit on the suede. And I’m sorry 
                        about your arm, I was just trying 
                        to get you out of harm’s way. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Oh honey. Are you okay? What 
                        happened? 

                                 GLEN
                        I’m not sure. It was all kind of a 
                        blur. Fists were flying and I think 
                        I may have punched a few guys--

                                 LEO
                        Actually I saw when you fell 
                        backwards, you landed on it kind of 
                        awkwardly. Probably just a bruise. 

                                 GLEN
                        I think it’s a little more than a 
                        bruise, Leo. It’s going numb. Which 
                        is going to make work extremely 
                        difficult.

                                 LEO
                        Oh wow. Glen are you a doctor?

                                 GLEN
                        No... a pastry chef. But it 
                        requires a lot of finger 
                        dexterity...

           Mim sits on the couch, WEARING THE CROWN. Taking selfies. 

                                 MIM
                        So how much is this thing worth 
                        anyway? 

                                 LEO
                        I’d say somewhere in the 
                        neighborhood of twenty million. 

           The kids all REACT. GASPS OF AMAZEMENT!

                                 KEVIN
                        Do you know what we could do with 
                        twenty million dollars?!

                                 CLANCY
                        I could buy a Bonjour Stradivarius!

                                 LEWIS
                        I could go to space camp like 
                        10,000 summers in a row. 

           Margot takes the crown off Mim’s head. A stern look. 
                                 MARGOT
                        It’s not ours. It’s going back. 

                                 LEO
                        Ah ah. I might have a different 
                        opinion on that.  

           He takes the crown from Margot. Starts packing a bag of 
           supplies. The mood shifts. Tense, uncertain. Leo’s demeanor 
           changes. Sharper, an edge to his voice. 

                                 MARGOT
                        What are you talking about? Of 
                        course we’re returning it. We’ll 
                        explain everything. How Jean-Paul 
                        found us both and blackmailed us 
                        into stealing it-- 

                                 LEO
                        Jean Paul died in prison a year 
                        ago, a harmless old man. He was out 
                        of the game for a long time. 
                        There’s a new head of operations. 

           Margot absorbs this, confused. Shaking her head...

                                 MARGOT
                        But who? Henry would have told me. 
                        The Canadian police, your handler, 
                        would’ve informed him--

                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        Ugh! I knew there was something I 
                        forgot to write in the company 
                        newsletter.

           Elise walks in. Gun drawn. The kids react, nervous. Confused. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Mom? What’s going on? Who’s that? 

                                 LEO
                        Elise here used to work for the 
                        Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She 
                        recently had a career change. 

                                 ELISE
                             (shrugging)
                        Twenty million dollars can be very 
                        persuasive. 

                                 GLEN
                        I knew it! I knew Leo was a bad 
                        guy! HA HAA! Well guess what--
           He rips the towel out from underneath him, rubbing his butt 
           on the chair out of spite. 

                                 LEO
                        Not cool, Glen. That’s a Van der 
                        Rohe. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Leo, what are you doing? 

                                 LEO
                        Once we found you again, with the 
                        help of Chubster’s little video--
                             (Kevin reacts, hey!)
                        I knew the only way you’d help me 
                        steal the crown is if you thought 
                        our lives were in danger. Those 
                        morals of yours have always gotten 
                        in the way of us having a good 
                        time. 

                                 MARGOT
                        But why? Why would you go back now?  
                        After all this time--

                                 LEO
                        Because I’m so bored! Aren’t you 
                        bored? The monotony of normal life. 
                        Driving carpool, flute lessons or 
                        whatever boring garbage you play--

           He motions to Clancy. She reacts, stung. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you miss it? The excitement? 
                        Don’t you miss me? I mean come on, 
                        you can’t really be happy with the 
                        nerdy baker. No offense, Glen.

                                 GLEN
                        Wha-- YES OFFENSE! You can’t just 
                        say no offense to erase the very 
                        clearly offensive words. 

                                 KEVIN
                        He’s a pastry chef NOT a baker! And 
                        he might be a nerd, but he’s our 
                        dad.

           Leo looks at Margot. Then Clancy. Cocks an eyebrow. 

                                 LEO
                        Are we so sure about that? 
                                 KEVIN
                        Uh yeah, I’m pretty sure I know who 
                        my dad is. What? What’s everybody--

           Everyone looks back and forth between Clancy and Leo, Clancy 
           and Glen. Now noticing the resemblance. The red hair... 

                                 KEVIN/LEWIS/MIM
                        Ohhhhh. 

           Glen GASPS as it dawns on him too! Margot reacts, furious.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Glen is their father. BOTH of them.  

                                 LEO
                        If you say so. Look, at first the 
                        plan was just to have you help us 
                        steal the crown, then frame you for 
                        it, and we disappear. But admit it, 
                        you had fun. And there’s still a 
                        spark there. So... come with me. 

           Margot stares, stunned. Absorbing this information. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I set it up perfectly for us. 
                        Glen’s the fall guy. And everyone 
                        saw that Clancy here is the one who 
                        actually stole the crown. 
                             (at Clancy)
                        Nice job by the way. You’re a lot 
                        like your mother. Elise will 
                        corroborate the story. She’s 
                        already called in the police and 
                        they’re on their way. Which means 
                        we’re free to live a life of 
                        excitement, passion. Hell, bring 
                        the chubby one. He seems harmless 
                        enough. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay, that stings every time--

                                 LEO
                        What’s it gonna be Mairéad? 

           Margot looks back and forth between Glen and Leo. Beat. 

                                 MARGOT
                        You’re right, Leo. I do want a life 
                        of excitement and passion. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        The life I already have. And it’s 
                        Margot.

           She walks over, slips her arm through Glen’s. He smiles.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Ha! BUUURN!

           Leo rolls his eyes. Grabs his bag, with the crown. 

                                 LEO
                        Suit yourself.
                             (to Elise)
                        Meet me at the boat when it’s done. 
                        I’m afraid this is goodbye for good 
                        Mair-- Margot. No more second 
                        chances. You’ll be going away for a 
                        long time now. 

           He walks out. They all exchange fearful looks. 

           LATER

           Our five guys sit squished on the couch. Elise on the phone, 
           gun trained on them. She turns, mid-conversation--

                                 ELISE (ON PHONE)
                        Yes I have the suspects in custody--

           CLOSE ON: the kid’s backpack. Out of the open top, a HUGE 
           SPIDER crawls out. Our missing friend from the subway. 

           It sits on top of the bag. Glen’s eyes go wide with terror. 
           He looks at Elise. Back at the spider. An idea. 

           He motions to Margot. Gestures to the spider with his head. 
           She frowns, what? They gesture back and forth for a moment. 
           He makes crazy hand signals: mimics spider crawling, 
           screaming, running... She shakes her head, not understanding. 
           He rolls his eyes, exasperated. Then... 

           PICKS UP THE SPIDER BY ONE LEG AND FLINGS IT TOWARD ELISE. It 
           lands on her chest. SHE SCREAMS! Swatting at it.  

           Margot seizes the momentary distraction to deliver a BLOW to 
           Elise. They square off. MARTIAL ARTS MOVE AND COUNTERMOVES. 
           PUNCHING, KICKING-- they fight across the apartment. Evenly 
           matched. Glen grabs the gun. Tries to gingerly hand it to 
           Margot as they fight. She can’t get it. Rolls her eyes. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Just shoot her!
                                 GLEN
                        I can’t! YOU shoot her!

                                 MARGOT
                        Shoot her in the leg then!

           He takes a deep breath. Aims for Elise’s knee. FIRES. Nowhere 
           near her. 

           It hits the chandelier ten feet above her head. The wire 
           snaps and it FALLS DIRECTLY ON TOP OF ELISE. Knocking her 
           out. They all stare at her contorted body. Beat. 

           Glen wiggles his fingers like a spider crawling. 

                                 GLEN
                        I was saying we could use the 
                        spider as a distraction to escape. 

                                 MARGOT
                        That’s the universal sign for snow 
                        falling. 

                                 GLEN
                        Wha? This--
                             (hand gesture)
                        Is clearly a crawling spider!

                                 MARGOT
                        Okaaay. We’ll work on our hand 
                        signals for next time. C’mon! We 
                        can’t let Leo disappear. 

                                 GLEN
                        Next time?!

           They all follow Margot, racing out of the apartment. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN TORONTO - NIGHT

           They spill out of the building onto the sidewalk. Margot 
           hurries over to a PARKED MINI-VAN. Looks around, discreetly 
           begins to pick the lock. Lewis looks at Glen, shock and awe. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I can’t believe you picked up that 
                        spider!

                                 GLEN
                        Well I knew it was harmless but I 
                        was hoping it could buy us a moment 
                        to catch her off guard. 
                                 LEWIS
                        Harmless? That was a Southern Black 
                        Widow. Those are one of the ten 
                        most poisonous spiders in the 
                        world. One bite can cause paralysis 
                        of the diaphragm or permanent nerve 
                        damage. It looked like it had an 
                        egg sac on its back too. That’s 
                        like millions of poison babies.    

           Glen absorbs this. Slowly swats at the back of his neck, 
           feeling the creepy crawlies. A shiver runs through him. 

           The car engine RUMBLES to life. Clancy stares open-mouthed.  

                                 CLANCY
                        Mom, you can hot wire a car?

                                 MIM
                        So cool. 

                                 MARGOT
                        You kids better never do this. Now  
                        everyone get in. And seat belts! 

           They all jump in the car. SOUNDS OF SEAT BELTS CLICKING. 
           Margot starts to get behind the wheel. Glen stops her.

                                 GLEN
                        Leo was wrong about one thing.
                             (beat)
                        I drive carpool.

           He scoots her over to the passenger side. Slides behind the 
           wheel. Hands at ten and two. Determined. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Are you sure honey? This is an 
                        emergency situation, and I know how 
                        you like to obey all the posted 
                        traffic laws--

                                 GLEN
                        Let’s go save our family. 

           He hits the gas. The car lurches backward with a TERRIBLE 
           CRUNCHING SOUND! He slams on the brakes. SCREEEEEECH!

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        I had it in reverse! It was in 
                        reverse. I’ve got a LOT of 
                        adrenaline pumping right now. I’m 
                        good now, no we’re good.  
           INT./EXT. MINI-VAN - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Glen ZOOMS through traffic. Everyone hanging on for dear 
           life. Margot looks over at him, a little fearful. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Honey? This might be a touch too 
                        fast--

                                 GLEN
                        He threatened my family. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Go get ‘em dad!

           GLEN FLOORS IT TOWARD THE TORONTO HARBOR EXIT. 

           INT./EXT. LEO’S CAR - NIGHT

           Leo speeds down the road. Glances in his rearview.

                                 LEO
                        What the--

           THE MINI-VAN ROARS UP BEHIND HIM. Glen’s determined face 
           behind the wheel. He pulls up along side. Leo looks over. 
           Glen makes the “roll the window down” sign. WTF?

           Leo, amused even slightly impressed, humors him. Rolls it 
           down. 

                                 GLEN 
                             (yelling over the wind)
                        HONDA ODYSSEY! 2016 SAFEST MINI-VAN 
                        FOR SIDE IMPACT COLLISION!

           HE RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF LEO’S CAR, SENDING HIM CAREENING 
           DOWN AN EMBANKMENT, FLIPPING, ROLLING TO A STOP UPSIDE DOWN. 
           The mini-van screeches to a halt on the shoulder.

           SOUNDS OF SIRENS in the distance. A HELICOPTER WHIRS above 
           their heads, shining a spotlight down on top of them. 

           EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

           Henry sits in the passenger seat, talking into the radio. 
           USING A STINGRAY TO TRACK MIM’S CELL PHONE SIGNAL. ON HENRY’S 
           PHONE: A picture of her Instagram page. Mim wearing the 
           crown.

                                 HENRY
                        Copy that. Suspect is down.  
           He swivels his head, looking in the back. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You ready to see your family again? 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Angus sitting in the back seat. He BARKS.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN TORONTO - NIGHT

           POLICE CARS SWARM THE SCENE. Fishing an injured Leo out of 
           the rubble. The kids hover around the mini-van. Glen 
           approaches Margot, sheepish.  

                                 GLEN
                        Y’know. You hesitated just a teeny 
                        tiny bit when he asked you to come 
                        with him. Like you considered it 
                        for a second. I dunno, going back 
                        to your old life...?

           She looks at him. A beat. 

                                 MARGOT
                        He was right about one thing. Glen,  
                        I am bored. 
                             (off his dismay)
                        I just mean I want to get a job! 
                        Like, a real job. In an office or 
                        something.

                                 GLEN
                        Um honey? Somehow I don’t picture 
                        you in an office setting. 

           She wraps him in a hug. A BIG KISS. He smiles.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        We do make a good team. You’re the 
                        beauty and I’m the brains. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Mmmm... 

                                 GLEN
                        You’re the brains and I’m the 
                        beauty? 
                             (as she’s walking away)
                        You can’t be the beauty AND the 
                        brains. Margot? 
           ANGLE ON KEVIN AND MIM. 

                                 MIM
                        I can’t believe how calm you were 
                        like, the whole time. You totally 
                        saved us back there with the whole 
                        kid band thing.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh. Yeah, I mean it wasn’t like a 
                        big deal or anything. 

                                 MIM
                        No. Kev. It was a big deal. 

           She’s looking at him. Kevin’s eyes go wide. Is this going to 
           be the moment?! When she realizes she’s loved him all alo--

                                 MIM (CONT’D)
                        You’re a really brave kid. 

           She slugs him in the shoulder. Walks away. Kevin sighs. 

                                 CLANCY (O.S.)
                        Give it a few years. They’ll be 
                        chasing after you. 

           He turns. Sees Clancy standing there, watching. He burns red, 
           looks at his feet. Flustered. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Wha? What do you mean? I wasn’t... 
                        I mean I don’t... huh? 

                                 CLANCY
                        Hey I’m sorry I called you a dork. 
                        I was being the dork. I guess 
                        sometimes I just get jealous of 
                        you.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jealous of me?!

                                 CLANCY
                        Yeah. It’s so easy for you. To just 
                        be yourself and not care what 
                        anyone thinks. I wish I could be 
                        more like that.  

                                 KEVIN
                        More like me? I wish I was like 
                        you. You’re the best musician ever. 
                        You’re so good! I don’t have any 
                        talents. I’m not good at anything.
                                 CLANCY
                        What? You tell the best stories! 
                        You’re so creative. You should 
                        start writing them down. Or 
                        whatever. 

           Awkward smiles from this unexpected cease-fire.  

                                 CLANCY (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I know I don’t always act 
                        like it-- but you’re a pretty cool 
                        little brother. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Thanks. You’re an awesome half-
                        sister. 

           Clancy SNORTS a laugh, punching him in the shoulder. 

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Ow! You must get your aggression 
                        from your dad’s side. 

           They LAUGH. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Police take statements from everyone. Leo sits in cuffs, in a 
           police car. Our gang waits, wrapped in blankets, petting 
           Angus. Henry walks up. Looks at Mim. 

                                 HENRY
                             (re his phone)
                        I’ll have you know I changed my 
                        passcode. 

                                 MIM
                        It’s not the last four digits of 
                        your badge number is it? 

                                 HENRY
                             (yep)
                        Nope. 

                                 GLEN
                        Well, well, well. If it isn’t ole 
                        Henry from University of Nebraska. 
                        Go Huskers!

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry about that Glen. 
                        Sometimes lying is an unfortunate 
                        part of the job. No hard feelings?  
           He reaches out his hand. Glen shakes it. Smiles. 

                                 GLEN
                        I’ll look forward to getting to 
                        know the real Henry Gibbs this 
                        Thanksgiving. Bring the family. 

                                 HENRY
                        And I’ll look forward to the 
                        cranberry corn bread--

                                 GLEN
                        Don’t push it. It’ll take some 
                        time. I’m not made of stone. 

           The sun starts to rise, casting a warm red glow across the 
           sky. Lewis notices, GROANS!

                                 LEWIS
                        UGH. It’s morning. We’re not gonna 
                        make it home in time. My mom will 
                        never let me have another sleepover 
                        as long as I live.

                                 HENRY
                        Ppssh. I can get you guys home in 
                        plenty of time. 

           He winks, motions to the chopper. Both Glen and Kevin pale. 

                                 GLEN
                        Seriously? Again? Come on.

                                 MARGOT
                        Can we... can we make one stop 
                        first? 

           EXT. HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Cookie-cutter houses sprout out of neatly manicured lawns.   
           Margot, Glen, Kevin and Clancy stand on the front porch. 
           Looking like hell. Margot fidgets, nervous. Adjusting their 
           hair and clothes. Glen stops her, kisses her head. 

                                 GLEN
                        Go on. 

           She takes a deep breath. RINGS the doorbell. Noise, shuffling 
           behind the door. It opens... 

           AN OLDER MAN, PEARSE TREMBLAY (70s) in a bathrobe, disheveled 
           hair, stands there. He takes them in, shocked. Margot smiles. 
                                 MARGOT
                        Hey dad. 

           His face clouds over with tears. He grabs her in a HUGE HUG. 

                                 PEARSE
                        I knew it was you calling all those 
                        times. HILDY! HILDY GET DOWN HERE! 
                        HILDEGARD!

           Clancy peeks past him, inside the house. Sees all the family 
           pictures on the wall. Margot with ALL HER BROTHERS AND 
           SISTERS. Four boys, two girls. And her parents... 

           Clancy’s grandmother has bright, red hair. 

           HILDEGARD TREMBLAY, (70s, silvery red hair now) hurries down 
           the stairs two at a time. 

                                 HILDY
                        What is it?! What’s all the yel--

           She sees her daughter. SCREAMS! Runs down the stairs. Grabs 
           them all in a huge hug. 

           LAUGHTER, TEARS, SHOUTS OF JOY AS WE PULL BACK, UP, UP INTO 
           THE SKY...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CAR - MORNING

           Mr. And Mrs. Kharoud drive through the quiet neighborhood. 
           Listening to NPR. They pull up in front of the Finch house. 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        Don’t forget the Bhatoora. 

           They both turn their heads, looking in the back seat for the 
           bread... AS THE HELICOPTER DESCENDS BEHIND THE FINCH HOUSE 
           INTO THE BACKYARD. The wind WHIPS through the trees, shaking 
           the branches. 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Ooh, windy today. 

           She grabs the gift, starts toward the house. 

           EXT. FINCH HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MORNING

           Mrs. Kharoud raises her hand to knock... the door flies open. 
           Everyone piles out of the house. 
           Big smiles, some in bathrobes, some wear winter jackets to 
           hide their clothes. All have crazy windblown hair.

                                 ALL
                        Morning!/Good morning Mrs. 
                        Kharoud/Hi mom!

           She takes them all in, startled.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Good morning. How did it go? 

                                 ALL
                        Great!/Fantastic!/Couldn’t have 
                        been better!/Absolutely no problems 
                        whatsoever.

           She cocks an eyebrow, suspicious. 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        So, no... issues? 

                                 GLEN
                        Nope! Piece of cake. 

           She takes in their huge, smiling faces. Looks at Lewis. He 
           glances away for just a second...

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        No. You’re not telling the truth. 
                        Something’s going on here. And I 
                        think I know what it is. 

           Everyone freezes. Margot sighs.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Mrs. Kharoud, I can explai--

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        You didn’t brush your teeth did 
                        you? 

           Lewis lowers his head, feigning guilt. 

                                 LEWIS
                        No. 

           She gives Glen and Margot a smug smile. 

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        A mother always knows. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m so sorry about that-- 
                                 GLEN
                        Kids, right? What can you do? Is 
                        that Bhatoora? Smells delicious! 
                        I’ve heard some stories about how 
                        legendary your Bhatoora is. Maybe 
                        you could give me the recipe? I’d 
                        love to carry it in the store. 

           Mrs. Kharoud smiles, proud. Won over.

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Oh, well, yes. That would be 
                        lovely. Thank you so much for 
                        having Lewis. Next time, Kevin will 
                        have to come to our house. 

                                 ALL
                        Definitely. 

           She smiles, strange little family. They walk toward the car. 
           Lewis turns, runs back. Grins.  

                                 LEWIS
                        Awesome sleepover.

                                 KEVIN
                        Totally. 

           They high-five. It’s a good one. They’re men now. 

           EXT. CAPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MORNING

           Morning drop off. Cars line up to unload kids. Minivans and 
           SUV’s... and The Nemesis. 

           INT/EXT. NEMESIS - SAME

           Clancy drives, Glen in the passenger seat. Mim and Kevin in 
           the back. She eases to a stop. 

                                 GLEN
                        Great job Clance. This afternoon 
                        we’ll work on parallel parking. 

           The doors lift up. Kids hop out amidst GAPING STARES. 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        No OOTD today Mim? I googled it. It 
                        means Outfit of the Day.  

           He smiles, pleased with himself. She shakes her head. 
                                 MIM
                        Nah. I’m taking a little break from 
                        social media. TBH, Mr. Finch? Too 
                        many cook sessions on there.  

           They walk off into school. He shakes his head, no clue. Hits 
           the PREDATOR MODE BUTTON.

                                 CAR VOICE
                        Good morning Glen. Please input 
                        your destination. 

           He grips the steering tightly. Big grin. 

           INT. CAPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MORNING

           The busy hum of a Monday morning. Clancy makes her way 
           through the bustling hallway. Sees Travis at his locker. She 
           stops, flustered, like she might turn back around. He looks 
           up. Smiles. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Hey. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Oh. Hey. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        I was gonna call you. Make sure you 
                        guys were okay. But I realized I 
                        don’t have your number.  

           Her face falls, embarrassed. 

                                 CLANCY
                        I... don’t have a cellphone. I 
                        know, it’s weir--

                                 TRAVIS
                        I don’t either. My parents won’t 
                        let me get one. They always think 
                        child predators and telemarketers 
                        will call me or something. I dunno, 
                        they’re super weird.   

           Clancy looks down, smiles. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Parents.

                                 TRAVIS
                        You have a house phone right? 
           He hands her a pen. Holds his hand out. 

                                 CLANCY
                        Yeah. 

           She scribbles her number on his open palm. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Cool. 

           He smiles. Heads off to class. She passes the Mean Girls.

                                 EMMA
                        Hey Fire Crotch! Didja’ make it to 
                        Canada? 

           They all LAUGH. She just smiles, blows past them. Into...

           INT. BAND ROOM - MORNING

           Clancy marches up to Mr. Campbell’s desk, floats a piece of 
           paper to him. CLOSE ON: the Julliard application. He picks it 
           up, grins. 

                                 MR. CAMPBELL
                        Your parents gave the okay?

                                 CLANCY
                        Yeah. My mom’s brothers live in New 
                        York city. They said I could stay 
                        with them for the summer. And 
                        they’re gonna get me a phone. Just 
                        for emergencies.

                                 MR. CAMPBELL
                        Well that’s great. 

           Clancy smiles. Yeah, it is. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - SAME

           A fifth-grade GIRL stands in front of the class, finishing a 
           very monotone presentation, holding one sheet of paper.  

                                 BORING GIRL
                        --and we spend every summer at Lake 
                        Wenatchee in cabins with no 
                        electricity or running water. That 
                        is my family portrait. Thank you. 

           BORED CLASSMATES stare. Mrs. Westenfeldt gets up, the lone 
           CLAP.
                                 MRS. WESTENFELDT
                        Thank you Lindsay. Kevin, do you 
                        have your project prepared? 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Kevin, at his desk. Smiling broadly. 
           Excited. He gets up, grabs his thick stack of papers.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes. 

           He walks to the front of the classroom. Shuffles his papers. 
           Looks out over the crowd of kids, smiles. He turns to Mrs. 
           Westenfeldt, standing next to him. 

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        You might want to sit down for 
                        this, eh? Turns out, I’m half-
                        Canadian. 

           INT. KHAROUD HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Mr. and Mrs. Kharoud sit at the kitchen table. Lewis walks 
           in, pajamas on. Gets a glass from the cupboard. Fills it to 
           the brim with milk. They watch him, confused. 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        Lewis? What are you doing honey? 

           He starts to drink. They react, stunned. Mrs. Kharoud drops 
           the papers she was holding...

                                 MRS. KHAROUD
                        Sweetheart, it’s seven-thirty!

           GULP, GULP, GULP. He slams the empty glass down. Looks at 
           them from underneath a thick milk mustache. A man now. 

           He reaches down, YANKS the bed-wetting alarm from his pants, 
           struggling with the wires-- ripping, pulling. GRUNTING. He 
           slams the broken machine down on the kitchen table. 

           Levels his gaze at them. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I won’t be needing this anymore. 

           They smile, unsure. Concerned. Mr. Kharoud nods. 

                                 MR. KHAROUD
                        Okay son. Sure. 

           Lewis turns and walks back to his bedroom. They stare at each 
           other, shocked. What the--?
           INT. FINCH HOUSE - SAME

           Kevin does homework at the kitchen table, while Glen bakes. 
           Margot works on her computer. Angus at her feet. 

           ON HER SCREEN: She’s revising her resume. The cursor blinks 
           at “Special Skills...” as she deliberates. She types “MIXED 
           MARTIAL ARTS.” Then erases it. TYPES “EFFECTIVE INTERPERSONAL 
           COMMUNICATION.”

           Glen pulls a piece off of a freshly baked Bhatoora. 

                                 GLEN
                        Okay, how about this one? 

           He tosses it to Old Angus, lying on a dog bed. Old Angus 
           sniffs it. Looks away.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Man, you are a tough critic. 

           Clancy walks past, holding her new phone: FACE-TIMING WITH 
           HER GRANDPARENTS. 

                                 CLANCY
                        And Grandma, Ha-na Chang is giving 
                        a guest lecture there. She’s like 
                        one of the greatest female cello 
                        players of all time.

                                 HILDY (ON SCREEN)
                        That sounds wonderful. I can’t wait 
                        to hear you play when we come down 
                        next weekend. 

           Clancy walks out, talking excitedly. Glen smiles at Margot. 

                                 GLEN
                        You excited? To have your whole 
                        family visit next weekend? 

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah. It’s been a long time. I’m 
                        excited for you to meet everyone. 

                                 GLEN
                        Four brothers and two sisters? Wow. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Big crazy family. 

           Glen stirs batter. Pauses. A thought. 
                                 GLEN
                        So I mean, that’s it, right? That’s 
                        all. There’s nothing else I need to 
                        know? You’ve told me absolutely 
                        everything. 

           Beat.

                        Mom...?

                                 GLEN
