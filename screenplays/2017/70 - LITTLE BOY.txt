          August 12, 2016
           EXT. HELICOPTER - MORNING

           SUPER: “2007. The English Channel.”

           Two uniformed Air Force soldiers inside a helicopter. Far 
           above the ocean. 

           One of them holds a metal cannister. He examines it.  

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Greatest killer in history. In a 
                        jar. 

           The other soldier grunts. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Weird request. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        I think he figured his tomb would 
                        be defaced. You know. Protestors. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Why didn’t he ask his family to do 
                        it?

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        He did. 

           The other soldier nods, taps on the window.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Here?

           Soldier #1 shrugs. They look over the edge. The water below 
           looks angry. He opens the cannister. It’s full of ASHES. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        He said halfway between England and 
                        France. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Close enough.

           The first soldier grabs the cannister from him. Tilts it over 
           the edge. 

           The ashes fly out. We follow them over the great British Sea. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
           INT. SPANISH STYLE BUILDING - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           SUPER: “ Colorado Springs Air Force Base, 1944”

           A MAN sits in a spare, small waiting room. He’s dressed in a 
           crisp military uniform. A few medals on his chest. His eyes 
           are bleary. This is LIEUTENANT PAUL TIBBETS (29). 

           There are two other SOLDIERS, also in uniform. One nods at 
           Tibbets. 

                                 SOLDIER
                             (by way of greeting)
                        Dresden. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Burma.

           They look at the third soldier, who chews gum loudly. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 
                        Morocco.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Lucky bastard.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Not really. 

           They lapse into silence. 

                                 SOLDIER 
                        What the hell’s the point of this?

                                 TIBBETS
                        The point is it’s mandatory. 

           BANG. CRACK!

           All three soldiers, without missing a beat, dive for cover 
           under the waiting room chairs. Soldier #2 flips a chair like 
           a barricade. Tibbets, however, stands, ready for action. His 
           hand goes to his belt, pulling a gun.

           REVERSE TO SEE:

           A terrified SECRETARY stands over a SHATTERED VASE. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        I’m so sorry.

           A beat. 
                                 TIBBETS
                        No problem at all, Ma’am. Need any 
                        help cleaning that up?

           INT. AIR FORCE BASE - PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tibbets sits opposite DR. LAUREL EVANS (31).

                                 LAUREL
                        Hallucinations?

                                 TIBBETS
                        No, Ma’am.

                                 LAUREL
                        Flashbacks?

           Shakes his head no.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Feel more jumpy than usual?

           He hesitates, caught off-guard. Then... 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Can’t say I do.

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s pretty commonplace in your 
                        field. We call it hyper-arousal.

                                 TIBBBETS
                        Never noticed anything like that, 
                        Ma’am.

                                 LAUREL
                        Lieutenant, you’ve been in the 
                        field for two years and eight 
                        months. Are you telling me you’ve 
                        come out of all that completely 
                        unscathed?

                                 TIBBETS
                        I guess I am. 

           Laurel closes her notebook, clearly accustomed to this.

                                 LAUREL
                        You boys never say anything, do 
                        you?
                                 TIBBETS
                        Sorry I can’t be more helpful. But 
                        I’d like to see my family. It’s 
                        been a while. So if you wouldn’t 
                        mind clearing me--

           He slides a form towards her. Laurel sighs, picks up a pen.

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                             (always polite )
                        Thanks.

           EXT. AIR FORCE BASE - TIBBETS HOUSE - EVENING 

           Snow falling. Tibbets starts to open the door to the assigned 
           family housing. His wife, LUCY TIBBETS (27), answers before 
           he turns the key. She’s unsentimental and outspoken. 

           They look at each other for a long, silent moment. She kisses 
           him, then backs away. 

                                 LUCY
                        Please tell me you didn’t forget.  

           Tibbets gestures to the bag in his right hand.

           Lucy looks in. Sees a MODEL AIRPLANE in a box. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously?

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           MARY (6), Tibbets’s daughter, kneels on the carpet examining 
           a WRAPPED CARDBOARD BOX.  

           Tibbets and Lucy sit close together on the couch, watching.

                                 MARY
                        What is it? A Barbie? Easy Bake 
                        oven?

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t be too disappointed if it’s 
                        not-- 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You’re going to love it, Honey.

           Lucy looks at him, doubtful. 
                                 MARY
                        Can I open it?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Of course--

                                 LUCY
                        No. It’s not your birthday yet, 
                        Mary. You can wait one more day. 

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lucy and Mary watch Tibbets cook. Mary sits on the counter-
           top, captivated.  

                                 TIBBETS
                        It’s rice vermicelli.

                                 MARY
                        From Burma?

           He nods, holds the dry noodles over the steaming broth. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m going to drop these into a fish-
                        based broth of onion, garlic, 
                        ginger and lemongrass. 

           He opens a plastic bag and pulls out an exotic-looking 
           pinkish-purple bulb.

                                 MARY
                        What’s that?

                                 TIBBETS
                        A flowering Banana blossom. An old 
                        woman in Burma taught me how to use 
                        it. 

           Then removes the outer layers of sepals, collecting the small 
           delicate flowers one at a time.

                                 MARY
                        They’re really pretty.

           Lucy smiles, amused.

                                 LUCY
                        I remember when you wouldn’t eat 
                        anything that wasn’t covered in 
                        cream of mushroom soup.
                                 TIBBETS
                        I like knowing something about the 
                        culture I’m--

                                 LUCY
                        -- invading.

           He gives her a look.

                                 TIBBETS
                        We didn’t invade. 

                                 LUCY
                        They can’t deploy you again, can 
                        they?

           Tibbets doesn’t answer. 

           Lucy lifts Mary off the counter.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Go wash up for dinner.

           Mary hesitates, fixated as her dad drops the flowers into the 
           pot.

           Lucy gently nudges her. When she’s out of earshot...

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You know, my new strategy is to 
                        assume you’re dead. Until you 
                        aren’t. Then I’m pleasantly 
                        surprised. 

           Tibbets puts down the wooden spoon, kisses her. Deeply, 
           fiercely, the way they didn’t when they first saw each other. 
           There are tears in her eyes.  

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Naked, entangled in each other, Lucy watches as Tibbets 
           drifts off to sleep. 

                                 LUCY
                        Paul?

           He’s out. 

           As we close in on his face, we hear SOUNDS OF WAR rising, 
           playing out in his embattled brain. SHOTS FIRED, SIRENS 
           BLARING. Then the sound of a PLANE, screeching against the 
           runway.
           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Now the same plane SOUNDS, but made by a child. 

           Tibbets, wearing a robe, watches Mary bring her toy plane in 
           for a landing. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Careful now. Back wheels first. 

           She takes this advice very seriously, looking up for 
           guidance. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Now dump the flaps. There you go. 
                        Easy. 

           Lucy enters pulling her robe around her, sees Mary soaring 
           around the room, clearly enthralled by her new gift.

           They hear a loud KNOCK. Both know what it means. 

           EXT. BASE - FAMILY APARTMENT - FRONT STEPS

           A young SOLDIER stands nervously at the door. Lucy answers.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Sorry to bother you on Christmas 
                        Day, Ma’am. I’m looking for 
                        Lieutenant--

                                 LUCY
                        He’s still in Burma.

           She slams the door. The soldier reacts, startled.

           Moments later, the door opens again. Tibbets stands there, 
           apologetic.

                                 TIBBETS
                        What can I do for you? 

           The Soldier hesitates, then takes out a BLINDFOLD.

                                 SOLDIER
                        This is a bit unusual. 

           INT. BASE - GROVES’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Tibbets, now blind-folded, sits alone in a crowded office.
           The door bangs open. GENERAL LESLIE GROVES (40s), overweight, 
           garrulous and a little ridiculous without meaning to be.

                                 GROVES
                        Tibbets?

           Tibbets looks in the direction of the sound. Stands to 
           attention and salutes. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes, Sir.

                                 GROVES
                        Well? Are you ready?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes, Sir.

                                 GROVES
                        You haven’t asked me what you 
                        should be ready for. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m ready for anything, Sir. 

                                 GROVES
                        Sit down.

           He does. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        You’re 29 years old. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I am, Sir.

                        You look twelve. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        If you say so, Sir.

                                 GROVES
                        They say you’re the best pilot in 
                        the history of the Air Force. Is 
                        that true?

                                 TIBBETS
                        I wouldn’t say that, Sir. 

                                 GROVES
                        You led the first B17 raid across 
                        the English Channel.

                        And Operation TORCH. You were Ike’s 
                        personal pilot. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes, Sir. 

                                 GROVES
                        Then tell me you’re the best. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I don’t--

           Groves walks around his desk, leans in close to Tibbets. 

                                 GROVES
                        Say it. That’s a direct order.

           Immodesty is extremely difficult for Tibbets.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m... the best, Sir. 

           Groves, with a quick gesture, removes the blindfold. Tibbets 
           blinks, looking at him.

                                 GROVES
                        General Leslie Groves. If you see 
                        me again, you’ll pretend you know 
                        me from anything but this. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Of course, Sir. 

           A beat. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 GROVES
                        The most important mission in 
                        military history. You’re going to 
                        drop a bomb and end this fucking 
                        war. What do you have to say about 
                        that?

           Tibbets reels. Groves keeps going, oblivious.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Did you say, end the war, Sir?

                                 GROVES
                        Oh yeah. 

           Tibbets shakes his head. He didn’t know that was possible. 
                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        I’m guessing you want to know 
                        something about this new bomb?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Whatever I should know, Sir.

                                 GROVES
                        Well, you can’t know anything. For 
                        now. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Of course, Sir.

                                 GROVES
                        Report to the hangar at 0600. Pack 
                        for several months. We’ve been 
                        watching you, Colonel. You’re an 
                        extremely boring man.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m sorry, General. Did you say 
                        Colonel?

                                 GROVES
                        Didn’t I mention we’re making you 
                        Colonel?

           Tibbets reacts. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m honored, Sir. 

                                 GROVES
                        Any questions?

                                 TIBBETS
                        May I bring my family? 

                                 GROVES
                        You’re not going to the Florida 
                        Keys, Tibbets. It’s not a family 
                        vacation.

           Groves stands up, indicating the interview is over. Tibbets 
           does the same. They salute each other. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to do this, you 
                        know. I can put you on reserve. 
                        You’ve done more time abroad than 
                        almost any soldier in the Air

                        Mostly because you haven’t died 
                        yet. 

           Tibbets barely hesitates, leans forward. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’d like to finish what I started.  
                        Kill the bastards who are killing 
                        our men.

                        I’m all in, Sir.  

           EXT. BASE - FAMILY APARTMENT BACK PORCH - NIGHT

           Tibbets and Lucy sit on the porch. They watch Mary, bundled 
           in a winter coat, playing in the snow. 

           Lucy’s clearly been crying, but now she’s just angry. 

                                 LUCY
                        Anyone else could do it. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Not as well. 

           She shakes her head. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t supposed to tell you 
                        anything.

           She looks at him, then goes inside. Tibbets stares up at the 
           white snow, still falling. Mary waves at him, laughing, 
           oblivious. He waves back.

           INT. JAPANESE FAMILY HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Halfway across the world, snowflakes drift past a wooden 
           window. It’s early morning in Tokyo. 

           MARQUIS KIDO (40s), lies next to his wife, NATSUKO GENTARO 
           (30s). His eyes are wide open. She’s asleep. 

           She wakes with a start, looks at him. Reaches out her hand 
           and gently touches his cheek. 

           (Dialogue and signage in Japanese with subtitles).

                                 NATSUKO
                        Go back to sleep.

           He gets out of bed instead. 
           INT. JAPANESE FAMILY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

           Kido, Natsuko and their son, AKIRA (7) kneel at a low dining 
           table. Natsuko jabs one of the untouched rice balls on 
           Akira’s plate.

                                 NATSUKO
                        They say if you eat rice balls with 
                        scallions you won’t get bombed. But 
                        you have to tell someone for it to 
                        work. 

                                 KIDO
                        That’s ridiculous. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        I know. 
                             (beat)
                        I told all my friends.

                                 KIDO
                        We’re safe, Natsuko. 

           He gets up to go. Akira yanks on his mother’s sleeve, 
           pointing to his full mouth. 

                                 AKIRA
                        I’m eating them!

                                 NATSUKO
                        Good. Now tell someone. 

                                 AKIRA
                        I told Takeshi.

           He points to a shoebox with air holes. Inside is a pet 
           turtle.

                                 NATSUKO
                        Good. Now pray together.

           INT. JAPANESE FAMILY HOUSE - SHRINE - MOMENTS LATER

           The family, including the pet turtle, prays in front of a 
           Shinto shrine. 

           Kido tries to get up again, but his wife, eyes still closed, 
           pulls him back down. Sighing, he kneels again.
           INT. CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           Kido and Akira drive in a compact Japanese car through the 
           city of Tokyo, devastated by a massive fire-bombing.  

           They pass a sign that reads: FORGET SELF! ALL OUT FOR YOUR 
           COUNTRY!

           Above the sign is a PORTRAIT of EMPEROR HIROHITO.

                                 AKIRA
                        Does he really never say anything?

                                 KIDO
                        Sometimes he does.

                                 AKIRA
                        Why doesn’t he talk more?

                                 KIDO
                        You know the answer, Akira. He’s 
                        divine. Above men.

                                 AKIRA
                        Don’t you ever wonder what he’s 
                        thinking?
                             (beat)
                        I wonder what Takeshi’s thinking 
                        all the time.

                                 KIDO
                        He’s not thinking anything, Akira. 
                        He’s a turtle.

           Kido slows down. Lets Akira off at a local school.

           Watches as he joins the other children in the yard, set up at 
           stations in the style of a factory. They are helping with the 
           assembly of WAR TIME EQUIPMENT. 

           School ended years ago.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Now Kido sits in the back of a luxurious black sedan. 

           Opposite him, on a silver dais, is EMPEROR HIROHITO (43). A 
           small, intense looking man in full military regalia. 

           And he almost never speaks.
           EXT. TOKYO - MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY

           Outside, HUNDREDS of TROOPS BOW to the passing car as they 
           move slowly through the front gate of the imperial compound. 

           INT. TOKYO - MILITARY COMPOUND HANGAR - DAY

           Kido and the Emperor stand next to ADMIRAL YANAMI (40s), the 
           commander of the air force. He holds a riding crop. 

           They stand on a balcony raised above a hangar full of sharp, 
           black planes. Below them, a crowd of YOUNG MEN wearing 
           jackets with Rising Sun symbols and leather helmets, bow to 
           their emperor.  

           Yanami uses a crop to gesture to the men.

                                 YANAMI
                        These are the brave men who give 
                        their lives for our glorious 
                        country! They ram their planes into 
                        enemy ships, committing suicide in 
                        the honorable name of the Empire!

           An ATTRACTIVE WOMAN weaves through the assembly of pilots,  
           offering tumblers of SAKE. They down them quickly. 

                                 YANAMI (CONT’D)
                        Who will fly today to destroy the 
                        USS Indianapolis?

           The men shout over each other to volunteer. Kido studies 
           their faces. Sees fear they pretend isn’t there. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Allow me! Please, Your Majesty.

           Hirohito says nothing. But Yanami gestures, and a SOLDIER 
           leads the young man to the cockpit of a fighter jet.

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

           The other young men shout the same.  

           The glass lid of the cockpit is lowered over the chosen man. 
           An ENGINEER begins to drill the lid closed.

           Kido looks at Yanami, questioning. 

                                 YANAMI
                        In case he changes his mind.
           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Kido and the Emperor exit the compound. 

                                 KIDO
                        Your Majesty.

           The emperor looks up. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        They say Germany will declare 
                        defeat soon.

           A long beat. It’s not clear if the Emperor has accepted this 
           reality. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        Have you given any thought to a 
                        negotiated peace?

           The Emperor is quiet, his expression inscrutable. 

           Then he speaks, his voice is surprisingly high-pitched.

                                 EMPEROR
                        They look like birds.

           Kido follows his gaze. Outside the window, a thick black 
           flock of planes rises into the sky. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Break of dawn. Tibbets, lugging a suitcase, pauses to look 
           into Mary’s bedroom.

           She’s sleeping with her arms around the toy plane. 

           INT. MILITARY PLANE - MOVING - MORNING 

           Groves and Tibbets are squeezed into the “jump” -- a 
           makeshift wooden plank directly behind the pilot and copilot. 
           The plane rattles from turbulence.

           Tibbets suddenly unbuckles his seat belt, unable to stop 
           himself. Leans forward and taps the pilot on the shoulder. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Go easy on engine two for a second. 
                        You’ll ride this out a little 
                        smoother. 
           As he returns to his seat, Groves studies him. Tibbets looks 
           out the window. Sees nothing but desert. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Where are we?

           Groves doesn’t reply. The ride stabilizes. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - AFTERNOON

           A JEEP is ushered through the triple layer of barbed-wire 
           security at the Los Alamos compound.

           A large sign reads: WHAT YOU HEAR HERE, WHAT YOU SEE HERE, 
           WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE, LET IT STAY HERE. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - OPPENHEIMER’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Groves and Tibbets stand outside a small, Adobe-style 
           bungalow. Groves leans on the buzzer.

                                 GROVES
                        I’m warning you now, he’s a weirdo. 
                        I mean, reads Sanskrit poetry, shit 
                        like that. But obviously a genius. 
                        But weird. Really fucking weird. 

           Suddenly the door opens, and standing in front of them is 
           ROBERT OPPENHEIMER (30s). A long, skinny man with a bright, 
           boyish face. He wears a suit with a flower through the lapel. 
           He’s smoking a cigarette and drinking a martini. Something he 
           does constantly. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Colonel Tibbets. Meet Robert 
                        Oppenheimer. Chief Scientist. 

           Tibbets reaches out his hand, but Oppenheimer doesn’t have 
           one to spare. 

           INT. OPPENHEIMER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Groves and Tibbets sit across from Oppenheimer, who is  
           smiling for no apparent reason. Gesturing to his drink--

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        Anything for you boys?

           Tibbets shakes his head.
                                 GROVES
                        The usual.

           Oppenheimer goes to the sidebar and pours whiskey into a 
           glass. A hefty dose. Groves gestures with his hand, keep 
           going. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                             (re: Tibbets)
                        What does he know?

                                 GROVES
                        Practically nothing. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        And what would you like him to 
                        know?

                                 GROVES
                        Everything.

           Oppenheimer raises an eyebrow. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        Everything?

           Groves nods. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        Have you heard of atomic energy, 
                        Colonel Tibbets?

                                 TIBBETS
                        No, Sir.

           Groves, restless and bored already, takes a sizable swig from 
           his drink. Wanders around the room, opening cabinet drawers. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        You know about matter and 
                        antimatter?

           Tibbets shakes his head. Oppenheimer sighs dramatically.

                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        Paul - may I call you that? The 
                        universe was born of annihilation 
                        and energy, destruction and 
                        creation, fire and water, all mixed 
                        together. The Hindus know that, of 
                        course. Brahma creates, Vishnu 
                        preserves. And what’s left? 

           Tibbets just stares at him.
                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        It’s not a trick question, Paul. 

           Groves is pulling hard on a closed cabinet door. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        The chocolates are in the drawer 
                        above. Top right.

           Groves grunts, pulls open the indicated drawer. Finds the 
           chocolates.

                                 GROVES
                        Just want one.

           He takes three.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        Shiva is left. Shiva destroys. It’s 
                        the Holy Trinity-- 

                                 GROVES
                        Jesus Christ, Oppie.   
                             (to Tibbets)
                        The bomb is equivalent to 20,000 
                        tons of TNT. As if 2,000 planes 
                        dropped max loads at the same time. 
                        Take every bomb you’ve ever 
                        dropped, add them up -- and it’s 
                        still less than what this bomb can 
                        do.

           Tibbets looks at them, stunned.

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        What are you calling it now?

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        The gadget.

                                 GROVES
                        It’s a stupid fucking name but a 
                        really powerful bomb, Tibbets. And 
                        we’re going to blow up a whole 
                        lotta Japs with it. 

           Oppenheimer exhales smoke.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        It’s not a stupid name.

                                 GROVES
                        You gotta quit smoking, Oppie, it’s 
                        a filthy habit.
           His mouth is full of chocolate. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - CRITICAL MASS FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           Groves, Tibbets and Oppenheimer look through a window at a 
           workshop. 

           A scientist, LOUIS SLOTIN (20s), uses a screwdriver to 
           manipulate a small metal hemisphere.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        That’s Slotin. One of our best 
                        physicists. He’s testing the 
                        critical mass. Which requires 
                        bringing the two cores as close as 
                        possible without provoking a 
                        reaction. If that screwdriver 
                        slips... they call it twisting the 
                        dragon’s tail.

           Slotin gives them a thumbs up through the glass with his free 
           hand. Groves grunts. 

                                 GROVES
                        I gotta piss.

           As he wanders off, Oppenheimer suddenly turns to Tibbets. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        His first choice chickened out. 
                             (beat)
                        Good chance you will too after 
                        hearing what I’m about to say.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Maybe it’s better left unsaid, Sir.

           Ignoring him--

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        If it goes off as planned, you and 
                        your crew will likely be 
                        incinerated in a massive eight mile 
                        blast that will extend all the way 
                        to the earth’s crust. Unless you 
                        fly away very, very fast. Which is, 
                        as far as I can tell, close to 
                        impossible. You’re going to want to 
                        think about all that. 
                                 TIBBETS
                        I’ve dropped a lot of bombs, Doctor 
                        Oppenheimer. I’ve found thinking 
                        doesn’t help much. 

           Oppenheimer leans in, intense, eyes a little wild. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        My cat wandered into the lab last 
                        month. His jaw bone turned to mush. 
                        His little tongue swelled. His hair 
                        fell out in patches. This isn’t 
                        just another bomb, Colonel Tibbets. 
                        This one kills slowly. It’s the 
                        embodiment of evil--

                                 TIBBETS
                        That’s more than I need to know. 

           His voice is firm. Oppenheimer looks surprised.

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        I fought the Japs. You know they 
                        dice American prisoners alive? Cut 
                        open their guts. Slowly, carefully, 
                        remove the organs, one by one. Guys 
                        are screaming while they do it. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes, it is. 

           Groves bangs the bathroom door open, still pulling up his 
           pants. 

                                 GROVES
                        Is he boring you, Tibbets?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Not at all, General. 

           He looks warily between them. 

                                 GROVES
                        Stop talking about your damn kitty 
                        cat, Oppie. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - MORNING

           Groves and Tibbets stand in front of a set of huge shiny 
           black wheels. 
                                 GROVES
                        You know what this is?

           Tibbets takes in the sight of the MASSIVE FOUR ENGINE PLANE.

                                 TIBBETS
                        A B29?

                                 GROVES
                        The super fortress. Biggest plane 
                        in the world. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I thought these weren’t ready yet. 
                        Accidents in testing.

                                 GROVES
                        Yeah, yeah, nineteen people died, I 
                        know. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Isn’t there another--

                                 GROVES
                        It’s the only plane big enough to 
                        fit the gadget. 

           He gestures toward it.

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        It’s yours. Two others on the way.

           Tibbets runs his hands along the nose, then climbs the 
           ladder. The plane is the size of half a football field. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Factory’s gonna send a trainer. If 
                        you’re nervous. 

           Tibbets steps inside. Pokes his head up through the cockpit. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Sir? Can I borrow this?

                                 GROVES
                        You got some girl you wanna 
                        impress?  

                                 TIBBETS
                        My daughter, Sir. I want to go get 
                        my family and bring them back here.

           Groves frowns.
                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        I insist, Sir. Or you’ll have to 
                        find someone else.

           Groves studies him. 

           INT. PLANE - MOVING - NIGHT

           A terrified Lucy, holding her daughter, sits on the “jump” 
           behind the pilot seat. 

           Tibbets pilots, grinning, and puffing on a pipe (he always 
           smokes when he flies). An easy-going copilot, ROBERT LEWIS 
           (29), sits next to him. 

                                 TIBBETS
                             (shouting)
                        Which way?

           Mary squeals with pleasure.  

                                 MARY
                        Right!

           Tibbets banks the plane right. Lucy and Mary slide to the 
           other end of the plank.

                                 LUCY
                        Paul! Please--

                                 MARY
                        Left!

           The plane banks left. She whoops, hollering, as they slide 
           again. The copilot grins.

           Tibbets looks out the window. It’s the first time he’s looked 
           completely comfortable and at home. This is where he belongs.

           The desert lights of Los Alamos wink in the distance. Their 
           new home. 

           INT. TOKYO - IMPERIAL WAR ROOM - DAY

           In a basement dining room -- Kido stands at the head of a 
           table of SIX MEN. 

           The table is covered with brocade. Behind Kido is a paper-
           thin gold screen. In front of the screen, a silver dais. 

           The Emperor enters. Sits on the dais, facing south. The men 
           bow deeply, then sit with their hands on their knees. 
           They do not look at the Emperor, who listens to the 
           proceedings with a detached expression. Kido at his side.

                                 KIDO
                        The Emperor wishes for Admiral 
                        Yanami to review his plans.

           ADMIRAL YANAMI opens a scroll, begins to read. 

                                 YANAMI
                        After the slight misfortune of Iwo 
                        Jima, we are preparing for the 
                        barbarian invasion of the Emperor’s 
                        homeland. The Americans will land 
                        at Kyushu in a few months. Where 
                        they will meet Operation Decision. 
                        Every man and woman age 15 to 60 
                        will fight. All of Japan.

           Kido listens to these insane plans, barely able to conceal 
           his distaste. 

                                 KIDO
                        And what will they use as weapons? 
                        You know the stock is depleted. 

           Yanami is irritated by the question.

                                 YANAMI
                        Bamboo sticks cut into spears. Bow 
                        and arrow. Whatever they can find. 

                                 KIDO
                        Against American firearms. And how 
                        long will we fight?

                                 YANAMI
                        Until the Americans surrender. Or 
                        we’re all dead. 

                                 KIDO
                        Our people are starving. There is 
                        no rice. We have 25 carriers. They 
                        have 100. The merchant fleet has 
                        declined by five million tons. 
                        Japan cannot defeat America.

           Yanami leans in. The other admirals watch, sensing the 
           tension. None dare to say anything. Even if they agree.

                                 YANAMI
                        I find your lack of faith 
                        disturbing, Kido. 
                                 KIDO
                        I’m the appointed voice of the 
                        Emperor. 

                                 YANAMI
                        Does anyone else believe these are 
                        the words of the Emperor?

           The other admirals remain silent. They glance at the emperor, 
           who makes no effort to settle the argument.

           Yanami stands, defiant. Places a military order in front of 
           the Emperor. 

           The emperor, hesitating, pours wax at the bottom of the page. 
           Then stamps his SEAL. Still silent. 

           Yanami looks at Kido with satisfaction. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - AIR HANGAR - MORNING

           Tibbets stands in the shadow of the massive B29. In front of 
           him, a group of SEVEN SOLDIERS. 

           As he calls out names from a clipboard, the corresponding 
           soldier steps forward. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Ferebee, bombardier. Van Kirk, 
                        navigator. Beser, radar. Parsons, 
                        ordnance. Caron, tail gunner. 
                        Eatherly, pilot. Lewis, pilot.  

           A beat.

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        You have the rest of the day off. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        To do what? We’re not allowed to 
                        leave the base.

           CLAUDE EATHERLY (22) is tall, handsome, rakish with a lantern 
           jaw. Breezy confidence. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        No, you’re not.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Not even on weekends. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Never.
                                 EATHERLY
                        So, what you’re saying is, no 
                        girls. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        This isn’t summer camp, Lieutenant. 

           JACOB BESER (23), short, wiry, intense. 

                                 BESER
                        What is it, Colonel? I’m pulled out 
                        of Nebraska right as the rest of 
                        the boys deploy to the Pacific. 
                        Nobody tells me anything. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You were each selected for your 
                        talents. You’re the best of the 
                        best. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        We already know that.

                                 TIBBETS
                        The rest is classified. 

           The men look at each other. 

                                 PARSONS
                        You ever commanded a troop before?

           WILLIAM PARSONS (43) is a Navy officer. A cool-headed bald 
           man.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m a quick study.  

                                 PARSONS
                        What are you, like a decade younger 
                        than me?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Practice tomorrow at zero six 
                        hundred. 

                                 PARSONS
                        Practice for what?

           Tibbets looks up at their confused faces. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Don’t worry about what we’re doing, 
                        boys. Just worry about doing it 
                        well.
           He tucks the clipboard under his arm, walks off. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - DORMITORY - DAY

           Eatherly, toting a large duffel bag, slams the door open, 
           steps into a tiny, cramped dormitory. Through the back 
           window, he sees a SECRET SERVICE MAN standing guard, arms 
           folded.

           He opens the window. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Hey there.

           The secret service man does not reply. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        You must be bored out of your 
                        fucking mind.

           Nothing. He plops down on a nearby bed. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        You gonna watch me jack off?

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS HOUSE - SAME TIME

           A simple one-story bungalow with a front porch. 

           Lucy sips tea with a few Army wives seated around her. They 
           are all looking at the BARBED WIRE FENCE that separates 
           family housing from the internal compound. 

                                 WIFE #1
                        I heard Oppenheimer’s having an 
                        affair--

                                 WIFE #2
                        Well, I heard his wife’s breath 
                        always smells like liquor--

                                 WIFE #1
                        She’s the only wife they let behind 
                        the fence.

           The other wives murmur at this. 

                                 LUCY
                        What the hell is actually going on 
                        over here? Does anybody know?

           They fall silent. Look at each other.
                                 WIFE #3
                        They’re planning a Winter Ball. For 
                        late January. 

                                 WIFE #2
                        I heard they’re bringing in the 
                        Tommy Dorsey band.

                                 WIFE #3
                        I love to dance.

           Lucy rolls her eyes.

           INT. HANGAR - B29 PLANE - MORNING

           The men climb into the B29, exploring the cramped interior. 

           Beser and Eatherly enter the cockpit -- stop when they see a 
           WOMAN sitting in the pilot’s seat. This is DORA DAUGHERTY 
           (27). Fierce, intelligent, with untamed dark hair. 

                                 DORA
                        Strap in, boys. Are you familiar 
                        with flying by instruments? 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Who the hell are you?

           Tibbets enters.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Dora’s an expert on B29s. Sent by 
                        the Boeing factory. Part of the 
                        Woman Airforce Service Pilots. 

           Eatherly calmly, confidently turns on various monitors. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        With all due respect, Dora, I don’t 
                        need a girl to tell me how to fly a 
                        plane. 

                                 TIBBETS 
                        Dora trained with the Wright 
                        Brothers--

                                 DORA
                             (to Tibbets)
                        Don’t. 
                             (to Eatherly)
                        You in or out, Sergeant? Because 
                        this beast is taking off either 
                        way.
           INT. FIRST B29 PLANE - LATER

           Later. Tibbets and copilot Lewis sit in the cockpit of a B29 
           as it flies several thousand feet above ground. 

                                 TIBBETS
                             (into headset)
                        The goal is to be eight miles away 
                        43 seconds after dropping the load. 

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - DAY

           Eatherly and Dora sit at the controls of a second B29, also 
           racing above the clouds. 

                                 TIBBETS’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Drop the target at AP. Then turn 
                        155 degrees. And fly. Fast. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        155 degrees? 

           The radio crackles, but there’s no answer. 

                                 DORA
                        Don’t choke the throttle--

                                 EATHERLY
                             (irritable)
                        I know. 

           Eatherly looks behind him.

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                             (shouting)
                        Prepare the pumpkin!

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - MIDSECTION - DAY

           TOM FEREBEE (26), a notoriously accurate bombardier, and 
           Parsons examine a giant metal sphere painted orange. It 
           weighs 10,000 pounds.

                                 FEREBEE
                        What the fuck is it?

                                 PARSONS
                        Just a dummy. 

                                 FEREBEE
                        I know that. What the fuck is it 
                        supposed to be?
           He shrugs, unhooks the “bomb” from a release catch swinging 
           from the wall. 

           INT. FIRST B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - DAY

           Tibbets and Lewis look out their windows at a small pristine 
           lake miles below them. Target practice. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Dropping pumpkin one. 

           EXT. FIRST B29 PLANE - DAY

           The bomb bay doors fly open and a metal orange ball drops 
           out, plummeting toward the still water.

           Tibbets maneuvers the plane into a hairpin turn. The massive 
           aircraft creaks and lumbers, struggling with the tight angle. 

           Then the plane guns forward, trying to get away from the bomb 
           as fast as possible.

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - DAY

           Eatherly watches the first plane drop its load with a 
           critical eye. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        He’s never going to make eight 
                        miles. 

           EXT. FIRST B29 PLANE - DAY

           Tibbets’s plane races away from the pumpkin as Eatherly’s 
           plane waits, ready. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Detonation would happen... now!

           Tibbets examines a gauge monitor. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        We made it 3 miles. 
                             (low)
                        We just got incinerated.

                                 LEWIS
                        What?
                                 TIBBETS
                        Nothing. 

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - DAY

           Eatherly laughs, buoyed by Tibbets’s defeat. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        My turn!

                                 TIBBETS’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Take it easy, Eatherly. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Not a chance. 

                                 DORA
                        I wouldn’t--

                                 EATHERLY
                        Here’s how we’re going to do this. 
                        You’re going to shut your pretty 
                        little mouth and I’m going to fly 
                        this fucking plane. Really fast. 

           He guns the throttle. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        Release!

           EXT. SECOND B29 PLANE - DAY

           Eatherly’s plane drops his pumpkin. Then he takes the 155-
           degree turn quickly.

           So quickly that the plane CAPSIZES IN AIR. 

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - DAY

           CHAOS. Eatherly and Dora hang upside down by straps. The 
           monitors light up.

           Eatherly desperately hits switches, pulls back on the 
           throttle.  

           He’s panicking, but trying not to show it. He slams the radio 
           with his fist.
           INT. FIRST B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - SAME TIME

           Tibbets watches calmly as Eatherly’s plane flies belly up. 

           The radio crackles frantically. 

                                 LEWIS
                        I think he’s trying to signal us--

                                 TIBBETS
                        Let him figure it out. 

           Lewis reacts, surprised. 

           INT. SECOND B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - SAME TIME

           Eatherly, wild-eyed, looks at Dora, who looks back at him, 
           relaxed.

                                 DORA
                        I’m keeping my pretty mouth shut.

           EXT. SECOND B29 PLANE - DAY

           Slowly the plane begins to right itself. It wavers, wobbly in 
           the air.  

           INT. SECOND B29 - COCKPIT - DAY

           Eatherly breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                 EATHERLY
                             (shaken)
                        There we go. There we go. I got 
                        this. Scared you didn’t I?

           Then without warning, it NOSE DIVES, heading into what pilots 
           call a “graveyard spiral.”

           Eatherly slams on instruments and switches, pulls on the 
           toggle, but nothing works. He looks over at Dora, who 
           casually checks her nails. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        Shit! Where is the RPM gauge?

           Still nothing from Dora. He slams the wheel, his voice 
           climbing several octaves as he SCREAMS. He looks at her. 
           Helpless. 

           She smiles, shouting over the screaming monitors--
                                 DORA
                        BEG FOR IT.

           He grimaces, furious. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        HELP. ME.

           Dora, almost bored, puts her hand over his and guides it to 
           the throttle. With her other hand, she rapidly flicks several 
           switches. The plane begins to right itself.  

           Eatherly watches, humiliated. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - LATER

           The two B29s stand side by side. A little worse for wear but 
           safely back on ground. 

           The crew, including Dora, stands in front of them. Eatherly 
           paces back and forth, enraged.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Those planes are fucking coffins.

           Tibbets says nothing. He’s studying the nose of the plane. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        And we need a commander who knows 
                        what the fuck he’s doing. 

           Tibbets isn’t listening. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Imbalance comes from the nose. It’s 
                        off-kilter. We should get that 
                        fixed.

           Eatherly stops pacing in front of Tibbets, furious.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Are you going to reply, Colonel?

           Tibbets eyes him steadily. His voice kind but firm. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I know you’re humiliated, Claude. 
                        But defeat makes you stronger. My 
                        first big mission, I nearly threw 
                        Eisenhower out the window. Banked 
                        too sharp. 
                             (beat)
                        Dora will work with you. 
                                 DORA
                        Happy to help.

           Eatherly looks at her, then back at Tibbets, enraged.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Are you out of your fucking--

                                 TIBBETS
                        And don’t curse around me. 

           Eatherly and the men look at him, astonished. Dora stifles a  
           chuckle. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - HANGAR - NIGHT

           Tibbets sits cross-legged in front of the planes, studying 
           them. Still trying to figure something out.

           Dora approaches. 

           Without looking away--

                                 TIBBETS
                        It takes a B29 two minutes to fly 
                        eight miles, but the bomb takes 
                        only 43 seconds to travel 29,000 
                        feet. The shock wave takes 40 
                        seconds to travel eight miles.

                                 DORA
                        We’d have to reach eight miles in 
                        one minute and 23 seconds. In a 
                        plane the size of a house.

           They both sigh together.

                                 TIBBETS
                        How’d you get so good?

           She looks at him, surprised. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        I want you on this mission.

                                 DORA
                        Right. We’re not even allowed to 
                        put on the uniform.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’ll handle it.

           He gets up abruptly, walks away. Off Dora, smiling.
           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tibbets, smoking his pipe, reads the newspaper. Mary sits at 
           his feet. 

                                 MARY
                        Read to me, Daddy. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Alright. Let’s see what we have 
                        here.

           He flips past various reports of the Pacific and German war 
           theaters. “10,000 DEAD IN THE PACIFIC THIS MONTH.”

           Lucy enters with cups of hot chocolate, hands one to Mary.

                                 LUCY
                        Tibbets. 

           He looks up. She hands him the other cup.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        This place is crawling with people 
                        who don’t look like soldiers. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Support staff.

                                 LUCY
                        There’s a lot of them.

           He doesn’t respond. Keeps turning pages. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Only way to survive this war is to 
                        keep your head down, Lucy.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sure that’s what they tell you.

                                 TIBBETS
                        It’s what works.

                                 LUCY
                        Not in this house. I’m not one of 
                        your soldiers. It’s not how I 
                        survive.

           Tibbets looks up at her.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Alright, Lucy.
           Then flips past another miserable report on deaths in Morocco 
           -- lands on a Peanuts comic strip. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Okay, here we go, Pumpkin.

           Mary sits up, eager. Lucy walks out.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Middle of the night. Lucy wakes up, looks at Tibbets. He’s 
           curled up in the fetal position, soaked in sweat. 

           She sighs, knowing what’s going on inside his head.

           EXT. BURMESE SKY - FLASHBACK - DAY

           Suddenly we’re soaring above the Burmese jungle -- Tibbets 
           and his CO-PILOT in the cockpit of a small fighter plane. 
           They’re CHEERING themselves hoarse -- evidently on the heels 
           of some victory. It’s chaotic, confused, jubilant... 

           Until BLOOD SPLATTERS across the instruments -- the copilot 
           falls forward, his head smashing against the monitors, a 
           gaping gunshot wound in the back of his head. 

           Above them, a Japanese plane, black-and-yellow, soars within 
           eyesight. 

           Behind the controls, a JAPANESE PILOT screams. Focusing his 
           gun on Tibbets now, their gazes locked. He’s about to 
           shoot...

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - MORNING

           CLOSE ON the picture of a JAPANESE SOLDIER, his cartoonish 
           face twisted in fury -- the expression a close match to the 
           flashback. 

           WIDEN TO SEE it’s an American propaganda poster, nearly a 
           story tall, being plastered on the building opposite 
           Tibbets’s house. 

           The caption: “WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? STAY ON THE 
           JOB UNTIL EVERY MURDERING JAP IS WIPED OUT!”

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Mary sits at the table, watching the men put up the poster. 
           She’s drawing her own little replica on a piece of paper.
           Tibbets stands by the window, eating an APPLE, looking at the 
           poster too.

           Mary turns back to her father. Points at him.

                                 MARY
                        What are you going to do about it?

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - MORNING 

           Tibbets, in shirtsleeves (normally wears full uniform), RIPS 
           OUT GUNS from the innards of the B29 plane and throws them, 
           with a clatter, onto the concrete.

           The men and Dora watch, astonished. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m tossing out the armaments next. 
                        The lighter we are, the faster we 
                        go. This could get us to eight 
                        miles.

                                 EATHERLY
                        With no guns. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Anti-aircraft can’t reach us at 
                        30,000 feet.

                                 EATHERLY
                        But interceptors can. 

           Tibbets shrugs.

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be chewed up by enemy fire. 

           Tibbets stops to look at him, then at Dora. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        We have no choice.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Yeah well, I do. 

           He turns and leaves. The men look warily at Tibbets, who 
           doesn’t stop him. Just keeps pulling out guns. 

           Dora looks at the men, then joins Tibbets.
           INT. LOS ALAMOS - MAIL ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Tibbets watches as Groves reads “outgoing” mail from the men. 

                                 GROVES
                        Van Kirk’s wife is pregnant. And he 
                        doesn’t sound too happy about it. 
                        ‘We will discuss when I return.’

                                 TIBBETS
                        Oh.

                                 GROVES
                        Mention it to him the next time you 
                        see him. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Why?

                                 GROVES
                        So he knows we know. 

           Groves smiles, then RIPS up the letter and throws it in the 
           trash. Hands an envelope to Tibbets. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

           Tibbets takes it, stalls by reading the address on the 
           outside.

           Groves pulls out another letter, reads...

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        I think Eatherly has emotional 
                        problems. Maybe we should cut him. 

           Tibbets considers this, then slowly shakes his head. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        He’s a good pilot. He just needs 
                        time. 

                                 GROVES
                        His letters talk about flashbacks 
                        to Dresden. Wakes up sweating. Shit 
                        like that.

           He shakes his head, laughing. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Listen to this. 
                             (in a little girl’s voice)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        I’m sick and tired of being 
                        expected to do exactly as I’m told. 
                        Because usually it means dying. 
                        We’re going on a suicide mission. 
                        Fine. I just want to know. Tibbets 
                        thinks we’re his pawns. But the 
                        truth is, he’s a pawn too.

           Groves snorts. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Coward.

           He rips up Eatherly’s letter too. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lucy scrubs dishes in the kitchen. Looks out the window and 
           sees a gaggle of “support workers” -- including Slotin, the 
           physicist -- walk past. One wears a white lab coat.

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door flies open. Lucy stands there, calls after the 
           workers. 

                                 LUCY
                        Hey! 

           They turn, surprised. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, but what exactly do you 
                        fellas do around here?

           They hesitate...

                                 SLOTIN
                        We’re sanitation workers.

           Lucy folds her arms, narrows her eyes.

                                 LUCY
                        Is that right?

           They nod. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Great. I’ve got a problem with my 
                        toilet. Think you could help me 
                        out?
           They look at each other, stumped.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS BATHROOM - MORNING

           Lucy watches as Slotin struggles with her toilet. He clearly 
           has no idea what he’s doing.  

                                 LUCY
                        The flapper and flush valve aren’t 
                        working properly. You can see that, 
                        right?

                                 SLOTIN
                        ‘course.

           She looks him steady in the eye.

                                 LUCY
                        What’s really going on here?

           He hesitates, then--

                                 SLOTIN
                        Rusted pipes.

           She shakes her head, exasperated.

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - DAWN

           The crew stands in formation outside the Hangar, waiting for 
           Tibbets. He approaches, stops in front of them. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Everyone but Eatherly can leave. 

           They look at each other, but follow the command. Eatherly 
           looks at him, questioning. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Just lead pilots today. 

           Eatherly nods, wary. Tibbets presses a button that opens the 
           hangar door. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        We’re dropping a very big bomb on 
                        Japan. It’s dangerous. Should wipe 
                        out an entire city. But it’ll 
                        probably kill us too - if we don’t 
                        clear eight miles. 
           He’s calm, matter of fact. Eatherly looks at him, shocked. 
           Just as he opens his mouth--

                                 GROVES (O.S.)
                        You’re late. 

           They turn. Groves stands by the plane, chomping on a cigar.

           Tibbets salutes. He waves it off. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        General--

                                 GROVES
                        Let’s get going, Boys.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Unfortunately, Sir, today is only 
                        for--

                                 GROVES
                        Too bad. I’m coming along. Need to 
                        see for myself what’s taking you so 
                        damn long. 
                             (beat)
                        You don’t mind, do you?

           Tibbets doesn’t respond. Looks at Eatherly, who’s still 
           reeling.

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - LATER

           Tibbets in the pilot seat. Eatherly is copilot. Behind them, 
           on the wooden plank, is Groves, smoking his cigar. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Dropping the pumpkin. 

           Eatherly starts a timer on his watch. 

           EXT. B29 PLANE - SAME TIME

           The dummy bomb hurls downward as the bomb bays close. The 
           plane races above the clouds. Faster now. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MOMENTS LATER

           The timer stops at one minute, 23 seconds.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Four miles. 
           Tibbets smiles grimly. Eatherly now understands the 
           ramifications of falling short.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Better than before. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        You said eight, right?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        But we’re already six miles away, 
                        vertically, from where this thing 
                        will explode. So if we flew in a 
                        slant line in the opposite 
                        direction after release, we’d need 
                        five miles. Not eight. 

           Tibbets looks at him. He’s right. 

                                 GROVES
                        The fucking wing is on fire! 

           They whip around. Flames whip out of the engine beneath the 
           right wing. Tibbets sighs. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        One of the problems with the B29. 
                        Happened in the test flights.
                             (to Eatherly)
                        Cut Engine three. 

                                 GROVES
                        What?

                                 TIBBETS
                        It’s fine. We’ll probably make it 
                        to ground before it spreads to the 
                        spar.

                                 GROVES
                        Probably?

           Groves is genuinely terrified for his life. Tibbets, on the 
           other hand, is completely calm. He’s been in many worse 
           scrapes.

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking kidding me? 
                                 TIBBETS
                        Just gotta make sure the fire 
                        doesn’t spread to the magnesium in 
                        the engine. That would be bad.

           The plane JOLTS upward. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be a little rocky 
                        without the engine.

                                 GROVES
                        So turn the damn thing back on!

                                 TIBBETS
                        It needs to be rocky.

                                 GROVES
                        I may not have flown a plane in 
                        five years, but I know we need a 
                        goddamn engine to stay in the sky--

                                 EATHERLY
                        General, the Colonel is right--

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m taking a calculated risk, Sir--

                                 GROVES
                        Turn the engine on! That’s a direct 
                        order!

           He’s panicking. The plane JOLTS again. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I can’t do that, General. 

           Groves reaches out to flick the engine switch. Tibbets, 
           acting instinctively, grabs his wrist and keeps him from it. 

                                 GROVES
                        This is fucking insubordination 
                        that will be punished at the 
                        highest level--

           Tibbets, his face determined, struggles with the General. 

           Suddenly, Tibbets lets go of the wrist. And with a swift, 
           violent blow, KNOCKS THE GENERAL with the back of his elbow. 

           The general’s head bounces off the back of the cockpit. He 
           slumps to the floor. Out cold. 
           Eatherly looks at Groves, then back at Tibbets. Stunned. And 
           flush with newfound respect. 

           EXT. B29 PLANE - MORNING

           The plane lands on the runway. The fire still flickering in 
           the engine. 

           Tibbets’s hand juts out of the open cockpit, FIRES A GUN into 
           the air. 

           Two PARAMEDICS near the runway recognize the signal and 
           sprint towards the plane with a gurney. 

           The plane rolls to a stop. Tibbets climbs out of the cockpit. 
           Drags Groves out by his feet, struggling to carry him in his 
           arms. The paramedics transfer him onto the gurney. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

           Groves lies sleeping in his bed, his chin bandaged. 

           Tibbets enters with a bouquet of flowers. Leaves them on the 
           bedside table, along with a handwritten card that reads: “I’M 
           SORRY, GENERAL. YOURS, TIBBETS.”

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tibbets, Lucy and Mary eat dinner quietly. 

           The door SLAMS open. Groves stands there, furious.

                                 GROVES
                        Don’t ever fucking do that again.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Likewise, General Groves. 

           A beat. A grudging expression of respect appears on the 
           General’s face.

                                 GROVES
                        Nice to see you Lucy. Mary. 

           Mary salutes. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        That smells good.
                                 LUCY
                        It’s meatloaf and potatoes, 
                        General. Why don’t you join us?

           He takes a seat across from Mary.

                                 GROVES
                        I don’t want to intrude.

           Lucy grabs an extra plate, spoons potatoes onto it. 

                                 LUCY
                        So can you tell me why your 
                        sanitation workers know nothing 
                        about plumbing?

           Both Groves and Tibbets blanch.

                                 TIBBETS
                             (warning)
                        Lucy--

                                 GROVES
                        Fair question. They’re only trained 
                        in underground systems.

                                 LUCY
                        Right. 

           Groves continues eating cheerfully. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Another practice run. Tibbets and Eatherly next to each other 
           in the cockpit, racing away from the bomb. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Five... four... three... two... 
                        ONE!

           He shuts the timer off. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        SIX MILES! WE DID IT!

           He cheers himself hoarse. 

           In the mid and back sections, Dora, Beser, Parsons, Van Kirk, 
           Ferebee and Caron join in. 

           Eatherly looks at Tibbets.
                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, nothing?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Can’t tempt fate. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        You don’t believe that shit, do 
                        you?

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’ve seen a lot of men shot while 
                        cheering.

           Eatherly looks at him, suddenly sober.

                                 EATHERLY
                        You can’t think that way.

           Tibbets reluctantly lets out a feeble... 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Hooray.

           Eatherly rolls his eyes. Tibbets takes a deep breath and 
           ROARS HIMSELF HOARSE. Eatherly claps him on the back. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - DAY

           As Tibbets and Eatherly walk with the rest of the crew from 
           the plane, they find General Groves, looking sober. 

                                 GROVES
                        Stop everything. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        What’s wrong?

           Groves shakes his head, walks away.

           Tibbets and Eatherly exchange a look. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - GROVES’S OFFICE - LATER

           Tibbets watches as Groves carefully takes down the 
           presidential picture of FDR that hangs above his desk.

           The picture of Truman, the Vice-President, remains. 
                                 GROVES
                        He didn’t even get to see his war 
                        end. Died getting his portrait 
                        painted.

                                 TIBBETS
                        What happens now?

           Groves shakes his head. 

                                 GROVES
                        Truman doesn’t know. About any of 
                        this. 

           Tibbets looks at him, astonished. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Roosevelt didn’t want him to know. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Why?

           Groves shrugs. 

                                 GROVES
                        Maybe he didn’t think he had the 
                        balls.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Groves sits opposite HARRY TRUMAN in the oval office. Next to 
           Groves is HENRY STIMSON (72), Secretary of State. 

                                 STIMSON
                        You need time to think, Sir. This 
                        is a lot of information. 

           Truman looks up, a sharp, intense expression on his face. He 
           sits back in his chair, like it’s been his for decades. 

                                 TRUMAN
                             (to Groves)
                        I want to drop two. Can you do 
                        that?

                                 GROVES
                             (surprised)
                        Yes, Sir. We can. 

                                 TRUMAN
                        Send me a list of Japanese targets 
                        by Monday. Germany’s going to fold 
                        soon.
           Stimson shakes his head, wary.

                                 STIMSON
                        Sir, I think we should consider the 
                        moral consequences--

                                 TRUMAN
                        I’m here to save lives, not 
                        perseverate over right or wrong. 
                        And that’s what I’m going to do. 

           Groves grins. He likes this guy. 

                                 GROVES
                        Great sign, by the way. 

           Sitting at the edge of Truman’s desk is a wooden plaque that 
           reads: “THE BUCK STOPS HERE.”

           EXT. TOKYO - IMPERIAL PALACE GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

           Kido and the Emperor watch as a group of BLINDFOLDED AMERICAN 
           PRISONERS OF WAR are lined up.

           Admiral Yanami whips his riding crop as he walks up and down 
           the line of Americans. Selects two. Then bows to the Emperor. 

           The men are brought forward. Placed in a kneeling position, 
           their necks exposed. Shaking and sweating with fear. 

           Yanami draws his ceremonial sword out of its sheath. Puts the 
           blade against the neck of the first man. He speaks in 
           English. It’s polished. He attended college in the States. 

                                 YANAMI
                        Your people lock us up in 
                        concentration camps. Treat us like 
                        animals. 

           He lifts the sword. The blindfolded Americans remain 
           perfectly still, terrified, listening. Kido closes his eyes. 

           The sound of the sword striking flesh. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - LATER

           After. Kido sits opposite the Emperor. Looks desperately into 
           the eyes of the commander of his country. Wishing he would 
           say or do something. 
           The Emperor suddenly motions for the car to stop. He opens 
           the door. VOMITS out the side. Then, wiping his mouth, closes 
           it. 

           He looks at Kido, still says nothing. 

           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - MORNING

           The grounds crawl with scientists, technicians and engineers.

           Tibbets and the crew stand in front of a 100-FOOT STEEL 
           TOWER. Behind them is a parked JEEP. 

           A winch pulls an ENORMOUS METAL SPHERE from the open jeep to 
           the top of the tower. 

           SUPER: “Bomb Test Day, July 1945”

                                 TIBBETS
                        You’re looking at the world’s first 
                        atomic bomb. 

           The men look at each other. 

                                 BESER
                        What the hell’s an atomic bomb?

           None of them have ever heard the phrase before. Most people 
           hadn’t. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You’re about to find out. 

                                 PARSONS
                        When?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Now. 

           Another JEEP pulls up and an AIDE clambers out. 

                                 AIDE
                             (shouting)
                        Colonel! 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Slotin, the physicist from earlier, lies in bed unconscious. 
           He’s emaciated. Right hand swollen like a balloon, covered in 
           massive blisters that ooze blood and pus. Lips are blue. Face 
           covered with an oxygen tent. 
           A DOCTOR, Groves, Oppenheimer and Tibbets stand next to him. 
           Oppenheimer is broken, emotional.  

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        The screwdriver slipped. While he 
                        was testing the critical mass on a 
                        sample. Just a small sample. I was 
                        in the room. There was a blue 
                        flash. We looked back and...  

                                 DOCTOR
                        These burns extend into his body. 
                        Like a three dimensional sunburn. 
                        All his internal organs... they’re 
                        black and dead.

           Tibbets looks at Groves, haunted.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you can’t tell me, but what 
                        the hell was he exposed to?

           Neither man answers. 

                                 GROVES
                        We’ll postpone the test by a day. 
                        No more. 

           He looks down at Slotin. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Poor bastard. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        He’s still alive, Leslie. Don’t 
                        talk about him like he’s not still 
                        here. 

           Groves gives Oppenheimer an exasperated look, then leaves. 

           Tibbets stares at Slotin. Underneath the oxygen tent, he can 
           make out a blackened, disfigured face. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Tibbets is drawing every curtain shut. It’s dark outside. 

           Lucy enters in her robe, sleepy.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s 4am. What are you doing?
                                 TIBBETS
                        You need to keep Mary in her room 
                        the entire morning. No exceptions. 
                        She can eat breakfast in there. If 
                        she needs to go to the bathroom, go 
                        with her. And make it quick, okay? 

                                 LUCY
                        What the hell is this about, Paul?

           He’s not listening. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        On second thought, she should stay 
                        in the basement. You should too.

           He draws the last curtain shut. 

           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - OBSERVATION SHELTERS - MORNING

           It’s the crack of dawn. Still dark. 

           Ten miles from the tower, the crew, including Tibbets, 
           slather sun screen onto their exposed skin. Oppenheimer and 
           Groves are also present.

           An AIDE passes out protective GOGGLES. 

           They all lie down on their bellies, feet toward the tower, 
           face away from the blast. 

           Tibbets turns to address his crew. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Don’t look up.

           A RADIO begins COUNTING DOWN. 

                                 RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ten... Nine... Eight... 

           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - TOWER - SAME TIME

           In a wooden crate at the top of the tower, the bomb glistens.  
           A caged animal, wrapped in tubes and wires like steel 
           entrails.

           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - FURTHER OUT - SAME TIME

           A RABBIT bounces into sight. It shakes with the cold. Nibbles 
           at a small green tendril sprouting out of a plant. 
           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - SHELTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Tibbets, even with his eyes shaded by goggles, shuts his eyes 
           tightly. 

                                 RADIO VOICE
                        Three... Two...

           Oppenheimer sits up, cross-legged, facing the tower. 

           Everyone else remains face down. 

                                 RADIO VOICE (CONT’D)
                        One.

           Silence. 

           A bright light of astonishing intensity shines on 
           Oppenheimer’s exposed face, twisted into a wild smile. 

           The lights shift from PURPLE to GRAY to WHITE to GREEN. We 
           don’t see the explosion itself, just the colors flickering. 

           The men and Dora slowly get up, turn to look. 

           A WAVE OF WIND, an aftershock from the explosion, THROWS THEM 
           TO THE GROUND. 

           Then, delayed by the speed of sound, a LOUD AND DEEP BOOM. 
           They cover their ears, already capped with earplugs. 

           Out of all the observers, only Tibbets remains on the ground. 
           His eyes still tightly clenched. Head literally buried in the 
           sand.

           The colors change above and around him. 

           As the noise booms through his earplugs, Tibbets flinches, 
           clearly triggering. Face covered in sweat, he hunches into 
           the ground like he’s under attack. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Lucy, still in her robe, sees flashes of light. She slowly 
           but decisively pulls opens a curtain. 

           Her face is suddenly lit, as if by a spotlight. Her eyes 
           widen. 

           She gasps. Hears Mary’s footsteps behind her - YANKS THE 
           CURTAINS SHUT just in time. 
                                 MARY
                        What is it, Mommy?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. ALMAGORDO TEST SITE - TOWER - DAY

           Hours later. The explosion over. 

           Tibbets, Groves and Oppenheimer tour the site of the 
           destroyed tower. 

           The desert sand has turned to A GREEN GLASSY SUBSTANCE FOR 
           MILES AROUND THEM. It crunches under their feet. Every plant 
           and hill has vanished. 

           It’s like someone erased a part of the Earth. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        What happened to the tower?

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        Evaporated. Poof.

                                 GROVES
                        And what is this shit?

           He indicates the green substance with his foot. Oppenheimer 
           shrugs.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        They’re testing it. Like glass, but 
                        not quite. 

           A beat. Tibbets is silent. Trying to wrap his head around it. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        It looked like a giant eyeball. 

                                 GROVES
                        You saw it?

           Oppenheimer looks out over the desolation, his affect 
           stranger than usual. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        I am become death, destroyer of 
                        worlds.

           Groves stares at him.
                                 GROVES
                        Oppie, I don’t know what the fuck 
                        you’re talking about. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        We should leave. It’s hot.

                                 GROVES
                        It’s not that hot. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        As in radioactive.

           INT. JEEP - MOVING - DAY

           Groves at the wheel. Tibbets and Oppenheimer ride in back. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        How is Slotin?

           Oppie shrugs, dispirited. 

                                 GROVES
                        We’re moving the bomb and your crew 
                        to Tinian. Small island off Japan. 
                        You’ll launch from there. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        No, it’s not ready. The explosion 
                        pattern was smaller than predicted. 

                                 GROVES
                        Oppie, we just blew up half of New 
                        Mexico. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        The ordnance was off. Delayed by a 
                        half-second. 

                                 GROVES
                        A half-second is fine. 

           They pass a pile of small CHARRED BONES. Completely stripped 
           of flesh. Where the rabbit used to be. Oppenheimer blanches.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        I need more time--

                                 GROVES
                        You’re out of fucking time. 

           It’s clear Oppenheimer is having second thoughts. For many 
           reasons. He looks helplessly at Tibbets.
           Groves twists back in his seat to look at them. The Jeep 
           starts to veer off the road.

           Groves’s gaze remains fixed, intense. Oppie wilts under it. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        They are dirty, ungentlemanly, 
                        primitive bastards. They eat raw 
                        fish. While sitting on the floor. 
                        They’re animals. Beasts of the 
                        jungles. They never surrender, 
                        never give in. They’ll blow 
                        themselves into smithereens with a 
                        hand grenade just to get some flak 
                        on you.  

           He turns back around just in time to keep the Jeep from 
           veering into a ditch. 

           Off Tibbets, still reeling from what he’s seen. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tibbets carries his suitcase into the living room, where Lucy 
           waits, withdrawn.

                                 LUCY
                        The Bible says the apocalypse 
                        begins with a ‘fire of 
                        destruction.’ 

                                 TIBBETS
                        When did you start reading the 
                        bible?

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know what else to do.

                                 TIBBETS
                        There’s nothing to do.

                                 LUCY
                        You should have said no.

                                 TIBBETS
                        That’s not how the military works. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do you really think they can’t find 
                        anyone else to drop the atomic 
                        bomb?
                                 TIBBETS
                        Lucy. I want to do this. 

           A beat.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s your choice. But I have 
                        choices too. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        What does that mean?

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know if Mary and I will be 
                        here when you come back. 

           He blinks. Not sure if she’s serious.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m tired of being a bystander. I 
                        don’t know exactly what you’re 
                        doing. But I don’t like it. And I 
                        don’t want my daughter anywhere 
                        near it. 

           She storms off, slams the bedroom door behind her.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Tibbets tries the door. Locked. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Come on, Lucy. Open the door.

           No answer. He bangs on it, frustrated. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Lucy. Grow up. This is bigger than 
                        you. 

           Silence. 

           He leans his head against the door. Then just as he turns to 
           walk away, he sees Mary, alone in the hallway. 

           She looks up at him, eyes wide and fearful. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Sweetheart--

           She steels herself, trying to look brave. 
                                 MARY
                        Are you going away again?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Yes.

                                 MARY
                        Forever?

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - AIR HANGAR - NIGHT

           Tibbets and Mary walk, hand in hand, towards the massive B29. 
           It’s evening, the compound abandoned. 

                                 MARY
                        Mommy’s gonna be mad. 

           He picks her up. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Mommy’s already mad. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - EVENING

           Mary, gleeful, races around the metal scaffolding that 
           surrounds a PUMPKIN. 

           She runs up and touches the orange metal with a little 
           trepidation. 

                                 MARY
                        Is this what’s going to kill all 
                        the murdering Japs?

           He looks at her, caught off guard.

           INT. B29 PLANE - FLYING - EVENING

           Tibbets and Mary, above the clouds. She’s strapped into the 
           copilot chair. Sitting very still, watching her father with 
           awe, like he’s a superhero. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I was twelve the first time I flew. 
                        Just a little older than you. 

           He looks over the edge of the cockpit. And...
           EXT. FLASHBACK - ILLINOIS FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           We’re on the ground, looking up at a YOUNG TIBBETS, in the 
           passenger seat of an old biplane. He peers down at us.

                                 TIBBETS (O.S.)
                        Your grandparents were candy-makers 
                        in Illinois. They hired a guy to 
                        fly low over football games so we 
                        could drop Baby Ruths. Like manna 
                        from heaven. With little 
                        parachutes. 

           Tibbets, sitting behind the pilot, reaches out and drops 
           CHOCOLATE BARS attached to PARACHUTES. They fall from the 
           plane, one by one. 

           We follow one of the chocolate bars, floating slowly down to 
           the field. 

                                 TIBBETS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        My momma, when I told her I was 
                        leaving school to fly, she didn’t 
                        get mad, just said, ‘You’ll be all 
                        right.’

           The chocolate bar drifts into the hands of a WOMAN (30s) who 
           looks up at her son in the sky, smiling. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        She knew I loved it. Being up here. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - EVENING

           Mary listens, rapt. He turns to look at her. She clambers 
           into his lap. 

                                 MARY
                        I love it up here too. I wanna be a 
                        pilot. Like you, Daddy.

           He wraps her little fingers around the throttle. Kisses the 
           top of her head. She squeals with glee as he pushes down on 
           the throttle, lowering the plane in the sky. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        We’re dumping the flaps now. 

           She giggles. 

                                 MARY
                        Where’s the gun? I wanna shoot 
                        Japs.
           He freezes a little. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        We don’t have guns on this plane, 
                        honey. 

                                 MARY
                        I wanna pretend!

           He reluctantly puts her hands on the trigger that controls 
           the wing-mounted guns, now inactive. She pulls on it eagerly. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        POW! POW! POW!

           Her fake gunshots ring into the night sky. Tibbets watches, 
           stroking her hair. He places his hand on hers, gently pulls 
           it back from the trigger. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - PLANE HANGAR - NIGHT

           Eatherly paces back and forth, pumped up. The rest of the 
           crew is more subdued, particularly Dora, who sits on the 
           plane wing, dangling her legs.

                                 EATHERLY
                        That was fucking amazing! Why 
                        didn’t we use that on the Germans?

           Nobody answers. Dora looks a little nauseated. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s hotter than a thousand suns. 
                        Combined. It’s gonna burn them 
                        alive. 

                                 PARSONS
                        They’re gonna melt like chocolate.  

           Tibbets enters. The men stand at attention, salute.

                                 TIBBETS
                        We move to Tinian tomorrow.

           They look at each other, uneasy. 

                                 DORA
                        Just like that? Is this right? Are 
                        we ready? 

           Tibbets blinks, conflicted.
                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        I mean... is it even safe?

           Tibbets looks at his crew. Sees Dora’s uncertainty reflected 
           in all of their eyes, even Eatherly’s. 

           Then his eyes harden. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You have a lot of questions, Dora. 
                        Maybe you’re not ready.

           Dora is taken aback. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        A mission like this, there’s no 
                        room for doubt. 

                                 DORA
                        I thought you wanted to talk about 
                        what happened yesterday?

                                 TIBBETS
                        And I thought you wanted this 
                        mission. More than anything. 

                                 DORA
                        I did. I... do. 

           But she’s clearly conflicted.  

                                 TIBBETS
                        Too late. You’re out. Go back to 
                        your dorm. We’re transferring non-
                        essential personnel to a base in 
                        Alaska. 

           Dora’s mouth drops open.

                                 DORA
                        Are you serious?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Anyone else have any questions? 
                        Concerns?

           He looks at the men, all shocked. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - MOMENTS LATER

           Tibbets walks quickly through the base.
                                 DORA (O.S.)
                        Tibbets.

           He keeps walking. She catches up.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell was that?

           He suddenly stops, looks at her. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You asked if this mission was safe. 
                        Why?  

                                 DORA
                        I--

                                 TIBBETS
                        It doesn’t matter why. It was the 
                        wrong question. 

                                 DORA
                        It wasn’t wrong.

           They just look at each other. Then a sudden realization hits 
           Dora.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re doing.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Go to Alaska, Dora.

           And he walks away.

           INT. TOKYO - IMPERIAL PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING

           Kido is ushered into an opulent bedroom. 

           The Emperor sits at a desk. He’s writing on a large scroll. 
           He turns to Kido, his expression questioning. Kido bows 
           deeply.

                                 KIDO
                        I am sorry to bother you at this 
                        time of night, Your Majesty. 

           The Emperor nods his head slightly. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        I received word from a man named 
                        Bern in Switzerland. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        He wishes to help us negotiate 
                        peace with the United States. 

           The Emperor doesn’t react. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll inform the Cabinet tomorrow. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m sure they’ll say no.

           The Emperor is impassive, silent. Kido sighs deeply. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        Your father always used to say the 
                        most admirable fish was the carp. 
                        It can swim upstream. Leap through 
                        steep falls. Evade bears, men. A 
                        fighter fish. But once caught and 
                        put on the cutting board, he lays 
                        quiet, accepting what must be. 

           The Emperor considers this. But still says nothing. 

           After a while, Kido bows and leaves. As he reaches the door--

                                 EMPEROR
                        Tell them we want peace.

           His voice trembles, but his face looks hopeful. Kido smiles, 
           grateful and surprised.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Truman sits opposite Stimson and the Joint Chiefs. He’s 
           leaning back in his chair, fingers steepled. 

                                 STIMSON
                             (reading from a telegram)
                        The message is through Bern in 
                        Switzerland. Comes straight from 
                        the Emperor. They’re willing to 
                        surrender if you call it a 
                        ‘negotiated peace’ rather than 
                        ‘unconditional surrender.’ And if 
                        you agree to preserve the monarchy.

                                 TRUMAN
                        No. 

                                 STIMSON
                        Sir, we could avoid a lot of 
                        bloodshed... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STIMSON (CONT'D)
                        these phrases, unconditional 
                        surrender, negotiated peace... it’s 
                        semantics, after all. 

                                 TRUMAN
                        We have an atomic bomb. We don’t 
                        need to negotiate with anybody. 

                                 JOINT CHIEF
                        And we spent two billion dollars on 
                        it. So we better fucking use it. 

                                 STIMSON
                        If I may say so, I don’t think a 
                        decision of this magnitude should 
                        be made based on pride. Or money. 

                                 TRUMAN
                        Every week, four thousand boys die 
                        in the Pacific. 

                                 STIMSON
                        We could stage a demonstration for 
                        them. A warning.

                                 TRUMAN
                        I want you to return a counter 
                        immediately. I’ll draft it myself. 

                                 STIMSON
                        Saying what?

           Truman just looks at the Joint Chief.

                                 TRUMAN
                        Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  

           The chief nods approval. Stimson throws up his hands.

                                 STIMSON
                        I’m 72 years old. I don’t have 
                        kids. It shouldn’t even matter to 
                        me. If this is the world you want 
                        your children to inherit, so be it. 

           EXT. TOKYO - SKY - DAY

           An American plane coasts high above the city. The bomb bay 
           opens and PROPAGANDA LEAFLETS drop out, fluttering down. 
                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        We call upon the government of 
                        Japan to proclaim now the 
                        unconditional surrender of all 
                        Japanese armed forces.

           EXT. TOKYO - STREET - SAME TIME

           Akira, catching one of the leaflets, folds it into an ORIGAMI 
           SWAN. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        And to provide proper and adequate 
                        assurances of their good faith in 
                        such action. The alternative for 
                        Japan is prompt and utter 
                        destruction. 

           INT. TOKYO - IMPERIAL WAR ROOM - DAY

           Another imperial war meeting with the Emperor at the head of 
           the table. 

           Yanami finishes reading the Potsdam Declaration. It was his 
           voice above. 

           He rips it into tiny shreds, disgusted. 

                                 YANAMI
                        Do they think we’ll retreat like 
                        scared rabbits?

           Nobody answers. The Emperor is frozen. Kido looks to him 
           urgently, but he says nothing. 

                                 YANAMI (CONT’D)
                        I know the Emperor is no rabbit.

           The Emperor avoids Yanami’s gaze. He appears frightened.

           Yanami slides another war order across the table. 

                                 YANAMI (CONT’D)
                        Authorization for the placement of 
                        troops in the Kyushu beach.

                                 KIDO
                        Your Majesty. Please tell us. Is 
                        this what you desire?

                                 YANAMI
                        How dare you address His Majesty--
           The Emperor, unnerved, starts to pour wax. 

                                 KIDO
                        Your Majesty, I know it is 
                        unorthodox, but please speak. You 
                        can stop this. 

           The Emperor looks at Kido, apologetic. Lowers his stamp. 

           INT. TOKYO - KIDO’S HOUSE - DAY

           Natsuko (Kido’s wife), looks on, panicked, as Kido rapidly 
           packs their belongings into suitcases. 

           Akira sits cross-legged on the floor, watching his parents.

                                 KIDO
                        You’ll be safe there. Hiroshima has 
                        been spared from the attacks. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        What if they’re saving it for 
                        something?

                                 KIDO
                        For what?

           Natsuko comes closer to her husband, speaks softly. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        Kido, why is this happening?

           Something snaps in him.

                                 KIDO
                        Because the Emperor is a coward! 

           Stunned by the blasphemy, Natsuko slaps him. 

           Akira runs to Kido’s side, hugs him. 

                                 KIDO (CONT’D)
                        Your mother’s right, Akira. I 
                        shouldn’t have said that.

           Akira looks at him, then places an arm around his mother, 
           enfolding her in their embrace.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - OPPENHEIMER’S FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           Oppenheimer and Tibbets watch as TERRIFIED SOLDIERS pack the 
           ATOMIC BOMB (oblong, 12 feet long) into a wooden crate.
           Oppenheimer suddenly turns to Tibbets. Gestures to the bomb.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        I lied. It’s perfect. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I know.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS HOUSE - MARY’S ROOM - EVENING

           A half-moon night-light illuminates Mary as she sleeps. 
           Tibbets kisses her on the forehead. Gently squeezes her 
           little hand. 

           Her eyes flicker open. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Count the moons for me. Then tell 
                        me how many you saw while I was 
                        gone.

           She nods, trying to stay awake. He stands still, watches her 
           eyes close. After a moment, he heads out.

                                 MARY  
                        Don’t forget to dump your flaps.

           He turns back, smiles.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           He picks up his suitcase, looks back at Lucy’s closed bedroom 
           door. Knocks on the door. There’s no reply. 

           INT. TOKYO - KIDO’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Kido wakes up. Looks at his wife’s side of the bed. She’s not 
           there.

           He walks through the now empty house. Finds his son’s ORIGAMI 
           SWAN on the ground. 

           INT. TRAIN - MOVING - MORNING

           Natsuko sits with her arm tight around her son. Looks out the 
           window as Japanese countryside rolls by. 
                                 AKIRA
                             (whisper)
                        When I grow up, I want to be 
                        American.

                                 NATSUKO
                        Why would you say that?

                                 AKIRA
                        I won’t say it to anyone else. I 
                        just want to marry Shirley Temple.

                                 NATSUKO
                        Akira--

                                 AKIRA
                        On the Good Ship Lollipop. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        That’s not real.

                                 AKIRA
                        I know.

           She caresses his hair. 

                                 AKIRA (CONT’D)
                        Dad isn’t going to die, is he?

           Can’t look him in the eye. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        Of course not. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - ENTRANCE - DAY 

           A PARADE OF CARS exits the compound with HEAVY POLICE 
           PROTECTION. 

           INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY

           Tibbets and Groves sit in the back of a large flatbed pickup 
           truck jostling along the dirt road.

           Groves knocks on the divider separating them from the DRIVER. 

                                 GROVES
                        Drive a little more gently, will 
                        ya? We’ve got a fragile load here. 

           In front of them is the WOODEN CRATE.
                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                             (to Tibbets)
                        Oppie named it ‘The Little Boy.’ 

           Tibbets looks out the window.

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cuz it’s littler than the one they 
                        tested. They think the fat bomb 
                        looks like Churchill and this one 
                        looks like Roosevelt. 
                             (beat)
                        May he rest in peace. 

           BOOM. The truck SUDDENLY JOLTS upwards. 

           The wooden crate LIFTS OFF THE FLOOR. When it lands, one of 
           the wooden walls comes unhinged, and the BOMB rolls out.

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - ROAD - DAY

           The truck’s tire has blown. The truck staggers forward, 
           ROLLING INTO A NEARBY DITCH, as official-looking men stream 
           out of nearby cars.

           INT. TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

           The bomb rolls back and forth, CRASHING against the side of 
           the truck. 

           Tibbets ineffectually tries to stabilize it. Groves reaches 
           for the cross around his neck. 

           When the truck’s descent into the ditch slows, the bomb 
           CAREENS towards them, landing with a THUD between their 
           boots. 

           Finally, the truck lurches to a stop. 

           The bomb lies still. 

           They look at it, expecting it to go off at any moment.

                                 GROVES
                        Jesus H. Christ. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - MORNING

           A hot, tropical island off the coast of Japan. 
           Tibbets lands a B29 onto the long runway between thatched 
           huts. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - DAY

           Two SOLDIERS draped in weapons sit next to a LARGE WOODEN 
           CRATE. They rest their beers on it, smoking.  

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - DAY

           Tibbets and his crew open the door to find a row of beds 
           covered in mosquito nets. A lazy fan blows warm air overhead. 

           Beser opens a window. They look out at the untouched jungle.

                                 BESER
                        My buddy in the 509 says there are 
                        Japs still out there. In the 
                        jungle. Fugitives from when we 
                        commandeered the island. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - DAY

           SUPER: “TWO DAYS TO MISSION”

           Tibbets and Eatherly sit in the cockpit. They’re idling on 
           the Tinian packed dirt runway.

                                 TIBBETS
                             (into headset)
                        Remember we’re just doing 
                        surveillance. A practice run. 
                        They’ll assume we’re weather planes 
                        since there are only two of us. 
                        Point is for them to get used to 
                        us.

           Lewis and Beser, in the adjacent plane, give a thumbs-up 
           through the cockpit window. 

           EXT. B29 PLANE - DAY

           Two B29s fly low over Hiroshima. 

           The city, considered one of the most beautiful in Japan, 
           stretches out below them. It’s engulfed in a green valley. 
           The HIROSHIMA CASTLE, military headquarters, juts out above 
           every other structure, most wooden with tile roofs.
           INT. B29 PLANE - SAME TIME

           Eatherly looks out the cockpit window. His tone is jaunty.

                                 EATHERLY
                        I can see them. Little black dots 
                        moving. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You can’t see shit from this 
                        height.

                                 EATHERLY
                        They all have black hair, you know.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I know.

                                 EATHERLY
                             (quiet)
                        They have no idea.

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - NIGHT

           Eatherly and the other men drink heavily, play poker. 

           Tibbets enters. With no preamble--

                                 TIBBETS
                        Tomorrow. Zero-two-thirty. 

           He turns, leaving the men astonished. 

           Eatherly chugs from the Tequila in his hand. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Our last night in the hell jungle, 
                        boys. Are we going to have some 
                        fun?

           His voice is strained. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s up for a Jap hunt?

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - NIGHT 

           Tibbets, in his hut, looks at a picture of Lucy and Mary. 
           Then climbs under the sheets. Stares at the ceiling. 
           He closes his eyes - immediately hears GUN SHOTS and 
           EXPLOSIONS, the beginnings of a flashback. His eyes pop open 
           again.

           He swats away a bug. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - JUNGLE - NIGHT 

           Eatherly, smoking, tequila in one hand, leads an expedition 
           through the jungle. 

           His flashlight glows in the dark. They’re surrounded by the 
           sounds of animals moving past them. It’s eerie. 

                                 FEREBEE
                        Didn’t we clear the island when we 
                        took it?

                                 BESER
                        Jungle’s too dense. 
                             (beat)
                        They say there are dozens of Japs 
                        out here. Whole regiments. Living 
                        in caves.

           Parsons suddenly claps his arms on Beser’s shoulders and 
           Beser JUMPS, terrified. Punches Parsons.

           They hear a rustling. Eatherly swings his flashlight around 
           wildly. He motions for the other men to stop.

           The rustling continues. Eatherly shines his light directly on 
           a clump of low-lying plants. Movement behind it. 

           A dark figure crouches behind the leaves.

                                 EATHERLY 
                        Hey! Don’t be afraid. We’ve got 
                        food. Cigarettes. 

           The leaves shake again. 

           Then, gradually, an EXHAUSTED LOOKING JAPANESE SOLDIER 
           EMERGES. His hands up. 

           Eatherly grins. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - NIGHT

           Tibbets is still unable to sleep. 

           A LOUD KNOCKING at his door. 
           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - OUTSIDE STORAGE SHED - NIGHT

           Tibbets, surrounded by his men, stands with his arms folded. 
           They’re all looking inside a supply shed at...

           The Japanese soldier, cowering in a corner. He bows down.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Don’t be fooled, Tibby. He’ll 
                        butcher us in a heartbeat. 

                                 BESER
                        Let him go, no telling who he talks 
                        to.

           Tibbets’s expression is inscrutable. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        You should be proud of us.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Give him some food and water. Then 
                        lock the door.

           He walks away. 

           Eatherly kicks the soldier in the stomach. Shoves him  
           further into the shed, then slams the door in his frightened 
           face. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - TIBBETS HUT - NIGHT

           Tibbets. Back in bed. Looks at his watch. It’s 2 AM.

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - OUTSIDE STORAGE SHED - NIGHT

           Tibbets returns. The supply closet is jammed shut with 
           crates. Eatherly is keeping “guard” -- he’s asleep with a 
           bottle of tequila in his hand. 

           Tibbets opens the door. The Japanese soldier looks up at him, 
           fearful. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Come on. Get out of here. 

           He gestures into the night.

           The Japanese soldier walks out, wary. As he passes Tibbets, 
           his eyes glint in the dark. 
           He suddenly GRABS TIBBETS’S GUN. As he fumbles to use it, 
           Tibbets slams him to the ground. 

           They struggle with each other. 

           Eatherly wakes up. Reaches for his gun and aims -- but the 
           men are rolling too fast for a clear shot. 

           Tibbets slams his elbow into the Japanese soldier’s neck. The 
           gun clatters out of his hand. 

           Then Tibbets knees him in the groin. Stomach. Chest.  He’s 
           clearly overpowered him, but aware of Eatherly’s gaze, 
           Tibbets continues KICKING him. It’s gratuitous. 

           He doesn’t want to be this guy, but feels he has to be. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        FUCKING JAP. 

           Eatherly watches, in shock. 

           Tibbets shoves the soldier back into the closet. Slams the 
           door shut. 

           Stands there, heaving. Eatherly says nothing. 

           Tibbets stalks back to his hut without another word. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - NIGHT

           Still breathing hard, Tibbets falls back on the bed. Eyes 
           open. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - SUPPORT HUT - LATER

           Tibbets shakes awake a MECHANIC, dozing with other 
           technicians in a hut. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           The mechanic, barely awake, looks at a PIECE of PAPER handed 
           to him by Tibbets.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Below the nose. 

           The mechanic nods. Drags over a bucket of RED PAINT.
           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HUT - SAME TIME

           Quietly and somberly, the crew rises from their few hours of 
           sleep. 

           They begin making beds, putting on boots, strapping coveralls 
           over shirts and undershirts. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           A CREW of SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS and SOLDIERS guide the ATOMIC 
           BOMB (now on a trolley) into the bay of the open B29. Sharp 
           floodlights illuminate the scene. 

           Fire trucks and ambulances position themselves at even 
           intervals along the length of the runway.

           Tibbets watches the preparations somberly. He sees his crew 
           walking towards him, dark shapes in the night.  

           He nods as they arrive, saluting.

           Beser points to the nose. The words “ENOLA GAY” freshly 
           painted. 

                                 BESER
                        Enola Gay?

                                 TIBBETS
                        Enola Gay Haggard is my mother’s 
                        name.
                             (beat)
                        Anyone have a problem with that?

           Eatherly smirks, but nobody says a word. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - NIGHT

           The crew crowds the catwalks that line the walls of the bomb 
           bay. The bomb is now attached via an elaborate 24-wire 
           interface to an electric console. 

           Eatherly WRITES on the surface of the bomb with a marker. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Your Majesty, Emperor Hirohito. 
                        Fuck You.

           He passes the marker to the next man, who draws a PENIS.
           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - MESS HALL / HUT - NIGHT

           The men quietly eat breakfast. Tibbets doesn’t touch his. 

                                 PARSONS
                        You gonna give a pep talk, boss?

           Tibbets stands. Looks at all of them. Takes a deep breath, as 
           if he’s about to embark on a moving speech-- 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Don’t eat too much. We can’t afford 
                        the extra weight. 

           He walks out. That was it. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           As they walk down the runway, they see HUNDREDS OF 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS and a VIDEO CREW standing outside the two B29 
           planes (the second is for Eatherly and his back-up crew).  

           Groves greets the men with a grin. 

                                 GROVES
                        I hope you realize you’re going to 
                        be famous. Whether you live or not. 

           He claps Tibbets on the shoulder. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        What the hell is all this, General?

                                 GROVES
                        I arranged a little send off for 
                        you boys. Now smile for our guests. 

           As they walk down a narrow path, almost like a red carpet, 
           the photographers yell for their attention. 

           Tibbets, deeply uncomfortable, offers a timid smile. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Hey! Look like you’re thinking 
                        about what you’re about to do. Like 
                        you feel the full weight of it.

           Tibbets grits his teeth, but can’t help but comply. It is 
           what he’s thinking about. 

           Groves, on the other hand, poses for multiple pictures, 
           grinning, basking in the attention. 
           Tibbets quietly takes him by the arm. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Get them out of here. 

                                 GROVES
                        Tibbets--

                                 TIBBETS
                        Now. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - NIGHT

           The press are gone. Groves, Tibbets and the crew watch as the 
           bomb bay slowly closes its doors. 

           A CHAPLAIN nervously approaches. 

                                 CHAPLAIN 
                        General Groves. You asked me to 
                        read a homily before flight.

                                 GROVES
                        Yes, yes, Father. Make it quick. 

           The Chaplain pulls out an ENVELOPE, reads from hastily 
           scrawled notes on the back of it. 

                                 CHAPLAIN
                        Almighty Father, Who wilt hear the 
                        prayer of them that love Thee, we 
                        pray Thee to be with those who 
                        brave the heights of Thy heaven and 
                        who carry the battle to our 
                        enemies. Guard and protect them--

                                 GROVES
                             (bored)
                        Okay, that’s terrific. 

           He pats the Chaplain on the back. Tibbets, trying to hold on, 
           watches as he’s ushered away. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s keep it moving.

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT / MID SECTION / TAIL GUN - NIGHT

           CHYRON: 2:40 AM

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:
           - Caron squeezes into the tail gunner compartment. Pulls on a 
           Brooklyn Dodger’s cap. 

           - Beser straps on a survival vest with fish hooks, a drinking-
           water kit, first aid package, emergency food rations, 
           parachute harness and a one-man life raft. Parsons watches 
           this elaborate process, amused. He’s wearing only coveralls. 

           - Tibbets and Eatherly sit in the pilot and copilot seats, 
           flipping switches, performing final checks. Tibbets opens a 
           small metal box containing five cyanide pills. He takes one 
           and puts it in a vest pocket. Then passes the box to 
           Eatherly, who does the same. 

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Lucy hears a KNOCK at the door, freezes. Then walks bravely 
           to the door. Opens it. 

           Dora reaches out a hand-- 

                                 DORA
                        We don’t know each other. I’m from 
                        beyond the fence. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dora and Lucy sit opposite each other on couches. 

           Mary lacks her usual enthusiasm as she plays with her toy 
           plane. 

                                 DORA
                        He was trying to save me. From the 
                        mission. Which is really fucking 
                        annoying. 

           Noticing Mary--

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. 

                                 LUCY
                        That’s what men like him do. They 
                        try to save us. And everyone. 

           Dora nods. Lucy seems less angry now. Just sad. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t say goodbye this time. 

           Dora takes her hand. 
                                 DORA
                        It doesn’t matter. He knows you’re 
                        always with him. 

                                 LUCY
                        Maybe I don’t want to be. 

           Dora studies her. Then, quietly--

                                 DORA
                        First he’ll take a deep breath. 
                        Then he’ll start the number three 
                        engine. Then four. Then one and 
                        two. 

           Mary looks up, she’s listening.

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           The B29 sits at the base of the runway. 

           As Tibbets fires up the plane, Dora’s voice carries over.  

                                 DORA (O.S.)
                        The rush... when you feel the plane 
                        buzzing beneath you. It’s hard to 
                        describe. 

                                 TIBBETS
                             (into intercom)
                        This is Dimples Eight-two to North 
                        Tinian Tower. Ready for taxi out 
                        and takeoff instructions. 

                                 RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
                        Tower to Dimples Eight-two. Clear 
                        to taxi. Take off on runway A for 
                        Able. 

           The plane rolls forward. 

                                 DORA (O.S.)
                        Now the take-off weight is 150,000 
                        pounds. He has to hold the bomber 
                        on the ground until the last moment 
                        to build up every possible knot of 
                        speed before lift off. He needs to 
                        get to 2550 RPM before pulling the 
                        nose up. 

           The scenery outside begins to hurtle past. Ambulances and

                        Your heart is in your throat. 
                        Adrenaline pulsing through your 
                        body. You know you’re about to defy 
                        gravity. It’s the best part. It’s 
                        the worst part. 

           The edge of the runway, where it falls off into the ocean, 
           approaches. Deep black beyond. The RPM dial nears 2000.

                                 LUCY (O.S.)
                        I hope they can’t take off. Ever.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Lift it up. Now! Or we’re going to 
                        submarine--

           The edge is even closer now. But something feels wrong. 

           SUDDENLY TIBBETS SLAMS THE BRAKES. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           The plane machinery SCREECHES as the massive aircraft strains 
           to slow down. 

           The edge of the runway rapidly approaches. 

           Just in time, the wheels stop rolling. Inches from the edge.

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           The plane is back at the base of the runway. Tibbets stands 
           outside the fuel tank with a crowd of TECHNICIANS. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Take out 400 gallons. We won’t make 
                        it with all the extra weight. 

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        That means one pass on Hiroshima. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I know what it means. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           Again, Tibbets and his crew hurtle down the runway. The black 
           edge looms ahead. 
           The RPM dial pushes up to 2300... 2400...

           The edge getting closer and closer. 2500. 

           Tibbets pulls back on the control wheel. 

           The plane lifts into the air. Eatherly exhales. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dora and Lucy watch silently as Mary lifts her plane into the 
           air. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - NIGHT 

           Tibbets breathes a measured sigh of relief as the aircraft 
           breaks above cloud level. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Five hours until we’re there.

                        Poker?

           Tibbets shakes his head. Eatherly reads the stress on his 
           face. It’s beginning to affect him too. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        When was the last time you slept?

                                 TIBBETS
                        It’s been a while. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - SAME TIME

           Parsons arms the bomb. His sleeves are rolled up, hands and 
           forearms covered in black graphite. 

           He reads off a piece of paper taped to the bomb, a checklist. 

                                 PARSONS
                        Ensure green plugs are installed. 
                        Check. Remove rear plate. Okay. 
                        Remove armor plate. Got it. Insert 
                        breech wrench in breech plug. 
                        Yep...

           Beser is lying on the catwalk. Napping. 
           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Dawn breaks. Tibbets and Eatherly watch in silence as the sun 
           crests the horizon. The sky gradually turns from black to a 
           deep pink. The moon remains, a pale ghost. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA BASE - SAME TIME

           SUPER: “HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE”

           Admiral Yanami, on a white horse with black fetlocks, enters 
           the air force base, riding fast between black and yellow 
           planes.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA CASTLE - COURTYARD - SAME TIME

           SUPER: “HIROSHIMA CASTLE”

           Miles away, in the heart of the city, troops in the castle 
           courtyard wait, motionless, for the signal to begin morning 
           calisthenics. When it comes, they instantly fall into 
           formation, moving fluently, as one. All except a handful of 
           stragglers. Closer, we see these men are blindfolded. They 
           are AMERICAN POWs. Though malnourished and sleep deprived, 
           they are forced to keep up with the demanding pace. 

           INT. HIROSHIMA - APARTMENT - MORNING

           Natsuko, Kido’s wife, wakes up in their small apartment. She 
           looks at her son, Akira, curled up next to her. 

           They are surrounded by unpacked boxes. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - MORNING

           Natsuko and Akira walk down the already bustling street, 
           passing a German priest, a doctor in whites, a crowd of 
           schoolgirls in uniform, neighbors in kimonos. 

           They stop at a food cart. The offerings are meager. She 
           sighs. 

           Suddenly an AIR RAID SIREN blares. Everyone looks up at it. 
           The FOOD VENDOR shakes his head. 

                                 VENDOR
                             (sighing)
                        Every morning.  
           Business continues as usual, the people accustomed to daily 
           false alarms. 

           Down the street, Natsuko watches as an anxious MAN IN A GREY 
           KIMONO leads his family into an underground shelter. 

           INT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

           Yanami, accompanied by lower level lieutenants and generals, 
           stands over a RADAR OPERATOR frowning at a radar screen. 

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        30 bombers to the Inland Sea. 65 to

                             (beat)
                        And two for Hiroshima.

                                 YANAMI
                        Just two?

           The operator nods. 

                                 YANAMI (CONT’D)
                        Strange.

                                 RADAR OPERATOR
                        Probably just weather planes. Not 
                        worth the bullets. 

           Yanami mulls on this. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - SAME TIME

           Parsons continues reading off the checklist as he arms the 
           bomb. 

                                 PARSONS
                        Unscrew breech plug, place on 
                        rubber pad. Insert charge, four 
                        sections, red ends to breech.

           This is the most important step. He pours gunpowder into the 
           bomb. Then replaces the green plugs with red plugs. 

           Forgets one of the plugs -- quickly catches his mistake, 
           laughing nervously. 

                                 PARSONS (CONT’D)
                             (repeating)
                        Red ends to breech. 
           Then wipes sweat off his forehead. The black comes off, 
           darkening his skin. 

                                 PARSONS (CONT’D)
                        Insert breech plug and tighten 
                        home. Connect firing line. Install 
                        armor plate. Install rear plate. 

           He finishes.

           Beser, down the tube between the forward and mid-section, 
           hears him. Yells into the cockpit...

                        We’re five miles out.

                        And we have no fucking guns on

           He shakes his head.

                        Thank you, Colonel Tibbets.

                        Either way, the bomb goes off. If

                        staying here in this cardboard box 
                        that is not my home. 

           Akira looks up at her, sees the sadness in her eyes.

                                 AKIRA
                        Maybe we can find a park?

           Tibbets opens his mouth to say something when the plane is 
           HIT BY A BARRAGE OF BULLETS AND FLAK FROM BELOW. 
           It rocks in place. Monitors light up. Tibbets quickly grabs 
           the control wheel. 

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - SAME TIME

           Parsons watches with horror as bullets dent the metal of the 
           bomb bay. The bomb remains undisturbed. For now. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - CONTROL HUT - SAME TIME

           The radio suddenly powers down, silencing the chaotic voices. 
           Groves stands, furious. Grabs the radio and throws it against 
           the wall. 

                                 GROVES
                        Get me another fucking radio!

           Tibbets struggles to keep the plane aloft as bullets dent the 
           windshield, threatening to shred it entirely. 

                                 FEREBEE (O.S.)
                        Sir, we are running out of time. 

           Eatherly reaches over to grab the intercom, but Tibbets 
           blocks him. Speaks with authority.

                        Begin auto synchronization. Now! 

           Now he lets Eatherly take it.

                        And make it fucking fast. Because

           The windshield SPLINTERS.

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - BOMB BAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Parsons, strapped into a chair, watches the bomb bay doors 
           FLY OPEN. Bullets pour in, narrowly missing him. He takes 
           cover on a catwalk. 

           The MASSIVE BLACK BOMB detaches like clockwork from its 
           electric console.

           The bomb slides off the restraining hook - BUT NOT ALL THE 
           WAY. It remains hanging on. It’s caught.
           Parsons, thinking quick, unscrews the metal door to a nearby 
           control panel. Then runs toward the restraining hook, using 
           the door as a shield. Bullets rain around him, bouncing off 
           the metal. The bomb is still perched there, buoyed by the 
           wind. 

           Parsons reaches out, fingers straining, slowly pushes the 
           bomb clutch off the hook. Inch by inch, until...

           IT BARRELS OUT into the beautiful dawn sky. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - MORNING

           The bomb hurls through the air, moving irregularly due to its 
           oblong shape.

           Ferebee watches through Plexiglas as it tumbles away from 
           them.

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           The plane elevates ten feet, suddenly lighter by 9,000 
           pounds. 

           Tibbets maneuvers the plane into a 155-degree angle. Guns the 
           throttle. 

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - TAIL GUN - MORNING

           Caron is pushed against the wall of the turret by g-forces 
           from the sharp turn. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - SKY - MORNING

           As the bomb plummets towards the ground, it gives off a small 
           puff of smoke.

           INSIDE THE BOMB

           The core of uranium hurtles toward the sphere of reactor 
           uranium at the tip. Closer. And closer. 

           INT. HIROSHIMA - APARTMENT - MORNING

           Natsuko waits as Akira searches for crackers in his knapsack 
           under the bed. She glances at the clock on the wall. 8:15AM. 
                                 NATSUKO
                        Akira--

           Suddenly a blinding FLASH OF WHITE. 

           In eerie silence, the mattress lifts off the ground, Akira 
           underneath. 

           For a millisecond, he looks up at his mother, terrified.

           The entire room leans backwards, slowly, then suddenly 
           explodes, folding in on itself. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA CASTLE - COURTYARD - SAME TIME

           The thousands of soldiers performing calisthenics look up as 
           a WHITE FLASH sweeps over them. 

           All catch fire and EVAPORATE, turning into wisps of steam. 

           The PILLARS at the front gate of Hiroshima Castle PLUNGE INTO 
           THE GROUND. 

           The Castle crumbles behind it. Stone blocks MELT. A soaring 
           bird ignites into flames. 

           INT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - CONTROL STATION - SAME TIME

           As Yanami stares at the radar screen, every window behind him 
           SHATTERS. 

           The glass fragments BLOW FORWARD, instantly skewering and 
           killing WORKERS. 

           A man standing by the window is LIFTED UP and IMPALED ON a 
           POLE waving the Japanese flag. 

           Yanami, fortunately positioned between two windows, is 
           spared. 

           The only other living person in the room stands, holding out 
           his right hand. It’s quivering with tiny shards of glass, 
           like a porcupine. A WOODEN BEAM flies through the now open 
           window, killing him. 

           Yanami flattens himself against the wall to avoid flying 
           debris. 
           EXT. HIROSHIMA - SKY - MORNING

           Above Hiroshima, a WHITE-HOT SPHERE with a diameter of 
           several miles hangs in the sky. 

           Around it, the air shimmers with intense heat. It’s spectral, 
           silent. 

           And slowly expanding, a bubble about to pop. 

           Eighty thousand people have already died from the heat and 
           radiation. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING 

           The cockpit is lit up brilliantly by light from the 
           explosion. 

           Tibbets, flying the plane away from Hiroshima as fast as he 
           can, can’t see any detail of the explosions. Only clouds lie 
           in his view. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Three miles.

                                 EATHERLY
                        Shit. That’s slower than the 
                        simulations.

           Tibbets nods, trying to remain calm.

                                 TIBBETS
                        The bomb is about to reach full 
                        radius.

           EXT. B29 PLANE - MOVING - SAME TIME

           The plane hurtles through the air, chased by the white rim of 
           the explosion.  

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Tibbets, sweating, guns the throttle. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Come on... Come on...

           He leans forward. Tense. 
           EXT. B29 PLANE - MOVING - SAME TIME

           Just as it looks like the plane will be consumed, the 
           explosion suddenly recoils. 

           The plane breaks away, finally clearing a gap. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING 

           Tibbets starts breathing again as Eatherly cheers, hoarse and 
           terrified. 

           Lights flash all around them, then they feel the EXPLOSION. 

           INT. B29 PLANE - TAIL GUN - MORNING

           Caron, pressed into the tail gun, which faces out the back of 
           the plane, stares wide-eyed. 

           The ball has turned into a fiery red pillar of dust, smoke 
           and fire. Gradually it’s overtaken by a massive MUSHROOM 
           SHAPE that shoots up into the sky, far above them. Bigger 
           than the mind can fathom. Bigger than anything you’ve seen in 
           superhero movies. 

                                 CARON
                        Sir. You have to see this. 

           A RING OF WIND suddenly expands out of the explosion. A shock-
           wave. It travels toward Caron at the speed of light. He 
           barely has time to open his mouth before the plane JOLTS 
           UPWARD.

           INT. B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - SAME TIME

           The plane is rocked by the shock-wave. 

           Tibbets carefully recovers their position. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        We’re free now. That was the last 
                        of it. 

           Tibbets breathes deeply. Closes his eyes. Exhales. Then they 
           burst wide open.

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m turning around. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        What?
                                 TIBBETS
                        I need to see it. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        You told us not to look.

                                 TIBBETS
                        My father was an asshole. But he 
                        used to say, You don’t shoot a man 
                        in the back. 

           EXT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - SKY - MORNING

           Tibbets turns the plane around so it hovers before the 
           massive cloud pulsing with color.

           Like a mosquito facing a bull. 

           Tibbets and his crew look up. The cloud seems to never end. 
           It rises 45,000 feet into the air, three miles above them. 

           As the mushroom continues to expand, the city is briefly 
           revealed below. Burnt. Charred. Decimated. Only a single 
           structure survives -- the dome that will become known as the 
           A-dome. 

           As flashes of light play across their faces, Tibbets and 
           Eatherly stare, awestruck. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - MORNING

           It’s dark. Dust fills the air. Natsuko’s apartment building 
           is charred rubble. 

           The rubble begins to shift as Natsuko slowly inches her way 
           out. 

           Half her face -- the part of her turned toward the window -- 
           is burnt black, seeping with a pale yellow fluid. 

           She yells, panicked, for her son. Hears and sees nothing in 
           the whipping, dark dust. 

           She starts digging through the rubble, freezes when she sees 
           an UNLACED SHOE. Then grabs it, starts pulling. 

           A MAN - the one in the grey kimono she saw earlier -- appears 
           out of nowhere, begins helping her. He’s grabbing his belly 
           with one hand, but uses the other as best he can. The shoe 
           falls off into Natsuko’s hands.
           INT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING 

           Yanami stumbles through the wreckage and devastation. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - CONTINUOUS

           As Yanami steps outside, we see the base is several miles 
           from the heart of the explosion. 

           From his perspective, he can see the entire city has been 
           leveled. There is no building still standing. He falls to his 
           knees. 

           A nearby gas tank, superheated, SUDDENLY ROCKETS MILES INTO 
           THE AIR. He watches it rise -- then spots a plane. A black 
           dot in the sky. Miles and miles away. He stares at it, 
           knowing. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - MORNING

           Natsuko and the MAN succeed in pulling out Akira. He’s pale, 
           unresponsive. Bleeding profusely from a gash in his head. She 
           looks at her son -- half his head is caved in. 

           She bursts into tears. 

           Then scoops him into her arms, holds him against her chest. 
           The man takes her arm with his free one, leads her through 
           the apocalyptic nightmare before them. We see the entire 
           street is missing, erased. The asphalt glows red hot. A 
           pillar of purple and red fire rises from the center of the 
           explosion. 

           As the dust swirls and clears, slats of sunlight peak in, 
           suddenly illuminating the gruesome scene. They are surrounded 
           by voices crying out from beneath the rubble, more people 
           trapped. Dying. 

                                 MAN
                        We must go to Asano Park. There is 
                        a medical station there. They can 
                        help your son. 

           Natsuko nods. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        What happened to your family?

           The man doesn’t answer. Just leads her firmly with one hand, 
           the other still clutching his belly. 

           Natsuko stares wide-eyed as they pass:
           A teenage girl, shuffling slowly, her hair on fire. 

           A man with MELTED eyes, PUS LEAKING DOWN HIS FACE. He looked 
           directly at the bomb.

           A pink horse quivers, strips of flesh hang off it, a common 
           effect of radiation. It’s scared and dying. It whines 
           pitifully. A cat, hair frayed, licks the pink flesh, curious. 

           Two men carry a PORTRAIT OF THE EMPEROR. Others bow and 
           salute it, some yelling out scattered entreaties, others 
           praying in silence. 

           An OLD MAN being carried by TWO WOMEN screams out. They 
           release him. He gestures for them to continue onward. When 
           they do, reluctantly, he gets up and runs back into a FLAMING 
           HOUSE. 

           Teenage girls trapped underneath a massive concrete barricade 
           SING the national anthem. Their voices trembling. 

           Piles and piles of bodies. Struck dead where they stood when 
           the bomb flashed. Charred, mutilated. Many we recognize from 
           the previous street scene.

           BLACK DROPS BEGIN TO FALL. The size of marbles. The rain as 
           thick as oil. Natsuko strains under the weight of her son, 
           her hair matted.  

           Suddenly the man PULLS HER TO THE GROUND. A wind carrying 
           panes of glass, eerily preserved, sweeps past where she stood 
           only moments before. 

           She gets up. The man remains on the ground. The hand 
           clutching his belly falls away. A long coil of bowel hangs 
           out, glistening in the spare light. He smiles beatifically, 
           then goes limp.  

           Natsuko screams, horrified, as she watches him die. 

           She backs away... then starts running. Akira bounces 
           lifelessly in her arms, his blood covering her clothes. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

           Yanami walks past dead bodies scattered across the runways. 
           He sees a SOLDIER, black and bleeding. But still alive. 

           He shouts in Japanese at him. We don’t understand the words. 
           But he’s pointing at one of the planes, then up at the sky. 
           The soldier, nodding, stumbles toward the nearby plane. It’s 
           a small fighter. Bent like a banana. All the glass blown out. 
           Tail twisted. Nose bent. 

           Yanami continues to yell. The soldier struggles into the 
           cockpit. Presses the starter button. 

           It somehow fires to life. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - RIVER - MORNING

           Natsuko stumbles, still carrying Akira, toward the bank of a 
           river, one of the seven shallow tributaries that course 
           through Hiroshima. 

           A sign that reads ASANO PARK is submerged into the silt of 
           the opposite bank. She can’t make out whether the park has 
           survived the devastation -- she can only see a few feet in 
           front of her with the blowing dust and rain -- but she pushes 
           blindly forward, wading into the river.

           It quickly comes up to her neck. She struggles, gasping for 
           breath, pushes Akira’s head above the water. His face is now 
           blue.  

           Her arms suddenly give way, and Akira is swept out of her 
           grasp. The wind pushes his floating body down the river. She 
           screams, fighting the wind and the flow to reach him. 

           She struggles, until finally, her outstretched hand is within 
           inches of his. He’s being sucked into the current, but she 
           manages to grip his hand tightly, pulling him back to her. 

           Then, to her horror, the skin of his entire hand comes off in 
           hers -- like a glove being pulled off. 

           A final gust of wind propels his body away from her. 

           She tries again to reach him, but...

           A CYCLONE is building in the east, whipping towards her. The 
           wind is laced with FIRE.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

           Yanami stands at the base of the runway, screaming. 

           INT. JAPANESE PLANE - MORNING

           The soldier, terrified, maneuvers the airplane slowly down 
           the runway. Wind rushes into the open cockpit.
           He passes blackened and burnt men walking aimlessly on the 
           tarmac.

           The plane rises three feet into the air, then crashes back 
           onto the asphalt.

           The soldier BELLOWS into the wind, his hand on the 
           accelerator.

           He yanks on the control wheel. The plane lifts into the air. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - RIVER - MORNING

           As the wind-fire approaches, Natsuko DIVES underwater. 

           Just as she does, a bright orange light skims the surface.

           She bursts up after it passes. Spots her son, floating on the 
           aft side of a small wooden boat. He’s face up. The boat 
           protected him from the fire. It looks like he’s sleeping. 

           She reaches him, grabs him around the waist, then, using her 
           free hand, tries to lift herself onto the boat. It threatens 
           to capsize.

           Finally, she clambers onboard. Pulls her son into her arms.

           She looks around. The boat is crowded with corpses, blistered 
           and bloated like Slotin. Frozen in poses from their time of 
           death. All of them looking up at something in the sky. A 
           strange tableau. 

           Ignoring them, Natsuko tries paddling the boat forward with 
           her hand. It turns in useless circles.

           A long stalk of BAMBOO floats by. She grabs it. Uses it as a 
           punt, driving it into the soil below to push the boat 
           forward.  

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Tibbets continues to stare, transfixed. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Let’s get the fuck out of here.  

           His hands are shaking. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        One more minute. 
                                 BESER (O.S.)
                        We’ve got something coming towards 
                        us. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - SKY - MORNING

           Below them, the Japanese soldier in his mangled plane is 
           flying higher and higher. 

           INT. JAPANESE PLANE - SAME TIME

           The soldier spots the massive B29 hovering above. 

           With a SCREAM, he aims and activates his guns. But they’re 
           bent, useless. Nothing fires. 

           The engine sputters. The last puff of endurance from the 
           little aircraft is beginning to dissipate. 

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Tibbets looks out at the tiny Japanese plane, falling from 
           the sky.

           He locks eyes with the pilot, as in his flashback. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Let’s go--

                                 TIBBETS
                        He’s done.  

           The Japanese plane is suddenly sucked into the massive cloud 
           of dust and fire.  

           INT. JAPANESE PLANE - MORNING

           The soldier coughs as the aircraft fills with black soot. He 
           struggles to stay upright. Then the little plane is consumed 
           by fire. 

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Tibbets watches quietly. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        It’s time to go. 

           He turns the plane, slowly. 
           EXT. HIROSHIMA - RIVER BANK - MORNING

           The boat lands in the bank close to Asano Park. 

           Natsuko lifts her son, stumbles over a charred tree sprawled 
           across the darkened water. She sees a group of injured taking 
           shelter beneath a collapsed bridge.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - ASANO PARK - MORNING

           Natsuko walks into Asano Park. Designed as a leisure spot for 
           the rich -- small pools and eddies, moon bridges -- and 
           largely preserved from the devastation of the bomb by the 
           stone house that shelters it. 

           There are crowds of people, burnt and injured like herself. 
           Many vomiting as radiation poisoning sets in. 

           A woman lies sprawled on the moon bridge, facing towards the 
           sky. It’s unclear if she’s dead or alive. 

           A man in a white coat sits wearily in front of a long line of 
           injured. A small black bag beside him. 

           Natsuko rushes forward with her son, bypassing the line.

                                 NATSUKO
                        Please, please, my son. 

           She lays Akira on the grass. The doctor looks at him with 
           stone eyes. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        He’s dead. Only the wounded. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        No! That’s not true!

           She drops to the ground, touching her son’s face, cradling 
           him. He’s completely still. In complete shock, she runs her 
           hands through her hair - the hair falls away, like it was 
           never attached to her scalp. There’s hair everywhere, falling 
           off everyone - another effect of radiation. 

           A NURSE in tattered white clothes pulls her away, wrapping 
           her in a blanket. Natsuko holds onto Akira. Won’t let go as 
           the nurse tries to gently pry him out of her arms. 

                                 NURSE
                        Some water. 

           She passes a flask with a long hollowed grass straw. 
           Instead of taking a sip, Natsuko puts the stem inside her 
           son’s mouth. 

                                 NATSUKO
                        Drink, Akira. Drink. 

           The nurse lets Natsuko be, respectful of her grief.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

           Yanami watches as the B29 races away, far above him. 

           He curses the sky. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - ASANO PARK - MORNING 

           Natsuko, still holding her son, looks up. There’s a commotion 
           at the entrance to the park.  

           An AMERICAN PRISONER OF WAR - a fugitive from one of the 
           destroyed prisons -- stumbles towards them. He’s badly burnt, 
           but still moving. 

                                 AMERICAN POW
                        Peace. I come in peace. I’m... I’m 
                        injured.

           He doesn’t know Japanese, but tries to communicate his good 
           intentions with gestures. 

           He collapses near the end of the line of wounded. 

           Several of the Japanese stand. They pick up stones, fallen 
           debris, long bamboo poles. 

           Natsuko, understanding, carefully lays Akira on the ground, 
           covering him with the blanket.

           Despite their injuries, the others begin to stone the 
           American POW, yelling epithets and insults. 

           Natsuko watches at first. Then picks up a large stone, is 
           about to HURL IT when her eyes meet his. They are frozen in a 
           shared moment of horror and despair. She clenches the stone 
           tightly, then drops it on the ground. As if the future of 
           humanity depended on it. 

           A STONE from the woman next to her lands on the POW’s face, 
           cracking it open. 
           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           The plane rushes toward Tinian. Bleary-eyed, Tibbets looks at 
           Eatherly, who is still stunned, oddly quiet. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Take my place. 

           Eatherly looks at him, questioning. 

           Eatherly takes over as he clambers back into the forward and 
           mid-sections, passing Beser, who says nothing. 

           Then he maneuvers feet-first into the 30-foot long tube that 
           connects the mid-section and tail gun. Lies in the tight 
           cocoon, with a diameter of only 20 inches. And promptly falls 
           asleep for the first time in thirty hours. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - MIDSECTION / COCKPIT - MORNING

           Hands tug on Tibbets’s feet, which stick out into the mid-
           section. 

                                 BESER
                        Wake up, Sir. 

           Tibbets’s eyes open. 

           An orange rolls down the tube above his head. 

                                 PARSONS (O.S.)
                        Breakfast.

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - AIR BASE - DAY

           The aircraft lands on the B29 runway where a massive 
           welcoming party awaits.

           Groves stands at the head of the crowd, bursting with pride.

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - MESS HALL / HUT - DAY

           The mess hall is crowded with soldiers and attractive nurses 
           from the island hospital. 

           There is lemonade, beer, hot dogs, cold cuts, potato salad. 
           More food than the soldiers have seen in four years. People 
           are dancing, hugging each other, celebrating.
           Tibbets makes his way to a table labeled “PIE EATING 
           CONTEST.” He watches as Eatherly and Lewis scarf down apple 
           pie with their hands tied behind their back. 

           Eatherly finishes first and looks up, pie filling dripping 
           down his face. 

           He whoops it up, celebrating his victory. His expression 
           bordering on psychotic. Like a screw has just come loose.

                                 EATHERLY
                        I win! I fucking win!
                             (beat)
                        Who’s next?

           Tibbets catches his gaze, sees the pain behind the mania. 

           INT. TINIAN ISLAND - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Hours later. Eatherly lies in a hospital bed, vomiting into a 
           bedpan. His skin is a pale yellow. A doctor looks between him 
           and Tibbets, sitting slumped in a nearby chair. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m worried about him. He drank so 
                        much his liver shut down. 

           Tibbets nods. 

           Eatherly starts laughing. It’s crazed. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Doctor... we killed a thousand... a 
                        hundred million... Japs today. 
                             (to Tibbets)
                        Did you already tell him that?

           Tibbets doesn’t respond. Eatherly’s expression rapidly 
           cycles. He now looks deeply morose. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        Their little black Jap heads.

           Then he starts laughing again. 

                                 EATHERLY (CONT’D)
                        We looked Hell right in the face. 
                        It’s purple. Hell is purple. 
                        Orange. Red.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Thank you, Doctor. 
           The doctor nods, exits. Eatherly grabs Tibbets’s arm. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        How do you... do the math? Groves 
                        says we killed a hundred thousand. 
                        Pearl was 2500. But the war-- 
                        that’s millions of theirs. And 
                        millions of ours. So who’s beating 
                        who?

           And then he starts sobbing like a child. He curls up into a 
           fetal position. Looks to Tibbets, desperate for comfort. 

           But Tibbets backs away. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Pull yourself together. 

           Eatherly looks hurt, alone in his pain and confusion. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        They deserved it. You said so 
                        yourself. 

                                 EATHERLY
                        Does anyone deserve that?

           Tibbets stares at him.

                                 TIBBETS
                        You think we just bombed a bunch of 
                        saints?

                                 EATHERLY
                        I know we were too far away-- but I 
                        see their faces. I do. I see them.

                                 TIBBETS
                        No. You don’t. 

           Tibbets is nearly shouting now.

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        All you saw was a fucking cloud. 

           INT. USS AUGUSTA - MESS HALL - DAY

           Truman dines with sailors on the USS Augusta, at sea on his 
           way home from the Potsdam Conference.

           Stimson approaches, whispers something in his ear. 
           The president immediately taps his glass to get the room’s 
           attention. Stands. 

                                 TRUMAN
                        I’m about to tell you the greatest 
                        thing in history. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS FOYER - DAY

           Lucy opens the front door. Sees the New York Times lying on 
           the porch. 

           The front page stares up at her. “FIRST ATOMIC BOMB DROPPED 
           ON JAPAN. MISSILE EQUAL TO 20,000 TONS OF TNT. TRUMAN WARNS 
           FOE OF A ‘RAIN OF RUIN.’ 

           She just stares back. Then, slowly, picks it up. As she 
           reads, an actual Truman radio recording plays...

                                 TRUMAN (V.O.)
                        The Japanese have seen what our 
                        atomic bomb can do. They can 
                        foresee what it will do in the 
                        future. 

           EXT. TINIAN ISLAND - RUNWAY - MORNING

           Tibbets’s plane takes off. Returning home. 

           INT. TIBBETS’S B29 PLANE - COCKPIT - MORNING

           Tibbets looks at the slowly shrinking piece of land in the 
           vast blue Pacific. 

                                 TRUMAN (V.O.)
                        We have used the bomb against those 
                        who attacked us without warning at 
                        Pearl Harbor...

           INT. TOKYO - KIDO’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Back in Tokyo. Kido holds a rice ball between chopsticks for 
           his wife.  

           She turns away, won’t eat anything. Her burn is violent red.

                                 TRUMAN (V.O.)
                        ... against those who starved, 
                        tortured and executed American 
                        prisoners of war. 
           REVERSE TO SEE:

           She’s looking at her son’s ORIGAMI SWAN. On the other end of 
           the table, where Kido left it. 

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - BASE - EVENING

           The plane idles on the runway. The crew emerges, greets their 
           spouses, friends and family members.

           Tibbets looks for Lucy and Mary. They’re not there.

                                 TRUMAN (V.O.)
                        We have used it in order to shorten 
                        the agony of war, in order to save 
                        the lives of thousands and 
                        thousands of young Americans. 

           Tibbets finds Dora. 

           She just looks at him. Shakes her head. 

                                 DORA
                        With her sister. In Colorado.

           INT. LOS ALAMOS - TIBBETS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tibbets, alone, listens to the radio. 

                                 TRUMAN (V.O.)
                        Only a Japanese surrender will stop 
                        us.

           He turns it off, unsettled. Looks around the empty house. 

           EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS - SISTER’S HOUSE - MORNING 

           Tibbets, now in civilian clothes, hat in hand, walks up to a 
           small bungalow. Knocks on the door. 

           LUCY’S SISTER answers. 

                                 SISTER
                        She doesn’t want to see you. 

           She closes the door in his face. 

           He stands there a moment. Looks at the front bay windows, the 
           curtains closed. 
           INT. COLORADO SPRINGS AIR FORCE BASE - TIBBETS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tibbets is back in his old Colorado Springs housing unit, 
           where we began. Mary and Lucy’s belongings still there. 

           His sleeves rolled up, he sits with the phone to his ear. 
           Willing Lucy to answer. She doesn’t. 

           A KNOCK. His eyes start open. He quickly moves to the door, 
           opens it. 

           Lucy is there. With Mary. 

           Mary, shrieking, runs into her father’s arms. He hugs her 
           tightly. 

           Lucy hands Mary her flowered knapsack.

                                 LUCY
                        Why don’t you go to your bedroom 
                        and unpack. Okay, sweetheart?

           She nods, runs off, dragging her bag.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You can have her for the weekend.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Lucy--

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t say a word to her. She 
                        doesn’t know. I hope she never 
                        finds out.

                                 TIBBETS
                        This is my job. You knew that when 
                        you married me.

                                 LUCY
                        I didn’t give up my career for 
                        this. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        What do you want me to do, Luce?

           She stares, studying his face.

                                 LUCY
                        Tell me you feel guilty. Tell me 
                        you feel something. 
                                 TIBBETS
                        I cross the ocean. Risk my life to 
                        stop this godforsaken war. And come 
                        home to an empty house. So what I’m 
                        feeling right now is that I don’t 
                        deserve this. 

                                 LUCY
                        Jesus, you don’t even know what 
                        feelings are, do you? Those are 
                        thoughts. 
                             (beat)
                        We can fix this, Tibby. I just need 
                        to see you cry. 

                                 TIBBETS
                             (softly)
                        You’re going to be waiting a long 
                        time.

           She shakes her head, walks out.

           INT. TOKYO - IMPERIAL WAR ROOM - DAY

           The Emperor sits on his dais at the head of the table. 

           SUPER: “August 9, 1945”

           His advisors are seated around the table, as before. Yanami 
           is conspicuously absent. Another Admiral, TOJO, is giving 
           updates.

                                 TOJO
                        ... and we’re still investigating 
                        reports of more explosions in 
                        Hiroshima and... this morning, 
                        Nagasaki. 

           Kido is frozen, as if he’s been hit in the gut. 

                                 TOJO (CONT’D)
                        We’re not certain the damage is as 
                        extensive as reported in 
                        international newspapers. We 
                        obviously know papers lie.

           The other advisors nod agreement. 

                                 TOJO (CONT’D)
                        Our country still has millions and 
                        millions ready to fight until the 
                        very end. Until... if necessary... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOJO (CONT’D)
                        our nation is destroyed like a 
                        beautiful flower!

           The men murmur their agreement again. 

           The Emperor looks to Kido, but he says nothing. He’s lost the 
           will to fight. The Emperor’s appointed Voice is silent.

           Finally, the Emperor bangs his fist against the table. A 
           sudden, violent gesture from a usually implacable presence. 

                                 EMPEROR
                        ENOUGH. 

           He takes a deep breath. Reaches out and takes the hands of 
           his advisors. Like a father comforting his children. 

                                 EMPEROR (CONT’D)
                             (softly now)
                        Enough. 

           INT. COLORADO SPRINGS AIR FORCE BASE - CAMP STORE - EVENING

           Tibbets wanders around the commissary of his old base. Sees a 
           display of toy planes, stacked nearly to the ceiling. He 
           smiles.

           Suddenly a woman CRIES OUT. She’s listening to the RADIO. She 
           starts sobbing. 

           Others look at her, alarmed. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Truman... oh my God... he just said 
                        the Japanese... they surrendered. 
                        It’s over. 

           EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           Tibbets drives his car through the base, exploding with the 
           news.

           Air-raid sirens are screaming. The base church is ringing its 
           bell. People are running into the streets and leaning out 
           windows, cheering and yelling. A man rips pages from his 
           phone book into shreds and tosses the confetti into the air. 

           An older woman sitting on a stoop hugs her neighbor. 

           Tibbets suddenly LEANS on his HORN, provoking a rousing cheer 
           from pedestrians on the sidewalk. 
           He cranks down the window, puts his hand out, touching dozens 
           of other hands as he drives slowly past. His face, at one 
           moment blissful, the next broken. He CHEERS himself hoarse. 

           Three years and eight months of war. All the bullets and 
           bombs. Sweat and nightmares. 

           EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS - SUBURB - DAY 

           Even the suburban streets are gridlocked. Tibbets gets out of 
           his car, abandoning it by the side of the road. He walks 
           quickly through the madness. Starts running toward the 
           bungalow where Lucy’s sister lives. 

           EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS - FRONT PORCH - DAY 

           Tibbets knocks on the door. Lucy’s sister opens it, grimaces.

                                 LUCY’S SISTER
                        It’s not a good time.

           She starts to close it, when Lucy appears, looks out at him.

                                 LUCY
                             (to her sister)
                        It’s okay.

           She gives Lucy a look, walks away. 

           Lucy looks at Tibbets. He’s worked up, sweating, charged with 
           energy. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        We used to talk about all the 
                        things we’d do. When it ended. 
                        Remember?

           He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away. 

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Look around. Everybody’s 
                        celebrating. 

                                 LUCY
                        Because they don’t know yet.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Everyone agreed it was the right 
                        thing. It would save lives. FDR, 
                        Truman, Groves-- 
                                 LUCY
                        They agreed on the numbers. That’s 
                        not what I’m talking about. I’m 
                        asking what kind of man can drop a 
                        bomb that burns women and children 
                        alive and not blink.

           She looks him in the eye, searching. He doesn’t answer.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Give me something. Anything.

           He trembles, silent. She shakes her head, closes the door. 

           Then, quietly, hoping she’s on the other side, listening...

                                 TIBBETS
                        Luce. I got through this because I 
                        knew you were there. Waiting. At 
                        the end of all the darkness. I need 
                        you--

           Nothing.

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Tibbets is alone. An untouched meal on the table. He opens 
           the small window, hears the SOUND of the world celebrating. 
           He listens, listless. Tries to cry. He can’t. Nothing comes. 

           INT. LUCY’S SISTER HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Mary, in pajamas, is dropping corn nuts over the side of her 
           toy plane, one by one, yelling...

                                 MARY
                        Kaboom! Kaboom!

           Lucy enters, holding a glass of water.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Look, Mommy. I’m killing Japs!

           Lucy abruptly grabs the toy plane out of Mary’s hands. She 
           starts screaming, banging her fists against her mother.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Give it back. It’s mine!

                                 LUCY
                        Only if you promise not to drop 
                        bombs. That’s not what it’s for.
                                 MARY
                        YES IT IS! WHERE’S DADDY? I WANT MY 
                        DADDY! 

           Lucy kneels down, hugs her daughter tightly. 

           INT. TIBBETS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           A knock on the front door. 

           Tibbets runs for it, still in his bathrobe.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Lucy?

           Opens the door and sees A REPORTER with slicked-back hair on 
           his doorstep.

                                 REPORTER
                        Aaron McGill from the Post. Just a 
                        few questions, Colonel, won’t take 
                        more than a few minutes--

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’m busy, sorry---

                                 REPORTER
                        We’re doing a special report--

                                 TIBBETS
                        You should talk to General Groves--

                                 REPORTER
                        Just one question, then. 

           Tibbets sighs. 

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you should be tried as 
                        a war criminal?

           Tibbets stares at him. Slams the door in his face.

           INT. BASE - AUDITORIUM - EVENING 

           Groves and Major General TIMOTHY SPATZ pin a medal to 
           Tibbets’s uniformed chest in front of a rowdy crowd of 
           SOLDIERS. 
                                 GROVES
                        The Distinguished Service Cross. 
                        For the man who ended the war. Paul 
                        W. Tibbets. A national hero.  

           He and Spatz hold up each of Tibbets’s arms. He smiles as 
           cameras flash. The smile is weak. 

                                 GROVES (CONT’D)
                             (whispering to Tibbets)
                        A few words. Upbeat. A final rah-
                        rah, then we can all go home.  

           Tibbets nods, steps up to the podium. Takes off his cap, 
           places it on the stand. Then looks out at the men, tired and 
           dirty. 

           A long beat before he speaks. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        You’re going to hear a lot about 
                        the bomb. What it was, what it 
                        meant, whether we should have 
                        dropped it. There will be a lot of 
                        talking. Speculating. Everyone will 
                        have an opinion. Sitting on their 
                        lounge chairs, smoking their 
                        cigarettes, thinking they would 
                        have done it differently. Or just 
                        better. But they don’t know a damn 
                        thing about it. They want us to 
                        feel guilty, immoral, tortured by 
                        nightmares. 

           Tibbets look into the eyes of the men in front of him.

                                 TIBBETS (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what I know. People were 
                        dying. Lots of people. We put an 
                        end to it. Every red-blooded 
                        American would have pulled that 
                        trigger if they’d had the chance, 
                        if they knew exactly what was at 
                        stake, if they saw all we’ve seen.
                             (beat)
                        This had to end. This long 
                        miserable war had to end. 

           The audience roars. Tibbets looks at Groves, who nods, 
           grateful. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
           EXT. AIRPORT - MORNING

           A passenger plane touches down. 

           It taxis up to the gate. As passengers walk out, most of them 
           Japanese, we see Tibbets. A passenger too.

           SUPER: “Hiroshima Airport. February 1946.”

           The AMERICAN FLAG hangs from a nearby pole. 

           Tibbets stops, salutes it. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - MORNING

           Tibbets, wearing civilian clothes, walks through the streets 
           of Hiroshima. Only slightly restored from the devastation. 

           He’s accompanied by a crew of scientists, including 
           Oppenheimer, and a JAPANESE INTERPRETER.

           The scientists carry Geiger counters, electroscopes. 
           Measuring radiation levels. They stop to collect samples in 
           plastic bags. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        I didn’t think you’d come. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        Why wouldn’t I?

           He shrugs.

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        Because nobody else did. 

           As they walk, Tibbets studies the people passing by, heads 
           bowed, not daring to make eye contact. Many have red spots on 
           their skin. Hair falling out in patches. They are all gaunt 
           and pale.  

           A young woman with a severely disfigured face has the pattern 
           of a kimono (flowers and birds) burnt into her bare arm. Her 
           eyes are cloudy with radiation-induced cataracts. 

           He can’t look away.

                                 TIBBETS
                        Good morning. 

           She bows her head, keeps walking.
           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - LATER

           Tibbets, Oppenheimer and the scientists stare at a stone 
           wall. 

           Much of the wall has melted away. The part that remains is 
           emblazoned with the BLACK SHADOW of a man cowering, looking 
           up at the sky. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        The bomb burned his shadow into the 
                        wall. The man probably evaporated 
                        on the spot. It’s all that’s left 
                        of him.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - STREET - LATER

           Tibbets looks through bric-a-brac piled on an overturned 
           cart. An eager vendor tries to interest him in various items. 
           Most salvaged from the ruins. 

           Tibbets holds up a hand-lacquered and carved rice bowl. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        I’ll take the bowl.  

           The interpreter passes on the message to the vendor, who 
           grins while pushing other wares in his direction. 

           As he fishes in his pocket for Japanese currency, Tibbets 
           notices a rusty clock on the cart. He picks it up. It reads: 
           8:15 AM. 

                                 INTERPRETER
                        The pika. It froze many of the 
                        clocks at the time of the 
                        explosion. In my house, the same. 

           Tibbets checks his watch, then corrects the time. Puts it 
           back.  

           He notices another clock. It also reads: 8:15 AM. He does the 
           same to that one. 

                                 TIBBETS
                        There you go. 

           He smiles, as if he made it all better. 

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - ASANO PARK - LATER

           They enter the park where Natsuko took shelter. 
           There is now green vegetation EVERYWHERE. Growing in the 
           gutters, the tiles, tin roofing, across fallen and dead tree 
           trunks. 

           The peaceful sanctuary is returning to life.

           Tibbets kneels next to Oppenheimer, who crouches close to the 
           moon bridge. Inspecting a flowering plant poking through the 
           cement. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                        The oleander is the official flower 
                        of the city of Hiroshima now. 
                        Because it was the first to bloom 
                        after the bomb. 

           Tibbets takes the flower tenderly by its stem.

                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D)
                        It’s poisonous. 

           Carefully cradles it in his hand. 

           INT. HIROSHIMA - A-DOME - MORNING

           Tibbets walks down a vast, dusty hallway. 

           At the end is a man who sits inside a kind of governmental 
           kiosk. On a table in front of him is a STACK of ENVELOPES. 

           The interpreter leans in. 

                                 INTERPRETER
                        They cremated all the bodies. Put 
                        them in envelopes for loved ones to 
                        retrieve.

           Tibbets watches as the attendant carefully pours ASHES from a 
           metal urn into yet another envelope. Labels it. Licks it 
           shut. 

           Tibbets stares, an unfamiliar feeling overtaking him. 

           Oppie and the other men turn back.

           Tibbets, alone, begins to sob. At first softly, then 
           uncontrollably.  

                              END OF MOVIE
           OVER VARIOUS SHOTS OF MODERN DAY HIROSHIMA, INCLUDING THE 
           FLAME OF PEACE.

           41 million people died in World War II.

           One modern atomic missile is equivalent to 84 Hiroshima’s. 

           Paul Tibbets became the executive of a private jet company. 
           He died in 2007.

           Claude Eatherly became a prominent anti-bomb activist. He 
           died in 1978. 

           Marquis Kido claimed all responsibility for war aggression in 
           Japan, thereby absolving the Emperor of guilt. He was 
           prosecuted as a war criminal, and imprisoned in the Sugamo 
           Prison in Tokyo. 

           Emperor Hirohito reigned until his death in 1989. 

           The Flame of Peace in Hiroshima has burned since 1964 in 
           honor of the victims and will be extinguished only when the 
           Earth is free from nuclear threat
