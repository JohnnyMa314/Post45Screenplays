           HELLO-KITTY WAVES AT US

           Pulsing neon on massive billboard.
           Seen through a window.
           It’s fluorescent arm wagging.
           Left. Right. Left. Right.

           We SHUDDER. And GASP... 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        I want to talk retirement.

           The accent, proper London. 

                                                         ...THEN BLINK:

           A LUXURY SEDAN. NIGHT

           Navigates the glitz at Shibuya Crossing.
           Surge of pedestrians.
           Beneath mammoth video screens.
           Shoppers. Tourists. 
           Manic detonation of color and fashion.
           TOKYO.

           Brash Texan drawl,

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        Thought we discussed that 
                        yesterday?

           A WOMAN

           Silhouetted in the backseat.  
           Completely still.
           Watches through closed window.
           Thrumming gloss smearing her reflection.

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        We started.

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        And we’ll finish soon’s you close 
                        the Tokyo deal.

           Plexiglass isolating her from Driver.
           Ink peeking from collar, curving up his neck. 
           Dialing wheel. Away from the Station.

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        You said that before Berlin.

           It starts raining...
           HOTEL ROOM. LATER

           Floor-to-ceiling window.
           Polychromatic light irradiates from without.
           Modern. Practical. Antiseptic. 
           Codified to her liking. 

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        I said you should consider a 
                        vacation. Think I suggested Bora 
                        Bora. 

           Subtle movement. Someone’s here...
           Calmly thawing from the murk.
           She’s been here. Swathed in shadow.

           Took this long to notice. 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Sharks, pythons, paralysis ticks. 
                        Bora Bora’s a deathtrap. I don’t 
                        want a vacation, I want to talk 
                        exit strategies and insurance; 
                        thirty-two years, Varrick, I want 
                        to talk severance. 

           Uttered with flat prosody. 

           BY THE WINDOW 

           38 floors up. Reflecting on the city below.
           Wafers of light delineate her.
           We get our first look.

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        They tell me retirement’s the most 
                        efficient murderer of elder folk.

           KATE
           Piercing cobalt gaze.
           Calm. Expressionless. Cold.
           Unnervingly static. Barely has a pulse.

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        That why you’re still working?

           Even the blinks are deliberate.

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        I never stop to think about it.

           Coolly regarding the city. Or herself. 
           Mileage in the eyes only she gleans.
                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        But that’s what you’ve been doin’?

           Her reflection hovering over Tokyo.
           A ghost haunting the metropolis.

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        Still there?

           No evidence of respiration. 

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        Kate...

           Her head tilts fractionally.
           Eyeing her wristwatch.

           HOTEL BAR. LATER

           Untouched drink before her.
           Cell to ear, this is the convo.

                                 VARRICK (O.S.)
                        Alright tell you what, I’ll divert 
                        my flight to Tokyo tomorrow and 
                        we’re gonna talk then.

                                 KATE 
                        We’re already talking.

           Japanese salarymen. Few gaijin. 
           One spying her from a stool over. 

                                 VARRICK (O.S.)
                        And I’ve already done as discussed, 
                        HR’s assured me they’re drawin’ up 
                        the insurance papers and-- Look, 
                        you’re our ace closer, Kate, so 
                        don’t give ‘em a reason now and 
                        bring this home like always.

                                 KATE 
                        Complete severance consolidation.

           Deep exhale on the other end.

                                 VARRICK (O.S.)
                        Tomorrow, face-to-face.

                                 KATE 
                        Get it done. 

           She ends the call.
                                 STEPHEN (O.S.)
                        They must be killing you. You 
                        haven’t even touched your drink.

           THE AMERICAN sitting beside.
           Kate’s glare frigid.
           Before returning to her cell.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, back up, total pick up line. 
                             (putting up hands)
                        Been here a week, heard English and 
                        keyed in. Involuntary, I swear. 

           Scoops his drink, shifting away.

                                 KATE
                        I believe you.

           Faux brow wipe, ‘Whew’.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        That scary? Couldn’t risk it being 
                        misconstrued as flirtation.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh, no, that’s not--

                                 KATE
                        Ice-bitch British bureaucrat, I get 
                        it.

           Recovery attempt.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No, no, just didn’t want it 
                        misconstrued as bad flirtation.

           Kate gives him a relaxed once-over. 
           He beams. Offers a hand.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Stephen.

           She considers before taking it.

                                 KATE
                        Angela.

           Sliding closer.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No soul-stabbing, work-related 
                        talk, I promise.
           LATER

           Drink still untouched.
           But she’s looser.
           He’s on his third.
           Not quite slurred.
           Yet.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        I mean, who on their deathbed’s 
                        ever said, “I wish I’d worked 
                        more”?

                                 KATE
                        Everyone who didn’t make partner?

           He’s mouthing, ‘Ha ha.’
           Slugging the rest.
           Gesturing for another.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        They keep trying to placate me with 
                        vacations.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Vacations! Mm--

           Dipping into the fourth.

                                 KATE
                        No good?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Alright, look, I wasn’t always 
                        Captain Skeptical. First vacation, 
                        Nassau, I came back and proclaimed 
                        it a paradigm shift.

                                 KATE
                        Wow. Sounds affirming.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Last year, Caracas, unbearable.

                                 KATE
                        Sure. Most violent city in the 
                        world. 119 homicides per 100k.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh, right. I meant the vacations 
                        themselves. Each one a time out, to 
                        reflect. On who you could’ve been, 
                        if only you’d gone that way instead 
                        of this. If it’s too late for that.
                                 KATE
                        Path not taken, it’s a vicious 
                        chestnut.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Every year that person dies a 
                        little. Then it’s all over. Is 
                        anyone gonna care we were here? 

                                 KATE
                        Consider retirement.

           A pensive swig.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This profession, my career... 
                        that’s not such an easy call.

                                 KATE
                        Till it’s too late for that guy.

           Raising his glass.

                                 STEPHEN
                        To getting out. Before our bodies 
                        fail us. 

                                 KATE
                        You’re a bit adorable, Stephen.
                             (off his look)
                        That was flirtation.

           BACK IN HER ROOM

           Frenzied sex in the shadows.
           Filtered lights playing across them.

           MUCH LATER

           Bedside clock blinks 11:59 PM.
           Kate stands there watching it.

           Alarm vibrates at midnight.
           For a second. She taps it off.

           Nudging Stephen with her foot.
           Asleep in a sheet tangle. 
           Comes alive with a yawn.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What time is it?

                                 KATE
                        For you to leave.
           Squints at her standing by window.
           Marshals a playful smile.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How was it?

           She nods to small cash wad.

                                 KATE
                        There’s extra.

           On his feet now, dressing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Was it okay? I riffed on what you 
                        specified. Tried to make it honest.

           Her silence killing his smile.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        We’re not that different, you know. 
                        In what we want. 

           Glare neglected, she’s facing the city.
           He snatches the cash. Pads out.

           BATHROOM

           Fogged. 
           She showers. 
           Methodic. Economical.

           We catch fractions of her body.
           Horrific swirls of scar tissue.
           Each one a story.

           Kills the spray.

           Hands paste nicotine patch on thorax.
           It’s concave.
           Mastectomy scarred. 

           BUZZ. PRELAP the door buzzer.

           HOTEL ROOM. NEXT MOMENT

           BELLBOY enters, pushing trolley.
           Squints, adjusting to ambiance.

           Kate seated across, facing him. Backlit.
           One leg draped over the other.
           Calmly pulling on gloves. Watching.
           He only discerns her silhouette.
           Bows. Exits quickly.

           She stays. Another moment...
           Then moves.
           Three perfect strides. 
           At the trolley.

           Ignores food, lifts the wine.
           Checks vintage. Pops. Pours.
           Exactly a quarter glass. 

           No more. No less.

           Sips. Not to her liking.
           Nostril flare gives it away.
           Swirls lightly.

           Pulling A PELICAN CASE from bottom section. 
           Keys her phone. Unlocking case.
           Click. Electronic bolts unlatch.

           An SGW Scope Rifle housed in velvet.
           In four clean sections.
           Beside ear-piece.

           She eyes it. Drains the glass.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Kate assembles the gun.
           A magician. Precise. 4 seconds.
           Not a move wasted.

           Cleans two rounds with pristine napkin.
           Chambers both. Just two.

           No more.
           No less.

           Discards gloves.
           Not a trace.

           EVEN LATER

           She dresses before mirror.
           Meticulous as a bomb tech.
           Perfectly fitting a monochromatic outfit.

           Slacks. Shirt. Crisp collar, unbent. 
           Without wrinkle. Or blemish.
           Her diligence like a soldier donning uniform.

           Or, armor.
           Keen eyes absorb her reflection.
           Finally, an expression...
           Barest hint of a frown.

           On her shirt, a spec. A flaw.
           You and I would never notice.

           She fastidiously undresses. 
           The shirt must go.

           Speedometer top-lining.
           EXPLODING through a red light.
           Chorus of honks in her wake.
           SHRIEKING outta control. 
           Then BLACK...

           As her heart quits on her.
           Head crashing into wheel.

           WHAM!
           Mercedes HURTLING end-over-end.
           Landing in a crushing explosion.
           Of glass, metal, flames.

           Honks. Screeches. Chaos.
           And through the dissolving smoke.
           We see KATE.

           Strapped into seat.
           Hanging upside down. 
           Motionless.
           Lifeless.

           BLACK

           A long beat...
           Disrupted by,
                                       ANOTHER DISTORTED MEMORY FRAGMENT
           LIVING ROOM. KID KATE on the couch, bloodsoaked face. Flanked 
           by her parents. BOTH DEAD. A stately WOMAN sits across with a 
           gun. This is MOTHER. We’ll never see her face. Posh English:

                                 MOTHER
                        What would you do if I let you go?

           Kate’s face, a fizz of fury.

                                 KID KATE
                        I’d kill you.

           Mother’s LIPS unfurling into a smirk,

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re going to like your new home.

           Then we’re GASPING out.
           Blinking.
           Painfully.
           Everything a blur.
           Slowly coming into focus.
           Fog lifting.
           Adjusting.
           Discerning surroundings. 

           In A HOSPITAL BED.
           Cordoned by PLASTIC CURTAINS.
           Donning patient gown.
           Mesh of IVs. Bleeping monitors. 
           Not a room...

           A HALL

           Expansive. Empty.
           Excepting her bed.
           Like all the others were removed.

           Abrupt SHOUTING in Japanese. 
           Someone noticing her awake, alerting others.

           NEXT MOMENT

           SIX MEN IN HAZMAT SUITS.
           Blink at us.
           Beep. Beep. Beep...
           Kate deadpans back. 
           Battered and broken. 
           Rigged to wires, tubes.

           Sudden explosion of CHATTER.
           Rapid-fire Japanese.
           A dizzying babel.
           Getting heated.
           The men point and argue.

           Then just exit.
           All of them.
           Kate looking after...

           LATER

           MORE PEOPLE IN HAZMAT SUITS.
           A dozen now. 
           Fierce clamor.
           All squabbling over her.

           Then big GASPS. 
           As A MAN cuts through.
           Sans hazmat suit.

           Marching straight to Kate.  
           Rips aside the plastic.
           Consulting his clipboard.
           Perfect English, no-nonsense.

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Canadian passport. Says your name 
                        is Angela Witten. Is that correct?

           Gets nothing for it.
           Points at the hazmat suits.

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the precautions, 
                        Angela, I’m a specialist here and 
                        need to ask you a few questions. 
                             (gesturing over)
                        Are you still doing radioactive 
                        therapy for your mastectomy? 

           Slow shake in the negative.

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Have you had any recent exposure to 
                        radioactive materials? Maybe you 
                        work near such a place?

                                 KATE
                        No.
                                 SPECIALIST
                        Because your blood is in a rare 
                        state of mutation, overrun, with 
                        viciously radioactive isotopes. 

           Pauses for a reaction.
           Proves futile.

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Considering the velocity of decay, 
                        and the sheer potency, it was most 
                        likely injected directly into your 
                        bloodstream.
                             (meaning)
                        You were poisoned, Angela.

                                 KATE
                        Poisoned?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        It’s lethal, I’m afraid. There is 
                        no treatment for this, no antidote, 
                        it is already too late. I can’t 
                        imagine what it must be like to 
                        hear this, Miss Witten, but I want 
                        to make sure you understand what 
                        I’m telling you?

                                 KATE
                        What are you telling me?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        That you have been murdered. It is 
                        now simply a matter of your heart 
                        receiving the unfortunate news.

           Everyone staring at Kate.
           Uneasy silence ballooning...

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        The pain is utterly unmanageable 
                        without these morphine drips so-- 

           He trails off...

           Because Kate’s on her feet.
           Refusing the verdict.
           Tearing off IVs. Tubes. Wires.
           Walking out.
           Just like that.

           Past the men.
           Staggering outta her way.
           Reacting loudly.
           Specialist stunned.
           Kate making it to entrance.
           Before it hits again.
           Amplified pain. 
           Spinning her into orbit.

           She persists. Tottering,

           INTO THE HALLWAY

           PERSONNEL here reacting big.
           Mouths are covered. 
           Pointed fingers. Yells.

           Kate lurches on.
           One step.
           Another.
           As far as she gets.

           Doubling over.
           Wilting to the floor.
           Squirming there.
           Hacking out a lung.

           Staff converging now.
           Kate getting assailed.
           By tides of pain.
           Her eyes BUNCHING,
                                  THROUGH ANOTHER IMPRESSIONISTIC MEMORY
           OPERATING ROOM. YOUNG KATE being operated on by TWO SURGEONS.  
           Mammogram x-rays on wall. It’s a PREVENTATIVE MASTECTOMY.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Simplify. Resolve problems before 
                        they can become problems. 
                                                              SNAPPING OUT:

           BACK IN THE BED

           Left wrist handcuffed to it.
           Only two men here now.
           Specialist. And Plainclothes Officer.
           Specialist translating for him,

                                 SPECIALIST 
                        Detective Sanada here wants to know 
                        who we can contact? Besides your 
                        entry on a flight from Berlin, 
                        there are no records linked to your 
                        passport. And no emergency contacts 
                        or power of attorney listed on your 
                        work visa. 

           SANADA continues, holding up Kate’s cell.
                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Your phone is locked, and the car 
                        you were driving was stolen.
                             (pausing for last bit)
                        Stolen near a crime scene, a murder-

           Sanada clarifies.

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        An assassination.

           But Kate’s not listening.

                                 KATE
                        I was poisoned recently?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Very.

                                 KATE
                        How?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        The manner, you mean? Could’ve been 
                        anything, an injection, a drink...

           Sanada wants to know,

                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Who may have wanted to kill you?

           Mumbles without looking.

                                 KATE
                        You mean in Tokyo?

           Eliciting a stutter from Sanada.

                                 SANADA
                        Who are you? 

                                 KATE
                        What happens now?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        It will get worse. Rapidly. The 
                        morphine is managing the pain now, 
                        but in one hour it will be 
                        intolerable. In two it will be 
                        blinding. Within six hours you will 
                        be unable to process thought.

                                 KATE
                        How much time do I have?
                                 SPECIALIST
                        It’s hard to say, really, it could--

                                 KATE
                        How much?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        14 hours, maybe 15. But you won’t 
                        be seeing the sunrise, Angela.

           That lands on her.
           If you know where to look.
           Her chance to start over.
           Any hope for a different life. 
           All gone. Just like that.
           The men look on somberly.

                                 SANADA
                             (subtitles italicized)
                        So she has to stay on the morphine?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        We’ll keep inflating the dosage, 
                        but at some point the pain will 
                        overcome it. Before it gets there 
                        we would--
                             (clears throat)
                        We suggest euthanasia. 

           Kate glancing up now.
           He’s suggesting she lay down and die.
           Before it gets worse.
           Not unreasonable. Considering.

           To fade away quietly.
           Without a trace.
           The way she’s existed...

                                 KATE
                        What blunts the pain, allows 
                        mobility?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        You’re already on morphine--

                                 KATE
                        No depressants. I want stimulants.

                                 SANADA
                        Miss, you are not leaving this 
                        room.

                                 KATE
                        Name the drugs.
                                 SPECIALIST
                        There’s thebaine, like morphine but 
                        a stimulant, oxycodone of course, a 
                        morphine derivative, also--

                                 KATE
                        Give me the cocktail.

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Miss Witten, there is no way. These 
                        drugs, they may dull the pain but 
                        will greatly accelerate the decay.
                             (holding up her cell)
                        See this battery, this is your life 
                        right now, minimal usage may get 
                        you through the night, but the more 
                        you exert, faster you’ll expend it.

           Kate clocking the phone display.

                                 KATE
                        That’s how much time I have left, 
                        52%?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        More or less. Probably less.

           Kate growls at Sanada,

                                 KATE
                        Hand him the keys.

           She’s got a Ruger on his thigh. His Ruger.
           He blinks down at his empty holster.

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Angela, please-- This is crazy!

                                 KATE
                        It’s on your femoral, I pull this 
                        trigger and you’ll die before I do. 
                        Give him the keys.
                             (to Specialist)
                        Unlock me.

           Sanada awed. Specialist obliging.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Gag him, cuff him in my place. 

           Snapping up her phone.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Where are the drugs?
           HOSPITAL MEDICINE ROOM

           Closets thrown open.
           Specialist snatching vials, syringes, pills.
           Kate standing aside.
           IVs still threaded into arm.
           Fluid packets in one hand.
           Gun in the other.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Mix them up. Load them into shots.

           She’s ripping off IVs. Snatching his coat.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Your wallet too.

           She’s shoving the shots into coat pockets.
           He’s pleading, sheer professional compassion.

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Angela, please, it is corroding 
                        your insides! The hemorrhaging will 
                        cause bleeding of the gums, tooth 
                        decay. There will be body sores, 
                        muscular atrophy, impairing sight 
                        and ability to speak. And if you’re 
                        lucky, your heart will give out.
                             (earnest)
                        What is it that you want to do?

                                 KATE (PRELAP)
                        I want to know who killed me?
                                                                     THUNK!

           STEAK KNIFE PINNING BELLBOY’S HAND TO WALL

           A palm clamping his mouth. Stifling the scream. 
           Kate this close to his face.

           She’s decided not to.
           Fade away quietly, i.e.

           HOTEL KITCHEN

           Saliva, tears. Bellboy mewls.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        English?
                             (taps his temple)
                        With your head, yes or no.

           He nods yes.
           Her tone academic.
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Four vital arteries in your hand. I 
                        twist half a millimeter and you’ll 
                        bleed out in 6 minutes. Understand?
           Yes.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to ask yes or no 
                        questions. I want yes or no 
                        answers. You don’t answer, I kill 
                        you. I think you’re lying, I kill 
                        you. Understand?

           A trembling yes.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You remember me?

           Yes.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Remember what you delivered?

           Yes.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Did you put it together?

           Yes.
           Her grip tightens. 
           He quivers with dread.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Were you hired to poison me?

           His eyes dilating huge.
           Shaking ‘No’, whiplash fast.
           She removes her hand.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get the wine?

                                 BELLBOY
                        Boss-- the boss give me the wine, 
                        special for 3807. 

           Kate stark-still.
           Eyes digging for veracity.
           Bellboy swallowing hard.

                                 BELLBOY (CONT’D)
                        But he off today, the boss is home, 
                        I give you his address, he’s the 
                        manager, I give you-- okay?
           Free hand patting chest pocket.
           Pulling order-pad, pen.
           Scribbling. Forking it over.
           Kate snatching a napkin. 
           Gagging his mouth.

                                 KATE
                        Bite down.

           Yanking the knife.
           Bellboy swooning with pain.
           Kate pulling napkin from mouth.
           Shoving it into his wrist. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Soak it in paraffin, stitch it.

           Leaving him coiling to the ground.

                                 KATE (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                        Why did you poison me?

           LUXURY MEGURO APARTMENT

           A family shrivels on the floor. 
           Mother. Teenage boy. Gawking.
           Father on his feet. Bowing repeatedly. 
           The hotel MANAGER.

                                 MANAGER
                        Please, I don’t understand.

           Kate at the kitchen counter.
           Ruger resting there.
           Twisting open oxycodone tube. 
           Pills spilling out.

                                 KATE
                        Who asked you to poison me?

                                 MANAGER
                        I don’t know what you mean, please.

           Crushing pills with bottom of glass.
           Sweeping them into the water.
           Swallowing clean.

                                 KATE
                        Who picked out the wine?

                                 MANAGER
                        The-- I pick out the wine.
                                 KATE
                        From?

                                 MANAGER
                        The wine cellar, it’s--

                                 KATE
                        Who else has access?

                                 MANAGER
                        Just me. I have sole key to cellar.

                                 KATE
                        Who told you to pick it out?

                                 MANAGER
                        No one tell me, it was specified in 
                        the room reservation.

                                 KATE
                        By who?

                                 MANAGER
                        I don’t know, I-- those 
                        reservations come through computer.

                                 KATE
                        Who enters them on the other end?

                                 MANAGER
                        They all come from...
                             (a beat, as it dawns)
                        ...Our owners. The Sumiyoshi Clan.

                                 KATE
                        Yakuza. I want a name.

                                 MANAGER
                        Name? I don’t know names, I told 
                        you it’s through computer--

                                 KATE
                        The Sumiyoshis, you deal with one 
                        of their people, give me the name.  

           Kate walking over.
           Ruger held at her side

                                 MANAGER
                        But-- I can’t! You don’t--

                                 KATE
                        I’ll start with your family. It 
                        will hurt.
           Her tone flat, inflectionless.
           His eyes going big.

                                 MANAGER
                        What-- no, please! I can’t--

           KRAK!
           Wife SHRIEKS. 
           Shot through shoulder.
           He yells, dropping beside her.
           Kid wailing.

                                 KATE
                        Name.

                                 MANAGER
                        Stop, please! 

           Ruger panning to the Kid.
           Smoke curling from barrel.

                                 KATE
                        The kid’s next.

           Manager’s eyes inflating huge.
           Throwing himself across his kid.

                                 MANAGER
                        You’re crazy! Stop, please, I’ll 
                        give you name!

           Kate considers him impassively. 
           Gun still on the kid.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Sato-san-- his name is Kujun Sato!

           Kate suddenly BLANCHING.
           Grinding through pain surge.
           Everyone eyeing the gun.
           Knuckles whitening around it. 

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        I deal with him sometimes, Sato, 
                        he’s a Sumiyoshi shatei-- a 
                        lieutenant, I don’t know anything 
                        else! Now please, the gun...

           She sights down her gun arm.
           Regards the tense grip.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Look what you did to her! Look what 
                        you did to my wife!
           Kate walking out sans a look.

                                 KATE
                        She’ll live.

           STEPHEN with an AMERICAN WOMAN.
           His ‘john’. Hand in hand.

           Turning into side street.
           Towards residential block.
           Laughing. Buzzed. 

           Someone watching from afar...

           Woman leading them inside.
           Figure across the street...

           APARTMENT BEDROOM

           Woman grinding atop Stephen.
           Moaning.

           SLAM!
           Door plows open. 
           Specter coasting in.
           KATE. 

           Woman leaping off.
           Muffling a scream.

           PICTURES on dresser.
           Of them both. 
           They’re A COUPLE.
           Huh. Kate’s eyes doing new math.

                                 KATE
                        Do you love her?

           Ruger in Stephen’s face.
           Terror choking his response...

                                 WOMAN
                        Who are you!? Who is she?!

                                 KATE
                        Do you. Love. Her?
                                 STEPHEN
                        Yes-- Yes I love her!

           APARTMENT BALCONY

           Woman DANGLES head-first off railing.
           Mouth taped. Wind WHIPPING.
           Stirring her into WRITHING frenzy.

           Kate holding her by one foot.
           Ruger in other hand 
           Trained on Stephen.
           Heave-ho rocking from dread. 
           Voice cracking.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        I swear I didn’t poison you! I-- 
                        you didn’t even touch your drink!

                                 KATE
                        Who do you work for?

                                 STEPHEN
                        You hired me, through the website, 
                        that’s how it works.

                                 KATE
                        Who owns it?

                                 STEPHEN
                        No one, I only deal with the 
                        clients, no one else!

           Kate laxing her grip slightly.
           Woman slipping several inches.
           Smothered screams echoing through tape.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        No! Please-- stop!

                                 KATE
                        Who set it up, who manages it? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Her, she does, my wife!

           Kate’s eyes skidding across his face. 
           Stephen sobbing now. Disgorging all.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        We needed money, okay, we needed 
                        money bad. And I was always good at 
                        this stuff, you know, listening, 
                        talking, providing comfort.
           Kate’s grip wavering.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        You were our out! The last client. 
                        We have enough to retire from this 
                        now, start over different.

           Kate absorbing this...
           Tightening grip. Straining.
           Hauling up the Woman.
           Stephen rushing over.
           Embracing, soothing her.

           BLOOD DRIPPING on him. 
           PUDDLING at their feet.
           He’s checking his wife. 

           Not hers.
           It’s GUSHING from Kate’s nose, mouth.

           BATHROOM

           Wife idles in doorway.
           Kate at the sink.
           Swabbing nose.
           Stephen handing her peroxide.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Rinse your mouth with this.

           Kate gargling.
           Spitting mouthful of diluted blood.
           Something RATTLING in sink.
           A tooth.

           Kate trying to catch it.
           Too late.
           It slips down the drain.

           She stares at her reflection.
           Cuts. Bruises. Sallow face. Drawn eyes.
           Barely recognizable. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Someone did this to you?

           Genuine concern on Woman’s face.
           Stephen with a gallows chuckle.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Guess it’s too late for you.

           Kate still fixed on reflection.
           He articulates softly.
                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        To retire, I mean. No getting out 
                        now. Discovering that person.

           Harkening to their existential tete-a-tete.
           Kate giving it a ponder...
           Her cell BUZZING. 
           Varrick.

                                 KATE
                        But they’re gonna know I was here.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who... who’s gonna know?

           Snatching cell, stalking out.

                                 KATE
                        Everyone.

           GINGKO AVENUE. DUSK

           Sidewalk cafe. High-end.
           VARRICK sipping wine alone.
           Rust and snow hair. Slim Whitman sideburns.
           Dressed for business. 
           Always dressed for business.

           Kate crossing over.
           He starts to stand.
           She beats him, sitting opposite.
           Eyes locked on his.
           He matches, pushes a wine glass over.
           Gazes latched in silence.
           Varrick like a concerned parent.
           Face creasing, can’t contain it.

                                 VARRICK
                        ‘Irreversible’, they’re sayin’? No. 
                        No goddammit. Our guy’s gonna check 
                        you out. We’re gonna find a way.

                                 KATE
                        You always have a drink ready for 
                        me.

           Beat. Varrick getting it.

                                 VARRICK
                        Jesus, Kate...

           She sips it anyway.
           Without breaking stare.
           Pauses at exactly a quarter.

                                 KATE
                        Like yesterday in Berlin.

           Then drains the rest.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Staged to divert suspicion from The 
                        Firm. Poison me. Send me off. Time-
                        release concoction hits after the 
                        job, they get the last ounce out of 
                        their agent before expiration. Nice 
                        and clean. Did I get that right? 

           Profound hurt on his face.
           Words not coming fast enough.

                                 VARRICK
                        You’re being ludicrous.

                                 KATE
                        I’m dying.

                                 VARRICK
                        That ain’t how The Firm does 
                        things, you’re a valued agent, vet 
                        status, for Christ’s sake. 

                                 KATE
                        I’ve expired agents before, I know 
                        how things get done. Was I part of 
                        the contract, no loose ends?

                                 VARRICK
                        Our agents aren’t expendable, 
                        godammit, think I’d let ‘em do that 
                        to you?! Three decades together and 
                        that’s what you think of me?

                                 KATE
                        You said it, I’m vet status, how 
                        many vets make it to retirement?

           Her face TWITCHES,
                                WHIPS THROUGH A FLIP-BOOK OF MEMORIES
           Decades diced into seconds. Sounds and images overlapping. 
           * KID KATE and YOUNGER VARRICK, first meeting. MOTHER lingers-

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        He’s your handler now. Starting 
                        today you’ll deal only with him.  

           * YOUNG KATE blows birthday candle in cupcake. Varrick smiles-
                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        That makes him your mother, father, 
                        best friend, and your therapist.

           * Hectic, bloody. DOCTOR working on Kate’s gnarled side. 
           Varrick right there brimming with concern, blood smeared. 

           * Young Kate blasting out of an alley, car screeching up, 
           Kate leaping in, Varrick at the wheel, flooring it.  

           * Through the years, Kate and Varrick sharing wine. Varrick 
           always making the same toast. But we don’t hear it as... 

           Kate SNAPS OUT. 
           Biting her lip to lull the pain.

                                 VARRICK
                        I got you approved, you were out.

           Paternal agony on his face.
           Emotional, sucks down the wine.
           Then places something before her.
           USB flash drive.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Severance. The whole package. Tooth 
                        and nail to get it expedited. 
                        Unprecedented by Firm standards.

           Waiter interrupts to replenish their glasses. 

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Stop fuckin’ around and bring the 
                        bottle!

           He bows, takes off.
           Varrick taps the USB.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Routing intel for all the funds, 
                        deposited across your offshores. 
                        Accessible only by you.

           Waiter with the wine bottle.
           Varrick snatching it, excusing him.
           Topping their glasses.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        That’s not the kind of money you 
                        just throw away. No reason to part 
                        with it if they’re gonna turn 
                        around and kill you.

           Kate considers... Then, 
                                 KATE
                        Who hired me?

           Varrick reacting big.

                                 VARRICK
                        You know I can’t, that’s not how it 
                        works. Anonymity’s what keeps this 
                        whole damn machine running.

                                 KATE
                        Anonymous just murdered me.

                                 VARRICK 
                        We don’t know that, alright? Let’s 
                        think this through, consider all 
                        the possibilities.

                                 KATE
                        I’ve already questioned all the 
                        possibilities, you were the last 
                        one. That just leaves the client.

                                 VARRICK
                        I can’t disclose that, Kate. 
                        Separation of duties is why our 
                        organization exists. Anything else 
                        and you know I wouldn’t hesitate. 
                        Just tell me, okay, whatever else 
                        you need right now, I’m here, let’s-

                                 KATE
                        I want their name. You don’t give 
                        me the name and I’ll consider you 
                        complicit and kill you right here.

           Her voice flat. Icy. 
           Subzero.
           Varrick like a wounded father.
           Knows the weight behind the words.
           Stunned. Swallows to hide it.

                                 VARRICK
                        Kate...

                                 KATE
                        I don’t have time for sympathy. 

                                 VARRICK
                        I tell you and I’m as good as dead.

                                 KATE
                        Did it look like I was asking 
                        nicely?
           Her gaze like a drill through his skull.
           Varrick shook. Draining his glass.

                                 VARRICK
                        I’ll need some time, to make calls.

                                 KATE
                        Bullshit. There’s no authorization 
                        for this, call like that is out of 
                        the question. Don’t insult me.

           He doesn’t bother contending.
           Long shut-eye exhale.
           Recalls something.

                                 VARRICK
                        Wasn’t gonna bother with this 
                        anymore, but what the hell.

           Reaches down, bag by his feet.
           Hauls out wrapped WINE BOTTLE.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        1787 Chateau Lafite, greatest 
                        vintage of the previous century. 
                        Last one sold in ‘85, for $160k.

           Faint smile,

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Wasn’t the last. Got word, made the 
                        offer before this hit Sotheby’s. 

           Tears off card stuck to wrapping.
           Ripping it up,

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Thought it’d be different 
                        circumstances. 

           Kate quietly seizing him with a stare.
           Doesn’t move. But touch her, she’ll explode.
           Face like a mask.
           Vacant. Lifeless. Haunting.
           Varrick wholly unsettled.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Kate. Please. Don’t do this.

           She reaches into his jacket.
           Peeling out a Glock 34. 
           Just holds it. 
           Eyes still linked.
           Varrick sighs it all out.
                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        It was the Sumiyoshis. I don’t know 
                        names, it was arranged through cut-
                        outs. They needed Firm resources to 
                        locate the target. These bigger 
                        clans are run like corporations 
                        now, and target was the Vice-
                        Minister’s Aide so they didn’t want 
                        the wetwork exposure either.

                                 KATE
                        The Sumiyoshis also handled my 
                        accommodations.

                                 VARRICK
                        That’s right. How’d you--

                                 KATE
                        Accommodations are outsourced to 
                        third-parties. 

                                 VARRICK
                        Not always, not anymore. 

                                 KATE
                        What about separation of duties?

                                 VARRICK
                        Budget cuts. If the client offers 
                        accommodations, we’ll consider the 
                        price point. Theirs was ideal.

                                 KATE
                        So they could kill me.

                                 VARRICK
                        Why?

                                 KATE
                        I can think of four reasons.

                                 VARRICK
                        Retaliation? No. Contracts are 
                        protected. Agent files aren’t 
                        exposed under any circumstances.

                                 KATE
                        I’ve personally sanctioned two silk 
                        road merchants dealing similar 
                        intel. You’re getting old.

           Varrick’s memories restoring.
           He knows it’s a possibility.
           The most rational one.
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        There was another party on scene. 
                        Two women.

                                 VARRICK
                        Don’t know nothin’ about that, if 
                        it was part of the act we weren’t 
                        informed. We were just the hitters. 

           She holds out her hand.
           He sighs, palming her extra mags.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        I gotta inform the Firm now. You 
                        know that right? You’re their 
                        responsibility, means they’re gonna 
                        put a contract on you. And I know 
                        they’ve got local boots on the 
                        ground. But for you they’ll even 
                        expedite out-of-towners. Everyone 
                        will want in on this.
                             (pause)
                        Unless you kill me right now.

           Kate holding him another penetrating beat.

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        Sumiyoshis are animals, the worst 
                        kind, where would you even go? 

                                 KATE
                        Kujun Sato.

                                 VARRICK
                        The fuck is he? 

                                 KATE
                        A start.

                                 VARRICK
                        Dammit Kate, it’s your condition, 
                        you’re not thinkin’ right. Tactics, 
                        precision, c’mon, you know better.

                                 KATE
                        I’m taking a more blunt approach.

                                 VARRICK
                        You’re being rash. 

                                 KATE
                        Thing about being dead, there’s no 
                        more rash decisions. 
                                 VARRICK
                        I don’t wanna make that call, Kate. 
                        Don’t make me. Please.

           Kate snatches the Lafite and walks off.
           Just like that.
           Varrick starts to call after.
           Only manages a defeated exhale.
           As the Waiter drops off the check.

                                 MOTHER (PRELAP)
                        Clients take precedence, Varrick, 
                        no matter the circumstance. They’re 
                        not be exposed. Ever!

           LONE CAR IN ABANDONED PARKING LOT

           Varrick in the driver’s. Cell to his ear.
           MOTHER on the other end.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s the bedrock of the trade. Any 
                        repercussions from the deal get 
                        handled by us, not our assets.

                                 VARRICK
                        I don’t need a reminder.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        She’s your responsibility.

                                 VARRICK
                        I said I had no choice and I meant 
                        it.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Every scenario has a logical 
                        contingency, appears you do need 
                        reminding. I’d already noted your 
                        relationship with her getting... 
                        let’s say, uncomfortably empathic. 
                        And now look where we are. You’ve 
                        bled intel you’re not allowed to 
                        and it’s going to blow back on The 
                        Firm.

                                 VARRICK
                        Like you said, there’s logical 
                        contingencies, we can still--

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Logic? Kate’s a reputation, a 
                        thought problem, we teach it now.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Her ratios are impossible, they 
                        don’t make any sense. There isn’t 
                        another like her.

                                 VARRICK
                        We made her, we know her, she’s our 
                        agent. 

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        We don’t make agents, Varrick, we 
                        make monsters. And Kate’s royalty 
                        among them, the king, she’s bloody 
                        Godzilla and her death thrash is 
                        going to stomp Tokyo into pulp.

                                 VARRICK
                        Look, I know how bad this can get--

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Oh for fuck’s sake, it’s already 
                        worse! And it puts your retirement 
                        into serious consideration. Do you 
                        need a refresher on your own asset?

                                 VARRICK
                        I don’t--

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Zero blown assignments. None. Who 
                        has that kind of record?! Garza, 
                        Mitte, Cape Town, remember Cape 
                        Town? 57 men in there and she still 
                        made it out, all of them dead. She 
                        was 17 then and already inexorable.

                                 VARRICK

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 VARRICK
                        63 men, and she was a week from 17. 
                        I don’t need a goddamn refresher. 
                        She fulfilled it like every other 
                        assignment. That’s what she does, 
                        who she is. It’s constitutional. 

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Now she’s given herself one, no 
                        leash, the final assignment. 
                        Personal, primal. The gravity 
                        obviously profound to her.
                                 VARRICK
                        She’s dying, she’s got no time.

                                 MOTHER
                        Do you think that makes her less 
                        dangerous, or the most?

           SHINBASHI AVENUES 

           Kate barging through.
           Trailed inconspicuously.
           By multiple OPERATORS.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Right, so get your bloody head in 
                        this, acknowledge the cock-up and 
                        tell me how we survive it.

           She ducks into an ALLEY.
           TWO MEN hasten after.

                                 VARRICK (V.O.)
                        She’s covered, I already activated 
                        all local Operators, they’re--

                        Dead. 

           ALLEY: Dead Operators on the ground. No Kate.

                        What?

           ALLEY: FIGURE appearing behind the Men, they spin --

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        I’m getting flatlines all over 
                        town. 8th just went down. 

           -- Both dropping as corpses. Kate already gone.

                                 VARRICK 
                        We have no coverage on her?

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Kate hasn’t fired a shot that 
                        didn’t hit it’s target in over 
                        three decades. So stop fucking 
                        around, wake the other monsters and 
                        pray they get her before this all 
                        burns down!

                        I’m on it.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Please impress me.

           Click. She’s gone.
           Varrick’s phone DINGING with a message.
           File picture of Kate. Scroll of stats.
           He keys it. Sound of outgoing messages.
           Varrick shuts weary eyes...

           A SOUNDPROOFED ROOM

           Vacant, excepting a desk and chair.
           And A TALL DISFIGURED RUSSIAN MAN.
           Legs crossed, smoking in his skivvies.
           Turned away from open laptop on desk.
           Russian folk squawking from it’s speakers.

           AN ORNATE LEATHER TRUNK ON THE FLOOR

           THUMPING from inside.
           Something fidgeting in there.
           Someone.

           Noise suddenly stops. 
           He stands. Jangle of keys.
           Unlocks trunk with a CLICK.
           Throws it open with his foot.

           A NAKED MAN inside.
           Fetally contorted, purpled face.
           GASPS, eyes blasting open.
           Standing, face coming into light.
           Identical to the Disfigured Russian.
           His TWIN. Looming over. Even TALLER. 
           Untarnished face, feminine.

                                 DISFIGURED RUSSIAN
                             (sub’d Russian)
                        You had enough, you goat fuck?

           THE TWINS eyeing each other...
           Before Disfigured gets CHOKED up by the throat.
           Taller Twin ONE-HANDING it.
           SLAMMING him into wall, feet off the floor.

                                 TALL RUSSIAN
                        Why did you open? I said wait 5 
                        minutes after oxygen runs out.
           Disfigured GAGGING on cigarette. 
           Blood vessels stippling forehead.
           His own oxygen cut off, when...
           His expression turns orgasmic.
           Lurid smile pooling on face.
           WHAM! Taller one SLUGS him angrily.
           Disfigured grins in grotesque nirvana.
           WHAM! WHAM! Taller one keeps going.
           HAMMERING the smile into enamel.

           On the desk, laptop PINGS with notification.
           Picture unfolding on screen.
           Kate’s.

           WHAM! WHAM! KRAK! The pain/pleasure continues...

           THE PUNK knits through the crowds. 
           25-year old Japanese girl, blowing gum bubble.
           Sonic Youth Goo t-shirt, worn jacket, Beats headphones.
           HMV tote bag on elbow, records poking out.
           Backpack hanging loose. Hip Harajuku DJ.
           Guitar riff on phone announces new message.

           Gum bubble pops, Punk grins, zips ‘em into backpack. 

           AT THE CURB

           She’s REVVING a Ducati 1098S.
           1090cc engine, 169 miles/hour.
           VROOM! She’s gone...

           UPSCALE APARTMENT

           THE ALBINO sits in the middle of the floor.
           Silenced gun in lap. Shoes next to him.
           HOURS LATER

           Above him, sound of a door opening. 
           Muffled footsteps. A man and woman talking.
           Albino stands, staring intently at ceiling. 
           Footsteps above moving about. 
           He tracks the louder of the two into,

           THE BEDROOM

           His socked feet gliding slightly across floor. 
           A COUPLE in bed. Bullet holes in foreheads.
           Albino lulls, exactly where the footsteps above do.
           Muted voice. It’s a man’s.
           He gauges, identifies where his target should be.
           Lifts gun. Careful aim. Five suppressed SHOTS.
           THUD of a body above. Done.
           Albino heads back. Dismantling gun as he goes.
           Tucking pieces into coat. Yanks vibrating cell.
           New message. He opens it, a picture.
           You know whose.

           A woman begins to scream in apartment above...

           NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

           THE KOREANS march through arrivals terminal.
           SIX of them. Sullen faces. Race-car jackets. 
           All of them on their cells. Listening.

           A PAIR OF KIA STINGERS

           Red and Yellow. Await them at the curb.
           Sleek bit of Korean engineering. 
           All six break into simultaneous grins...

           UNKNOWN SPACE

           A derelict OPERA HOUSE. 
           Stage up front. Gaudy furniture, chandeliers.
           An opera in progress, not one you’ve seen.
           A perverse variation, Grand Guignol variety.
           Bad lighting sparing us the amoral acts of horror.
           Weeping violins in corner accentuating SQUEALS.

           An audience of one. 
           THE PRIESTESS stands alone. In snug green qipao.
           She’s a sight. Easy on the eyes, hard to look at.
           Milky left eye. Face chiseled to porcelain sheen.
           Crooked stance. Deformity in inked leg. Accented by heels. 
           Someone approaches. On all fours. Unseen.
           Presenting cellphone. She scoops it without looking.
           Brings it up. Face-to-face with Kate.
           An infernal grin scythes her face...
           GINZA STREETS. NIGHT

           Ritzy shopping district.
           Tokyo’s Fifth Avenue.
           Insane masses.
           KATE stomping through.
           Bulldozing rather. 
           An unnatural presence.
           Like something that doesn’t belong.

           Breath catching suddenly.
           MUSCLE SPASM attacking mid-stride. 
           Kate staggering, clutching chest.
           Hand coming away BLOODY.
           Shirt SOAKED through.

           PHARMACY 

           Kate lumbering in.
           Coat buttoned over shirt.
           Careening through aisles.
           Eyes lucid with torment. 
           Snatching bandages, gauze, iodine.

           AT THE CASHIER

           Cashier sniffing, recoiling.
           Like he smells something hideous.
           Kate slamming down smudged bills. 

           PHARMACY RESTROOM

           Kate locking the door.
           Unbuttoning coat, shrugging out.
           Peeling off shirt, wincing in unbidden agony.
           Stench of searing flesh like a gut punch.
           Her torso a nightmare.
           Old WOUNDS OPENING UP.
           Skin bubbling, BLISTERING.

           Stuffing bandages whole into mouth.
           Biting down hard as she can.
           POURING iodine on the wounds.
           Roaring through mouthful of bandages.
           Tears glazing cheeks.
           Collapsing on lidded toilet.

           Rips open gauze.
           Banding it over wounds. Tight, tight, tight.
           Taping it down.
           Catches her breath. Eyes distant. 
           Everything before was pain. 
           This is different.
           This feels like dying.
           BACK IN THE PHARMACY 

           Lurching out through the aisles.
           Noticing nicotine patches on shelf.
           Pausing...

           GINZA STREETS

           Kate SPARKING a cigarette.
           Wading through the mobs.
           Taking hefty pull, exhausts a cathartic gust. 
           Catching reflection in store window.

           100 miles of bad road. 
           Bottle of Lafite poking outta coat pocket.
           She takes another drag.

           MATSUYA DEPARTMENT STORE

           Kate striding onto luxury floor.
           Scanning clothing racks.
           Zeroing on exactly what she wants.
           Plucking items without stopping.

           DRESSING ROOM

           Snapping on fresh clothes.  
           Same fierce scrutiny and precision. 
           Jeans. Shirt. Pea coat.
           Cloaking guns and ammo.
           Strategically accessible spots. 
           Perfect outfit. Immaculate. Chic.
           Her war uniform.
           Final glance in mirror.
           Pain SWELLING into FLASHBACK,
                                                 OUTSIDE UPSCALE RESTAURANT
           MOTHER and KID KATE stand holding hands. A HOST apologizing.

                                 HOST
                        We had to cancel all reservations 
                        for a private event tonight. We--

                                 MOTHER
                        I’ll be having a word with Reitman 
                        tomorrow. Either way, she needs to 
                        use the loo, show her in, will you?

           Host hesitates. But relents under Mother’s stare. Smiling,

                                 HOST
                        Of course. This way, little lady. 

           INSIDE. Kate trails him towards the back. Place occupied by a 
           DOZEN MEN in suits. More HEAVIES on the fringes.
                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Your first job in the real world. 
                        We don’t have an exact head count, 
                        but you know the target and the 
                        layout. You’ll have a Glock, 15 
                        rounds. It’s all you can conceal 
                        inside, so make it count. Car will 
                        pick you up at the rear exit.

           As they approach the main table, Kate stops, taking a knee. 
           Host turns, sees her tying her shoe. Smiles. It disappears 
           when she comes up. Aiming a Glock 19 at the Target.

           A stunned pause. As she pulls the trigger.

           Click! It’s empty.

           Everyone deflates with laughter. This silly kid...

           One snatching the Glock, exclaiming, “It’s real!”

           Everyone reacting, snapping into action, guns coming up.
           Kate swiping a steak knife off table, LUNGING FORTH --

           OUTSIDE. KRAK! KRAK! KRAK!  Muted GUNFIRE echoes from inside.
           SEDAN idling by rear exit. Finally, door opens. Kate emerges. 
           Soused in blood. Not hers.

           SEDAN. Kate climbs into backseat. Mother waiting there.

                                 MOTHER
                        Is he dead?

                                 KID KATE
                        They’re all dead.

                                 MOTHER
                        The job’s done. Good.

                                 KID KATE
                        The gun was empty. Was it another 
                        test?

                                 MOTHER
                        The final one. This, is graduation. 

                                 KID KATE
                        What now?

           Points at Kate’s soiled clothes,

                                 MOTHER
                        We get you new suits, and you start 
                        working.
                          KATE GROWING UP THROUGH A TYPHOON OF KILL-TABLEAUS
           Similar. Bodies slathered around. Kate standing over them, 
           coolly reloading. Getting older with each successive one. 

           Kate painfully WINCES OUT.
           Eyes her cell battery: 38%
           Then she’s gone.

           NIHONBASHI STREETS

           Business district north of Ginza.
           A convoy winds past the Stock Exchange. 
           Dark SUVs and Toyota Century sedans. 
           Pull up behind a slab-stone OFFICE BUILDING. 
           Sixteen car doors open simultaneously. 
           The Yakuza emerge.
           Young kobun escort an old oyabun to entrance. 
           Fleet of shatei there bow in sync as he walks in. 

           FOUR BLACK-SUITED MEN GAWK AT US

           Lit cigarettes dangle from gaping maws.
           Or between fingers.
           Frozen in place.
           Someone painfully GURGLING offscreen.
           They all blink...

           A Man staggers backwards into frame.
           Throat clutched, blood spitting through.
           Collapses at their feet.
           They look down at him, then back up.
           Collectively whip out tanto blades.
           Crouch for attack.

           KATE

           Flicks her cigarette.
           Moves at them.
           Pan up to reveal.
           They’re in front of that same BUILDING.

           SUMIYOSHI BOARD ROOM

           Business meeting.
           Yakuza gone corporate.
           Office suites the new compounds.

           Two old oyabun (Bosses). 
           Sumiyoshi. Kozakura.
           Making vile transactions over dinner.
           Sex slaves for weapons. 
           Pair of kobun (proteges). 
           One stands guard, other works device.
           Projecting pictures onto wall.
           Of young girls, boys. Their ages.  

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        The last batch was anemic, used up, 
                        their hair and teeth fell out 
                        within a month, you can’t just feed 
                        them boiled eggs and energy drinks.

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN
                        That’s why we took care of their 
                        disposal, so you didn’t have to.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        I still have to account for the 
                        money and weapons.

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN
                        I’ll throw in my sokaiya’s files on 
                        Nippon Electronics, that’s about 80 
                        million in blackmail currency.

           Off a polite nod-smile,

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN (CONT’D)
                        You’re the first to pick from this 
                        new batch. Foreigners all, I have 
                        their passports with me --
                             (tapping briefcase)
                        -- so we can conclude this tonight.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        These are all 17 and older, you 
                        mentioned you had younger?

           Old man’s lips contorting into lewd smile.

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN
                        Yes, much younger. However for 
                        those, we will have to renegotiate 
                        the weapons bargain and--

           WHACK!
           Door gavels in.
           Kate stepping forth like a judgement from god.
           Blood-specked countenance. 
           Instantly changing the temperature of the room.

           Guttural reactions, shouts.
           Kobun moving, weapons out.
           Kate faster. Ruger in her hand.
           KRAK! KRAK!
           A shot each. Chests. Center mass.
           Both spun like tops. Flailing down.

           Oyabun panicked, staggering up.
           Kate shrinking them right back.
           Kozakura Boss, gun to his head.

                                 KATE
                        You Sato?
                             (bug-eyed, shaking ‘no’)
                        Kujun Sato, where is he?

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN
                        Don’t know, I don’t know Sato-san! 

                                 KATE
                        Who arranged the hit on the 
                        Minister’s Aide?

           Reaction flitting across his face.
           But he keeps shaking his head.
           Kate gleaning it.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t answer, I shoot you dead.

                                 KOZAKURA OYABUN
                        I don’t know what you ask, please! 

           KRAK! Headshot.
           Red Rorschach’s the wall. 
           Gun panning to second Boss.

                                 KATE
                        Same question. Same deal.

           His eyes ballooning from sockets.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        You killed him! He’s Kozakura 
                        oyabun! He-- you don’t know what 
                        you done!

                                 KATE
                        He’s dead, worry about you. You’re 
                        Sumiyoshi?

           No answer. Dazed. 
           Eyes fastened to the corpse.
           She snaps her fingers.
           Yanking him from his trance.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        Yes-- yes, I am Sumiyoshi.
           Looking up at her now.
           Anger shifting his demeanor. 
           Turning defiant. Setting jaw.
           Someone MOANING on floor.
           One of the kobun, still alive.

                                 KATE
                        Who ordered the hit yesterday?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        I don’t know.

                                 KATE
                        Does Sato know?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        Kujun Sato, does he know?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        No, he is not-- Sato? No.

                                 KATE
                        You know him then. Where is he?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        Sato is-- he is my kobun, he does 
                        not know these matters, he--

                                 KATE
                        Where is he?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        22nd floor.

                                 KATE
                        In here?

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        Yes, but--

           She’s tugging his tie.
           Jerking him upright.
           Spinning him towards entrance.
           Ruger stabbing his ear.
           Split-second before,
           A PLATOON OF YAKUZA ARRIVES.
           20 deep. Guns aimed. Frothing mad.

                                 KATE
                        Drop your weapons and your pants 
                        and back off, else he dies. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (jabbing further)
                        Translate. They don’t comply, 
                        you’re dead.

           No choice, Boss quickly obliges.
           Deafening explosion of reactions.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        They will not listen to order, say 
                        they understand I am under pressure 
                        and that they can kill you.

           Kate frigid, mouth set in hard, grim lines.

                                 KATE
                        This is an SR45, 10-round clip, now 
                        down to 7. That inhale before you 
                        pull the trigger, I’ll have already 
                        put down 4 of you, your rounds will 
                        then hit your boss while I execute 
                        3 more, swiping a higher capacity 
                        weapon and ending the rest. 

           They stand firm.
           MOANING on floor gets louder, pained...

           A rattlesnake-instant, KRAK!
           Moaning stops.
           No one saw her arm move.
           Scalding barrel already back in ear.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You blink and you die in the dark.

           Boss growls, barking order.

                                 SUMIYOSHI OYABUN
                        Do as she says! Bakayaro! That’s an 
                        order! All of you! Right now!

           That’s it. Stand-off over.
           Guns wane, clatter. Pants drop.
           Men backpedalling into hallway.
           Kate prodding the Boss out. 

           22ND FLOOR

           Open floor plan. Burgundy-lit.
           Tarped floor. Drain-ducted.
           A WOMAN death spams in pooled blood.
           Inciting WAILS from A MAN bound to chair.
           Worked on by SATO.
           An overstuffed pit viper in a suit.
                                 SATO
                        She’s dead, bakayaro, stop puling!

           Man bawls on, eyeing his wife’s stiff.
           Another Yakuza GRUNT stands near.
           Sato sighs, tells him to,

                                 SATO (CONT’D)
                        Enough, make him stop.

           Grunt jams fingers into Man’s mouth. 
           Adds a fresh incision.
           Blood spumes by the liter. 
           Man gags, muffled screams. 

                                 SATO (CONT’D)
                        Innocent young bride. What a shame. 
                        At least you don’t have kids, 
                        imagine seeing your little ones 
                        worked on like that?

           Grunt yanks his fingers.
           Man gurgles, vomiting blood. 
           Urine soaking his leg.
           Sato disgusted, bored, waving it off.

                                 SATO (CONT’D)
                        I’m done, finish him.

           Grunt severs the Man’s throat
           Stepping back to avoid arterial gush, as--

           WHAM! Door splits.
           Figure crossing threshold.
           Kate, a golem bathed in burgundy.

           Shoving the Boss inside.
           He slip-wobbles on puddled blood.
           Almost comical. 
           As Grunt pulls his gun--

           KRAK!
           Kate blasts him through frontal lobe.
           His head snaps then wilts. 
           Body swaying on feet. Nerves mangled.
           Arm slapping side. Twitching abnormally.
           Spasming eyes agape. LOBOTOMIZED.

           Frisson of fear, Sato BLEATS. Backpedals.
           Kate hovering over. Imposing. Almost mythic.
           A principle given human form.

                                 KATE
                        Sato?
           He keeps stuttering back.
           Kate fixing him with those dead eyes.
           Cinders now. Demonic under the light.
           Reflecting his mortality.

                                 SATO
                        Yes, I am Sato. But--

                                 KATE
                        You poisoned me. Why?

                                 SATO
                        Poison? I don’t-- who are you?

           KRAK! His knee detonates, blown tire.
           He squeals to the ground.

                                 KATE
                        Yesterday’s hit, I was put up and 
                        poisoned in the hotel you run.

                                 SATO
                        Please! I only collect money from 
                        hotels, I don’t know anything else!

                                 KATE
                        Who knows, who arranged the hit?

                                 SATO
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        It was the Sumiyoshis. I want the 
                        person who made my accommodation?

                                 SATO
                        Different department, I don’t know!

                                 KATE
                        Which floor?

           He clutches his ruined knee, pleads.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        This is the Sumiyoshi compound, 
                        where is it, which floor?

                                 SATO
                        Not here! They not here tonight!

                                 KATE
                        I want a name and address.

           She’s dragging him by pants leg.
           Towards window. His nails scraping plastic. 

                                 SATO
                        Stop! Stop, please!

                                 KATE
                        Name and address or you go out the 
                        window.

                                 SATO
                        They out of town tonight, karaoke 
                        in Golden Gai! Please!   

           Sato wailing, drenched in blood and sweat.
           FOOTFALLS pounding outside. Dozens.

                                 KATE
                        Name. Address. 

                                 SATO
                        Kishikawa! It’s his department! At 
                        Golden Gai Karaoke tonight!

           YAKUZA FLEET REACHING THE DOOR. 
           Freezing. Absorbing the scene. Awed. 

           Entire floor a crimson nightmare.
           Boss soaking on ground. 
           Ogling lobotomized Grunt. 
           Still swaying to and fro, a pendulum. 
           Dead eyes, lips fauceting spit.
           Blood gasping from wound.

           Kate at the window, Sato by the pants.
           Flicking oxycodone straight from tube.
           Like Mentos. Swallowing dry.

                                 KATE
                        Kishikawa, Golden Gai Karaoke?

                                 SATO
                        Yes, yes-- Kishikawa!

           As the lobotomized Grunt flops.
           A spasming tangle of limbs.
           All eyes snapping to him, when--
           SMASH! Sato gets tossed through window.
           22 floors up, scream a fading echo...

           Yakuza reacting, flummoxed.
           Kate’s not there, already gone. 
           Isn’t running to hide.

           She’s coming at them.
           KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK!
           1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of them go down.
           Pirouetting blood.
           Before even getting a shot off.
           Kate halfway there, dropping Ruger.
           Cycling out the Glock.
           Men rushing in one-by-one.
           Getting felled just as fast.
           1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more. Rapid-fire.
           Headshots all. 

           Rest shooting blind, backtracking.
           Hitting their Boss’ face. 
           Realization eliciting horror. 
           Not for long.
           KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK!
           Brains blasted to burgundy wine.
           Their bodies sack the floor.
           Clearing doorway. 
           Kate stepping through,

           INTO THE HALLWAY

           An apparition.
           Gun-grip shifting to C.A.R. method.
           Center Axis Reload. Max impact CQ flexibility.
           Dozen men shooting askew. 
           Kate blasting the next, before the last’s fallen.
           Every trigger pull, a death.
           No such thing as wounded.
           Burns a mag. Speedloads.
           Swaths on. Unrelenting. 
           Unstoppable.

           REAR ENTRANCE

           Gunshots echo from upstairs.
           Cavalcade of parked cars.
           Battalion of kobun by them.
           Convened over something on the ground.
           Sato’s CORPSE. What’s left of it anyway.
           All start arming up.

           14TH FLOOR STAIRWAY/LANDING

           Dozen Yakuza pounding up stairs.
           Trio approaching landing door, when--
           WHAM! A BODY SPLATS down from above.
           All necks crane up simultaneously, as--
           KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK!
           Slugs explode through the door.
           Peppering the trio.

           Kate slamming out a beat later. 
           Emptying clip into one.
           Twisting another’s gun-hand.
           Blasting three more with it. 
           Using him as shield. 
           Rampaging down stairs to the, 

           13TH FLOOR LANDING

           Letting go of his pulped body. 
           It slumps besides the rest. 
           One still alive, wounded, groaning.
           Painfully aiming up at her, squeezing.
           Kate calmly cocks her head to the side.
           BANG! He misses by a mile.
           KRAK! She doesn’t.

           More rushing up the stairs
           Kate coolly deviating course.

           9TH FLOOR MESS HALL

           Mob of kobun mobilizing in a huff. 
           Gunfire cracking outside like morse code.
           Tanto blades out, they rush the door.
           Banging open before they reach it.

           Kate hurtling in, gun clicking dry.
           Instantly stormed by blades.
           Blocking with arm, one STABBING through.
           Tugs it out, holding it like a chisel.

           Meets them head on.
           Her arm flashing. 
           Puncturing heart, kidney, liver. 
           Blood flowers blossom.
           First man dying on his feet.
           Second, third, fourth going down.
           Kate getting SLASHED.
           Pain FLARING through,
                                                 IMPRESSIONISTIC FLASHBACKS
                                                YOUNG KATE getting slashed.
           JABBING another neck.
                                                         HELLO-KITTY WAVING
           And another.
                                                  KID KATE KNIFING A TARGET
           And another.
           Pure muscle memory.
           Punting the last one into adjoined,

           BACKROOM

           He smashes through.
           TEN YAKUZA here loading guns.
           See Kate barging in weaponless.
           Face quivering with pain.
           Eyes trembling, getting overcome,
                                                         FRENZIED FLASHBACK
           PARISIAN LOUNGE. Same scenario. Armed gangsters. YOUNG KATE 
           jolting in. Utterly fearless. Palming one’s nose into his 
           skull, wrenching gun. Carving into the rest. Whirling dervish 
           of death. Churning blood and smoke. Last body drops and we...

           SNAP OUT into a similar haze.
           Kate wincing on one knee. Gore soaked.
           Not hers. Entire room lays gutted.

           VIAL in mouth, stabs it with HYPODERMIC.
           Pulling plunger, loading it. 
           Tapping a vein, burying needle into arm.
           Eyes shuddering close, absorbing the drugs.
           Opening to a smoother world. Manageable. 
           Up now. Already moving.
           Re-arming as she does.
           Can’t stop. No time.

           6TH FLOOR STORAGE ROOM

           Dingy. Weapon crates line the walls.
           Tattoo needle BUZZING under BLARING hip-hop.
           Kobun face down on gurney, getting inked.
           Others encircling someone on the floor.

           A YOUNG JAPANESE GIRL.
           13-year old ANI.
           Mess of black and fuchsia Manga hair.
           Mini skirt. Knee-high socks.
           Holding a beer and fuck-you staring back.
           At the men hurling insults and beer.

           WHAM! Goes the door.
           Men getting PLUGGED before she even enters.
           Rapid-reloading a Glock. Here’s Kate.

           Tattoo Artist fumbling for weapon.
           Getting neck speared by tattoo gun.
           Kate one-handing it. 
           Last man’s got a blade to Ani’s throat.

                                 YAKUZA
                        Stop, I kill her! You--

           Kate BLASTS him mid-sentence.
           He catapults backward dead.
           Splotching Ani’s face with his blood.
           Shortest hostage crisis in history.

           Kate and Ani the only ones standing.
           Eyeing each other...
           Before Kate’s moving again. 
           Pain SLUGGING her, 
                                                  INCITING FLASHBACK
           LIVING ROOM. Kid Kate. Bloodied. Flanked by dead parents. 
           Staring defiant. Same expression as Ani’s. At an impasse... 

           Snapping out in a WINCE.
           Knuckles grinding into temple.
           Staggering on.
           One step. Two.
           Pain LASHING harder.
           SEIZING her,
                                           CAPTIVE TO SAME FLASHBACK
           Kid Kate. Fork in the road. We know which way she went... 

           WRENCHING out.
           Looking back at Ani.
           Frozen in the same spot. 
           Blood-doused stone face. Angry eyes. 
           Hasn’t crossed the Rubicon yet.
           Still time for her.  
           Can go either way.
           Both sizing each other up...

           Then Kate nods begrudgingly.
           Instant grin, Ani bolting over.
           Taking Kate’s hand. Kate freeing it. 

                                 KATE
                        Stay behind me.

           Cracking open crate.
           Lined with M67 GRENADES. 
           Peers at the SERVICE ELEVATOR.

           THE LOBBY

           All the kobun swarming in.
           Sumiyoshi and Kozakura. 
           Half rushing the stairs.
           Other splitting towards,

           THE ELEVATOR BANKS.
           Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.
           Every elevator arriving simultaneously. 
           Men freezing up, guns steady.

           Ones by the stairs gawking up.
           At A BODY plummeting from above.
           SPLAT! Tattoo Artist’s corpse.
           Clothes stuffed full of M67’s.

           ELEVATOR DOORS PARTING.
           Bodies in each one.
           Similarly stuffed.
           Split-second to react before--

           WHOOM!
           The entire lobby blows out.

           THE REAR SERVICE ELEVATOR

           Arriving a beat later. 
           Kate and Ani emerging.
           Calmly making their exit.

           TOKYO STREETS

           SIRENS wailing nearby.
           Kate and Ani navigating side street.
           Neon-drenched city imposing over them.
           Ani wiping off her face.

                                 ANI
                        Kuu-sooo. I feel like shit.
                             (up at Kate)
                        What’s your name? I’m Ani.

           Kate doesn’t even look. Ani sulking,

                                 ANI (CONT’D)
                        What’s your problem?

           Kate hastening, turning corner.
           Past large ELECTRONICS STORE.
           Ani rushing to catch up.

                                 ANI (CONT’D)
                        Slow down, freaky gaijin!

                                 KATE
                        Go home.

           Her footsteps instantly ceasing.
           Kate throwing a casual look back.
           Ani tremoring in front of store window.
           Eyeing wall of TVs, a news report.
           Picture of the murdered Minister’s Aide.

           The man Kate killed.

                                 ANI
                        My dad, they killed my dad...

           Gust of anguish blowing through her like a train.
           Shuddering, gasping, WHEEZING, unable to breathe.
           Kate lulls, watching Ani palpitate...
           Finally,

                        out which ones can be utilized.  

           GUN RANGE. Kids lined up assembling weapons. Shooting. Kate 
           among them. Flinching with each kickback. 

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Weapons must become an extension of 
                        your body. Using them, second-
                        nature. Like breathing. And 
                        remember, anything can be a weapon.

           VIEWING ROOM. Kids stood in a circle, watching some abhorrent 
           act in the middle. Too repulsive, too graphic, too horrifying 
           to show. Wide eyes quivering. One pukes. Another faints.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Nothing can frazzle you, derail 
                        your focus, no matter how toxic.

           GYM. Kids paired off, sparring. Brutal. Bloody.

           VIEWING ROOM. Kate watches nonchalantly. Dead eyed gaze. 

           GYM. Kate’s opponents getting bigger. And older. Going down 
           all the same. One hit takedown. Kate always the one standing. 

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        All things pass away.

           ENDURANCE ROOM. Kate getting assaulted in chair. Deadpan 
           glaze. Body pummeled. Mind elsewhere. Controlling the pain.

           SHOWER. No tears anymore. No soul either. All remnants of 
           humanity vaporized.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        God never changes.

           MAZE. Kate blowing through the mazes. More chaotic they are, 
           the faster she clears them. Insane focus and will. 

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Teach yourself stillness.

           SMALL CHAMBER. Kid Kate sits across the table from a Boy, 
           fellow recruit. A disassembled gun before both.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)

                        out of that room or you both die.

           BUZZER goes off. Both start swift assembly. Boy finishes, 
           aims at Kate. She’s already pulling the trigger. KRAK!

           OUTSIDE. Kate exits, hands gun to INSTRUCTOR, walks off 
           without a look. Instructor smiles, calls after:

                        No! Mine!

           Drinks. Burps. Giggles.
           They blink.

           GOLDEN GAI KARAOKE

           Black-suited Yakuza occupying main room.
           Spread out on mats, drinking. Drunk.
           One howls along to The Ramones’s Blitzkrieg Bop in Japanese.

           As the duo shoves Kate in.
           She drunk-staggers, clutching bottle.
           One bows to a MAN sitting aside, 

                                 ANGRY KOBUN #1
                        This drunk yariman keeps asking 
                        about you. She just killed Ryoji!

                                 KATE
                        You-- you’re Kishikawa then?

           KISHIKAWA watches her slug the bourbon.

                                 KISHIKAWA
                        Who is this gaijin whore?

           And Kate starts POURING it on him. 
           DOUSING him. Just like that. 
           Everyone instantly on their feet, roaring.
           Adjoining doors SLIDING open, more Yakuza.
           Kate SPARKING lighter next to his SOAKED face.
           Icing everyone in their tracks.

                                 KATE
                        You hired me to kill the Minister’s 
                        Aide. 

                                 KISHIKAWA
                             (wiping his eyes)
                        What?!

                                 KATE
                        You arrange and accommodate all 
                        hits for the Sumiyoshis, yes? 

                                 KISHIKAWA
                        I-- What?

                                 KATE
                        Next time I won’t repeat the 
                        question.

           Lowers the flame to his eyes.
           He squirms, squeezing them shut. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Your department handles the 
                        contractors, yes or no?

                                 KISHIKAWA
                        Yes, yes, but--

                                 KATE
                        Then you had me poisoned. Why?

                                 KISHIKAWA
                        No-- Sumiyoshi did not contract 
                        this, I promise to you!

           Yakuza encircling. Blades up. Tightening. 
           Kate unconcerned. Yanking him by his hair. 

                                 KATE
                        Then who?

                                 KISHIKAWA
                        Don’t know-- I-- maybe Kozakura.

                                 KATE
                        I was put up in your hotel, I was 
                        poisoned in your hotel.
                                 KISHIKAWA
                        Please! I promise we only take the 
                        girl-- the daughter, we kidnap her 
                        to make deal but he was killed 
                        before he arrived.

           Kate pausing. A dead-end. Confusion...
           Her SHOULDER TWITCHES. Flame jerked, flitting. 
           Everyone shifting, coiling. Kishikawa’s eyes darting.
           Kate RE-SPARKING. Thrusting it at his face.

                                 KATE
                        Name and address.

           Kate tearing a Glock off one.

           Punctuating the ensuing mayhem.

           Yakuza hustling Ani towards one.
           Mouth muffled, squirming mad.

           Cig in mouth, Kate lets the shorty rip.
           Doesn’t slow, doesn’t even look.

           WHA-CHACK-CHACK-CHACK!
           Windshields IMPLODING. 
           GLASS PEBBLING the Cops.
           Shielding eyes, ducking, STOMPING GAS.
           TIRES SQUEALING backwards in panic.
           Our duo already gone. Turning,

           ONTO CROWDED STREET

           PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
           Silent rounds WHIZZING in.
           PELTING wall above Kate’s head. 
           She drops, pulling Ani with her.
           Seconds before more drill the spot.
           Missing ‘em by this much.
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Up. Move. Keep moving.

           They zig-zag. Hectic. Divergent
           Kate’s eyes darting. 
           Scanning the ROILING CROWDS.
           Unable to spot,

           THE ALBINO

           Fusing in and out of the stampede. 
           Silenced Sig SPITTING. 
           Each shot from a new position.
           Dropping empty, cycling out another.
           Unrelenting. Closing in on,

           KATE

           Round PUNCHING shoulder.
           Blood flecking Ani.
           Shotgun slipping grasp.
           No time to reclaim it.

                                 ANI
                        You’re shot! You-- Who’s shooting?

           Kate yanking her down roughly.
           Second before bullets rip the spot.
           Recalibrating. Shoving Ani forward.

                                 KATE
                        Don’t look back. Two steps right, 
                        one left. Keep moving.

                                 ANI
                        What?

           Kate just tugging her along.
           Plowing through pedestrians.
           PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
           One taking a bullet. Then another.
           Blood misting the air.
           Kate calculating, snapping a glimpse of,

           THE ALBINO
           Sig held waist-level.
           Firing inconspicuously. 
           Eyes clasping for a second...

           Kate pulling her gun.
           SPASMING mid-move.
           CONTRACTION obliterating her thigh.
           She wobbles, COLLAPSING. 
           Pandemonium. Crowds stirring.
           Ani joining their SQUEALS. 

                                 KATE
                        Don’t stop! Keep moving, keep--

           Ani frozen, immobilized by fear. 
           Bullets THWACKING all around.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Turn around, move that way! 

           Kate wincing up, every ounce of strength.
           One LEG PARALYZED, thigh SOAKED through.
           Fist-sized open sore BUBBLING.
           Struggles GIMP-LEGGED towards the kid.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Go! I’ll cover you!

           Ani snapping out, turning.
           Just as, PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!
           Rounds carve Kate’s side.
           She stutters. Goes down again.
           Gun skimming away.
           Ani YELPING, rushing back.
           A guttural bark,

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I said go! Keep moving!

           New ingredient in her voice.
           Emotion. Heated with concern.
           Kid refusing, tear-glazed faced.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Ani, stop! Turn around!

           Crowds dissipated, Albino emerging.
           Ani now taking Kate’s hand.
           As Albino aims, dead-on...

           PHUT! PHUT! PHUT! PHUT!
           Tiny shuriken LODGE into his limbs.
           EXPLODE without sound.
           The Albino QUIVERS, drops gun.

           FOUR FIGURES materialize behind him.
           All black. Balaclava masks. 
           One grabs Albino’s face. 
           Unceremoniously opens his throat.
           Another approaches Kate,

                                 MASKED FIGURE
                        Show me your hands.
           TOKYO STREETS. LATER

           TWIN BLACK SUVs navigate the neon wonderland.

           FRONT SUV

           Kate in the back. Hands zip-tied.
           FLANKING FIGURES bear KRISS Vector SMGs.
           LEAD FIGURE sits across.
           Next to Ani, still dazed.
           Everyone staring at Kate...

           All simultaneously unmask.
           All WOMEN. Stoic. Severe.
           We’ve seen two of them.
           The Lead speaks in academic English,

                                 THE MIKO
                        I’m not going to ask who you are. 
                        Because I know what you are. You’ve 
                        set half our city on fire tonight. 

                                 KATE
                        I’ve seen you. At a murder scene. 
                        Rifling a dead man’s pockets.

           The Lead eyes the others, considers.
           As recognition flits across Ani’s face.

                                 THE MIKO
                        We are The Miko. Autonomous 
                        Japanese intelligence. We keep 
                        things manageable. And we do not 
                        officially exist.

                                 KATE
                        Don’t mind me, I’m almost done.

                                 THE MIKO
                        Almost? It’s going to take a very 
                        long time to put out these fires. 

                                 KATE
                        Maybe you can point me in the right 
                        direction then. Expedite this.

                                 THE MIKO
                        What you want is not our concern. 
                        Our concern is the ‘dead man’ and 
                        what he had. So we can stop this 
                        before the whole city burns down.

                                 KATE
                        Dead man. Ani’s father.
                                 THE MIKO
                        He had evidence linking government 
                        officials to the Yakuza. Sending 
                        the two largest clans into panic. 
                        He was in hiding so the Sumiyoshis 
                        kidnapped his daughter to exchange 
                        for it. But he got killed en route. 

           Ani reacts, a million gears churning.

                                 KATE
                        Who contracted the hit? Susumu?

                                 THE MIKO
                        Kozakura boss, yes. To eradicate 
                        the problem. Unaware that the 
                        Sumiyoshis had also taken steps.

                                 KATE
                        But you were shadowing the Aide.

                                 THE MIKO
                        We couldn’t get to him in time. So 
                        we tried to secure the drive, and 
                        realized he didn’t actually have 
                        it. He’d given it to someone no one 
                        would think of. The only person he 
                        trusted.

           Turns to Ani. Her eyes damp, swallowing.

                                 THE MIKO (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that right, Ani?

           Ani shaking her head.

                                 THE MIKO (CONT’D)
                        You’re a brave girl, Ani. Where did 
                        you hide it?

           Impatience swelling,

           Lead smiles. It never reaches her eyes.
           Drops the facade and nods at Kate.

                                 THE MIKO
                        And who do you think she is, a 
                        ‘good guy’?

           Kate knows what’s coming.
           Her eyes burgeoning with panic.

                                 THE MIKO (CONT’D)

           Ani walloped, her whole world rocked again.

           Doesn’t know how to.
           We can’t see it, but her heart’s breaking.
           Ani instantly knows it’s the truth.
           Devastated. Spiraling.
           Betrayal inducing tears.

                                 THE MIKO

                        all of this. Just give it to me.

           Ani toughening, shaking head.
           Getting yanked by her hair.
           SLAPPED. Hard.

                        You hit her again, I’ll kill you.

           Lead pauses.
           SLAP! Makes Ani bleed.
           Kate returns a hostile look.
           Memorizing her face.
           To do something medieval to it...

           But VOMITS instead.
           Spewing BLOOD all over the Lead.
           Stunned for a moment.
           Before she SOCKS Kate, CRUNCHING cartilage.

                                 THE MIKO
                        I’ll make the kid pay for this.

           She turns back to Ani.
           And something growls.
           Something infernal,

                                 KATE
                        Shouldn’t have touched her.

                        What the fuck are you going to do?
           Spins on Kate again.
           Something off about her.
           All eyes drifting down to...
           Kate’s hands: free now.
           Simultaneous reaction,

                                 THE MIKO (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit...

           Too late. Kate LAUNCHES --

           DESERTED STREET

           -- SUV SWERVES.
           Careens wild. Overturns.
           Skid-slamming the curb.

           Smoke wafts. Dirt too.
           Then, CRACK!
           Windshield blows outward.
           Kate waddles out.
           KRISS Vector in hand.

           SECOND SUV burning a fierce 180.
           Donating it’s tires to the city.
           Masked Miko leaning out.
           Assault weapons aimed.

           Kate unconcerned, limping towards back window.
           SUV nigh. Gunfire imminent. 3, 2, 1--
           When almost an afterthought,
           Kate lifts the KRISS.
           Razors the SUV.
           60 rounds/sec.
           Punched like colander.
           SUV fishtails, SKIDS past. Capsizes. 
           Flames blossom, engulfing it.

           Kate hasn’t even looked.
           She’s peeking into the back window,

           INVERTED SUV

           Ani mashed in a corner.
           Only one alive. 
           Angry, eye-spearing Kate.
           Kate blinks back.
           No words for this in her software.
           Just extends her hand.

           Ani ignores it.
           Starts to say something.
           Is overcome.
           Just looks away, nostrils aflare.
           Kate withdrawing her hand
           To cover mouth.
           Brutal coughing fit.
           She sways, woozy, reeling.
           Clocking cell life: 9%
           Sucks a breath, turns.
           And limps off...

           Ani squirms out after a moment.
           Looks after Kate, seething.
           Starts stumbling the other way...

           When suddenly, a ROAR.
           REV of a Ducati.
           Here she comes,

           THE PUNK

           Thundering in.
           Devil-horned helmet.
           One-arming a BFR.

           Kate whirls.
           Sees Ani exposed in the middle.
           Punk closing fast.
           Doesn’t calculate, doesn’t think.
           Just breaks into a peg-legged run.

                                 KATE
                        Ani, get down!

           Ani drops, as--
           The Punk opens up.
           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
           BFR coughing thunder.
           50 cal rounds BLOWING asphalt chunks. 

           Kate sprays the KRISS.
           Punk veering into zig-zag.
           Ani going fetal, HOWLING.
           Bullets SPARKING all around.
           Punk approaching fast.
           Kate hobbling on one good leg.

           Two forces of nature.
           Thrashing towards each other.
           Round GRAZING Kate’s gun arm.
           She tosses it into the other.
           Resumes fire.

           Hits the Ducati
           Sends it SKIDDING.
           But the Punk’s rolled off.
           Pulling second BFR.
           Kate hitting empty.
           Still she persists.
           Deranged kamikaze yell.
           Round shaving her side.
           Nevertheless, she persists.
           But slower now.
           In a zombie stagger.
           One step, two, another.
           Almost to Ani...

           Punk striding up sans helmet.
           Face-to-face. 
           She aims at Kate.
           Lulls, something cruel twitching.
           Bloody grin, pans gun to Ani.
           Contorted into a shuddering ball.
           BOOM! 

           Blood SPLOTCHES Ani’s face.
           SHOVED outta the way. 
           Kate there instead.
           Took the round through her shoulder.
           Everyone stunned in that moment...

           Except Kate.
           Two lighting strides.
           She’s already on the Punk.
           Supinates an arm. Inverts a knee.
           And SNAP! Breaks her neck.
           The Punk drops dead.
           Kate looms over, lungs heaving
           Her back to Ani.

           Ani wipes her eyes, uprights.
           Watches Kate from behind.
           Neither moves. Or says anything.
           Just stand there.
           Among corpses. Fire. Smoke. Blood.
           SIRENS pulsing closer.

           Beat. Beat. Beat...

           Kate painfully lifts her arm sideways.
           Ani rushes beneath it, hefting.
           Supporting Kate.
           The pair slowly waddling off...

           RED-LIGHT DISTRICT

           Tokyo’s ‘Sleepless Town’.
           Hostess clubs. Love hotels.
           They elbow through crowds.

           Clutch of cars outside. 
           Cars we recognize. 
           THE KOREANS’ rides.

           Awed by the horror that is her body.

           More corpse now than a living thing.

                        The drugs have seized you. Poisons, 
                        sustaining your pain, and pleasure. 
                        Your synapses will misfire, there 
                        will be sensory glitches, it will 
                        heighten everything. 

           Tighter: Kate trembling with ineffable anguish.

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        This is pain you do not understand. 
                        The ropes are twisting your bones, 
                        disfiguring you, accenting the 
                        suffering to an ethereal degree. 

           Noises radiate from somewhere.
           MOANS. SCREAMS. All indiscernible. 

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        You must maintain a steady heart-
                        rate, even as the pain becomes 
                        unbearable. One wrong move, even a 
                        sharp exhale, and you fracture a 
                        100 bones at once.  

           Tighter: Kate’s breath RASPY, sawing in/out.
           Tighter: Tears flaring turgid eyes.

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        Brink of death, one foot in the 
                        void. No one has come this far. It 
                        is where you must remain, my pet. 
                        Until this misery becomes euphoric. 

           Scoops loaded SYRINGE off a table.
           Sinks it into her own cubital vein.
           Mouth curving lasciviously.
           Aroused whisper,

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        Fear is a potent aphrodisiac.

           Kate lost in a whirlpool of pain.
           Eyes burnishing with KALEIDOSCOPIC, 
                                                          MEMORY FLASHES
                                                 All the lives she’s taken.
                                                    Every. Brutal. Assault.
                                                              Never ending.
           The Priestess out of her qipao.
           Her body a canvas of hurt.
           Of abhorrent, eccentric self-abuse.
           One leg mauled, tattooed over.
           Milky eye fluttering, 

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        This undiluted agony, it is more 
                        glorious than I imagined.

                                                   KILLS STILL FLASHING
                                     EACH ONE JOLTING HER WITH NEW PAIN. 
                                             BLOW BY BLOW. KILL BY KILL.
                                             DELIVERING HER COMEUPPANCE.

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        We get what we deserve.

           Another body in the gloom now.
           THE SERF. Face tattooed like the Maori.
           Rope-binding The Priestess herself.

                                 THE PRIESTESS
                        You are being liberated from your
                        body. To be revived in a new form. 

           Kate sinking in a quicksand of memories,
                                                        SHORT-CIRCUITING
                                             KID KATE bloodsoaked and angry.
                                                HELLO-KITTY waving in neon.
                                                 ANI bloodsoaked and angry.

           Priestess quaking with pleasure. Pain.

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        Stay, my pet. We’re almost there...

           But Kate’s gone catatonic.
           Her light going out...
                                 Dim...          
                                       Dimmer...            
                                                 BLACK.
           Flatline. 

           Priestess silent. Bound chest heaving.
           Watching Kate through cloudy eye...

           KATE IN DARKNESS...  

                              Suddenly from within it, 
                              A silly JINGLE. Familiar...
                              A beacon.
                                                              A MEMORY STAB
                                                 Ani holding out her phone.

                                 ANI (V.O.)
                        In case of emergency...

           Her phone bleeping with ANI’S RINGTONE.
           Kate’s pulse SPIKES.
                                                               Ani sobbing.

                                 ANI (V.O.)
                        My dad, they killed my dad...

           Another surge, her fingers TWITCH.
                                                             Ani screaming.

                                 ANI (V.O.)
                        Kate!!!

           WRENCHING Kate back to life.
           Literally.
           Her eyes SLAM open.
           Bloodshot.
           She’s SCREAMING. HOWLING.
           CONVULSING. Through the pain.
           CRACK!
           Her ARM DISLOCATING again.
           LOOSENING within the bounds.
           Body WARPING unnaturally.

           The Priestess snapping fingers.
           The Serf retracting a step.
           As she SHEARS herself out of the restrains.

           Kate’s eyes welding to hers.
           Vision oscillating violently.
           Between reality and hallucinogenic hell.
           Priestess appearing a fiery hellion.

           Kate MUMBLING inaudibly.
           Priestess inching in close.

                                 THE PRIESTESS
                        Let me moisten these.
           To Kate’s parched lips.
           She licks them. Lingers there.

                                 THE PRIESTESS (CONT’D)
                        What was that, my pet?

           Kate weakly opens her mouth.
           Priestess brings up her face.
           And Kate BITES OUT HER JUGULAR.
           TEARS it right out.
           Priestess SPASMING.
           Shears in her hand SLICING rope and flesh.
           Kate RIPPING her arm free. 
           Snatching the shears.

           Priestess stunned, staggering back.
           GAGGING. CHOKING. WHEEZING.
           Clutching throat.
           Blood HISSING through fingers.

           Sending everyone into a frenzy.
           Workers BUCKING against their leashes.
           Serf rushing to The Priestess.

           As Kate SPITS out the throat.
           Three rapid CUTS to her binds.
           She THUDS to the ground.

           Serf failing to stifle the rupture.
           Priestess’ gaze still lasered on Kate.
           Pleased smile breaking her lips.
           She dies content.

           Serf throwing LATCH on wall.
           Chain-leashes SNAPPING loose. 
           Lights PULSING. Alarms WAILING.

           Workers blitzing Kate en masse.
           On her feet now.
           Plucking katana off samurai armor.
           Facing them one-handed.
           A lightning flurry of SLASHES.
           Too quick to register.
           They die where they stood.
           Collapsing in geysers of gore.

           Kate slamming Serf against wall.
           Hammering shears into gagging mouth.
           Like a railroad spike, THUNK!
           Pinning him to wall, CRACKING from impact.
           SPIDERWEBBING out. Real or optical glitch?

           Body deteriorated, Kate WOBBLES.
           SPRAWLING helpless on the floor...
           DING of text messages. 
           Cellphone atop pile of her clothes.
           Frayed breaths, she looks over.
           And starts elbowing towards it.
           COMMOTION rumbling outside.

           Kate reaching the cell.
           Life: 1%
           Text from Ani,

                                 ANI’S TEXT
                        I went to get the drive and the 
                        Yakuza kidnapped me (;_;)

           Note: Japanese emoticons are upright unlike US counterparts.

                        I decided I didn’t want to become 
                        like you. Wanted to make the right 
                        choice (._.)

           Scrolls to the last one.

                                 ANI’S TEXT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know where I am but I’m 
                        scared (O_O) I’m sorry I was angry. 
                        Will you come rescue me again Kate?

           Kate types back.

                                 KATE’S TEXT
                        Don’t be sorry. I’ll be right 
                        there.

           Pauses. Adds her first emoticon.

                                 KATE’S TEXT (CONT’D)
                        :)

           Sends the text and looks around.
           Gaze settling on the table.
           FOUR SYRINGES arrayed on it.
           Loaded with who-knows what.
           No other options, she squirms over.
           Palms all four. GRIPS ‘em tight.
           Inhales...

           And STABS them into her femoral.
           MASHING the plungers.
           Nothing happens...
           Steel door RATTLING.
           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

           Suddenly her eyes UNDULATE.
           Body ROCKED by the drug soup.
           Flooding her system.
           She THRASHES, then goes still...
           Cellphone finally going dark. Dead.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

           A FINGERNAIL scratches feebly.
           TOES shift, seeking purchase.
           A HAND plants itself.
           TEETH bared, a rictus of pain.
           Rising up, standing.
           Reaches full height.
           SNAPS the arm in place.
           And it has a name again,

           KATE

           Stands reborn. Bloody. Demonic.
           Senses surging, heightened. 
           Vision see-sawing, eyes ticking.
           Through a phantasmagoric inferno.
           Kicks open crate, GAS CANISTERS inside.
           Looks up at the SAMURAI ARMOR...

           OUT IN THE HALLWAY

           Throbbing lights and alarms.
           HORDE outside the door.
           Leather-garbed, head-to-toe.
           Bearing hatchets, bolos, hammers.

           WHAM! Door ruptures and STEEL QUIVERS.
           Torquing bodies in DETONATIONS OF GORE.
           CANISTERS roll out through heap.
           GAS-BOMBING the hallway.

           Before she emerges...
           Devilish gasmask atop soaked armor.
           Katana flexed in her grip.
           A roaring, nightmarish vision of hell.

                                 KATE
                        I’m coming, Ani!

           Senses peaking, vision fluctuating.
           Between real and surreal. 
           Everything distorted, warped.
           Or not. Impossible to tell here.
           Macabre figures lunge.
           Katana sings, down they go.
           In SPURTS of viscera.
           Kate cleaves through.
           Leaving them smeared on floor.
           Gunfire FLARES, streaking the soot.
           Rounds lacerate flesh, she howls.
           Wrangles gun, returns the gift. 
           RIBBONING the onslaught. Manic now, feral.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Just hold on!

           Sordid CHAMBERS line hallway.
           Twisted eyesores FLOODING OUT. 
           Real or phantasms, menacing all the same. 
           Kate hacks through unhinged. 
           In a frenzy. Deranged. Delirious.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming, baby, I’m--

           Argh! Brutal GASHES. Quarting blood. 
           Would put down an African elephant.
           Only make her angrier.
           She churns through the vile vertigo.
           Accented through her perception. 

           Emerges half standing. 
           Assembled eyes tracking her: 
           A blood-soaked beast. Primordial. Elemental.
           Facing a parade of grotesqueries. 
           Impossible odds. 
           She stares them down.
           Sunken eyes. Shot through with red.
           We glimpse the demon in there. 
           It growls. They take a step back. 

           It gets biblical.

           DARK DESERTED ALLEY

           Concealing heavy steel door.
           Entrance to Jigoku.
           Dead silent. Sound-proof door.

           RUSSIAN TWINS working on it.
           Fresh corpses at their feet.
           Door unbolts with a CLUNK.
           Opening into darkness.
           Faint noises echo from within.
           One brings up gun, enters.
           We stay out with the other.
           Standing lookout.
           Growing impatient...

           First one finally staggers back out.
           Takes a step, face plants.
           Claw-end of hammer jutting from skull.
           The other Twin SPINS and,
           Click! A gun prods his forehead.
           His eyes expanding at the bearer.

           YOYOGI PARK. NIGHT

           After-hours empty.
           VARRICK pacing alone.
           Irritated, checking watch, cell.
           Pauses when he hears RUSTLING. 
           Russian Twin stumbles from the gingko trees.

                                 VARRICK
                        It’s against protocol, meeting like 
                        this. What is it?

           Twin corkscrews to the ground. Revealing:

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        KATE. Oh Christ.

           Elated, hastening towards her.

                                 KATE
                        Stay there.

           Varrick stops and gawks.
           Looks like she went 20 rounds with a mountain lion.
           Or four. 
           An upright corpse.

                                 VARRICK
                        Let me take you to the hospital, 
                        Kate, you don’t have to go like 
                        this, don’t have to die in pain!

                                 KATE
                        That’s precious. I just killed a 
                        man you sent to kill me.

                                 VARRICK
                        Firm rules, nothing I could do. 
                        Forget that now, let me take you to 
                        the hospital, we’ll avoid the guns.

                                 KATE
                        There’s no avoiding the guns.

                                 VARRICK
                        What can I do? Anything, I’ll-- 
                        just tell me!

                                 KATE
                        I need intel.
           Argh! Kate ROARING in anguish.
           Violent CONVULSION.
           Entire body caught in eruption.
           VARRICK’S EMOTIONS CRESTING.

                                 VARRICK
                        Whatever you want to know! Just--

                                 KATE
                        Need to find someone. 

           Varrick at the boiling point.
           Frothing over. Enough!

                                 VARRICK
                        Who?! This has nothing to do with 
                        the Yakuza! The Firm killed you, 
                        Kate! It was their call, it was--

                                 KATE
                        You. You administered the poison.

           His silence confirming it.
           Tears pearling his eyes.

                                 VARRICK
                        Yesterday in Berlin. No one else 
                        could get close enough to you.

                                                                BERLIN CAFE
                                    Kate and Varrick toasting, sharing wine.

                                 KATE
                        Why?

                                 VARRICK
                        What you said, no one retires. It 
                        was supposed to hit after the job. 
                        The poison. Quick and clean. But...

           Genuine hurt on his face.
           Hers too.

                                 KATE
                        So they wouldn’t even have to look 
                        me in the eyes. After what they’ve 
                        made me. Well take a good look.

                                 VARRICK
                        It was the hardest thing I’ve ever 
                        had to do.

                                 KATE
                        And the money, my severance?
                                 VARRICK
                        Contingent upon you being alive. 
                        Unless it’s transferred outta those 
                        accounts, it all reverts back to 
                        The Firm when you expire.

                                 KATE
                        I’ve not expired yet.

           Another brutal SURGE.
           Kate one-knees the ground.
           Face flush with pain and tears.
           Varrick fighting back his own.

                                 VARRICK
                        I don’t care now, Kate, just let me 
                        get you help, let me-- there are 
                        drugs, treatments, we can make the 
                        pain disappear!

           Kate coming undone through gritted teeth,

                                 KATE
                        How the hell do you make the pain 
                        disappear? I’ve got an hour left. 
                        How do you make that pain 
                        disappear, Varrick? Tell me. Tell 
                        how you do that and I’ll let you. 
                        Tell me how you make it go-- how I 
                        make the knowledge that I’m gonna 
                        die having only ever been what they 
                        made me, a killer, a monster, a-- 
                        how do I make that disappear? How 
                        do I wipe that clean? I’ve got a 
                        fucking hour, how do I wipe it 
                        clean!? Tell me and I’ll-- Argh!

           Spasms wracking her body.
           Clenching and constricting.
           Struggling through the tremor.
           Pain echoing over the silence...

                                 VARRICK
                        I take responsibility for this, you 
                        hear me? I accept the punishment!

                                 KATE
                        I don’t want revenge.

           Corrals herself, gets vertical.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Not anymore. One hour, just need to 
                        do one thing.
                                 VARRICK
                        What’s that?

                                 KATE
                        Save a life. Little girl. Man I 
                        killed, his daughter, they’ve taken 
                        her. I need to know where.

                                 VARRICK
                        Why?

                                 KATE
                        Firm knows everything happening in 
                        the city. Tell me or I hurt you.

                                 VARRICK
                        Listen to me, for Christ’s sake, I 
                        don’t want anymore pain for you, 
                        just-- do away with me, give me my 
                        due! I want my comeuppance!

           KR-KRAK! Blown kneecaps.
           Varrick heaps with a shriek. 
           Grunts it all out,

                                 VARRICK (CONT’D)
                        They’ve meeting tonight, the entire 
                        Kozakura clan, compound in 
                        Marunouchi, they’ve got her there. 
                        You can’t take on all of them, 
                        Kate, not like this, you can’t take 
                        on all of the Yakuza!

           Kate recedes a step, darkness gathering on her.

                                 KATE
                        You have weaponry in the trunk?  

                                 VARRICK
                        It doesn’t matter now, Kate, saving 
                        a life. It won’t change anything.

                                 KATE
                        I know. Keys.

           He fumbles them out.

                                 VARRICK
                        Then why?

                                 KATE
                        There’s still time for her.

           As she snatches ‘em,
                                 VARRICK
                        Wait, don’t leave me here, please, 
                        kill me, just-- do me this favor.

           Kate lulls...
           Pulls notepad from his pocket.

                                 KATE
                        After you do something for me.

           MARUNOUCHI SKYLINE

           Steel and glass monoliths against the night.
           Tokyo’s central commercial district.

           THE KOZAKURA COMPOUND

           One of the cold, dark gargantuans. 32 stories. 

           19TH FLOOR HALLWAY 

           Two shatei march through, bursting into,

           SPARE ROOM

           Startling ANI, she screams, runs.
           Tall one kicks her down, yanks her hair.

                                 TALL YAKUZA
                        She wasn’t there, you lying little 
                        bitch!

           Short one notices her cell on the floor.
           Grabs it and scrolls the texts. 
           Taps the other’s shoulder, displaying it.
           Tall one reads, then orders.

                                 TALL YAKUZA (CONT’D)
                        Tell Susumu-san we won’t have to 
                        look for the gaijin anymore.
                             (grins at Ani)
                        You’re useless now. You get thrown 
                        in with the other underaged whores.

           DOCTOR’S OFFICE

           Low-rent. After hours.
           Kate sits on the desk. Gun in lap.
           Nervous DOCTOR administering a shot.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This will overwhelm the pain from 
                        the poison, maybe for an hour. But 
                        it will bring it’s own discomfort.
                                 KATE
                        Make it a double then.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This is impossible!

                                 KATE
                        I can feel myself going, Doc. I 
                        won’t last without another boost.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Thebaine at this dosage is itself a
                        poison. You will experience 
                        convulsions, seizures, your spinal 
                        column will curve on itself. The 
                        pain will literally paralyze you!

                                 KATE
                        Just give it to me.

           He regards her, states softly.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Death by asphyxiation or exhaustion 
                        is certain within the hour.

           Kate swallows. Digests.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Please. Take the lesser dose.

                                 KATE
                        It won’t get me to her.

           He eyes her gun.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Are you not a bad person?

           Kate considers...

                                 KATE
                        Not tonight.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Please, you will never survive the 
                        greater dose! What am I doing?!

                                 KATE
                        Helping someone try to save a 
                        little girl’s life.

           And maybe my soul...
           Doctor’s heart breaking for this woman,
                                 DOCTOR
                        I can give you NSAIDs to counteract 
                        the trismus, some pain. But not the 
                        seizures. This dose will mean your 
                        end. And it will hurt like hell.

           Kate locking eyes with him.

                                 KATE
                        She’s worth it.

           MATSUYA DRESSING ROOM

           Kate stands before mirror, eyes ablaze.
           Fire coursing through her insides
           Neck and chin quivering visibly. 
           Emptying NSAIDs down her gullet.

           She slides on fresh clothes.  
           With painstaking precision.
           Jeans. Shirt. Pea coat.
           Clicks open weapons case.
           Conceals everything tactically.
           Perfect outfit. Her armor.
           Looks down at piece of paper.
           Blood smudged. Numbers on it.
           Scrawls something at bottom.
           Folds it into coat pocket.

           Then adds a flourish.
           Tacking accessory to collar. 
           A colorful Totoro pin. 
           Final glance in the mirror.
           And she’s gone.

           THE KOZAKURA COMPOUND

           LOBBY thronged with black-suited Yakuza.
           Horde outside visible through glass entrance.
           Smoking, joking, laughing over the muzak... 

           VROOM!

           A CAR SCREECHES towards entrance.
           Gaining speed, PLOWING through bodies.
           WHAM! EXPLODING into the lobby.
           Scattering them like bowling pins.
           THUDDING into the elevator bank.

           Yakuza regaining bearings.
           Yanking guns, aiming.
           Soot obscuring backseat.
           GASOLINE JERRYCANS stacked there.
           One realizes it’s rigged, yells,
                                 SHATEI 
                        Matte!

           Too late. Everyone unloads.
           WHOOM! Car ERUPTS.

           A vague silhouette coasting past...
           He snaps up the radio, barks.

           Ani sits exhausted on floor. 
           Surge of footfalls outside.
           Bodies mobilizing. A STAMPEDE.
           A Yakuza enters to find her grinning.

                                 TALL YAKUZA

           Waves of Yakuza positioned in the concrete cavern.
           Every weapon trained on the stairway/elevator.
           Nervous. Quivering with anticipation. And anxiety.

           EXPANSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM

           Same inside.
           Susumu and 10 of his best.
           One holds onto Ani.
           NEON PULSING through large windows.
           We stay here as the FIGHT starts outside.
           Not a fight. A slaughter.
           Men SHRIEKING. HOWLING. SCREECHING.
           Painful, like being gutted by an animal.
           A monster. Godzilla laying waste.
           It keeps going. And going.
           Everyone inside frozen with fear.
           Except Ani: Ear-to-ear grin.

           And suddenly there’s silence...
           Somehow more unbearable then the violence.

           Doors swing open. And just like that,

           Spurned by hell.
           Body misshapen, caving on itself.
           Creased to inhuman degree.
           One leg useless. An arm too.
           Face pulped. One eye fucked shut.
           Gore coated, wouldn’t be called a person.
           Someone’s dying dream. A nightmare.
           A primal scream given form.

           She keeps coming.
           This smudge of a person. 
           Bewitched by a lone purpose. 
           Standing only by it’s virtue.
           Her body dead. Of poison, drugs, bullets.
           The ghost still haunting these men.
           Not running, she’s falling in a straight line.

           Guns spent, they rush her with blades.
           Susumu backpedals, YANKING Ani along.
           As Kate bites and claws. Literally.

           Kamikaze yell, one SHANKS her rapidly.
           She roars, CLAWS out his throat.
           COUGHING BLOOD in another’s face.
           He SLAPS her, she BITES out his jugular.
           SPITS it at the last face, CRATERS it.
           And keeps coming.
           Forget atonement, this is EXORCISM.

           Susumu jabs the gun into Ani’s head.

           WHAM! Kate PUNCHES his chest.
           Then collapses. For good.

           Hit too weak, Susumu retains footing.
           Smiles, moves the gun from Ani to Kate.

           Smug laugh, he pulls the trigger.
           Tries to anyway.
           When his body starts SEIZING.

           BLOOD FOAMING his nose, mouth.
           The hit did take. He drops. 
           And dies at Ani’s feet.

           She rushes, puts Kate’s head in her lap.

           No, not a grunt.

           A ROAR.

           Leaves Ani that gift.
           As her grip slackens.
           Ani realizing Kate passed her something.
           In her hand, piece of paper we’ve seen before.
           Account number, instructions. 
           And at the bottom, two heartbreaking words:
