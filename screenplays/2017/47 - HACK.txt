           EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA, DAY 

           A fast-moving luxury yacht off the coast of Cyprus. On the 
           deck, a strange mixture of women in swimsuits and men with 
           laptops. Everybody on board is white.

           SUPER: “July 2015: 16 Months Until the Election”

           A man with headphones around his neck (THE DJ) emerges from 
           the cabin smoking a cigarette. As he coolly passes a BLONDE 
           MODEL lazing in a lounge chair --

                                 BLONDE MODEL
                             (in Russian)
                        You promised us blow.

                                 THE DJ
                             (in Russian)
                        After the music.

           The DJ walks to a table with Serato and a sound system and 
           plays Bieber of all people, “What Do You Mean?” 

           Gradually, the men leave their laptops and begin to drink and 
           dance with the women. We hear chatter without subtitles over 
           the music. Everybody is speaking Russian.

           Then, suddenly, as the party finds its rhythm --

           Speedboats swarm the yacht.

           The revelers don’t realize what’s happening until it’s too 
           late. Then, panic and screaming as armed personnel board the 
           yacht, storm the deck. Assault rifles pointed everywhere. 

           No joke. This is a military grade operation. But these aren’t 
           soldiers. They aren’t wearing fatigues. They’re spooks.

           And wait -- they’re speaking Russian too.

           The women are divided from the men. All of the laptops are 
           seized.

           A trio of personnel storm the cabin --

           INSIDE THE CABIN

           It looks like a hotel suite with a kitchen and a wet bar. 
           Lots more technology, screens hosting huge databases of 
           credit card numbers, a couple prostitutes, and a short, 
           stocky man with supreme confidence. We’ll call him DMITRY.
           The armed men rush in, shouting. The women yell, put their 
           hands up. Dmitry does nothing, stays seated on the bed, bites 
           his lip. As if he always knew a day like this would come. 

                                 DMITRY
                             (in Russian)
                        Who are you, FSB? I won’t go to 
                        prison.

           The POINT MAN responds without moving his rifle.

                                 POINT MAN
                             (in Russian)
                        No. You’ll work for us. 

           EXT. FBI NORTHERN VIRGINIA RESIDENCE AGENCY, DAY

           A fenced facility with sprawling green space. The main office 
           building consists of two five-story wings joined by a central 
           service core. It resembles a hotel overlooking the ocean. 

           SUPER: “September 2015: 14 Months Until the Election” 

           INT. FBI OFFICE, DAY

           Special Agent ADRIAN HAWKINS, a desk jockey with the physique 
           to match, picks up the phone and dials a number off the 
           computer.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                        Democratic National Committee. How 
                        may I direct your call? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Yeah, can I speak to someone in the 
                        tech department? 

           The call is transferred. 

           EXT. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE HQ, DAY

           A beige office building with steps leading up to the 
           entrance, split by white handrails. The address “430 South 
           Capitol Street” is stamped beneath the words “Democratic 
           National Headquarters” on the overhang.
           INT. DNC HELP DESK, DAY

           A mini version of a call center. Small cubbies, little 
           privacy. The phone rings at the desk of YARED TAMENE, 40. He 
           looks younger than his age and has extremely good posture. 

                                 TAMENE
                        DNC help desk. Yared Tamene 
                        speaking.

           His voice is skeptical but academic. From here we INTERCUT 
           between Tamene and Hawkins.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Is this tech? 

                                 TAMENE
                        It’s the help desk. How can I help 
                        you? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Hi, Yared. This is Special Agent 
                        Adrian Hawkins at the FBI. I’m not 
                        sure if I was transferred to the 
                        right place or not-

                                 TAMENE
                        You said you’re from the FBI? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        That’s correct. Who deals with 
                        cybersecurity?

                                 TAMENE
                        If someone gets a virus they call 
                        us. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I’m talking about system issues.

                                 TAMENE
                        Why don’t you just tell me what’s 
                        going on? 

           Hawkins’s frustration shows.

                                 HAWKINS
                        I have information that at least 
                        one of your systems has been 
                        compromised by hackers from a cyber-
                        espionage team that we call ‘the 
                        Dukes.’ 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                        Is that something I should be 
                        talking to you about or someone 
                        else? 

                                 TAMENE
                        How can you reassure me that you’re 
                        actually from the FBI? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I gave you my name. I can give you 
                        my phone number. 703-686-6674.

                                 TAMENE
                        What about emailing me a picture of 
                        your badge? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        An email could alert the hackers 
                        that we know they’re inside. Then 
                        they could take steps to secure 
                        themselves before we could lock 
                        them out. You should know this.

                                 TAMENE
                        But you could be impersonating 
                        someone. This could be a prank 
                        phone call. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I promise you, Mr. Tamene, this is 
                        not a prank.

                                 TAMENE
                        Well, thank you for letting me 
                        know.

           Tamene hangs up. 

           We stay with Hawkins. He hangs up as well, scratches his 
           head. After a moment, he gets up and walks down the hall to a 
           larger office with the door open. 

           His SUPERIOR is inside, behind a desk, reading paperwork. On 
           the wall, there’s a framed photograph of him with Rudy 
           Giuliani at Ground Zero, shortly after 9/11.

                                 HAWKINS
                        I made the call.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        What was the result? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        They’re looking into it.
           When his boss doesn’t respond, Hawkins asks --

                                 HAWKINS
                        Is there anything else we should 
                        do?

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        They’re big boys. Just follow up. 
                        Stay on them.

           INT. DNC HELP DESK, DAY

           Back with Tamene, looking at a notepad next to his computer, 
           where he wrote a few things down from the call.

           He proceeds to Google “the Dukes malware”. 

           He finds a link to a white paper with the following brief: 

           “We believe that the Dukes are a well-resourced, highly 
           dedicated, and organized cyber-espionage group that has been 
           working for the Russian government”

           His expression strikes a worrisome chord. 

           He then opens a software application that allows him to 
           search the DNC computer systems logs for signs of a breach. 

           His demeanor improves.

                                 TAMENE
                        Looks clear to me.

           His phone rings.

                                 TAMENE
                        Help desk. Yared Tamene speaking.  
                             (listens)
                        Have you tried restarting your 
                        computer yet? 
                             (listens)
                        Okay, why don’t you do that first? 
                        I’ll stay right here with you until 
                        it reboots...

           Tamene closes the systems logs window on his screen.

           EXT. FUSION GPS, MORNING

           A man with dark, bushy hair, glasses and a tight, graying 
           goatee aggressively jaywalks through traffic in Washington 
           D.C. 
           to reach a nondescript office building, the home of Fusion 
           GPS, a company that provides “research, strategic 
           intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law 
           firms, and investors worldwide” (you can Google them).  

           This is GLENN SIMPSON, early 40s.

           INT. FUSION GPS, MORNING

           Simpson walks into a conference room where a middle-aged 
           woman in a motorized wheelchair waits. Let’s call her DENISE.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Denise, usually nobody’s as prompt 
                        as me. 

           They shake hands.

                                 DENISE
                        The chair’s new. I’m still figuring 
                        things out. 

           He sits.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’m sorry. What happened? 

                                 DENISE
                        When you have to push people around 
                        all day, eventually you get tired 
                        of pushing yourself around too. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I wouldn’t know the feeling. 

                                 DENISE
                        Of course you wouldn’t.

                                 SIMPSON
                        No, not that. Of being tired.

                                 DENISE
                        We’ll see if you can still say that 
                        after this election. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        What’s the name of the super PAC 
                        you work for?

                                 DENISE
                        Does it matter? 
                                 SIMPSON
                        We have to bill someone.

                                 DENISE
                        I’ll leave you with the information 
                        for my holding company. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        So you want it on Trump? What’s the 
                        problem? His tweets aren’t enough? 

                                 DENISE
                        I’ve been led to believe you can 
                        give us better opposition research 
                        than a few monkeys banging out 
                        search terms on Twitter. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        You’ve been talking to my former 
                        colleagues at the Journal. 

                                 DENISE
                        What makes you say that? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        You’re Republican aren’t you? 

                                 DENISE
                        I’d prefer you stop trying to 
                        decode me and start giving us 
                        ammunition to take down the Donald.

           She drives the wheelchair towards the door. 

           INT. DNC CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           Technology director ANDREW BROWN (37) leads a meeting amongst 
           staffers. CEO AMY DACEY (45) and Chairperson DEBBIE WASSERMAN 
           SCHULTZ (50) are in the room. 

           Brown discusses a Power Point presentation on “Cybersecurity 
           During the Election Cycle”. His eyes are sunken. The work is 
           overwhelming.

                                 BROWN
                        The reality is every corporation, 
                        big or small, has to deal with 
                        these threats on a daily basis. And 
                        they do. With budgets that are 
                        astronomically higher than ours. 

           Dacey weighs in. Her brown hair is in bangs. She has a big 
           smile when she wants to use it -- which isn’t right now. 
                                 DACEY
                        We’re a nonprofit, Andrew. 

                                 BROWN
                        Right. With highly sensitive data. 
                        We’re not selling Girl Scout

                        So what’s the point of this 
                        presentation? To let us know we’re 
                        screwed?  

                                 BROWN
                        Well, we’re not screwed until 
                        something happens. In the meantime, 
                        we have software.

                                 DACEY

                        Filters email to block phishing 
                        attacks and malware. And our techs 
                        can monitor the system for evidence 
                        of compromises, intruders...

                                 BROWN
                        Mediocre at best.

                                 DACEY
                        How much more should we have in the 
                        budget? 

                                 BROWN
                        It’s not even worth saying.

                        have no choice. Mr. Trump stated, 
                        ‘Without looking at the polling 
                        data, it’s obvious to anybody the 
                        hatred is beyond comprehension of 
                        such a big portion.’ We have to 
                        figure it out. We can’t live like

           An open floor plan. Lots of young people, loads of 
           enthusiasm. 

           We focus in on a pair of twenty-somethings at computers, a 
           man and a woman. If they didn’t believe deeply in Bernie’s 
           message you’d expect to see them on Haight Street with a 
           Hacky Sack, sharing a “j.” Instead, they’re here, poring over 
           voter data. One is JOSH URETSKY, the campaign’s national data 
           director. Let’s call the other SAM.
                                 JOSH
                        Huh. That’s weird. 

                                 SAM
                        What is it? 

                                 JOSH
                        I can access the Clinton campaign’s 
                        version of the master voter list, 
                        with all their extra data tacked 
                        on.

                                 SAM
                        Let me see.

           Sam leans over and looks at his laptop then back to hers, 
           where she sees the same link.

                                 SAM
                        Do you think the DNC opened it up 
                        to us for some reason? Or is it a 
                        glitch? 

                                 JOSH
                        I haven’t heard anything. 

                                 SAM
                        Are you gonna click it? 

                                 JOSH
                        We need to try to understand if 
                        there’s been a security breach, 
                        right?

                        The way the Post tells it, the DNC 
                        is in a panic over this. And yet I 
                        don’t hear anything back when I

                        It doesn’t make any sense.

           prep schooler JOE SCARBOROUGH are interviewing Trump over the 
           phone.

           This is an actual transcript: 

                                 BRZEZINSKI
                        Do you like Vladimir Putin’s 
                        comments about you? 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Sure. When people call you 
                        brilliant it’s always good. 
                        Especially when the person heads up 
                        Russia. 

           Brzezinski has been laughing.

                                 BRZEZINSKI
                        Yeah.
                                 SCARBOROUGH
                        Well, I mean, also is a person who 
                        kills journalists, political

                        ...and invades countries. 
                        Obviously, that would be a concern 
                        would it not? 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        He’s running his country, and at 
                        least he’s a leader, you know, 
                        unlike what we have in this 
                        country.

                                 SCARBOROUGH
                        Yeah. But, again, he kills 
                        journalists that don’t agree with 
                        him.

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Well, I think our country does 
                        plenty of killing also, Joe.

           He notices a staffer, KIMMY, lean, indefatigable, 30, pass by

           approaches the stereotypically large, uniformed SECURITY

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Do you have an appointment? 

           Hawkins shows him his badge. The Security Guard looks over 
           his shoulder then puts a sign-in clipboard in front of him.

           INT. DNC CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           Hawkins sits across from Tamene, who’s flanked by two male 
           associates from the tech department, both younger looking 
           than him. Let’s give them the names DEV and KAMAL. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Why wouldn’t you return my calls?

                                 TAMENE
                        Could I look at your badge, please? 

           Hawkins slides his badge across the table. Tamene not only 
           looks at it, he picks it up and inspects it, and then passes 
           it over to Dev and Kamal. The latter writes the badge number 
           down on a notepad.  

                                 TAMENE
                        What about a business card? 

           Perturbed, Hawkins goes into his wallet and takes out a 
           beaten up business card, hands it to Tamene. Tamene holds it 
           up to the light, turns it over between his fingers, as if 
           he’s trying to decode a magic trick. 
                                 HAWKINS
                        For Christ’s sake, keep it. 

           Tamene hands the business card to Dev, who pockets it.

                                 TAMENE
                        I didn’t call you back because I 
                        had nothing to report. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Have you escalated this to your 
                        superiors? 

                                 TAMENE
                        Our systems scans show no evidence 
                        of a hack.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Is that correct? 

           Dev and Kamal nod in agreement. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        You two have looked at the logs 
                        too? Independent of him? 

                                 DEV
                        Yared showed me his computer.

                                 KAMAL
                        Same.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Using what software? 

           Kamal starts to say but Yared stops him.

                                 TAMENE
                        We sign confidentiality agreements 
                        that cover our internal processes.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Because what I see shows that you 
                        have software calling ‘home,’ with 
                        ‘home’ in this case being Russia. 
                        Does that alarm you? 

                                 TAMENE
                        I don’t see any proof of that. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        You don’t see any proof... okay. Do 
                        you think that maybe the goddamn 
                        FBI has better tools than the DNC? 
           Tamene looks at Dev and Kamal before saying --

                                 TAMENE
                        It’s conceivable.

                                 HAWKINS
                        We’re talking about behavior that’s 
                        consistent with a state-sponsored 
                        attack. Do you think that maybe, 
                        just maybe, the hackers could hide 
                        what they’re doing from whatever 
                        fucking rinky-dink operation you’re 
                        running? 

                                 TAMENE
                        I take offense to that.

                                 HAWKINS
                        You have software sending 
                        information to Moscow. I don’t know 
                        what else I can say. 

           Tamene stands up, inviting the close of the meeting.

           EXT. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE HQ, DAY

           Hawkins walks out, pissed, sees a female SMOKER on the steps.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Could I bum one? 

           She passes him a cigarette, lights it. He takes a giant hit.

                                 SMOKER
                        Just visiting? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Yeah, I came here instead of 
                        watching Titanic.

           The woman doesn’t get it. But we do. 

           INT. DNC HQ, DAY

           Tamene walks through the halls in a haze until he reaches 
           Andrew Brown’s office. The door is closed. BROWN’S ASSISTANT, 
           stern, matronly, even at 23, is at a desk out front. 

                                 TAMENE
                        Is Andrew available? 
                                 BROWN’S ASSISTANT
                        He’s swamped. 

                                 TAMENE
                        What about later today? 

                                 BROWN’S ASSISTANT
                        He has back to back meetings and 
                        calls with the campaigns on this 
                        master voter list breach. 

                                 TAMENE
                        Still? 

                                 BROWN’S ASSISTANT
                        Can you imagine anything worse? 

                                 TAMENE
                        Is he around tomorrow? 

                                 BROWN’S ASSISTANT
                        He’s going over proposals all day 
                        on replacing NGP VAN.

                                 TAMENE
                        Okay, um just try to have him come 
                        see me. I don’t think it’s 
                        anything, but I’ve gotten some 
                        calls from the FBI.

                                 BROWN’S ASSISTANT
                        I’ll let him know.

           Tamene lingers before buggering off.  

           EXT. THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE, DAY

           A flat fronted building about ten stories tall, rectangular, 
           with large evergreen trees inside the fence. 

           A Senior Russian diplomat in his 40s exits, underdressed for 
           the weather but unbothered by the late winter/early spring 
           cold. We’ll say his name is MIKHAIL POPOV. 

           He gets into a waiting car.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC, DAY

           The black sedan travels around the city until it picks up a 
           fat 25-year-old kid and an ELDERLY MAN with a walker, waiting 
           outside a nursing home. The kid is his GRANDSON. 
           INT. BLACK SEDAN, DAY

           The car continues to drive. Popov hands the old man an 
           envelope that looks like it contains a check.

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                             (in Russian)
                        Has the price of oil gotten so low 
                        that it’s cheaper to drive than use 
                        a stamp? 

                                 POPOV
                             (in Russian)
                        Who wants to give money to this 
                        government? Open it up. 

           The elderly man opens the envelope. His eyes go wide when he 
           sees the number on the check. 

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                             (in Russian)
                        This isn’t a pension, it’s a 
                        ransom.

                                 POPOV
                             (in Russian)
                        You remember your normal 
                        disbursement? Double that number. 
                        The rest you should hold as cash. 
                        Three men will visit you 
                        separately. Not all will speak 
                        Russian. They’ll probably look 
                        something like your grandson here. 
                        Distribute the cash evenly amongst 
                        them. 

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                             (in Russian)
                        Why?

                                 POPOV
                             (in Russian)
                        They’re good with computers.

           INT. DNC CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           Tamene finally gets his meeting with Brown, who appears to be 
           in a hurry. No time to sit down. 
                                 TAMENE
                        The FBI thinks we have at least one 
                        compromised computer on our 
                        network, but that’s not consistent 
                        with what I’ve seen.

                                 BROWN
                        Which is what? 

           He has his laptop with him. He shows Brown emails that have 
           been captured by the DNC’s phishing filter.  

                                 TAMENE
                        But they’re getting picked up by 
                        our filters. And I don’t see any 
                        other evidence of a compromise. 

                                 BROWN
                        Who at the FBI? 

                                 TAMENE
                        Special Agent Adrian Hawkins. 

                                 BROWN
                        That place is full of fucking 
                        Republicans.
                             (beat)
                        I have a little wiggle room in the 
                        budget. Let me see if we can get 
                        some improved monitoring tools.

           Brown exits with a hand on Tamene’s shoulder. He feels good, 
           like he did the right thing. 

           INT. FBI OFFICE, DAY

           Hawkins goes to see his boss. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I met with the DNC again this 
                        morning. They’re stepping up their 
                        efforts.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Is that so? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Uh huh. Better software.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Then it looks like your work is 
                        done.
           Hawkins’s Superior hasn’t even made eye contact with him. 
           Hawkins stares at the photo on his desk of him and Rudy 
           Giuliani at Ground Zero after 9/11.

                                 HAWKINS
                        I’ve never asked... how well do you 
                        know the Mayor? 

           His Superior gets up and walks over with the photo.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        We have good memories from when he 
                        was a prosecutor. This was a 
                        special moment.

                                 HAWKINS
                        The other day he said he was 
                        probably going to endorse Trump. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Ah, New Yorkers. We’re tribal 
                        creatures.

           He takes back the framed photo and returns to his desk. 

           EXT. HAWAII, NIGHT

           An upscale hotel in the dark, early morning hours.

           SUPER: “March 2016: 8 Months Until the Election” 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

           An iPhone alarm goes off, waking up a man, BILLY RINEHART, 
           who’s been asleep in a T-shirt with the Hillary Clinton 
           campaign logo on it. 

           Bleary-eyed and sore, Rinehart gets a hold of the phone, 
           shuts off the alarm and checks his email.

           His eyes are drawn to a message from Google with the subject: 
           “Someone has your password”. 

           His heart rate picks up. He opens the email. It says that 
           someone located in Ukraine tried to sign in to his account 
           but was stopped by Google. An IP address is included. 

           There’s also advice to change his password immediately with a 
           link. 

           Hurriedly, he clicks the link -- which asks him to sign in to 
           his account before providing a new password.
           After finishing, Rinehart breathes then replies to a couple 
           emails before resetting his alarm and going back to sleep.

           EXT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS, MORNING

           At One Pierrepont Plaza, a brownstone skyscraper in Brooklyn 
           Heights. 

           INT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS, MORNING

           A youthful, Silicon Valley vibe. A delegate tracking wall 
           uses little Post-Its to show the progress of the Democratic 
           primaries. More blue Post-Its for Clinton than pink for 
           Sanders.

           A young ASSISTANT, hair pulled back, wearing jeans and 
           Converse, moves through the office, chasing the sound of a 
           ringing phone. 

           She gets to her desk and answers the call with a headset. 

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        John Podesta’s office. 

           We don’t hear the other end of the call. Instead we see that 
           she’s simultaneously checking her boss’s email.

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        He’s in with Hillary at the moment. 
                        We’ll call back. 

           She disconnects. 

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        Hey, Sara. Can you come here? 

           Podesta’s Chief Of Staff, SARA LATHAM, late 30s, glasses, a 
           little nerdy walks over. 

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        Look at this. 

           She points to an email on her computer screen -- the same 
           exact email that Rinehart received in Hawaii except addressed 
           to “John”. Latham reads.

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        What do you think? 

                                 LATHAM
                        I’ll call the help desk and then 
                        forward it over.
                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        Good idea.

           Latham goes to her phone.  

           INT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HELP DESK, MORNING

           In another wing of the same offices, Hillary For America help 
           desk technician CHARLES DELAVAN reviews the Podesta email 
           while drinking his fourth cup of coffee of the morning (the 
           empties are still on his desk). 

           Delavan quickly types a response. He has no doubt:

           “This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his 
           password immediately, and ensure that two-factor 
           authentication is turned on his account.

           “He can go to this link: 
           https://myaccount.google.com/security to do both.

           “It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP.”

           Delavan presses send.

           INT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS, MORNING

           Latham reads Delavan’s response on her phone, but she only 
           gets as far as “This is a legitimate email.” before sitting 
           down at Podesta’s Assistant’s desk, opening the original 
           email that was sent to John and clicking the link, 
           unwittingly falling for the phishing attack. 

           INT. FUSION GPS, NIGHT

           Simpson, Kimmy, and a third researcher, FRANK -- an old man 
           in a young man’s body, befitting his name -- eat Chinese 
           takeout in a conference room. They’re on their phones. 

                                 KIMMY
                        Frank, are you gonna see Batman 
                        Versus Superman on Friday? 

                                 FRANK
                        How are the reviews? 

           Simpson interrupts. 
                                 SIMPSON
                        Hey, who wants to listen to Trump’s 
                        interview with the Post editorial 
                        board? 

           He doesn’t wait for an answer. He hits play on a video (still 
           images plus audio) on The Washington Post website then puts 
           his phone in a cup, expanding the volume. 

           The interview starts. This is from an actual transcript: 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        New building. 

           He’s talking to FREDERICK RYAN JR., Publisher of the Post.

                                 RYAN JR. (V.O.)
                        Been here all of a month. 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Good luck with it. 

                                 RYAN JR. (V.O.)
                             (nervous chuckle)
                        Thank you. Uhm, it’s been agreed 
                        this is an on the record meeting...

           Kimmy talks over the next section. 

                                 KIMMY
                        God, this is worthless. Can’t you 
                        ever just take a break, Glenn? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Quiet.

           The interview continues:

                                 RYAN JR. (V.O.)
                        ...even perhaps we heard you might 
                        be announcing your foreign policy 
                        advisory team soon if there’s 
                        anything you can share on that?  

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        I wouldn’t mind. Doug, do you have 
                        that list? I’ll be a little more 
                        accurate with it.

           We hear shuffling while someone presumably comes forward with 
           a sheet of paper. Frank says: 

                                 FRANK
                        He has no idea.
           Trump gets the list.

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Okay, you ready? 

           The people in the room at the Post laugh like tourists in the 
           room with a celebrity. Simpson rolls his eyes.

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Walid Phares, who you probably 
                        know, PhD, adviser to the House of 
                        Representatives Caucus and is a 
                        counterterrorism expert. Carter 
                        Page, PhD. George Papadopoulos, 
                        he’s an oil and energy consultant, 
                        excellent guy. And I have quite a 
                        few more. But that’s a group of 
                        some of the people that we are 
                        dealing with.

           The interview continues, but Frank has already moved on. 

                                 FRANK
                        These reviews aren’t good.

                                 KIMMY
                        Yeah, but who cares about critics? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Wait. Hang on. Who the fuck is 
                        Carter Page? 

           Nobody knows. 

           INT. DNC HELP DESK, EVENING

           Tamene packs up his belongings for the day. His buddies Dev 
           and Kamal say goodbye. 

           SUPER: “April 2016: 7 Months Until the Election”

           Tamene starts to head out, when suddenly his phone buzzes. He 
           turns around, goes to his computer, and opens an application 
           that’s new to our eyes, one of the robust monitoring tools 
           that was mentioned by Brown. 

           He starts to shake.

           EXT. TAMENE’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           A well-mannered colonial in the Maryland suburbs. Tamene’s 
           silhouette is visible in the window on the first floor. 
           INT. TAMENE’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           Tamene sits on the arm of a chair in the living room, holding 
           his phone. A puppy runs around the house. A little boy can be 
           heard playing video games in the other room. TAMENE’S WIFE 
           walks by holding a little girl and a book.  

                                 TAMENE’S WIFE
                        Time for bed, baby girl.

           She can tell that something is bothering her husband.

                                 TAMENE’S WIFE
                        You’ve been glum all night. 

                                 TAMENE
                        I’ll be fine.

           She doesn’t believe him, but she has to put their daughter to 
           bed.

           He looks down at his phone. He texted his boss, Andrew Brown, 
           at 6:08pm. No response.

           He opens his contacts, finds the name “Amy Dacey” and 
           reluctantly presses the call button.

           INT. AMY DACEY’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           Amy Dacey, CEO of the DNC, whom we remember from the meeting 
           where Brown made his presentation on cybersecurity, hurriedly 
           does her makeup in a cocktail dress. Her HUSBAND says -- 

                                 DACEY’S HUSBAND
                        Uber’s here.

                                 DACEY
                        Just a second.

                                 DACEY’S HUSBAND
                        The Correspondents’ Dinner waits 
                        for no man... or woman.

                                 DACEY
                        No, but the pre-parties do. 

                                 DACEY’S HUSBAND
                        I’ll stall him. 

           He exits. We hear the front door open and close -- and then 
           Dacey’s phone rings. It’s on the bathroom counter next to 
           her. She looks down, sees Tamene’s name, and picks up. 
                                 DACEY
                        Yared, what’s going on? 

           EXT. AMY DACEY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

           Dacey comes outside. The Uber’s gone. Her husband is standing 
           in the driveway alone. 

                                 DACEY’S HUSBAND
                        I failed.

                                 DACEY
                        We have bigger problems. 

           EXT. PERKINS COIE LLP, NIGHT

           A multi-story office building the length of a city block. 

           INT. PERKINS COIE CONFERENCE ROOM, NIGHT

           Brown, Dacey, Wasserman Schultz and lawyer MICHAEL SUSSMANN 
           (52) -- tanned, sloped chin, looks like he could be an NFL 
           official -- convene in secret. A lot of tension in the room. 
           Sussmann, a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the DOJ, now a 
           partner in the Privacy and Data Security Practice, runs the 
           show. 

                                 SUSSMANN
                        Let me just repeat that, Andrew, so 
                        the gravity of it can sink in. 
                             (beat)
                        An unauthorized person with admin-
                        level security status has gained 
                        access to the DNC’s computers. This 
                        means password theft, data breach, 
                        everything you can imagine. Okay? 

           The others nod, gravely.

                                 SUSSMANN
                        Now, combine this with the fact 
                        that the FBI warned you seven 
                        months ago about a state-sponsored 
                        attack, and you should have a 
                        pretty sound idea of why I’m not 
                        planning us a trip to Disney World. 

                                 WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
                        I was unaware of any of this until 
                        last night. 
                                 DACEY
                        So was I.

                                 BROWN
                        To be fair, the information from 
                        the FBI really only came into focus 
                        in January. At that point we 
                        upgraded our software, which 
                        enabled us to catch this. 

                                 SUSSMANN
                        Catching it isn’t preventing it. 

                                 BROWN
                        I’ll have our Director of IT write 
                        a memo explaining the timeline. 

                                 SUSSMANN
                        We’ll need that. In the meantime- 
                        and I mean starting now- we need to 
                        answer three questions. What data 
                        was accessed? How was it done? How 
                        do we stop it? Say it with me. 

           The group repeats the three questions in concert.

                                 SUSSMANN
                        Let’s bring in an outside firm. I’m 
                        going to recommend CrowdStrike.

                                 BROWN
                        We don’t have the budget for them. 
                             (looks at Dacey)
                        Do we? 

           Sussmann doesn’t give her room to respond. 

                                 SUSSMANN
                        Move Heaven and Earth. And don’t 
                        say any of this on DNC email. We 
                        only have one chance to raise the 
                        drawbridge. 

           INT. DNC HQ, DAY

           Employees from the DNC form a line, handing in laptops to 
           Andrew Brown.

                                 BROWN
                        Just a systems upgrade. Company 
                        phones and emails will be shut off 
                        for the weekend as well.
           Tamene reaches the front of the line, hands Brown his laptop. 

                                 BROWN
                        Thank you, Yared.

           His voice implies he doesn’t really mean it. 

           INT. DNC HQ, NIGHT

           Technicians from CrowdStrike Services cybersecurity firm 
           replace the computer systems. Email is turned off. Hard 
           drives are wiped.

           INT. DNC HELP DESK, MORNING

           Tamene arrives at the crack of dawn. CrowdStrike technicians 
           are still finishing up. He sits at his work station.

                                 TAMENE
                        Can I turn this on yet? 

           A TECH who, if you had to guess, you’d bet supported Bernie 
           Sanders responds --

                                 CROWDSTRIKE TECH
                        Couple more hours. Maybe by 8:30?

           The tech saunters off. Tamene digs in his drawer for a legal 
           pad and a pen, forced to start a memo to Wasserman Schultz, 
           Dacey, Brown, and Sussmann by hand.

           We hear Yared’s voice. Excerpts from the actual memo:

                                 TAMENE (V.O.)
                        On September 15, 2015, a call was 
                        transferred from the main DNC 
                        switchboard to the Help Desk; I had 
                        no way of differentiating the call 
                        I just received from a prank; I did 
                        not return his calls, as I had 
                        nothing to report. 

           It sounds fucking horrible, and Tamene knows it. But he keeps 
           writing because it’s the truth, and he believed at the time 
           that what he did was right. It’s almost admirable. Almost.

           INT. FANCY DC RESTAURANT, DAY

           Simpson sits across from a white male INVESTMENT BANKER. 
           Sushi on the table that Simpson can’t be bothered with. The

                        I’m not going to say something then 
                        see it show up in the Wall Street 
                        Journal in three months or anything 
                        like that, right? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I left the Journal. I told you that 
                        like six times.

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        But you’re doing the same thing, 
                        you know, you’re acting the same 
                        way. I don’t get it. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        If I said I’m doing investigative 
                        reporting, but it’s being funded by 
                        private entities that use it for 
                        their benefit instead of publishing 
                        it in a newspaper- still no 
                        comprende? 

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Whatever, man. As long as I can 
                        still call you for gossip about 
                        Goldman, I’m good. 

           Simpson can barely hide his disdain for this guy.

                                 SIMPSON
                        You worked at the office in Russia? 

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        For Merrill, yeah. 2005, 2006.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Did you know Carter Page? 

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Who? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Bald guy in his 40s who runs an 
                        energy fund called- this is hard to 
                        believe- Global Energy Capital now. 
                        Trump mentioned him to the Post.

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Oh, that guy. I’ve gotten a bunch 
                        of emails from my buddies on that 
                        piece of shit. ‘Hey, who’s Carter 
                        Page? Did you guys fuck?’ Idiot 
                        frat boys... 
                                 SIMPSON
                        You operate on a higher plane.

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Sushi not steak. Carter Page is 
                        neither. He’s at the kids’ table 
                        begging for mac and cheese. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        What’d he do at Merrill? 

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Made copies? I don’t know. We 
                        hardly did anything in Russia. When 
                        it came to the big shit, say like 
                        something with Gazprom, those deals 
                        closed at the CEO level. I mean 
                        Putin had to sign off. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        His bio says he was part of slicing 
                        up RAO UES.

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah. He was around for that. The 
                        Russians called him stranichkin.

                                 SIMPSON
                        What’s that? 

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        “Little page.” 

                                 SIMPSON
                        So if Trump is listening to him on 
                        foreign policy involving Russia...

                                 INVESTMENT BANKER
                        Then Trump is even dumber than he 
                        seems. Why talk to Carter fucking 
                        Page when Paul Manafort is running 
                        your campaign? That guy may as well 
                        have a hammer and sickle tattooed 
                        on his ass.

           He inhales another piece of sushi as Simpson looks on, trying 
           to connect the puzzle pieces in his head. 
           EXT. FBI NORTHERN VIRGINIA RESIDENCE AGENCY, DAY

           Hawkins comes back from lunch, walking up to the entrance as 
           the special committee from the DNC exits, Wasserman Schultz, 
           Dacey, Brown and Sussmann. 

           Hawkins immediately recognizes Wasserman Schultz from her TV 
           appearances. Brown nods at him, none the wiser to his 
           identity or involvement in discovering the hack. 

           Somewhat stunned, Hawkins watches the group leave the 
           property and we 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MONTAGE OF ACTUAL ONLINE MEDIA & VIDEO CLIPS

           SUPER: “June 2016: 5 Months Until the Election” 

           The lead is a headline in The Washington Post: “Russian 
           government hackers penetrated DNC”

           Then, DAVID MUIR on ABC News: 

                                 MUIR
                        We’re also learning more at this 
                        hour about an alleged Russian hack 
                        attack on the headquarters of the 
                        Democratic National Committee...

           Next, pull quotes from The WaPo article: “The firm identified 
           two separate hacker groups, both working for the Russian 
           government...”

           Followed by JAKE TAPPER on CNN: 

                                 TAPPER
                        ...and what information did they 
                        apparently zero in on? Well, the 
                        opposition research file on one Mr. 
                        Donald J. Trump. 

           “One group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear... the 
           other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the 
           network in late April...” 

           Next, RENÉ MARSH on CNN:

                                 MARSH
                        Now the researchers were roaming 
                        around the network for about a year 
                        but were removed this weekend.

                        The DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman 
                        Schultz saying in a statement, 
                        quote, ‘When we uncovered the 
                        intrusion we treated this like the 
                        serious incident it is and reached 
                        out to CrowdStrike immediately.’

           One last quote from WaPo: “CrowdStrike is less sure of whom 
           Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal 
           Security Service, or FSB, the country’s powerful security 
           agency, which was once headed by Putin.”

           And finally José Díaz-Balart interviewing HILLARY CLINTON on 
           Telemundo in split-screen: 

                                 CLINTON
                        ...this seems like another example 
                        where they're trying to vacuum up 
                        information. Now, why? We don't 
                        know yet. So far as we know, my 
                        campaign has not been hacked into 
                        and we're obviously looking hard at 
                        that. But cyber security will be an 
                        issue that I will be absolutely 
                        focused on as president.

           INT. FUSION GPS, MORNING

           We find ourselves staring at a computer screen, a web browser 
           open to a page with a large baby blue header that reads:

           “GUCCIFER 2.0”

           Underneath: 

           “GUCCIFER 2.0 DNC’S SERVERS HACKED BY A LONE HACKER”

           The page starts to scroll down. It’s a crude WordPress site 
           with a taunting tone. Most important, we see that several 
           documents have been embedded on the page for download --

           DNC opposition research on Trump; DNC donor ledgers; a 
           “secret” promises and proposals paper on foreign policy.

           The scroller hits the bottom of the site. We linger on a 
           block of text: 

           “The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I 
           gave to Wikileaks. They will publish them soon.”

           After a moment, our view reverses to show Simpson and Kimmy 
           hovering over the screen. 
                                 SIMPSON
                        So the DNC reveals the hack to the 
                        Post yesterday and now-

                                 KIMMY
                        This gets sent to Gawker. 
                        CrowdStrike is standing by their 
                        statements. They say the lone 
                        hacker thing is bullshit.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Has our boy the Donald said 
                        anything yet? 

           Frank hears Simpson from outside the conference room, bobs 
           his head in. 

                                 FRANK
                        There’s a statement. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I prefer his tweets and unhinged, 
                        off the cuff remarks but go ahead, 
                        read it. 

                                 FRANK
                        ‘We believe it was the DNC that did 
                        the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract 
                        from the many issues facing their 
                        deeply flawed candidate and failed 
                        party leader. Too bad the DNC 
                        doesn’t hack Hillary Clinton’s 
                        33,000 missing emails.’

           Kimmy laughs.

                                 KIMMY
                        He would say that.

                                 FRANK
                             (skimming the statement)
                        And here he’s talking about the 
                        DNC’s opposition research report on 
                        him. Quote, ‘This is all 
                        information that has been out there 
                        for many years. Much of it is false 
                        and/or entirely inaccurate.’

                                 SIMPSON
                        Download that report from this site 
                        and see how much of it overlaps 
                        with what we’ve done. In the 
                        meantime, I’m going to prepare to 
                        differentiate.
                                 KIMMY
                        How?

                                 SIMPSON
                        Depends on what I can get the 
                        client to pay for.

           Google them too). 

           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           An organized no frills space but posh, and classic, with none 
           of the posturing associated with American interior 
           decorating. 

           CHRIS BURROWS (50s), one of the two co-founders, silently 
           sips tea in his office, deep in thought. He’s debonair, with 
           a full head of gray hair styled and combed to the side. Not 
           everyone at the company has to, but he wears a suit to work. 

           A copy of The Daily Mirror is on his desk. The front page 
           contains a photo of a boy in British flag face paint, looking 
           resigned, with the headline: “WE’RE OUT” -- and the subheads: 
           “Britain votes to quit the EU” >> “Pound goes into freefall”

           Even the abrupt ringing of his phone doesn’t break his 
           concentration. He answers just before it reaches voicemail.

                        Burrows.

           INTERCUT: SIMPSON

           On his cell phone, leaning against the wall in the corner of 
           his office. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Mr. Burrows... Glenn Simpson. How’s 
                        the void look from where you’re 
                        standing? 

                                 BURROWS
                        Sitting. At the moment it looks 
                        very much like the bottom of my tea 
                        cup. How does it appear to you? 
                                 SIMPSON
                        Distant but encroaching.

                                 BURROWS
                        Stay vigilant. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        That’s why I’m calling. How 
                        available is the other Chris? 

           EXT. CHESAPEAKE & OHIO CANAL, DAY

           A soft dirt surface near the water, crowded with joggers -- 
           and Simpson and Denise, the motorized wheelchair bound 
           representative from Fusion’s unidentified client. 

                                 DENISE
                        Were you ever a runner? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        You say that like you can tell that 
                        I’m not one now. 

           Denise looks him up and down.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Did this use to be your spot? 

                                 DENISE
                        These people are a lot like 
                        politicians, you know.

                                 SIMPSON
                        We’re in DC. Most of them are 
                        politicians.

                                 DENISE
                        They run the same route. Every day. 
                        Every other day. Like politicians 
                        and the election cycle, every four 
                        years, six years... ‘the race for 
                        the White House.’ But no one’s 
                        actually running. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        And these people aren’t actually 
                        racing. I don’t see your point.

                                 DENISE
                        What’s your proposal, Glenn? 
                                 SIMPSON
                        I want to go deeper on his ties to 
                        Russia. Hire someone with 
                        intelligence experience in the 
                        country. But it’s going to cost.

                                 DENISE
                        He’s the presumptive nominee at 
                        this point. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        But there’s a chance for a brokered 
                        convention. And I know he said he 
                        could stand in the middle of Fifth 
                        Avenue and shoot somebody and he 
                        wouldn’t lose any voters, but 
                        there’s an above average chance we 
                        could dig something up that would 
                        force him to drop out.

                                 DENISE
                        That’s why we’re still paying you. 
                        But to increase your budget?

           Simpson watches a father and son jog past, the son keeping 
           his pace slow to stay with his dad.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I think I get your analogy. These 
                        people run until they can’t run 
                        anymore. Then new runners come 
                        along, replace them. But the whole 
                        time the route still stands. The 
                        system perpetuates. It lives on.
                             (beat)
                        I have a feeling our ‘runner’ is 
                        different. 

                                 DENISE
                        How so?

                                 SIMPSON
                        He’s actually laying down mines.

                        I think they’ll say yes, but my

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT, DAY

           A suave, somewhat aloof British man walks through the crowds 
           towards a departure gate, wearing headphones, listening to 
           classical music (which we hear). 

           This is CHRIS STEELE, 52, co-founder of Orbis Business 
           Intelligence, former agent for MI-6. 

           He takes a seat at the gate and starts eating from a bag of 
           Jelly Babies candies.

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT MARRIOTT, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           Denise is in her wheelchair. Steele has chosen to sit on the 
           edge of the conference room table at the other side of the 
           room.

                                 DENISE
                        I didn’t bother to read your

                        I wouldn’t disagree. Did Glenn 
                        vouch for me or did he think it’d 
                        be prudent to waste your time?

                        He said you were a spy in Moscow.

                                 STEELE
                        Please. To be precise I was a 
                        diplomat.

                                 DENISE
                        And you knew Litvinenko before he 
                        was poisoned.

                                 STEELE
                        Well, not after he was poisoned, 
                        that’s for certain. 

           Denise frowns. She doesn’t like his attitude. 

                                 STEELE
                        Alexander needed help exposing

                        say I lent a hand, but I was raised 
                        to be a Good Samaritan. And I was 
                        very upset when he was murdered.

                                 DENISE
                        I also heard that you don’t like

           Steele laughs.
                                 STEELE
                        I was proud of the FBI, but 
                        unsurprised, when they were able to 
                        remove the corrupt head of power at

                                 STEELE
                        Justice is inevitable, I believe, 
                        but costly.

                                 DENISE
                        How does that explain what Putin

                                 STEELE
                        Novels have more than one chapter.

                                 DENISE
                        Glenn thinks Trump and Putin are up 
                        to something. Or Putin is up to 
                        something with Trump. I don’t know 
                        if I believe him either way. But 
                        he’ll be the nominee, officially, 
                        in a month and then he’ll be 
                        Hillary’s problem.

                        We’ll pay you until then.

                                 STEELE
                        I should have flown first class.

                                 DENISE
                        Talk to Glenn from now on. I don’t 
                        want to see you again. 

           She leaves.

           EXT. NURSING HOME, DAY

           A COMPUTER WHIZ -- mid 20s, looks 17, Latino, has bad posture 
           -- approaches the building in a Force Awakens T-shirt even 
           though it’s too cold to not be wearing a coat. 

           INT. NURSING HOME, DAY

           The Computer Whiz moves through the lobby and references the 
           top of a manila envelope in his hand. The number “115” is 
           scrawled on top. 

           He finds room 115 and knocks on the door. 

           Briefly, the Elderly Man who had the exchange in the black 
           sedan with Russian diplomat Mikhail Popov answers.

                                 COMPUTER WHIZ
                        Hey dude.
           He shows him the envelope. The Elderly Man seems to be trying 
           to find his bearings.

                                 COMPUTER WHIZ
                        It’s for you. We’re supposed to 
                        trade.

           The Elderly Man finally takes the envelope and retreats into 
           his small room, leaving the door open. The Whiz follows him.  

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                             (in broken English)
                        Do I open? 

           The Whiz shrugs his shoulders. 

                                 COMPUTER WHIZ
                        Just do you, man. 

           The Elderly Man rummages in a dresser drawer. He comes away 
           with a rubber banded stack of bills that he hands to the 
           Whiz, who tries to no avail to fit them in the front pocket 
           of his skinny jeans.

                                 COMPUTER WHIZ
                        Do you have an envelope? Like 
                        something to put this in? 

           The Elderly Man reads the Whiz’s body language. He takes the 
           envelope, opens it, removes a stack of documents then hands 
           the envelope back to the kid.

                                 COMPUTER WHIZ
                             (laughs)
                        Awesome, dude.

           The Whiz transfers the money to the envelope then goes. 

           The Elderly Man returns to the documents, lying on a plush 
           chair. As he sifts through them, we see that they appear to 
           contain reams of hacked information on Russian oligarchs 
           living in the U.S. and then, mercurially, at the bottom -- an 
           image of the Christian Bale Batman wearing a “Make America 
           Great Again” hat.

           EXT. EMBASSY OF RUSSIA, LONDON, MORNING

           A fenced property, estate-like, with a Russian flag flying 
           out front. 

           Chris Steele is across the street, searching for garbage with 
           a full-on trash picker. 
           A pale man, thick like a bear, emerges from the Embassy. 
           Let’s call him IVAN. He bee-lines for Steele, speaks with a 
           gruff Russian accent.

                                 IVAN
                        Hey! What are you doing here?!

           Steele looks up, bemused.

                                 IVAN
                        The real garbage is at the Diana 
                        Playground. It’s overrun with it! 
                        Fucking numbskull. 

           He turns back into the Embassy.

           EXT. DIANA MEMORIAL PLAYGROUND, MORNING

           Inside Kensington Gardens. A huge wooden pirate ship is the 
           centerpiece of the playground, which also includes teepees, 
           toys, and play sculptures. Children run all over the place 
           while parents and guardians mill about. 

           Steele checks his watch. It’s 9:55am. 

           Ivan walks into the playground. He comes next to Steele.

                                 IVAN
                        Were you amused? 

           He’s being funny, but he doesn’t really show it. Doesn’t have 
           that mode.  

                                 STEELE
                        I don’t particularly care for 
                        playgrounds.

                                 IVAN
                             (re: the pirate ship)
                        I admire the pirates very much.

                                 STEELE
                        How about Donald Trump? 

                                 IVAN
                        His wife. His daughter...

                                 STEELE
                        His hair.

                                 IVAN
                        Is that what this is about? 
                                 STEELE
                        Yes, I intend to determine once and 
                        for all whether or not his hair is 
                        authentic. 

                                 IVAN
                        Good luck.

           Ivan almost starts to go.

                                 STEELE
                        Does he have business in your 
                        homeland? 

           Ivan rocks his head back and forth. 

                                 IVAN
                        He’s had opportunities.

                                 STEELE
                        Real estate, I presume?

                                 IVAN
                        Around the World Cup in 2018.

                                 STEELE
                        You said ‘had’...

                                 IVAN
                        He chose not to accept.

           Steele waits for Ivan to say more, but it’s like pulling 
           teeth with this guy. He rarely goes more than one sentence.

                                 STEELE
                        He doesn’t strike me as a man who 
                        turns down much. Am I wrong? 

                                 IVAN
                        How should I know? He’s not my 
                        comrade.

                                 STEELE
                        He must be someone’s in order to 
                        see proposals.

                                 IVAN
                        The relationship is reciprocal.

           Cryptic. Steele ruminates.

                                 STEELE
                        Does his name begin with a ‘V’? 
                                 IVAN
                        This shouldn’t be a mystery.

           A serene PLAYGROUND MONITOR approaches. 

                                 PLAYGROUND MONITOR
                        Gentlemen, I apologize. 
                        Unaccompanied adults are only 
                        allowed on the grounds between 9:30 
                        and 10:00.

                                 IVAN
                        I’m leaving.

           He goes. Steele, who hasn’t moved, calls after him.

                                 STEELE
                        How long? 

           Ivan puts up his hand as if he’s waving goodbye then counts 
           his fingers, one, two, three, four, five.

                                 IVAN
                        At least.

           EXT. THE RITZ LONDON, NIGHT

           A luxury hotel in the West End (as if it needs to be said). A 
           woman, dressed professionally, walks down the street. Heads 
           turn. If she was never a runway model, she could’ve been. 
           Let’s call her KATE (30s).

           She heads into the hotel.

           Steele, wearing a suit, enters the frame from the opposite 
           side of the street and follows her in. 

           INT. THE RITZ LONDON, NIGHT

           Kate waves to the bellboys, says hello to a server delivering 
           drinks to a guest in the lobby. She puts a name tag on her 
           blouse. She works here.

           As she’s walking, Steele comes up to her from behind, taps 
           her on the shoulder. 

                                 STEELE
                        Do you have a moment? 

                                 KATE
                        I’m on my way to the concierge 
                        desk.
           She might look Russian, but she has a British accent. 

                                 STEELE
                        Five minutes won’t kill them.

                                 KATE
                        Fifteen will.

                                 STEELE
                        I promise.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

           They’re inside a room that isn’t occupied. Kate sits on the 
           bed. Steele hands her cash.

                                 KATE
                        For this time? 

                                 STEELE
                        For last time. 

                                 KATE
                        Then what might this be?

                                 STEELE
                        A favor for a friend.

                                 KATE
                        Who’s the friend? 

                                 STEELE
                        A rather handsome man.

           He sits on the bed next to her. 

                                 STEELE
                        Would any of your regular Russian 
                        guests be interested in discussing 
                        a certain candidate for President 
                        of the United States? 

                                 KATE
                        Perhaps. But that seems quite 
                        pointless. 

                                 STEELE
                        Why? 

                                 KATE
                        Because I know far more about him 
                        than them. But it won’t come for 
                        free. 
           EXT. THE RITZ LONDON, NIGHT

           Steele comes out of the hotel with a cramped expression on 
           his face. His phone rings.

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        Are you calling from Moscow?

           A QUIET WOMAN is on the other end of the line.

                                 QUIET WOMAN (V.O.)
                             (in Russian)
                        I’d rather not say.

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        But you know Kate?

                                 QUIET WOMAN (V.O.)
                             (in Russian)
                        Oh yes. My good friend. We see her 
                        every time we see the orange man.

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        He’s fond of her, so she arranges 
                        his trips to Russia. Is that your 
                        understanding? 

                                 QUIET WOMAN (V.O.)
                             (in Russian)
                        This is above my pay grade. I don’t 
                        know. But there is money that will 
                        come for me? 

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        Yes. Kate will take care of it. 
                        Now, what did you see? 

                                 QUIET WOMAN (V.O.)
                             (in Russian)
                        I had just changed the linens in 
                        the suite where the black American 
                        President and his wife like to 
                        stay. Several women of the night 
                        were called in...

           As Steele listens, his jaw slowly descends.
           INT. NIGHT CLUB, NIGHT

           Steele works his way through the sweaty, drug-addled crowd to 
           the dance floor, where Ivan is literally standing, not 
           dancing, ogling women in every direction. 

           They have to shout to be heard.

                                 STEELE
                        Is there kompromat on Trump? 

                                 IVAN
                        On Clinton? 

           A subtle admission on Ivan’s part. Steele gets it.

                                 STEELE
                        But not on Trump? 

                                 IVAN
                        He’s traveled to Moscow. What would 
                        you guess? 

                                 STEELE
                        Is there a tape? 

                                 IVAN
                        A what?  

           He couldn’t hear.

                                 STEELE
                        Is there a tape of women pissing on 
                        each other in front of him? 

           Ivan grins. 

                                 IVAN
                        The Kremlin is one of the last 
                        places on Earth to still use a VCR.

                                 STEELE
                        What do they want from him? 

                                 IVAN
                        To be a knife.

                                 STEELE
                        Go somewhere posh next time. 

           He leaves the dance floor. 
           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           Seated at his desk, Burrows finishes reading a memo. He looks 
           up. Steele is in the room, standing. 

                                 STEELE
                        Your thoughts?  

                                 BURROWS
                        Besides the fact that we’re all 
                        gobsmacked? 

                                 STEELE
                        Besides that.

                                 BURROWS
                        Go ahead. Send it to Glenn. 

           INT. FUSION GPS, MORNING

           Simpson has finished reading the memo. Frank and Kimmy are 
           sharing his copy now. She reads faster than him.

                                 KIMMY
                        He’s in their pocket. He’s 
                        basically-

                                 FRANK
                        Let me finish.

           Reluctantly, she does. Frank sits down at the conference 
           table. Kimmy picks back up -- 

                                 KIMMY
                        He’s basically a tool for Putin.

           Simpson grabs the memo and reads. What we hear is an actual 
           passage from the memo, dated June 20: 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Specifically, the ‘Russian regime 
                        has been cultivating, supporting 
                        and assisting Trump for at least 
                        five years. Aim, endorsed by Putin, 
                        has been to encourage splits and 
                        division in western alliance.’

                                 KIMMY
                        That’s exactly what I said.
                                 FRANK
                        And he can’t do anything about it 
                        because they have a tape of him 
                        watching golden showers?!

                                 KIMMY
                        Gross! Don’t repeat that.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Why would he want to? 
                             (reads)
                        Trump ‘and his inner circle have 
                        accepted a regular flow of 
                        intelligence from the Kremlin, 
                        including on his Democratic and 
                        other rivals.’

                                 KIMMY
                        The hack? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Quite possibly.

           INT. FBI PRESS BRIEFING, DAY

           FBI DIRECTOR JAMES B. COMEY stands in front of a U.S. flag in 
           between two FBI flags, looking like a high school guidance 
           counselor, with the charisma of a church lector. 

           SUPER: “July 2016: 4 Months Until the Election” 

           These are his actual remarks. Clip one: 

                                 COMEY
                        Good morning. I’m here to give you 
                        an update on the FBI’s 
                        investigation of Secretary 
                        Clinton’s use of a personal email 
                        system during her time as Secretary 
                        of State.

           Clip two: 

                                 COMEY
                        Although we did not find clear 
                        evidence that Secretary Clinton or 
                        her colleagues intended to violate 
                        laws governing the handling of 
                        classified information, there is 
                        evidence that they were extremely 
                        careless in their handling of very 
                        sensitive, highly classified 
                        information.
           Clip three: 

                                 COMEY
                        Although there is evidence of 
                        potential violations of the 
                        statutes regarding the handling of 
                        classified information, our 
                        judgment is that no reasonable 
                        prosecutor would bring such a case.

           INT. NEW ECONOMIC SCHOOL, MOSCOW, DAY

           A 44-year-old American, bald, with light black hair on the 
           sides, looks something like a mortician, speaks at a podium 
           in front of an audience. 

           We’ll soon find out that this is CARTER PAGE, Trump’s foreign 
           policy advisor. These are his actual words: 

                                 PAGE
                        Yet, ironically, Washington and 
                        other Western powers have impeded 
                        potential progress through their 
                        often hypocritical focus on ideas 
                        such as democratization, 
                        inequality, corruption and regime 
                        change.

           The audience is captive. We focus on a pair of distinctive 
           looking Russian men at the front, both with escorts on their 
           arms. We’ll call them LIAISON 1 and LIAISON 2. 

           LATER

           Page has finished his speech. He’s receiving well wishers on 
           stage. The Liaisons and their guests approach while he’s in 
           the middle of talking to someone else.

                                 LIAISON 1
                        Carter! Carter Page. 

           They butt in.

                                 LIAISON 1
                        Not every day you get to see a 
                        famous American economist with the 
                        ear of Donald Trump in the flesh.

           Liaison 1 offers his hand. Nervously, Page takes it. A fallen 
           leaf in front of a brash gust of wind.
                                 PAGE
                        I’m flattered, but I’m here in a 
                        private capacity. I’m firmly an 
                        energy investor.

           Liaison 2 is more casual.

                                 LIAISON 2
                        Either way, important speech.

           He and Page shake hands. 

                                 PAGE
                        Have we met? You look familiar.

                                 LIAISON 1
                        You know Rosneft. 

           Page perks up.

                                 PAGE
                        I’ve been expecting you. 

           EXT. CHESAPEAKE & OHIO CANAL, DAY

           Simpson waits at the large brown sign in Georgetown that 
           marks the start of the towpath. A rail THIN MAN, taller than 
           Glenn, of indeterminate age, suddenly engages him. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Mr. Simpson...

           Simpson, taken aback, looks the man up and down.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Who are you? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Denise had an accident involving 
                        her chair. She asked that I speak 
                        to you about the memo. Shall we 
                        walk? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        We can stand right here.

           Two women in burkas pass between them onto the path. The Thin 
           Man waits until they’re gone.

                                 THIN MAN
                        She has her doubts about the 
                        material. The sources are 
                        anonymous. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THIN MAN (CONT'D)
                        The information is ‘hearsay’ to use 
                        one word, ‘gossip’ to use another.

                                 SIMPSON
                        We have two, three sources all 
                        saying the same thing. That’s 
                        called reporting. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Let me see if I have this correct. 
                        Yes. Her first words after reading 
                        the memo were, ‘When was Glenn 
                        going to tell me I’m funding The 
                        National Enquirer?’ 

                                 SIMPSON
                        The Enquirer killed John Edwards.

           A soldier in uniform walks out of the path with her 
           boyfriend, a civilian. Simpson and the Thin Man wait. Then --

                                 THIN MAN
                        To be actionable, we need hard 
                        evidence. To leak to the media, to 
                        show to donors, other Republicans.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Fuck you. If he were a Democrat 
                        this would be in the hands of every 
                        media outlet under the sun. 

           The Thin Man doesn’t respond.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Did she send you here to tell me 
                        that she’s done? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Business ends with a phone call, 
                        Glenn, not a meeting.

           INT. GATED HOME IN SURREY, NIGHT

           A 1.5 million-pound mansion. This is where Chris Steele 
           lives. He’s currently home, playing with his three cats. His 
           phone rings.

           INTERCUT: SIMPSON

           On the other end of the line, also at home. A condo. Not 
           modest. But messy. The home of a creative type. Books on the 
           sofa and a joint burning in the ash tray.
                                 SIMPSON
                        I know it’s Saturday night there. 
                        Are you married? Sorry if you’re at 
                        dinner with your wife. 

                                 STEELE
                        I have time.

           Steele moves through the house as the conversation continues.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I think I know the answer to this, 
                        but what are the chances you can 
                        get the tape? 

                                 STEELE
                        I set myself up for that, didn’t I?

           Steele goes to the window, looks outside. Something raises 
           his eyebrows.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Do you believe it exists? 

                                 STEELE
                        My sources indicate-

                                 SIMPSON
                        What’s in your gut? 

                                 STEELE
                        I’ll ring you back. 

           He hangs up, opens the front door and walks 

           OUTSIDE

           Where he finds the gate to his home wide open, swinging in 
           the dark. 

           EXT. LONDON BUS STOP, DAY

           Ivan, Steele’s contact at the Russian Embassy, waits amidst a 
           small group of people. 

           Steele meanders into the crowd, next to Ivan, and looks up 
           something on his phone. The page he wants won’t load -- or at 
           least that’s what he pretends is happening.

                                 STEELE
                        Goddamn mobile service... never 
                        works when you need it. Am I right?
           He turns to Ivan as if he’s a total stranger. 

                                 STEELE
                        I was trying to look at what’s 
                        playing at the cinema in the West 
                        End. You wouldn’t happen to know, 
                        would you? Have you seen anything 
                        recently that you’ve liked? 

                                 IVAN
                        You should find another hobby.

                                 STEELE
                        I wouldn’t say that. I heard about 
                        a film just the other day that was 
                        set in a hotel...

           A NOSY BYSTANDER interrupts --

                                 NOSY BYSTANDER
                        Grand Budapest Hotel, that’s it.

                                 STEELE
                        Hmm. I’m not sure that’s the one. 
                        This was a Russian film, I believe. 

           Ivan is silent.

                                 STEELE
                        It may not be in theatres now that 
                        I think of it. It may be available 
                        to watch at home. That’s what I’m 
                        trying to find out. Can I watch 
                        this Russian film set in a hotel in 
                        the comfort of my own home? 

           He surveys the crowd for answers. They look at him like he’s 
           out of his mind. Ivan eventually weighs in. 

                                 IVAN
                        Forget the cinema. Go to the 
                        British Library for Russian 
                        literature. 

           The bus arrives. The crowd lines up.

                                 IVAN
                        But get there by 4:00 or there 
                        won’t be any books left.

           As the passengers board, Ivan and Steele ignore the bus and 
           go their separate ways. 
           EXT. THE BRITISH LIBRARY, DAY

           From outside it looks more like a compound than a library. 
           Steele checks his watch. A couple minutes to four. 

           He walks towards the entrance.

           INT. THE BRITISH LIBRARY, DAY

           Steele wanders into a section with cubbies surrounded by all 
           consuming stacks of books. Almost no one is here... except a 
           droll-looking man with a fat face and dark hair that’s 
           probably a toupee. Copies of The Brothers Karamozov, War & 
           Peace, and Anna Karenina are piled up at his side. 

           Steele sits down next to him. 

                                 STEELE
                        May I ask what you’re reading? 

           The man closes the book in front of him and shows Steele the 
           cover. Crime & Punishment. 

                                 STEELE
                        Ah, Ivan’s my favorite character. 

           The man, whom we’ll call THE STORYTELLER, takes off his 
           reading glasses. He speaks with a Russian accent.

                                 THE STORYTELLER
                        Would you like to hear a tale about 
                        a no name foreign policy adviser 
                        who met with an oil company on 
                        behalf of the reality TV star who 
                        made him a public figure?

                                 STEELE
                        Go on...

                                 THE STORYTELLER
                        Let’s say this company is in peril 
                        because of sanctions against its 
                        home country. Can you imagine it 
                        offering nineteen percent of its 
                        equity to the reality star in 
                        exchange for those sanctions being 
                        lifted?  

                                 STEELE
                        Through his adviser...
                                 THE STORYTELLER
                        As a proxy so irrelevant he could 
                        slip through the cracks, 
                        unmolested.

                                 STEELE
                        Is this true? 

                                 THE STORYTELLER
                        Wait. There’s an epilogue. Let’s 
                        finally imagine this stranichkin 
                        meets with Igor Divyekin and learns 
                        that the Kremlin has kompromat on 
                        his boss. And that this should 
                        always be kept in mind. 
                             (beat)
                        Do you see the pieces of a puzzle 
                        fitting together? 

                                 STEELE
                        Who are you? 

                                 THE STORYTELLER
                        Rosneft has a President. That man 
                        has associates.

                                 STEELE
                        Why do you want me to know this? 

           The Storyteller puts his reading glasses back on and returns 
           to his book. 

           INT. CAFE, DAY

           The streets of Washington DC are visible through the glass 
           front. Simpson sits at a table in the back with a briefcase. 
           He’s moved the chair opposite him out of the way to make room 
           for Denise’s wheelchair. 

           But then the Thin Man walks in. Simpson swears under his 
           breath. The Thin Man repositions the chair and sits.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Tell her I know that she’s blowing 
                        me off. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Do you really? 

           Simpson removes a two-page document from his briefcase. He 
           reads, out loud, actual excerpts from Steele’s memo. 
                                 SIMPSON
                        ‘Trump senior advisor Carter Page 
                        holds secret meetings in Moscow 
                        with Sechin and senior Kremlin 
                        Internal Affairs official, 
                        Divyekin.’
                             (beat)
                        ‘Substance included offer of large 
                        stake in Rosneft in return for 
                        lifting sanctions on Russia over 
                        Ukraine. Page confirms this is 
                        Trump’s intention.’
                             (beat)
                        ‘Divyekin... hints at Kremlin 
                        possession of kompromat on Trump.’ 
                             (beat)
                        Those are the highlights. 

           He passes the document to the Thin Man, who skims through it 
           then stands up. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        That’s it? You’re not going to say 
                        anything? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I have a flight to Cleveland. 

           He leaves.

           EXT. CLEVELAND, DAY

           Archival footage of the city during the week of the 
           Republican National Convention. We see protesters, 
           Republicans, police and an eerily deserted landscape as big 
           business chose not to attend and those working in and around 
           the city were told to stay home. 

           Denise motors through the crowd outside the Q arena, where 
           the events of the Convention itself are being held. No 
           bandages, cast, bruises; no sign of an accident. 

           INT. LONDON RESTAURANT, NIGHT

           Steele walks in, ignoring the Maitre D’, and heads for the 
           dining area, where he spots Ivan having dinner with a large 
           contingent.

           They make eye contact.

           Steele heads to the restroom. 
           INT. RESTROOM, NIGHT

           He enters a stall and leaves the door partially open. Moments 
           later someone else walks into the restroom and enters the 
           stall next to him. The voice tells us it’s Ivan.

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        My dessert’s on the way.

                                 STEELE
                        Is it coming out with the tape?

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        Don’t be absurd.

                                 STEELE
                        You’ve already compromised him.

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        To a degree.

                                 STEELE
                        What do you want to accomplish? 

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        Not everyone-

           They hear something. The door opens. The sink runs. Then the 
           hand dryer. The door opens again.

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        Not everyone approves of the 
                        scheme. Dissent is healthy.

           Steele laughs.

                                 STEELE
                        Yes, I’m sure Putin has that quote 
                        hanging above his bed.

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        Why does it matter? Who’s paying 
                        you? Is the money drying up? Or are 
                        you still angry about your friend, 
                        Litvinenko?

           Steele comes out of his stall and barges into Ivan’s, 
           knocking into him. But Ivan holds his ground, doesn’t flinch.

                                 IVAN
                        You know how this works. I talk to 
                        you. You talk to me. Money is 
                        passed around. We don’t really do 
                        anything. Nothing changes. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        We eat good steak. Sleep with 
                        beautiful women. Drive fast cars. 
                        It’s all a game. Golf, not rugby.

           Ivan pushes past Steele, heads for the door.

           Steele watches him go then glances at the sink. There’s a 
           streak of blood in the basin. 

           INT. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, NIGHT

           The arena where the Cleveland Cavaliers play basketball has 
           been turned into a shrine to the Republican party. Revelers 
           on the floor and in the seats. “Make America Great Again” 
           signs everywhere...

           IVANKA TRUMP, in a pink sleeveless dress, on stage. 

           This is from the actual speech:

                                 IVANKA
                        I’ve loved and respected him my 
                        entire life. And I could not be 
                        more proud tonight to present to 
                        you, and to all of America, my 
                        father and our next President, 
                        Donald J. Trump!

           Trump, in a dark suit and red tie, walks out to bombastic 
           orchestral music and languorous applause. He kisses Ivanka on 
           both cheeks, comes close to patting her on the ass, then 
           makes his way to the podium, clapping, waving, giving a dual 
           thumbs up. We see exuberant faces in the crowd as the 
           applause grows louder.

                                 TRUMP
                        Thank you, thank you. Thank you. 
                        Thank you very much. Friends, 
                        delegates, and fellow Americans. I 
                        humbly and gratefully accept your 
                        nomination for the Presidency of 
                        the United States. 

           The crowd erupts. A “U.S.A.” chant starts. Trump picks it up.

                                 TRUMP
                        U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A. 
                             (returns to his speech)

                                 TRUMP (CONT'D)
                        Who would have believed that when 
                        we started this journey on June 16 
                        last year, we- and I say we because 
                        we are a team- would have received 
                        almost 14 million votes, the most 
                        in the history of the Republican 
                        party, and that the Republican 
                        Party would have gotten sixty 
                        percent more votes than it received 
                        eight years ago? Who would have 
                        believed this? 

           INT. DIVE BAR, NIGHT

           Simpson, Kimmy, and Frank watch the close of Trump’s speech 
           amongst a group of hardcore drinkers who are some combination 
           of shocked and amused. Simpson and company are more dour. 

           His phone rings. 

           INTERCUT: DENISE

           On the other end of the line, watching from inside the Ritz-
           Carlton in Cleveland.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’ve been expecting this call. 

                                 DENISE
                        It’s over, Glenn. We’ll pay out for 
                        last week and then that’s it. He’s 
                        our candidate now.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Yours? Or the Russians’? 

                                 DENISE
                        I believe in the Republican Party.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Party over country, that’s what 
                        they always say...

                                 DENISE
                        Goodbye, Glenn. You did good work. 
                        It just didn’t make a difference.

           She hangs up. Simpson sets his phone down on the bar.

                                 KIMMY
                        Was that it? 
           He nods. She slaps the bar. Frank curses. Smiling, cheering 
           people fill the TV screens.

           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           Burrows walks down the hall and peeks into an office. Steele, 
           inside, throwing darts at a dartboard. 

                                 BURROWS
                        Chris.

           They make eye contact. Burrows makes the throat slash 
           gesture.

                                 STEELE
                        I’ll close my door. 

                                 BURROWS
                        No, not the darts. The reality 
                        star.

                                 STEELE
                        Life goes on.

           He throws another dart. 

           INT. DARK ROOM, NIGHT

           Low light. Someone burning the midnight oil. We see hands 
           typing at a keyboard. On the computer screen, a bar tracks 
           the progress of an upload. A very large file. It shoots 
           through to the finish.

           A few mouse clicks, a couple keyboard taps, and then a 
           webpage publishes, taking over the screen --

           https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails

           The header reads: 

           “Search the DNC email database”

           Below that, a passage that reads in part: 

           “Starting on Friday 22 July 2016 at 10:30am EDT, WikiLeaks 
           released over 2 publications 44,053 emails and 17,761 
           attachments from the top of the US Democratic National 
           Committee -- part one of our new Hillary Leaks series.”

                                                                CUT TO:
           A MONTAGE OF EMAILS

           From the DNC hack, including those that suggest the committee 
           actively undermined the Sanders campaign in favor of Clinton. 
           The montage ends with an email about Sanders from Debbie 
           Wasserman Schultz:

           “He isn’t going to be president.” 

           Followed by --

           A CLIP FROM FOX NEWS

           BRETT BAIER interviews Michigan Congresswoman DEBBIE DINGELL 
           on one side of the screen. The other half has footage up of 
           TIM KAINE, who has just been announced as Clinton’s running 
           mate. This is an actual transcript: 

                                 BAIER
                        Congresswomen, I know that you say 
                        it’s unity, and I know Bernie 
                        Sanders has endorsed Hillary 
                        Clinton. But, you know, there are 
                        these emails- thousands of them now 
                        out, that WikiLeaks put out, from 
                        the DNC emails- that show there was 
                        clearly some effort to edge out 
                        Bernie Sanders. And that the 
                        concern that the Sanders people, 
                        including Senator Sanders, had 
                        about Debbie Wasserman Schultz may 
                        have been justified.

           INT. DNC HQ, DAY

           With the help of interns, Wasserman Schultz packs up the 
           items in her office.

           LATER

           A shot of Wasserman Schultz in the empty office all alone. 
           She’s out. She resigned. 

           LATER STILL

           CEO Amy Dacey walks between two members of security. One is 
           at her side. The other pushes a cart loaded with boxes that 
           have her name written on them. No one in the office wants to 
           look at her.
           Tamene walks by. 

           He stops, turns, and watches her leave the building... before 
           proceeding into the help desk area and turning on his 
           computer. 

           INT. FBI NORTHERN VIRGINIA RESIDENCE AGENCY, DAY

           Special Agent Hawkins looks at Twitter, sees an (actual) 
           tweet from @realdonaldtrump: 

           “The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous 
           D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written 
           (stupid), because Putin likes me.”

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE, DAY

           Trump stands at a podium with his name and Pence’s name and 
           “Miami, Florida” on it. Behind him, a blue curtain, the 
           American flag and the flag for the state of Florida. This is 
           an actual transcript.

           A MALE REPORTER asks: 

                                 MALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        When you say, ‘Let’s get tough,’ 
                        why not get tough on Putin and say, 
                        ‘Stay out’-

                                 TRUMP
                        What do I have to get involved with 
                        Putin for? I have nothing to do 
                        with Putin. I’ve never spoken to 
                        Putin. I know nothing about him 
                        other than he will respect me. He 
                        doesn’t respect our President. And 
                        if it is Russia- and it’s probably 
                        not- nobody knows who it is. But if 
                        it is Russia it’s really bad for a 
                        different reason. Because it shows 
                        how little respect they have for 
                        our country when they would hack 
                        into a major party and get 
                        everything. But it would be 
                        interesting to see- I will tell you 
                        this- 
                             (looks directly into the

                        I think you will probably be 
                        rewarded mightily by our press. 

           INT. SOUTHERN ESTATE, DAY

           The Thin Man stands next to Denise in a lavish living room. 
           They’re watching the press conference from Miami on C-SPAN. 
           Neither looks very comfortable. 

                                 TRUMP
                        No, no. Excuse me. In the back.

                                 GERMAN FEMALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        I would like to know, if you became 
                        President, would you recognize the 
                        annexed (inaudible) Crimea as 
                        Russian territory? And also if the 
                        US would lift sanctions that are 
                        (inaudible)?

                                 TRUMP
                        We’ll be looking at that, yeah. 
                        We’ll be looking.
                             (points)
                        Go ahead.

           As the next reporter asks a question, Denise mutes the TV 
           with the remote. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        That was predicted in the memo from 
                        Fusion.

                                 DENISE
                        Yes it was. 

           She stews. Then --

                                 DENISE
                        We have a list of donors on the 
                        opposing team...

                                 THIN MAN
                        We do.

                                 DENISE
                        Pick a pit bull. Put them in touch 
                        with Glenn.

           EXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, MORNING

           A plane takes off. 
           SUPER: “August 2016: 3 Months Until the Election” 

           INT. PLANE, DAY

           Simpson is in first class, in the window seat, looking out 
           over Los Angeles as the plane continues its descent. 

           I/E. HOUSE IN MALIBU, DAY

           Simpson walks through a gorgeous interior, out to the back, 
           where there’s a pool, even though the house overlooks the 
           ocean. 

           A tall, blonde-haired man in his mid-20s, with a hairless 
           chest and a model’s physique skims the pool for debris. We’ll 
           call him DAVID.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Where’s David? 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m David. 

           He puts the net down, greets Simpson.

                                 DAVID
                        You thought I was the pool boy. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I expected someone older, shorter, 
                        wearing a shirt. 

                                 DAVID
                        You stereotypical old, white man. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Are you the guy? Or do you 
                        represent the guy? 

                                 DAVID
                        Your skin looks truly vampiric. 
                        Let’s get you some trunks.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Simpson, in newly outfitted swim trunks, sits across the pool 
           from David. They dangle their legs in the water. It’s killing 
           Simpson to be this relaxed. 
                                 DAVID
                        Are you sure you don’t want to lose 
                        the shirt? I’ve got lotion.

                                 SIMPSON
                        What are we doing here? 

                                 DAVID
                        We’re dancing. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        There’s no time for that. Did my 
                        previous client slip you the memos? 

           David smiles.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Does that mean you want us to slip 
                        you the memos? 

           David dives into the pool, swims towards Simpson, but stops 
           in the middle of the pool. 

                                 DAVID
                        I heard there’s a tape. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        We don’t know if it exists.

                                 DAVID
                        That’d be something if it did.

                                 SIMPSON
                        What do you need from me to help 
                        you make a decision?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, it’s not up to me. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Then who’s it up to? 

           David swims over, hops out of the water, gets two Coronas 
           from a fridge and sits down next to Simpson. He passes him a 
           beer.

                                 DAVID
                        Just keep the number under six 
                        figures. Unless you get the tape. 
                        Then...

           He shrugs. They cheers, drink. Not everything Simpson could 
           have hoped for but something. 
           EXT. LONDON, NIGHT

           Steele walks the dark, lonely streets on his own. We see no 
           one else, but we hear their footsteps. 

           He turns down an alley. At the other end he sees --

           The Russian Embassy, off in the distance. 

           A taxi pulls up in front of it, stops. A woman gets out. She 
           walks towards Steele, covered by darkness. 

           It’s Kate, his contact from the Ritz. 

                                 STEELE
                        I wouldn’t have chosen this spot. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m here every Tuesday. It’d be 
                        stranger if I weren’t.

           She walks past Steele, to their actual destination, a 
           drinking lounge behind a cozy little wooden door. 

                                 STEELE
                        Wait. You don’t know what I need, 
                        and I’m not sure you can find out.

                                 KATE
                        Try me.

                                 STEELE
                        Are your ties to the campaign or to 
                        the company? 

           She looks at the door. Not the ideal conversation to have in 
           public.

                                 KATE
                        I’ll say it like this. He DM’s me 
                        on Twitter.

                                 STEELE
                        You can’t get this from him. I mean 
                        you could, assuming he’s not the 
                        least knowledgable person on the 
                        campaign, but you shouldn’t.

                                 KATE
                        Thankfully I’m very social.

                                 STEELE
                        Careful. I have a docket of 
                        questions for you.
                                 KATE
                        Do you have funds? 

                                 STEELE
                        Would I expect you to speak to me 
                        if I didn’t?

           She opens the wooden door and holds it there, asking him to 
           come inside with her. 

                                 STEELE
                        I don’t like the smell of borscht.

           He goes.

           INT. LOUNGE, NIGHT

           The place is packed with people of Russian descent. The 
           chatter is loud, the music is louder. Kate sits in a booth, 
           part of a large group, lots of drinks to go around. 

           She receives a text message that says, “Uber for flowers.”

           Quickly, she says goodbye to her friends and leaves. Walking 
           out, she passes Ivan, having drinks with a woman. Neither 
           seems to know the other. But now we understand why Steele 
           didn’t want to come in with her.

           EXT. LOUNGE, NIGHT

           Indeed an Uber is waiting for Kate outside. She gets in.  

           INT. UBER, NIGHT

           The DRIVER is Pakistani. 

                                 DRIVER
                        You’re Christopher? 

                                 KATE
                        My boyfriend.

                                 DRIVER
                        You’re going to 20B Waterloo in 
                        Maplethorpe?

                                 KATE
                        That sounds as right as anything.
           EXT. LOUNGE, CONTINUOUS

           As the Uber pulls away, Steele reappears and enters the 
           lounge.

           EXT. LONDON, NIGHT

           The Uber drops Kate in a desolate area. No one wants to be 
           here. The car pulls away, leaving Kate stranded. 

           Someone waits in the shadows, holding a box of flowers. 

                                 KATE
                        Are those for me? 

           The individual comes forward, speaks up. It’s Burrows.

                                 BURROWS
                        I can’t say I see anyone here who 
                        deserves them more than you. 

           He hands her the box and walks away. 

           She opens it. Inside, a dozen roses, wrapped in tissue paper. 
           Underneath, several questions have been handwritten on the 
           bottom of the box.

           INT. LOUNGE, NIGHT

           Steele sits at the bar, sipping a martini. Ivan walks up to 
           order a drink. They act like they don’t know each other. 

                                 STEELE
                        Crowded for a Tuesday isn’t it? 

                                 IVAN
                        Crowded in general. 

                                 STEELE
                        I prefer the library, actually. 
                        Would you believe that? I meet the 
                        most fascinating people there. For 
                        instance, just the other day I met 
                        a man who was a champion of Russian 
                        literature. He told me a story 
                        about a little boy, for all intents 
                        and purposes, who was sent to a 
                        foreign land to negotiate on behalf 
                        of a wannabe king. You’re Russian. 
                        Do you know this story? 
                                 IVAN
                        I don’t like fairy tales.

           The bartender reaches Ivan.

                                 IVAN
                        Another vodka.

                                 STEELE
                        I would tend to agree. But then, a 
                        few days later, I saw the wannabe 
                        king himself, in front of the 
                        American media, confirm pieces of 
                        the negotiation. And I thought, I 
                        need to meet this man again, to 
                        hear more unbelievable stories that 
                        magically come to life. 

           The bartender delivers Ivan’s drink. 

                                 IVAN
                        Oleg is underpaid.

           He puts cash down on the bar to pay for his vodka, holds it 
           there, looks at Steele... then leaves it, turns away, and 
           returns to his table. 

           EXT. THE RITZ LONDON, DAY

           Steele, in disguise -- wig, fake glasses, a beard -- 
           approaches the hotel. 

           INT. THE RITZ LONDON, DAY

           Steele heads to guest check-in, greets a female HOTELIER.  

                                 STEELE
                        Checking in. 

                                 HOTELIER
                        Last name?

                                 STEELE
                        Stalin.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, DAY

           Steele enters the room using a keycard. He flips over the 
           pillows on the bed, finds a manila envelope tucked under the 
           comforter, and takes it. 
           From his coat, he pulls out a bundle of pound notes, then 
           slips the pillowcase off a pillow, stuffs the money inside, 
           and redresses the pillow. 

           LATER  

           Kate walks in and retrieves the money from the pillowcase. 

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, DAY

           Steele strips off his disguise in a stall, packages it into a 
           briefcase and exits.

           INT. MERCEDES, DAY

           Parked on a street off the beaten path. Steele sits in the 
           driver’s seat, reading the material that Kate put together, 
           borderline shocked.  

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC, MORNING

           Simpson walks from getting coffee towards the Metro station. 
           His phone buzzes in his breast pocket. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’m about to go underground. 

           INTERCUT: STEELE

           In the Mercedes on his cell. 

                                 STEELE
                        No, you want to hear what I found 
                        immediately.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Who’s the source? 

                                 STEELE
                        An ethnic Russian, close associate 
                        of Trump. The same source who first 
                        told me about the tape. 

           Simpson reaches the Metro station. It’s rush hour. He 
           attempts to post up out of the way, but it’s impossible. 
           People are just going to have to deal with him. 

                                 STEELE
                        Glenn-
                                 SIMPSON
                        Sorry, it’s a mess here.

                                 STEELE
                        More than you realize. We’re 
                        looking at a full blown conspiracy 
                        between the Trump campaign and the 
                        Kremlin. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        What? 

                                 STEELE
                        The Carter Page detail opened all 
                        of this up for me. Manafort, the 
                        campaign manager, is fielding it. 
                        But Trump is aware. They’re using 
                        WikiLeaks for the sake of plausible 
                        deniability.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Who is? The Russians? 

                                 STEELE
                        Yes, but the campaign has hackers 
                        as well. They’re co-funding the 
                        operation through a scheme with the 
                        Russian pension disbursement 
                        system. And the Trump hackers are 
                        getting information on Russian 
                        oligarchs and their families inside 
                        the US and passing it back to the 
                        Kremlin.

                                 SIMPSON
                        A Putin obsession...

                                 STEELE
                        Absolutely.  

                                 SIMPSON
                        Write the memo. 

           He hangs up, trapped in a throng of people, tries to find his 
           footing. What the hell is going on? 

           EXT. THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE, DAY

           As we saw earlier, senior Russian diplomat Popov exits then 
           gets into a waiting car. 
           EXT. NURSING HOME, DAY

           Only the grandson waits outside. The Elderly Man is nowhere 
           to be seen. The black sedan pulls up. The door opens.  

           INT. BLACK SEDAN, CONTINUOUS

           The grandson leans inside, arm extended, holding a folder. 
           Popov takes it.

                                 POPOV
                             (in Russian)
                        Where’s your grandfather? 

                                 GRANDSON
                        Uh, what’s that? 

                                 POPOV
                        You don’t speak Russian? 

                                 GRANDSON
                        I did Spanish in high school.

           Popov is disgusted. 

                                 POPOV
                        Is your grandpa sick? 

                                 GRANDSON
                        I made him stay inside because of 
                        the temperature. Hottest year on 
                        record, man.

           Popov can’t close the door fast enough. As the car pulls 
           away, he goes through the contents of the folder. More 
           information on Russian oligarchs and their families...

           And an image of the Ben Affleck Batman with a “Make America 
           Great Again” sign hanging between the bat ears on his mask. 

           Popov chuckles, finds a pen, scribbles out “America” and 
           writes the word “Russia”.  

           INT. HOUSE IN MALIBU, NIGHT

           An ongoing black tie affair. Clinton campaign propaganda 
           decorates the home. It’s a fundraiser -- which honestly looks 
           a lot more like a party than a gathering of people who see 
           their candidate facing a serious threat. 

           David moves through the crowd. He seems to know everybody. 
           His phone buzzes. He checks it. 

           A new email from Glenn Simpson.

           The subject: “Company Intelligence Report” 

           In the body, text from Steele’s actual memo: “Russia/US 
           Presidential Election: Further Indications Of Extensive 
           Conspiracy Between Trump’s Campaign Team and the Kremlin”

           A PDF is attached. The memo. 

           David appears disappointed that that’s all there is. He 
           writes back: “Maybe it’s because I’m a Millennial but video 
           >>>>>> text” 

           He sends the message then returns to the party.

           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           Steele’s office. He’s eating Jelly Babies again. An assistant 
           walks in, drops a package on his desk. As she leaves, Burrows 
           enters.

                                 BURROWS
                        Glenn called me. The client is 
                        pressuring him to deliver the tape.

           Steele is slow to respond. He’s looking at the package 
           curiously. 

                                 STEELE
                        There’s one other maneuver I can 
                        try, but it’ll cost us. 

                                 BURROWS
                        Will it fit the budget? 

                                 STEELE
                        No.

           He starts to open the package.

                                 BURROWS
                        Perhaps we have a moral obligation. 

                                 STEELE
                        Do we? 

           Neither of them knows for sure.

                                 BURROWS
                        You’ll make the proper decision.
           He leaves. 

           Steele finishes opening the package. Inside, there are photos 
           of Alexander Litvinenko on his death bed, hairless, dying 
           from polonium poisoning.

           Steele drops the images on his desk.

           EXT. RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, DAY

           Some Russian children play with sidewalk chalk outside the 
           fence. 

           Steele walks up, bends down to the level of a LITTLE GIRL 
           with a blue piece of chalk. 

                                 STEELE
                        Do you know how to spell ‘River 
                        Thames’? 

           Excitedly, she nods.

                                 STEELE
                        Let’s see it then.

           She writes both words but incorrectly spells ‘Thames’, 
           forgetting the ‘h.’

                                 STEELE
                        That’s wonderful. 

           He walks away. 

           Moments later, Ivan emerges from the Ministry and discovers 
           the ‘River Tames’ scrawl. 

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Look what a man asked me to write, 
                        Daddy!

           Ivan checks in every direction.

           EXT. THE RIVER THAMES, NIGHT

           Steele waits at the edge of the river. Several dead swans lie 
           along this stretch. They’ve been shot through with bullets. 
           He’s troubled.

           Ivan shows up.

                                 STEELE
                        Someone killed these swans.
           Ivan glances at them, doesn’t really look like he cares. 

                                 IVAN
                        What do you want? 

                                 STEELE
                        From you, nothing.

           He hands a thick envelope to Ivan, who looks inside.

                                 STEELE
                        You said Oleg was underpaid.

           Ivan smiles. 

                                 STEELE
                        Why did you give me his name? 

                                 IVAN
                        I’ll be in touch.

           He starts to go.

                                 STEELE
                        I want to know what I’m purchasing.

                                 IVAN
                        That’s up to Oleg.

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        It could be up to you. 

           Ivan stops.

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        Aren’t you also underpaid?

                                 IVAN
                             (in Russian)
                        Aren’t we all? 

                                 STEELE
                             (in Russian)
                        You could keep it for yourself. If 
                        you traded me the tape.

           Ivan walks.

                                 STEELE
                        I didn’t appreciate the photos by 
                        the way.
           But Ivan is gone. Nothing but darkness. 

           INT. FUSION GPS, NIGHT

           It’s a Sunday. The crew is working late. Frank and Kimmy are 
           in the conference room, eating pizza, writing memos, keeping 
           one eye on Twitter.

           A new story hits Kimmy’s feed. A tweet from the New York 
           Times. 

                                 KIMMY
                        Did you see this? Look.

           She clicks, swivels her laptop towards Frank. He reads the 
           headline: 

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Secret ledger in Ukraine lists 
                        cash for Donald Trump’s Campaign 
                        Chief.’ Holy shit.

           Frank pulls the article up on his computer while Kimmy 
           hurriedly carries her laptop out of the conference room.

                                 KIMMY
                        Glenn!

           She bursts into Simpson’s office. He’s stoic. A bottle of 
           whiskey on his desk.

                                 KIMMY
                        The Times got Manafort.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Did they?  

           Frank yells from the conference room: 

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        He was being handed kickbacks from 
                        Yanukovych.

                                 KIMMY
                        Is that the former President of 
                        Ukraine?

                                 SIMPSON
                        Putin loyalist. 
                                 KIMMY
                        You don’t look surprised. Have you 
                        been feeding them stuff? Did you 
                        know this was coming? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        But I am surprised. I’m surprised 
                        the Times published a story that 
                        didn’t have shit to do with email.

           Frank comes in with his laptop, reading. 

                                 FRANK
                        ‘In addition, criminal prosecutors 
                        are investigating a group of 
                        offshore shell companies that 
                        helped members of Mr. Yanukovych’s 
                        inner circle finance their lavish 
                        lifestyles... among the hundreds of 
                        murky transactions these companies 
                        engaged in was an $18 million deal 
                        to sell Ukrainian cable television 
                        assets to a partnership put 
                        together by Mr. Manafort and a 
                        Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, a 
                        close ally of President Vladimir V. 
                        Putin.’ 

                                 KIMMY
                        No way he survives this. Not with 
                        the heat Trump’s been getting about 
                        Russia.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Plus, I heard they wanted to bring 
                        someone in above Manafort anyway.

                                 KIMMY
                        Are there names?   

                                 SIMPSON
                        Yeah. Steve Bannon.

                                 FRANK
                        The Breitbart guy?

                                 SIMPSON
                        Ringmaster of the fucking alt-
                        right. We go from a dishonest 
                        traitor to a maniac.

                                 FRANK
                        But if it breaks the link to Russia 
                        are we better off? 
                                 SIMPSON
                        Those links are like redwoods. Get 
                        back to work.

           INT. CNN, DAY

           Host BRIANNA KEILAR interviews Trump organization 
           executive/Donald’s personal lawyer, MICHAEL COHEN in split-
           screen. Cohen is pompous, tanned, douchey, wearing a pink 
           tie. 

           A headline at the bottom of the screen reads: “Trump 
           Overhauls Campaign In Dramatic Shakeup”. There’s also a 
           countdown timer to the Green Party Presidential Town Hall. 
           This is an actual transcript of a clip that went viral: 

                                 KEILAR
                        You say it’s not a shakeup, but you 
                        guys are down. And it makes sense 
                        that-

                                 COHEN
                        Says who? 

                                 KEILAR
                        Polls. 

                                 COHEN
                        Says who? 

           Keilar is incredulous. Cohen talks over her. 

                                 KEILAR
                        Most of them. All of them? 

           Cohen is silent for several seconds. Then:

                                 COHEN
                        Says who? 

                                 KEILAR
                        Polls. I just told you. I answered 
                        your question. 

                                 COHEN
                        Okay. Which polls? 

                                 KEILAR
                        All of them.

                                 COHEN
                        Okay. And your question is? 
           INT. FOX NEWS, MORNING

           ERIC TRUMP, gelled, pale and vampiric, is interviewed at a 
           3/4 angle on Sunday Morning Futures. This is from an actual 
           transcript: 

                                 ERIC TRUMP
                        ...I think my father didn’t want to 
                        be distracted by, you know, 
                        whatever things, you know, Paul was 
                        dealing with. And Paul was amazing. 
                        He helped us get through the 
                        primary process. He helped us get 
                        through the convention. He did a 
                        great job with the delegates. Now 
                        you look at Kellyanne and some of 
                        the other people that we’re 
                        bringing in, and they’re absolutely 
                        fantastic. I think they’re gonna be 
                        the ones that bring us all the way 
                        through November 8th and ultimately 
                        get us the victory. 

           EXT. STEELE'S HOME, NIGHT

           The gate opens. 

           SUPER: “September 2016: 2 Months Until the Election” 

           Steele pulls in in his Mercedes but has to stop prematurely. 
           Something’s lying in the driveway. 

           A nylon sack.

           He gets out, cautious, letting the car idle. He investigates 
           the sack, opening it. 

           Inside, a host of library books. Bios on Stalin, Lenin. 
           Nonfiction on the Soviet Union. Last but not least, a book on 
           Soviet gulags.

           He opens the cover. A Post-It has been stuck on top of the 
           register of when the book was checked out and needs to be 
           returned. It says: “TOMORROW 3PM”

           INT. THE BRITISH LIBRARY, DAY

           Steele carries the sack to the return bin then drops off the 
           books. He proceeds into the section of the library with high 
           stacks and cubbies, where he previously met the Storyteller 
           aka Oleg. 
           No one is here besides an OLD LIBRARIAN, re-stacking the 
           shelves, gray hair up in a bun.

           Steele approaches her. 

                                 STEELE
                        Excuse me, ma’am, you don’t happen 
                        to have seen a man with dark hair, 
                        short but shaggy? Russian. He most 
                        likely would have been reading 
                        Dostoevsky... 

           She stops her work, looks concerned.

                                 OLD LIBRARIAN
                        You’re not bringing in more 
                        trouble, are you? 

                                 STEELE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 OLD LIBRARIAN
                        There was a bit of a tiff half an 
                        hour ago. More than a tiff, really. 
                        Two bobbies came in. There was a 
                        shouting match with this man. Who 
                        sounds like your man. Well, that 
                        turned into a fisticuffs. He had to 
                        be escorted out. 

                                 STEELE
                        What were they arguing about? 

                                 OLD LIBRARIAN
                        I couldn’t say. The whole tit-for-
                        tat was in Russian, I believe. 
                        Imagine that. A couple British 
                        police officers informed of a 
                        Communist language.

           Steele breaks for the doors.

           EXT. LONDON, NIGHT

           It’s raining. Ivan, a woman who appears to be his WIFE, and 
           their little girl exit a restaurant together.

                                 WIFE
                             (in Russian)
                        I don’t have my umbrella.
                                 IVAN
                             (in Russian)
                        If you told me, I would’ve valeted. 

           Bearing the downpour, Ivan hurries down the street towards 
           their car, a BMW. He hits the remote keyless entry. The 
           lights flash. He gets in.

           INT. BMW, CONTINUOUS

           Closes the door, reaches for the push button starter -- when 
           the passenger door opens.

           Steele.

           He occupies the passenger seat, slams the door. 

                                 IVAN
                        While I’m out with my family-

                                 STEELE
                        Where is he?

                                 IVAN
                        Do I look like his shadow? 

                                 STEELE
                        Men dressed like bobbies took him 
                        before I arrived.

                                 IVAN
                        Then take a tour of police 
                        stations. 

                                 STEELE
                        They spoke Russian. 

                                 IVAN
                        Many citizens of London are 
                        bilingual. 

                                 STEELE
                        I gave you money. I want him back. 

                                 IVAN
                        Do you? Or would you rather have 
                        the tape? 

                                 STEELE
                        He better not be harmed.

           Steele exits.
           INT. BURROWS’S HOME, NIGHT

           Elegant, arguably pretentious decor that radiates status. 
           Steele, dampened from the rain, sits across from Burrows, 
           who’s wearing a monogrammed robe. They’re circled by a poodle 
           and a cat, engaged in a kind of hunt for one another.

                                 STEELE
                        My concept was to put the money in 
                        Source A’s hands, hoping that would 
                        compel him to take my bribe for the 
                        tape. 

                                 BURROWS
                        Absent that?

                                 STEELE
                        He’d pass the money on to Source C, 
                        in exchange to meet with me again. 
                        I left it up to him.

                                 BURROWS
                        You thought Source C could also 
                        provide the tape? 

                                 STEELE
                        I wasn’t sure. Either way, I 
                        believed he could give me 
                        additional information that I could 
                        use to apply pressure on Source A 
                        to ultimately give up the tape.

                                 BURROWS
                        That was a heavy gamble.

                                 STEELE
                        You said I’d make the proper 
                        choice.

           Steele isn’t himself. He’s weary, lacking confidence.

                                 BURROWS
                        What do you suspect happened to 
                        Source C? 

                                 STEELE
                        My fear is a repeat of the 
                        Litvinenko disaster. 

                                 BURROWS
                        In which case we’d be out the 
                        money. And the tape.
                                 STEELE
                        Another life would be lost.

                                 BURROWS
                        Yes, that too. Would we be in the 
                        red on the contract? 

           Steele nods.

                                 BURROWS
                        I’d say drum something up, whatever 
                        that might be. Ask Glenn for more 
                        money. We’ve had a fantastic year 
                        otherwise. We can stomach a hit. 

           The cat finally catches the poodle. There’s a ruckus.

                                 BURROWS
                        Stop!

           They separate. 

                                 BURROWS
                        They’re not used to being up this 
                        late. I really must get to bed.

           He stands up. So does Steele.

           EXT. THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, NIGHT

           Simpson is walking. He’s seen the memorial a thousand times, 
           but he still gazes up at it as he goes. 

           He gets a call, stops. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Jesus, how late is it there? 

           INTERCUT: STEELE

           At home, sitting on the edge of his bed. The only 
           illumination is the moonlight coming in through the windows. 

                                 STEELE
                        Late enough to not be sure if it’s 
                        the night or the morning. Can you 
                        talk? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’ve been drinking. The polls are 
                        narrowing. This piece of shit is 
                        almost in the lead.
                                 STEELE
                        I’ll make it brief. We need to 
                        raise our rate.

           Simpson bursts with excitement.

                                 SIMPSON
                        You have the tape...

                                 STEELE
                        Not exactly, we-

                                 SIMPSON
                        Chris. 

                                 STEELE
                        Glenn, I’m trying-

                                 SIMPSON
                        You seriously called to ask for a 
                        raise at the same time you’re 
                        telling me that you failed. Do you 
                        want to get fired? 

                                 STEELE
                        I’m in a predicament.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Is that right? You know who else is 
                        in a predicament? Hillary fucking 
                        Clinton. The Democratic Party. 
                        Muslim Americans. Gays. Immigrants. 
                        Should I go on? 

           There’s a long pause.

                                 STEELE
                        Source C may be in danger. I need 
                        to tighten the screws on Source A.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’m not going to tell you how to do 
                        your job. 

                                 STEELE
                        What has the client done with our 
                        reports? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Not enough, as far as I’m 
                        concerned.

                                 STEELE
                        I have contacts at the FBI.
                                 SIMPSON
                        The client won’t want that.

                                 STEELE
                        Do we care? 

           It almost surprises Steele to hear himself say this.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’m looking up at the Lincoln 
                        Memorial right now because the Uber 
                        I called couldn’t figure out how to 
                        get to a pin. It’s glorious, 
                        really. But when I look at 
                        Lincoln’s face all I can think 
                        about is that goddamn remake of 
                        Planet Of the Apes.

                                 STEELE
                        Can you forget I asked about the 
                        raise? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 STEELE
                        Get home safe, Glenn. 

           They hang up. 

           INT. ORBIS, MORNING

           The RECEPTIONIST straightens her desk then begins making 
           coffee. Steele walks in, the only other person in the office. 
           She’s surprised to see him.

                                 ORBIS RECEPTIONIST
                        You’re here early, Mr. Steele.

                                 STEELE
                        Could you bring me some coffee once 
                        it’s ready, please? 

           INT. STEELE'S OFFICE, MOMENTS LATER

           Steele works at his desk, copying and pasting all of his 
           memos on the Russia-Trump Campaign conspiracy into a single 
           document. 

           The Receptionist drops off his coffee. He thanks her and 
           sips, holding the mug to his lips. Then he watches the clock.
           LATER

           The time turns to noon. Steele picks up his phone and dials.

           EXT. FBI NORTHERN VIRGINIA RESIDENCE AGENCY, MORNING

           To re-establish. We hear the sound of a phone ringing as the 
           camera tracks closer and closer. 

           INT. FBI OFFICE, DAY

           Now we’re looking at the phone that’s ringing. It’s sitting 
           on a desk. Something about the setup looks familiar. The 
           camera pulls back... is that a photo of Rudy Giuliani on the 
           desk? Then a hand picks up the receiver, and the camera 
           continues to retreat, showing the face of the man who’s 
           answering the call. 

           Hawkins’s Superior. For the sake of this conversation, let’s 
           call him “Henry Rouse.”

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Rouse. 

           INTERCUT: STEELE

           At his desk, on the other end of the line. 

                                 STEELE
                        Henry, it’s Chris Steele.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Chris! You’re calling me early.

                                 STEELE
                        I remembered how hard you worked.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        How long’s it been? When was FIFA? 

                                 STEELE
                        Almost a year and a half now.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        I’m sure you look the same. You 
                        always looked great. I remember 
                        seeing how they flocked to you. 

                                 STEELE
                        There’s something rather serious 
                        that we should discuss.

                        Something grave, in fact. I want to 
                        send you a dossier...

           INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           A team of agents fills a small room. SA Hawkins is included. 
           They have printed out copies of Steele’s memos aka the 
           dossier. This is not a happy time. 

           Hawkins’s Superior walks into the room, closes the door. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        I trust you’ve all had time to 
                        review the dossier.

           Sounds of acknowledgment. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        John, what do you think? 

           FBI AGENT JOHN, 50s, strong, serious, responds. 

                                 FBI AGENT JOHN
                        Frankly, I’m shocked. 

           FBI AGENT RACHEL, 40s, brash, intimidating, weighs in.

                                 FBI AGENT RACHEL
                        Add horrified.

           Hawkins interjects. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I don’t know if this is all true, 
                        but if it were, would anyone be 
                        surprised? 

           A beat. This sinks in. They wouldn’t. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        I’ll tell Chris to keep sending the 
                        memos, if there’s more. 

                                 FBI AGENT JOHN
                        How should we proceed in the 
                        meantime, sir? 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Obviously, we’re buried working 
                        with State on the emails Hillary 
                        failed to turn over. How many are 
                        there? 
                                 FBI AGENT RACHEL
                        Over 15,000. Some portion are 
                        personal. Some will be duplicates.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Prioritize getting those processed 
                        before the election. But keep your 
                        eyes open, ears to the ground. 

           He adjourns the meeting. 

           INT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS, DAY

           Staffers move and chatter at a breakneck pace. Election day 
           is right around the corner. 

           SUPER: “October 7, 2016: 32 Days Until the Election” 

           Podesta’s Assistant chases down Sara Latham, his Chief Of 
           Staff. We met both of them before, when they dealt with the 
           phishing attack on their boss’s email.

                                 PODESTA’S ASSISTANT
                        The Post has a tape.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE

           A bus arrives outside the set of Days Of Our Lives. Neither 
           Trump nor Access Hollywood host BILLY BUSH can be seen, but 
           there’s audio. This is from an actual transcript.

           Clip one: 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        I moved on her actually. You know 
                        she was down on Palm Beach. I moved 
                        on her, and I failed. I’ll admit 
                        it.

           Audible sounds of pleasant surprise. Laughs.

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        I did try and fuck her. She was 
                        married. 

                                 BUSH (V.O.)
                        That’s huge news there!
           Clip two:

           The bus has parked. We’re looking at the door. The crew has 
           gotten off, but we still can’t see Bush and Trump. We hear 
           someone opening a case of mints.

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        I better use some Tic Tacs just in 
                        case I start kissing her. You know 
                        I’m automatically attracted to 
                        beautiful- I just start kissing 
                        them. It’s like a magnet. 

           Bush laughs uncontrollably. The camera has turned to show the 
           side of the bus, a canted angle. 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And 
                        when you’re a star they let you do 
                        it. You can do anything.

                                 BUSH (V.O.)
                        Whatever you want. 

                                 TRUMP (V.O.)
                        Grab ‘em by the pussy. You can do 
                        anything.

           Clip three:

           Trump and Bush get off the bus and greet ARIANNE ZUCKER, the 
           woman in the purple dress referenced earlier. 

                                 BUSH
                        How about a little hug for the 
                        Donald? He just got off the bus.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Would you like a little hug, 
                        darling? 

           They embrace.

                                 TRUMP
                        Absolutely. Melania said this was 
                        okay. 

           INT. CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS, DAY

           A group of female staffers, including Latham and Podesta’s 
           Chief Of Staff, finish watching the tape. A mixture of anger, 
           disgust, sadness, fear; the behavior causing them to relive 
           so many awful past experiences.
           INT. DARK ROOM, NIGHT

           We’ve been here before. This time someone is listening to 
           music, “We Don’t Talk Anymore” by Charlie Puth with Selena 
           Gomez. We see fingers working a trackpad, using Photoshop to 
           edit an image of JOHN PODESTA, buzzed gray hair, late 60s, 
           glasses. His mouth is open, eyes clenched, as if caught in 
           the middle of an argument. To his left, an American flag.

           SUPER: “That Same Day” 

           The graphic is given sepia tones. Text is added: “The Podesta 
           Emails”. The user drags and drops it into a webpage that’s 
           all set to go, just needs to be published. 

           They click post. The finished product goes live --

           https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails

           A passage reads in part: 

           “WikiLeaks series on deals involving Hillary Clinton campaign 
           Chairman John Podesta. Mr Podesta is a long-term associate of 
           the Clintons and was President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff 
           from 1998 until 2001.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MONTAGE OF EMAILS

           Showing that Donna Brazile, CNN contributor/former Vice-Chair 
           of the DNC, leaked debate questions to the campaign; a 
           strangely innocuous message about Democratic Party supporter 
           and fundraiser James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, a 
           pizza restaurant in Washington; and several emails from 
           Clinton’s own staff and supporters, questioning her tactics, 
           including Podesta himself referring to “terrible decisions 
           made pre-campaign”. 

           One from Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American 
           Progress, takes center stage. In it, she writes: 

           “Hillary. God. Her instincts are suboptimal.”

           Out of this, we burst into --

           THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS 

           It’s now an absolute mess, not only because of the leaks but 
           because this has been an insane day, and the election was 
           already so close. 
           Latham races through the office, all the way to the help 
           desk, where she seeks out --

           Charles Delavan, the Clinton Campaign tech who responded to 
           the phishing attack on Podesta’s email. He’s already white-
           faced, this is only going to make it worse.

                                 LATHAM
                        Charles!

                                 DELAVAN
                        Sara, how did this-

                                 LATHAM
                        You said it was ‘legitimate’!

           She has the email prepped on her phone, shows it to him. He’s 
           reminded that he wrote: “This is a legitimate email. John 
           needs to change his password immediately”. 

                                 DELAVAN
                        ‘Legitimate.’ I meant to write 
                        ‘illegitimate.’ It was a typo.

           He wipes his hand over his eyes, nose, and mouth. 

                                 LATHAM
                        You fucked us.

                                 DELAVAN
                        But I put the right link to change 
                        his password in the message. Did 
                        you click the link in the phishing 
                        attack? You had to. Otherwise they 
                        never could’ve gotten access.

                                 LATHAM
                        I don’t remember.

           She doesn’t. But they both know. 

           INT. FUSION GPS, DAY

           An email hits the inbox of Simpson’s desktop computer. He 
           opens it then uses his cell to make a call on speaker. 

           INTERCUT: DAVID

           At home, in bed. Legs entangled with those of another, older 
           man, whose face we’ll never see.

                        Big day today. I have other news a 
                        couple hours early, thought you’d 
                        like to hear.

                                 DAVID
                        Probably not. But okay.

           Yes, the Access Hollywood tape, the Podesta dump, and this 
           statement all happened on the same day.

                        brain. They believe Russia’s 
                        ‘senior-most officials’ authorized 
                        the hacks, with the express purpose 
                        of interfering in our election. 

                                 DAVID
                        So, like, do you want a cookie? 
                        You’re already getting paid. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        May be time to get confident enough 
                        with what we’re giving you to 
                        actually do something with the 
                        research.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s being used as background. And, 
                        not my call. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Then whose is it? Let me talk to 
                        them. 
                                 DAVID
                        Oof. Pleading is so gross. Did you 
                        see the Access Hollywood video? 
                        We’re going to win. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’ve been around too long. 

                                 DAVID
                        Look, I’m sad too that I’ll never 
                        get to see this golden showers 
                        tape, but life goes on. I guess.

                                 SIMPSON
                        We haven’t given up. 

                                 DAVID
                        No, you should.    
                             (beat)
                        I think we’ve done enough.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Do you truly believe that? 

                                 DAVID
                        Fun doing business with you, Glenn. 
                        Next time you’re in LA, text me. 

           He hangs up. 

           INT. STEELE'S HOME, NIGHT

           Steele cleans his cats’ litter boxes with Burrows on 
           speakerphone. 

                                 BURROWS (V.O.)
                        I had a phone call from Glenn. He 
                        said he emailed you. 

                                 STEELE
                        I haven’t checked.

                                 BURROWS (V.O.)
                        The client is no longer inclined to 
                        contract us. They think the race is 
                        over. 

                                 STEELE
                        How does Glenn feel? 

                                 BURROWS (V.O.)
                        Grumpy. Skeptical. Cynical about 
                        Hillary’s momentum. 
                                 STEELE
                        Sounds like him. 

                                 BURROWS (V.O.)
                        At any rate, I wish we’d avoided a 
                        loss, but I suppose we did our 
                        part.

           LATER

           Steele looks at his email on his phone before going to bed. 
           He reads the message from Simpson. One piece stands out: 

           “I’m not satisfied we did everything we could.”

           MORNING

           Steele wakes up, checks his phone. Something intrigues him.

           EXT. THE RITZ LONDON, MORNING

           Steele crosses the street to the hotel. 

           INT. THE RITZ LONDON, DAY

           He approaches the concierge desk. Kate is working.

                                 STEELE
                        I’m sorry to bother you. I lost my 
                        key. I wasn’t certain. Should I ask 
                        the front desk...

                                 KATE
                        I can help with that.

           She types on her computer, probably for show, and then passes 
           him a key card. 

                                 STEELE
                        I’m trying to remember. I’m in 506, 
                        aren’t I?

                                 KATE

           He goes.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM, DAY

           Steele watches BBC News. 

           The door to the room opens. Kate walks in. 

                                 KATE
                        I have information. 

                                 STEELE
                        I can’t pay you.

                                 KATE
                        At no cost. 

                                 STEELE
                        What’s gotten into you? 

           She sits on the bed. BBC News is playing Trump’s statement on 
           the Access Hollywood tape. 

                                 KATE
                        Shut this bloody thing off.

           Steele kills it with the remote then sits on the bed next to 
           her, puts a hand on her thigh. 

                                 KATE
                        Don’t touch me.

                                 STEELE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 KATE
                        Sometime during the first week of 
                        September, there was a meeting in 
                        Prague at the offices of a Russian 
                        NGO, Rossotrudnichestvo.

                                 STEELE
                        Between whom? 

                                 KATE
                        Donald’s private attorney, Michael 
                        Cohen and officials from the 
                        Kremlin. Plus, Konstantin Kosachev. 
                        Do you know him? 

                                 STEELE
                        Yes. From Duma. He’s the Head of 
                        the Foreign Relations Committee. 
                        But I haven’t heard Cohen’s name 
                        mentioned before.
                                 KATE
                        Has a Russian wife. He took over 
                        the operation from Manafort. In 
                        fact, that’s what the meeting was 
                        about. To clean up the rubble and 
                        find a way to move forward without 
                        being exposed.

                                 STEELE
                        I’m listening...

           EXT. HIGH RISE LONDON APARTMENT BUILDING, NIGHT

           A car drops Ivan off with a Russian woman who could be a 
           model. She’s taller than him. He’s handsy with her. He opens 
           the door --  

           Steele comes into frame. 

                                 IVAN
                             (in Russian, to the woman)
                        Go upstairs. 

           Although agitated, she listens, enters the building. 

           Ivan keeps his distance from Steele.

                                 STEELE
                        I hear your government is preparing 
                        for him to lose.

                                 IVAN
                        You should take a vacation.

                                 STEELE
                        I’m short on funds at the moment. I 
                        made an investment that hasn’t 
                        delivered.

                                 IVAN
                        Be patient.

                                 STEELE
                        When? 

                                 IVAN
                        There’s infighting. We’re in damage 
                        control. 

                                 STEELE
                        What does that mean? 
                                 IVAN
                        You’ve won. A woman will be 
                        president.

           He enters the building.

           INT. STEELE'S HOME, NIGHT

           Steele works from his sofa, typing on a laptop.

           LATER

           He makes a call. 

           INTERCUT: SIMPSON

           At the Fusion offices. He picks up. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        You know you can’t bill me for this 
                        call. 

                                 STEELE
                        I know. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        What do you want? Stock tips? 

                                 STEELE
                        I’m sending you and the FBI a new 
                        memo.

           INT. FBI OFFICE, DAY

           Hawkins’s Superior receives an email at his computer from 
           Chris Steele. He opens it. Then forwards the email without 
           reading the memo. 

           INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

           Hawkins, Rachel, John, and the other agents who previously 
           gathered here are back together, reading the latest memo for 
           the first time. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Hit me with the highlights.

           Hawkins starts. These are excerpts from the actual dossier:
                                 HAWKINS
                        ‘Agenda included how to process 
                        deniable cash payments to 
                        operatives; contingency plans for 
                        covering up operations; and action 
                        in the event of a Clinton election 
                        victory.’

                                 FBI AGENT JOHN
                        ‘The overall objective had been to, 
                        quote, sweep it all under the 
                        carpet and make sure no connections 
                        between Trump and Russia could be 
                        fully established or proven.’

                                 FBI AGENT RACHEL
                        And they felt suited to give this 
                        mission to the prick from the ‘says 
                        who?’ video that went viral.

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        Allegedly. 

           He goes to the door. 

                                 HAWKINS’S SUPERIOR
                        All we can do is investigate.

           EXT. THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE, NIGHT

           The middle of the night. Diplomat Popov rushes out, stuffing 
           clothes into a duffel bag. He sets the bag down and gets in 
           as the driver puts it in the trunk. 

           INT. BLACK SEDAN, NIGHT

           Popov is in the back. The driver takes the wheel. 

                                 POPOV
                             (in Russian)
                        They order me home in the middle of 
                        the night, like we have some chance 
                        of being caught. I scoff at this. 
                        Drive slow. I might never see these 
                        sites again. 

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS, NIGHT

           The third and final Presidential debate. As seen on TV. 
           Clinton is in a white pantsuit that makes her look like a 
           combination of an angel and a soldier. 
           Trump is in a dark suit and red tie. Their hair colors are 
           complementary. CHRIS WALLACE is the moderator. The mood is 
           nasty. 

           SUPER: “October 20, 2016: 19 Days Until the Election” 

           This is from the actual debate: 

                                 WALLACE
                        Secretary Clinton, I want to clear 
                        up your position on this issue 
                        because in a speech you gave to a 
                        Brazilian bank for which you were 
                        paid $225,000, we've learned from 
                        WikiLeaks, that you said this. And 
                        I want to quote. ‘My dream is a 
                        hemispheric common market with open 
                        trade and open borders.’

                                 CLINTON
                        If you went on to read the rest of 
                        the sentence, I was talking about 
                        energy. But you are very clearly 
                        quoting from WikiLeaks. What is 
                        really important about WikiLeaks is 
                        that the Russian government has 
                        engaged in espionage against 
                        Americans. So I actually think the 
                        most important question of this 
                        evening, Chris, is finally, will 
                        Donald Trump admit and condemn that 
                        the Russians are doing this, and 
                        make it clear that he will not have 
                        the help of Putin in this election. 

           Wild noise from the crowd.

                                 TRUMP
                        That was a great pivot off the fact 
                        that she wants open borders. Okay? 
                        How did we get on to Putin?

                                 WALLACE
                        Hold on, folks. Because this is 
                        going to end up getting out of 
                        control. Let's try to keep it 
                        quiet. For the candidates and for 
                        the American people.

                                 TRUMP
                        I don't know Putin. He said nice 
                        things about me. If we got along 
                        well, that would be good.

                        If Russia and the United States got 
                        along well and went after ISIS, 
                        that would be good. He has no 
                        respect for her. He has no respect 
                        for our president. 

                                 CLINTON
                        Wait.

                                 TRUMP
                        Putin from everything I see has no 
                        respect for this person.

                                 CLINTON
                        Well, that's because he would 
                        rather have a puppet as president 
                        of the United States.

                                 TRUMP
                        No puppet. You're the puppet.

           INT. BAR, NIGHT

           Simpson, Kimmy, and Frank watch the debate with a raucous 
           crowd of Clinton supporters. People cheer Hillary’s every 
           point, but Simpson is disinclined. 

                                 KIMMY
                        She’s killing him. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh yeah. Big time.  

                                 KIMMY
                             (turns to Simpson)
                        Right? 

           His arms are crossed. His jaw is clenched. He looks mean. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        He speaks to the gut. She goes for 
                        the head. You know how people vote.

           Kimmy and Frank turn their attention back to the TVs, their 
           moods totally dampened.

           EXT. FBI NORTHERN VIRGINIA RESIDENCE AGENCY, NIGHT

           An establishing shot. The first time we’ve seen the building 
           at night. Hawkins, looking unsettled, leaves work late.

           SUPER: “October 28, 2016: 11 Days Until the Election” 
           We hear the voice of FBI Director Comey. This is taken from 
           his actual statement: 

                                 COMEY (V.O.)
                        Dear Messrs Chairmen: In previous 
                        congressional testimony, I referred 
                        to the fact that the FBI had 
                        completed its investigation of 
                        former Secretary Clinton's personal 
                        email server. Due to recent 
                        developments, I am writing to 
                        supplement my previous testimony.

           EXT. TRUMP TOWER, NIGHT

           New York City. At Columbus Circle. A low angle view that 
           captures the statue of Christopher Columbus and Trump’s 
           flagship property.

                                 COMEY (V.O.)
                        In connection with an unrelated 
                        case, the FBI has learned of the 
                        existence of emails that appear to 
                        be pertinent to the investigation. 

           INT. STEELE’S HOME, NIGHT

           Steele appears rattled. We’re seeing his reaction to the 
           Comey letter.

                                 COMEY (V.O.)
                        Although the FBI cannot yet assess 
                        whether or not this material may be 
                        significant, I believe it is 
                        important to update your Committees 
                        about our efforts in light of my 
                        previous testimony.
                        Sincerely yours, James B. Comey, 
                        Director.

           INT. FUSION GPS, DAY

           Simpson hurls a full cup of coffee across his office. The 
           liquid sprays, the mug shatters. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Fuck!

           Kimmy pops her head in the door. 
                                 KIMMY
                        Is everything okay? 

           He just stares at her. 

                                 KIMMY
                        I’ll get you some paper towels.

           He goes to pick up the pieces of the mug when his phone 
           rings. 

           INTERCUT: STEELE

           At home, in the middle of getting ready to go out, putting on 
           a suit. But he keeps going back and forth to the closet, 
           unable to decide on a shirt or a tie.

                                 STEELE
                        Have you seen this shite?

                                 SIMPSON
                        What the fuck is he doing? What are 
                        his agents doing? 

                                 STEELE
                        I’ve spoken with several of them. 
                        Besides sending the memos. There’s 
                        an intelligence briefing scheduled 
                        this weekend.

                                 SIMPSON
                        In Congress? 

                                 STEELE
                        For the gang of eight. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        It won’t be made public. 

                                 STEELE
                        I know. This letter throws 
                        everything into disarray. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Let me think of something... would 
                        you come to New York? 

                                 STEELE
                        Sure. Yes.

                                 SIMPSON
                        I might know someone. 

           Simpson hangs up. 
           Steele gives up on trying to pick a shirt and tie, bails on 
           the whole endeavor, decides to stay in for the night. 

           EXT. BROWNSTONE, DAY

           In Brooklyn. A MEXICAN WOMAN -- hair just done, whip smart, 
           you can tell she’s fuming mad -- rings the bell. Charles 
           Delavan, the Clinton Campaign help desk tech, answers. 

                                 MEXICAN WOMAN
                        Are you Charles Delavan? 

                                 DELAVAN
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 MEXICAN WOMAN
                        I read your email to Podesta 
                        online. How could you not tell he 
                        was being phished?!

                                 DELAVAN
                        No, I mistyped-

                                 MEXICAN WOMAN
                        You are going to make us lose the 
                        election.

           She storms away. All Delavan can do is stare into the street, 
           stone-faced, contemplating a nightmare that will haunt him 
           for the rest of his life. 

           INT. JFK, MORNING

           Steele walks through the concourse towards baggage claim. A 
           reminder of when he walked through Dulles, listening to 
           classical music, eating candy. Not this time. Now he listens 
           to a goddamn political podcast in his headphones and bites 
           his nails.

           INT. HOTEL LOUNGE, DAY

           Steele has coffee with the Washington editor of Mother Jones, 
           DAVID CORN, 57, nearly white hair, gregarious, liberal AF.

                                 CORN
                        I wasn’t expecting to have this 
                        rush of feeling, but I did. It’s 
                        very stirring, compelling work. 

                                 STEELE
                        Unfortunately, I’d say. 
                                 CORN
                        Why? 

                                 STEELE
                        Given the situation, and the 
                        candidate, I’d prefer something 
                        docile. Worthy of a beach read.

                                 CORN
                        I believed every word. 

                                 STEELE
                        I didn’t come here seeking your 
                        approval.

                                 CORN
                        I’m getting to my point. The weight 
                        and... the obligation that comes 
                        with my calling, this civic duty of 
                        being a journalist, necessitates 
                        that I hold to a specific code 
                        before I write anything. I’d need 
                        to confirm these reports with 
                        multiple sources. And they can’t 
                        just be people you point me to. I 
                        need to work the story, you see. 
                        That takes time. 

                                 STEELE
                        How long? 

                                 CORN
                        Weeks, months, years. Who can say? 
                        I’m playing a different game than 
                        Glenn.

                                 STEELE
                        Perhaps there’s a reason he left 
                        it.

                                 CORN
                        Yes. Money.

                                 STEELE
                        What if you redacted names and 
                        leaked the actual dossier online?

           Walking on the streets of Manhattan. He has a notepad in one

                        I spoke to someone in the

                        ‘He is a credible source who has 
                        provided information to the US 
                        government for a long time, which 
                        senior officials have found to be 
                        highly credible.’

                                 SIMPSON
                        I wouldn’t have used credible twice 
                        in a single sentence.

           INT. PLANE, NIGHT

           Steele reads on an iPad, connected to the in-flight wifi. An 
           article, published at 6:52pm on Halloween night, is up on 
           Mother Jones:

           “A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a 
           Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump” 

           With the subhead: “Has the bureau investigated this 
           material?”

           It’s a longish article. Steele gets into it, pleasantly 
           surprised by the depth...
           INT. FUSION GPS, NIGHT

           Simpson, Frank, and Kimmy are in Halloween costumes, watching 
           TV in the conference room. Steele has the remote. He’s 
           flipping back and forth between cable news networks. 

           No one’s talking about the Mother Jones story. The face of 
           ANTHONY WIENER is on every channel. 

                                 KIMMY
                        The emails were on his computer?

                                 FRANK
                        It must be on MSNBC at least.

           It’s not.

                        This sleazebag on every fucking 
                        channel.

           Simpson increases the rate he’s changing the channels, 
           virtually turning the TV screen into a collage before 
           shutting it off altogether.

           A plane lands.

           Steele’s Mercedes pulls up to the gate. He slows. A red 
           balloon, filled with helium, has been tied to the mailbox.

           He gets out. 

           There’s a little square of paper inside the balloon. The word 
           “Tames” [sic] has been written on it.

           In bed, groggy. The phone ringing woke him up. But true to 
           form, he still has the wherewithal to be on top of it. Also, 
           cantankerous.

                        be surprised- they’d rather gossip 
                        about sexting all day. What the 
                        hell time is it? 

                                 STEELE
                        Glenn, hold on. Source A wants to 
                        meet.

           Simpson sits up in bed. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        What do you think? 

                                 STEELE
                        It must be the tape. Or something 
                        from the source on Page and 
                        Rosneft, Source C.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Call me as soon as you know.

           EXT. THE RIVER THAMES, NIGHT

           Steele returns to the spot on the river bed where he 
           previously met with Ivan.

           A woman appears. She pads along the dirt. Comes to Steele and 
           hands him a familiar envelope before continuing on.

           Steele examines the envelope. It’s the same one he gave to 
           Ivan, at this same location, with the bribe inside.

           He opens it. 

           It’s his money, not the tape. They gave it back. 

           He calls out to the woman --

                                 STEELE
                        Where’s Oleg? What did you do to 
                        him? 

           But she’s gone, disappeared into the darkness. 

           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           Steele walks into Burrow’s office with the envelope, sets it 
           on his desk. Burrows peaks inside. 
                                 BURROWS
                        Is this the money? 

                                 STEELE
                        They returned it.

           Burrows smiles.

                                 BURROWS
                        We’re in the black! 
                             (beat)
                        You don’t look pleased.

                                 STEELE
                        It’s Source C. I’d assured myself 
                        Litvinenko was the last one. There 
                        couldn’t be any more ghosts. 

                                 BURROWS
                        The world doesn’t always work how 
                        it should, Chris.

                                 STEELE
                        I’d tried to forget. 

           INT. FUSION GPS, DAY

           Simpson’s phone vibrates on his desk. A text message from 
           Steele:

           “It was unrelated” 

           We stay with Simpson, as dour resignation overtakes him, and 
           then we

                                                                CUT TO:

           ABC NEWS ELECTION NIGHT COVERAGE

           A stage is set up at Times Square. A crowd is gathered in 
           front. Video boards line the background. Still images of 
           Clinton and Trump. A “Your Voice, Your Vote 2016” graphic in 
           the left corner of the screen. A symphonic, hard charging 
           version of the program’s theme song plays. 

           Then we’re inside a studio with a multicultural cast of 
           anchors, seated on a dais in living room furniture. AMNA 
           NAWAZ speaks. This is an actual transcript: 

                                 NAWAZ
                        Hey everybody, it’s Tuesday 
                        November the 8th, 2016.

                        Election day turns into election 
                        night. What’s up America? Let’s 
                        pick a president y’all? 

           NBC NEWS ELECTION COVERAGE

           LESTER HOLT stands across from CHUCK TODD, in front of a 
           video board showing the electoral map. Todd points at 
           Florida. This is from an actual transcript: 

                                 TODD
                        This is no longer- If he sweeps 
                        those two and Ohio. And then 
                        suddenly we could be sitting on 
                        Michigan, we could be sitting on 
                        Colorado. It’s gonna be a long 
                        night. If you’re a junky it’s gonna 
                        be a fun night. We are dividing up 
                        this maps in ways that we haven’t 
                        seen. 269 269 is in play. This 
                        feels a lot like 2000, Brokaw.

           INT. REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT, NIGHT

           Simpson treads through the concourse, passing men, women, and 
           children of all different ages and ethnicities. He stays 
           glued to his phone until he reaches an open area with 
           restaurants and a wall-sized TV screen. People standing and 
           watching everywhere. A dead, zombie-like feeling. 

           Wisconsin has just gone to Trump. 

           Simpson knew it was possible, but he still can’t believe it. 
           An eerie silence takes over the concourse. Only the noise 
           coming from the TV... Until a tall TRUMP SUPPORTER in his 
           late 20s -- white, messy hair, a backpack -- can’t hold it in 
           any longer. 

                                 TRUMP SUPPORTER
                        What is wrong with everyone?! We. 
                        Are. Witnessing. History!

           He bounds through the concourse. Simpson rocks back and 
           forth, fist over his mouth. 

           INT. BALLROOM, NIGHT

           A Republican victory party. Everyone in suits and dresses. 
           Trump/Pence signs dominate the frame. A crush of pure joy and 
           excitement.   
           In the crowd, we find Denise, in her wheelchair, next to the 
           Thin Man. She’s deeply reserved. He’s stoic as always. 

                                 DENISE
                        Who did you put in touch with 
                        Glenn? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        David.

                                 DENISE
                        Which David? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Not the one you’re thinking of.

                                 DENISE
                        You gave him a terrier not a pit 
                        bull. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        They’re liberals. Aren’t they all 
                        one breed? 

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE, MORNING

           It’s raining. 

           SUPER: “November 9, 2016: Donald Trump Is President-elect”

           INT. NORTH CAROLINA HOME, MORNING

           MADDISON WELCH, 28, with shaggy brown hair and a thick beard, 
           wearing construction boots in the house, investigates a 
           thread on reddit about the Podesta emails. Specifically, 
           “PizzaGate,” a conspiracy theory involving Comet Ping Pong 
           Pizza being the headquarters of a child sex slave operation.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Welch walks into the living room, where his wife is playing 
           with two small daughters. He kisses the girls on the head.

                                 WELCH
                        I got some things to do. 

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA HOME, MORNING

           Welch puts an assault rifle and a shotgun in his pickup 
           truck. There’s a pistol already on him. 
           EXT. HIGHWAY, DAY

           Welch drives from North Carolina to Washington DC. 

           EXT. COMET PING PONG PIZZA, DAY

           A green building, part of a row of shops on a quaint street. 
           An in your face sign above the door says “COMET”. 

           Welch walks in with an assault rifle.  

           INT. COMET PING PONG PIZZA, DAY

           High ceilings. Picnic table style seating. Reclaimed wood. 
           Ping pong tables. It’s packed with families. 

           Welch enters, eyes probing, stalking ahead. His presence 
           gradually becomes known. People scream then flee. 

           Welch points his rifle at an employee. The rush to get out 
           turns into a mad dash. He barges into the kitchen --

                                 WELCH
                        Where are the tunnels?! Where you 
                        hiding the children?!

           When no one will respond, he fires a shot into the floor. The 
           kitchen clears out. Welch frantically searches the space for 
           some kind of hidden compartment or trap door, but he can’t 
           find anything. 

           EXT. COMET PING PONG PIZZA, DAY

           Police surround the building, guns drawn... 

           Welch walks outside and surrenders.

           INT. STEELE’S HOME, NIGHT

           Steele sits on the sofa. The cats want to play, but he can’t 
           muster the mirth tonight. A call comes in.  

           INTERCUT: SIMPSON

           Standing on a street corner in Los Angeles across from 
           McDonald’s. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Would you rather have Trump or 
                        Theresa May? 
                                 STEELE
                        I’ll take Churchill. 

                                 SIMPSON
                        Touché. You ever been to 
                        McDonald’s, Chris? 

                                 STEELE
                        Have I ever been to McDonald’s? Of 
                        course I’ve been to McDonald’s. 
                        What do you mean? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I’m standing outside one in Los 
                        Angeles right now.

                                 STEELE
                        What are you doing there? 

                                 SIMPSON
                        I came to see about a woman. I 
                        don’t think it’s going to work out. 

                                 STEELE
                        At least you made the effort. 
                        Things tend to work out for the 
                        best.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Come on. You don’t really believe 
                        that.

                                 STEELE
                        I used to.

                                 SIMPSON
                        They’re flying a flag outside this 
                        McDonald’s, all the way up on a 
                        flagpole. But it’s not the stars 
                        and stripes. It’s the golden 
                        arches.

                                 STEELE
                        I’ve never noticed that.

                                 SIMPSON
                        The golden arches. Can you believe 
                        it? Maybe that’s all that’ll be 
                        left in the end. 

                                 STEELE
                        The tape wouldn’t have made a 
                        difference. 
                                 SIMPSON
                        No. No matter what we did. He was 
                        right. He could’ve shot somebody on 
                        Fifth Avenue, and all the forces 
                        would’ve aligned in his favor.

                                 STEELE
                        For all we know, he did.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Good luck with Brexit.

                                 STEELE
                        Sure.

           They hang up. 

           EXT. MOSCOW, DAY

           A Lexus is parked on the street. Someone is slumped in the 
           back. We move inside the vehicle. 

           It’s Oleg, the Storyteller from the British Library. 

           He’s dead.

           INT. ORBIS, DAY

           Steele sits at his desk. An article from the Telegraph is up 
           on his computer. He reads:

           “Oleg Erovinkin, a former general in the KGB and its 
           successor the FSB, was found dead in the back of his car in 
           Moscow on Boxing Day in mysterious circumstances.

           “Erovinkin was a key aide to Igor Sechin, a former deputy 
           prime minister and now head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil 
           company.” 

                                 STEELE
                        Oleg... that’s why he gave me his 
                        name.

           A knock at the door, which was already open. It’s Burrows.

                                 BURROWS
                        We have a problem.

           INT. FUSION GPS, DAY

           Kimmy walks in to Simpson’s office. 
                                 KIMMY
                        Buzzfeed published the dossier.

           She sets an iPad on his desk. He looks it over.

                                 SIMPSON
                        Shit. It’s only a matter of time 
                        until somebody prints his name.

           INT. STEELE’S HOME, DAY

           Harried, Steele packs a suitcase.

           EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, DAY

           Flags hang from every precipice. People line the steps and 
           the balconies. Orchestral music plays. 

           The stage is set for the inauguration of President Trump. 

           EXT. STEELE’S HOME, DAY

           Steele rushes across the front yard and outside the gate, 
           towards his neighbor’s house. 

           EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, DAY

           Trumpets play. Drummers drum. A deep voiced ANNOUNCER 
           declares: 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the President-
                        elect of the United States, Donald 
                        John Trump. 

           Trump walks through an open hallway, stops to give a thumbs 
           up, then emerges onto the balcony to subdued cheers. He 
           raises a fist.

           EXT. STEELE’S NEIGHBOR’S HOME, DAY

           Steele rings the doorbell. An older man answers the door. 
           Just by looking at Steele’s face he can tell something is

                        Hi, Harold. Would you mind looking 
                        after my cats? I hope just for a 
                        few days.
           EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, DAY

           Trump walks down the balcony on a red and blue carpet, kisses 
           his wife on the cheek then does the same to MICHELLE OBAMA 
           before shaking hands with BARACK OBAMA and JOE BIDEN. 

           EXT. STEELE’S HOME, DAY

           Steele speeds away in his Mercedes.

           EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, DAY

           The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the United States Marine Band 
           perform “America the Beautiful”. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE, NIGHT

           Steele enters what amounts to a one-room home. Nondescript, 
           old furniture, dark. He sets down his suitcase but doesn’t 
           know where to go. 

           EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, DAY

           At the podium, Senator ROY BLUNT announces:

                        Ladies and gentlemen, it’s an honor

                        Jr., who will administer the 
                        Presidential Oath Of Office. 
                        Everyone please stand. 

           Trump and his family migrate from their seats to the edge of 
           the balcony. Melania is holding the Bible. JUSTICE ROBERTS 
           stands opposite them, at least ten feet away. 

                                 JUSTICE ROBERTS
                        Please raise-

           Trump puts his hand on the Bible and we

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
