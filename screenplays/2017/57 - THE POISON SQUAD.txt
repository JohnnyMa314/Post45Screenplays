           Red. The perfect shade of red.

           A breeze rustles it. Yellow sunlight kisses its taut skin.

           This is life. And then --

           -- a hand, browned from soil and sun, reaches in, cradles the 
           tomato on the vine. Gives it a turn. 

           And SNAPS it off, placing it atop a full bushel basket.

           The FARMER carries the basket to a wooden cart, heaves it on 
           a tottering pyramid of them. Wipes a fresh layer of dirt 
           across the rear of his overalls.

           Manages a weary gesture to its DRIVER, precariously seated 
           atop the mound.

           The driver tugs the reins. And we’re off...

           A DRY CRUNCH as hooves and wheels shuffle through earth.

           The driver runs a hand across his push broom mustache, 
           producing a dark mass that assuredly used to be spittle.

           He pulls a tomato from the pile under him and bites into it.

           The horse-drawn cart rattles down the dirt road.

           The wheels rumble through the ruts and bulges as it

           BA-BUMP!

           lifts onto paved road.

           The cart pulls to a stop in front of a factory. Soot curtains 
           the sky. 

           FACTORY HANDS swarm the cart.

           INT. FACTORY

           Tomatoes on an assembly line feed into a macerator...

           Their liquid innards are fed into a mixing vat...

           Catsup bottles on a conveyor belt pause under a nozzle.

           The nozzle is labeled: BORIC ACID.

           It FIRES a shot of boric acid into the bottles beneath.

           Freshly labeled bottles are packed into boxes...

           ...which are loaded into wagons. The wagons disperse down the 
           avenues of a crowded city.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Those red bottles lined perfectly on a shelf. 

           A hand reaches in and grabs a bottle, dropping it into a 
           shopping bag.

           The GROCERY CLERK turns and hands the bag to a PRIM WOMAN in 
           a blue dress.

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           The woman opens her oven and bastes the roast inside.

           She plates the roast. Opens a can of BRIGHT GREEN PEAS and 
           adds them to the dish.

           INT. DINING ROOM

           It’s the ideal family table setting. Dapper, mustachioed 
           HUSBAND sits at the table beside young SON and DAUGHTER. He 
           readies a pipe as behind, a fire crackles behind a grate.

           The woman carries in the roast and places it at the center of 
           the table. She adds a host of condiments, including the 
           bright red catsup.

           A quick unwrap of the apron and she joins her family at the 
           table. They all join hands and bow their heads as the husband 
           leads them in prayer.
                                 HUSBAND
                        Heavenly Father, we thank you for 
                        this bounty we are about to 
                        receive, with this meal and forever 
                        after.

                                 ALL AT TABLE
                        Amen.

           Almost in response, the catsup bottle EXPLODES, covering the 
           family in a shade of red. Stunned faces. And then a shard of 
           glass CLATTERS to the floor. Yes, this really used to happen.

                                 FOSTER (V.O.)
                        And what exactly prompted you to 
                        resort to human experimentation, 
                        Dr. Wiley?

           And now we get our first glimpse of our hero, HARVEY WILEY, 
           61. Beady-eyed, as if breaking down your math, and ruddy-
           cheeked, as if always in the midst of a tantrum. This is a 
           man forgotten by history, and we’ll soon know why.

                                 WILEY
                        It was less a prompt and more a 
                        hunch. You see, of all the animals, 
                        the human being is the most 
                        resilient.

                                                            FADE UP ON:

           EXT. 7TH STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING

           A bustling morning in our Nation’s capital. Horse-drawn carts 
           and trolley cars exchange right-of-way as pedestrians pack 
           the expansive sidewalks.

           At a news stand, a group of elegantly dressed GENTLEMEN 
           huddle over an outstretched copy of The Washington Post. 
           Beside, their older BIDDY WIVES prattle on, re-pinning a 
           corsage on one of their ostentatious hats.

           WHOOSH!

           Suddenly, a bicycle slices between them, its wake tugging 
           newspapers into the sky. The women frantically chase after 
           their unseated hats.

           We WHIP, trying to catch up -- 
           The bicycle angles through an interweaving mesh of unfettered 
           motion. Like muscle memory, anticipating every opening.

           We race behind as he:

           --SPLITS the gap between passing trolley cars

           --SKITCHES a ride from an apple cart, leaving a nickel, 
           snagging an apple

           --SLINGSHOTS through a narrow alleyway, bursting back onto a 
           main road, SPOOKING a passing horse.

           Finally level with the rider, we see the stormless face of 
           Harvey Wiley, now 56.

           A bright white sign for canned peas. Atop a ladder, a PAINTER 
           brushes the last touches on the slogan proclaiming ‘THE 
           GREENEST PEAS MEAN YOU LOVE HER!’

           Wiley zips beneath, clipping the base of the ladder. The 
           painter hangs on for dear life.

           EXT. RANKIN’S CANDY STORE - MORNING

           The bicycle now leans against the front of the shop.

           INT. RANKIN’S CANDY STORE

           An exasperated MOTHER, 30s, hair tight in a head scarf, rants 
           to the CHOCOLATIER.

                                 MOTHER
                        A nickel of the peppermints will 
                        do. All night and day now. The only 
                        thing keeping her insides on the 
                        inside is peppermint candy. Soft 
                        stomach like her father.

           Wiley, waiting behind, looks down to her pale YOUNG DAUGHTER 
           crouched in a cold sweat beneath the counter.

           Their eyes connect. Wiley bites his apple.

           The chocolatier hands her the bag of candy.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Never again with the spinach. Let’s 
                        go, Margaret.

           She takes Margaret’s frail hand.
           The chocolatier notices Wiley.

           A brick of chocolate CHOPPED. WRAPPED.

           EXT. AQUEDUCT BRIDGE - MORNING

           Wiley’s bicycle glides across wooden panels bridging the 
           Potomac, and onto a dirt path on the other side.

           EXT. FARMLAND - SAME

           Wiley slows as he nears a dairy farm.

           A DAIRY FARMER in overalls milks a large cow, milk splashing 
           into a pail. His BLONDE CHILD of 7 watches from behind.

           The child turns and notices Wiley. He quietly sneaks away. 

           Wiley smiles.

           The child approaches with another pail. Wiley produces an 
           empty bottle from his jacket, and the boy diligently fills it 
           with raw milk. He hands it back to Wiley.

           Wiley brings a finger to his lips. Pulls the WRAPPED 
           CHOCOLATE from his pocket and hands it over. Mimicking the 
           gesture, the boy takes the chocolate.

           Wiley pedals off.

           EXT. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           JAY GAFNEY, a coiffed, hale man in his 40s, compulsively 
           checks his watch.

           The bicycle rolls up, Wiley dismounting on the fly.

                                 GAFNEY
                        So nice of you to make time for us 
                        this morning.

                                 WILEY
                        Good breakfast takes time.

           Wiley takes an expiring bite, tossing the core to Gafney.

           INT. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           CHYRON: DECEMBER 6, 1901
           A room of consequence: timeless, ornate. An elevated mahogany 
           dais horseshoes formidably at the front.

           Seated center is the brimstone-tongued CONGRESSMAN HOLLIS 
           “HICKORY” SUMNER, 60. Beside him sits fellow Southern 
           CONGRESSMAN WALKER HAYES, 45. 

                                 SUMNER
                        Sir, you’re here on behalf of your 
                        associates in Richmond, which 
                        composes about 25% of farmland in 
                        the great state of Virginia, to 
                        petition the United States 
                        Government to pay you to farm? Am I 
                        missin’ something?

           Dwarfed by the dais, at a lonely podium, stands a farmer, 40, 
           dressed in his SUNDAY BEST.

                                 SUNDAY BEST
                        Mr. Congressman, with all due 
                        respect, we farmers out here are 
                        struggling. Even despite the record 
                        harvests the last few years, we 
                        just can’t make ends meet. All 
                        we’re asking for, is a loan against 
                        the value of our future harvest. 
                        The past five years, our gross has 
                        increased an average of--

           Sumner waves him off.

                                 SUMNER
                        No I very much got your logic. And 
                        what you’re asking me to do is 
                        grant you a loan on the value of a 
                        harvest that hasn’t happened yet. A 
                        harvest that God himself has yet to 
                        design. Well why don’t we ask God 
                        for permission for this loan?

           Sumner rises, invoking a Baptist preacher.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        O Lord, if you see fit to grant 
                        this farmer a loan based on crops 
                        you intend to bestow, then speak 
                        now, and it shall be done.

           The room sits in ironic anticipation. The farmer slinks from 
           the podium.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        Not much a man of faith, are you.
           He sits back down.

           From the gallery, a disturbance as a BRIGHT RED hat rises 
           from the crowd. Balancing atop her chair, a young curly-
           haired SUFFRAGETTE shouts over the room, a VOTES FOR WOMEN 
           sash draped around her. 

                                 SUFFRAGETTE
                        Hey Sumner, why don’t you just beat 
                        him to death! Equal rights for 
                        equal lives!

           A SECURITY GUARD lifts her off the chair and begins to carry 
           her to the door.

                                 SUFFRAGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Watch the sash, you’re crumpling 
                        it.

           Her shouts continue as she’s dragged out.

                                 SUFFRAGETTE (CONT’D)
                        We will be heard!

           Wiley watches from the gallery. He turns to Gafney.

                                 WILEY
                        What was that about?

                                 GAFNEY
                        Women want to vote.

                                 WILEY
                        No, the beating of a man to death.

           In the background, Sumner is picking another VICTIM apart.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Story goes that back when Sumner 
                        was a Junior Congressman from 
                        Georgia, he beat an abolitionist 
                        half to death with the leg of his 
                        desk.

                                 WILEY
                        Persuasive.

                                 GAFNEY
                        That’s old Hickory.

           Sumner scratches a name off the docket. Next: Wiley, Harvey.

                                 SUMNER
                        He’s back.
           Congressman Hayes leans in to confer.

                                 HAYES
                        Old Borax?

                                 SUMNER
                        Probably with more about his 
                        diseased little vegetable farm.

                                 HAYES
                        Carrots with rickets.

           The two CHUCKLE with disdain.

                                 HAYES (CONT’D)
                        So what do you want to do?

                                 SUMNER
                        Let’s run him out--
                            (then)
                        Dr. Wiley!

           Wiley steps up to the podium, unfolding his papers.

                                 WILEY
                        Good morning, Congressmen. I know 
                        this isn’t the first time I’ve come 
                        before you, with the warning that 
                        our nation is in peril. But I fear 
                        this could be my last--

                                 SUMNER
                        Yes, yes of course. Unfortunately 
                        we have a vote that has been moved 
                        to right... now, so we will have to 
                        share the pleasure of hearing your 
                        apocalyptic findings at another 
                        date. Thank you, Dr. Wiley.

           Sumner and Hayes stand and hustle out of the room.

           Wiley crumples the papers.

           Under the shade of billowing hardwoods, MONTY NORTH, 28, 
           matinee idol handsome, taps ash into the grass.

                                 MONTY
                        Well at least he addressed him by 
                        name.
                                 GAFNEY
                        Monty, I’ve been doing this a long 
                        time. I know progress when I see 
                        it. That in there, that’s not 
                        progress.

                                 MONTY
                        Look, Jay, Moses led his people 
                        through the desert for 40 years. 
                        That probably didn’t look like 
                        progress at the time either.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Harvey Wiley is no Moses.

           Monty hides a smile.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        Just talk to him. For some reason, 
                        he listens to you. We need to focus 
                        on realistic goals. Regulating at 
                        the farm level. Seeds.

                                 MONTY
                        Seeds?

           Monty gives Gafney a look. We talking about the same person?

           Wiley walks up, a bicycle at his side.

                                 WILEY
                        I think he softened towards the end 
                        there.

                                 GAFNEY
                        We need to look at shifting our 
                        focus.

                                 WILEY
                        We’ve already discussed the focus. 
                        There’s no problem with our focus. 

           Gafney looks to Monty. A little help?

                                 MONTY
                        Harvey, maybe Jay has a point. 
                        We’ve been rejected five days in a 
                        row.

           Wiley pops a puckish grin.

                                 WILEY
                        Monday I’ll make it six. Or seven. 
                        Or eight.
           He mounts his bicycle and begins to pedal away.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                            (over his shoulder)
                        Or nine! Or 10!

           He’s a blur in the distance, still shouting numbers.

           EXT. WILEY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Wiley’s bicycle leans against a modest blue brick apartment.

           INT. WILEY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Vacuous white walls, naked hardwood, and a lone desk pushed 
           against a blank wall. Only the essentials.

           At the desk, swallowed in empty space, is Wiley.

           Staring at the white wall.

           Unblinking. Brainstorming, fixated like he’s trying to move

           That blank wall.

           DRIP. DRIP.

           As we TRACK IN on Wiley, the sound of DRIPPING builds.

           DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

           Through the window behind him, crisp sunlight peeks in.

           Now tight on his clenched face, brow knotted, as the DRIPPING 
           swells to downpour.

           We sit with him in the rain.

           INT. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           CHYRON: DECEMBER 16, 1901 - DAY 11

           Wiley sits in the front row of the gallery.

                                 SUMNER
                        Wonders never cease.

                                 HAYES
                        A glutton for punishment...
                                 SUMNER
                        Alright, Dr. Wiley. You’re nothing 
                        if not enduring. You’ve got five 
                        minutes of our time.

           Wiley again approaches the podium, this time without 
           reference material.

                                 WILEY
                        I won’t need that long. 
                        Congressmen, today I’m not going to 
                        leaf through pages of data, or tell 
                        stories of children that have 
                        fallen ill to additives designed to 
                        make canned peaches colorful, or 
                        give prognostications of a world 
                        where humans have no control over 
                        the deadly chemicals they consume. 
                        Instead I’m simply going to ask 
                        you, as men of God, to do what’s 
                        decent.

           Sumner furrows his brow.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        You can continue to deny there’s a 
                        problem with our food in this 
                        country. I’m not asking for 
                        legislation. I’m only requesting an 
                        opportunity to show you. With a 
                        grant of $5000, the Department of 
                        Agriculture can do that. As a 
                        decent man, I would hope you 
                        wouldn’t want to leave behind the 
                        people you may be poisoning.

           Sumner sits back in his chair.

                                 HAYES
                        Look, as much as we--

           Sumner raises a hand to stop him.

                                 SUMNER
                        Dr. Wiley, you’re a devoted sort. 
                        Pious. With a deep love for your 
                        fellow man. And, as you so 
                        eloquently pointed out, a decent 
                        man would never turn a blind eye to 
                        a brother in peril. 
                            (leaning forward)
                        But $5000 is a lot to spend to find 
                        which of our foods give hamsters a 
                        headache. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUMNER (CONT'D)
                        So, this is the proposition I make 
                        to you. If you can show me a direct 
                        link between food additives and the 
                        damage they inflict in man, I will 
                        give your Department the grant.

           On Wiley, resolve as his ASSOCIATES deflate behind him.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        I suspect I won’t be seeing you 
                        here tomorrow.

           INT. LOBBY - HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

           Wiley’s face fills the screen. A tight, creased ball of tense 
           consternation. His eyes burn through us.

           As we very slowly PULL BACK, DULL MURMURS resolve into:

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        ...What do you feel like for lunch? 
                        I’m in the mood for something with 
                        cheese on it. I’ve been off of it 
                        for three days; to kind of re-set 
                        things. Like a cheese holiday.

           Monty notices Wiley isn’t paying attention.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        ...Doctors say it’ll be the cheese 
                        that comes for me. Roving packs of 
                        ravenous cheese with their sights 
                        set on cold-blooded murder.

                                 WILEY
                            (vacant)
                        That’s a shame.

           Finally biting, Monty follows his stare across the crowded 
           lobby to:

           Congressman Sumner, engaged in a rather congenial 
           conversation with a well-groomed BUSINESSMAN with severe 
           features and slicked hair, packaged into a tailored suit.

           From a distance, we catch a crumb of their conversation.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        You’ll love it. This time of year, 
                        the sun rises over the hills, and 
                        the sky just sings. It’s like being 
                        born all over again.
                                 SUMNER
                        Awfully neighborly of you, Mr. 
                        Hutton.

                                 HUTTON
                        I’ll have my secretary messenger 
                        over the keys. Word of warning, the 
                        snow can be treacherous. One wrong 
                        turn up there, Hickory, we won’t 
                        see you till the thaw.

           Haughty LAUGHS from the two, and with a pat, Sumner departs.

           Now alone, Hutton turns to catch Wiley’s stare. Caught, Wiley 
           spins around, but Hutton is already making his way over.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Wiley.

           Hutton slides a hand in front of his face. A golden fox pin 
           on his lapel GLISTENS.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Arthur Hutton. Big fan.

           His pencil mustache twists into an insufferable grin.

                                 WILEY
                        I take it you’re also a fan of open 
                        sores and botulism.

                                 HUTTON
                        Oh, I find you far more tolerable 
                        than that. You have the people’s 
                        best interests at heart.

                                 WILEY
                        I take immense pride in biting the 
                        hand that only feeds itself.

                                 HUTTON
                        Well, if there’s any way my company 
                        can assist your research, please be 
                        sure to let me know.

                                 WILEY
                        As a matter of fact--

           Monty swallows a laugh.
                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve sent several notices to your 
                        attention with regards to the 
                        instability of your catsup, 
                        including accounts of victims with 
                        facial lacerations from exploding 
                        bottles. For some reason, they were 
                        all returned to me unopened. I’d be 
                        happy to deliver them in person.

           A smile that could torch forests.

                                 HUTTON
                        I wish you the best of luck, Dr. 
                        Wiley.

           Hutton tugs on a hat and stalks away.

           Monty bursts out laughing.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DEPT OF AGRICULTURE - DAY

           A cigarette is snubbed into a mound of ash and butts.

           It’s somber. Gafney, seated at his desk, rubs his temples.

           KNUCKLES CRACK from the corner. Behind his Coke bottle 
           glasses, LOUIS KRUPP, 38, rotely counts ceiling tiles.

           Monty reclines his feet up onto Gafney’s desk. He lights 
           another cigarette.

                                 MONTY
                        Well gentlemen, we can always run 
                        away with the circus.

           Louis releases a puff of smoke.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Louie, you’ve got a weird-shaped 
                        head. I’m sure they could use that.

           Gafney pushes Monty’s feet off his desk.

                                 GAFNEY
                        So Monty’s out of ideas.
                            (beat)
                        The ruling is a dead end. I don’t 
                        see a way around it.

           Through the cloud of smoke in the corner, the glasses emerge.
                                 LOUIS
                        What about the Public Health 
                        Service? With their backing and-- 
                        and-- their field tests-- we could 
                        mount an offensive to apply more 
                        pressure on Sumner.

                                 MONTY
                        I think his weird-shaped head is on 
                        to something.

                                 GAFNEY
                        George Slotter is in charge of the 
                        Public Health Service. Guess who 
                        appointed him?

           The guys deflate again.

           Gafney stands and faces them, playing the part of a general.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        We need to understand when our 
                        dog’s been bit. I was made the head 
                        of Agriculture to act in the 
                        people’s interests. And I won’t let 
                        this department devolve into a 
                        parade of moral crusades. 

           ...as he knocks Monty’s feet off his desk again.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        From here on out, the focus is 
                        seeds. I don’t care about toppling 
                        corporations and proving people 
                        wrong. We are through with doing it 
                        Wiley’s way. I’m in charge. So the 
                        next time Harvey Wiley walks 
                        through that door, the line starts 
                        here.

           He points to the floor behind him.

           The door opens and Harvey Wiley walks in. Crosses the room 
           and leans against a shelf. Begins to peel an orange.

           Everyone watches him. Pin drops would be thunder.

           Wiley lets orange peel drop to the floor.

                                 WILEY
                        These doors are remarkably thin.
                                 GAFNEY
                        Harvey, it’s over. You were in 
                        there today. You saw it with your 
                        own eyes.

           Wiley flashes a smile like the cat that ate the canary.

                                 WILEY
                        He blinked.

                                 GAFNEY
                        He blinked? Have you lost it? There 
                        are no experiments that will 
                        satisfy those specifications.

                                 WILEY
                        You’re right, Sumner left us no 
                        option for standard animal 
                        experimentation.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Thank you.

                                 WILEY
                        He did, however, leave open the 
                        option of testing humans.

           Frozen faces of shell-shock. Like a bomb went off.

           Monty’s grin peeks around his hand. This fucking guy.

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           A windowless basement lit by gas lamp.

           Empty mugs pile up around Monty and Wiley.

                                 WILEY
                        Never stop shooting.

                                 MONTY
                        We’re getting down to the meaning 
                        of life, huh?

                                 WILEY
                        Never stop. Don’t be like that 
                        spineless puppet Gafney.

                                 MONTY
                        Come on, Jay means well.
                                 WILEY
                        He’s never taken a shot in his 
                        life. Monty, eventually your time 
                        will come. You may not even 
                        recognize it. 

           A wistful beat.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        When the war started, I was just a 
                        child. I was sent out on patrol 
                        with three other soldiers... this 
                        was near Nashville. We got to about 
                        two miles from base, stumbled upon 
                        a clearing. And sitting right there 
                        in the middle was an abandoned 
                        Rebel ambulance wagon, with a big 
                        red cross painted on its side. The 
                        boys challenged me to hit it. It 
                        was well known at the time that I 
                        was the worst shot in the company. 
                        I made no false claims about that. 
                        Charlie went first. He was the 
                        oldest private we had -- and he was 
                        very aware of it, if you follow me. 
                        So old Charlie took first shot and 
                        he misses. And the group goads me 
                        to go next, make a fool of myself. 
                        So I line up my shot, close my 
                        eyes, and pull the trigger. 
                        Wouldn’t you know it. Dead center. 
                        Charlie didn’t take it well, he was 
                        furious. Even drew his rifle -- 
                        except with his misfortune it went 
                        off and hit another soldier. Guns 
                        were very unpredictable back then, 
                        they’d fire at the slightest 
                        jostle. But I’ll tell you, when we 
                        got back to camp, my entire 
                        reputation was different. They 
                        called me Red Cross.

           Wiley takes a gulp from his mug, deep in memory.

           Monty’s hands are up in exasperation.

                                 MONTY
                        Well -- what in the hell happened 
                        to the soldier who got shot?

                                 WILEY
                        The ball went through his brain. He 
                        expired.
           Monty starts chuckling.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MONTY
                        That’s what I love about you, 
                        Harvey. You sure know how to rob a 
                        story of its essence.

                                 WILEY
                        You’ll hit one out of a thousand 
                        shots you take with your eyes 
                        closed. You just have to live long 
                        enough to take them all.

                                 MONTY
                        So is that what this is about? You 
                        taking your shot?

           He rises.

                                 WILEY
                        I need to get back to work.

                                 MONTY
                        Harvey, you can’t seriously be 
                        suggesting we experiment on humans.

                                 WILEY
                        The only other option is 
                        abandonment. Do you want to go back 
                        to testing seeds?

                                 MONTY
                        No, but--

                                 WILEY
                        You’re aware of the stakes here. 
                        We’re fighting for people’s 
                        lives... and those lives we’re too 
                        late to fight for.

           On Monty, the loss that he alludes to flickers across his 
           glassy eyes.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Get some rest. And go easy on the 
                        beer. I’m going to need you 
                        healthy...

           Wiley heads for the exit, leaving a slack-jawed Monty behind.
                                 MONTY
                        Wait-- what? Harvey! Healthy for 
                        what?

           INT. HUTTON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Two bottles of catsup. Noticeably different shades of red.

           One bright, one dimmed.

           Hutton turns the bottles in his hands, the flickering of a 
           gas lamp casting distorted colors across his face.

           As it turns, we land on the bright bottle’s label: Cassel’s.

           The moment is jarred by the door closing across the room. A 
           NERVOUS SCIENTIST in a lab coat stands tentatively in the 
           corner. He moves to sit across from Hutton’s desk.

           Hutton doesn’t shift his glance.

                                 HUTTON
                        How do they do it?

                                 SCIENTIST
                        From what we can find, there’s just 
                        a spike in vinegar. The shelf life 
                        proves to be exactly the same.

           Hutton leans back in his chair.

                                 HUTTON
                        So what’s the bottom line?

                                 SCIENTIST
                        It’s not an ingredient cost, Mr. 
                        Hutton, vinegar costs almost 
                        nothing. It’s a procedural cost. 
                        The infrastructure involved in 
                        preserving this way...

           Hutton waves him off. He’s heard enough.

                                 HUTTON
                        Well now, Doctor, it all comes down 
                        to the highest quality of product 
                        we can reasonably provide for the 
                        customer.

           The scientist nods, he knows what he means. Or... he thinks 
           he knows what he means...
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

           We’re moving down a row of houses -- each with a fresh bottle 
           of milk prominently placed on the porch.

           Milk... Milk... Milk... Milk... 

           ...and then we stop on a MILKMAN.

           He’s carefully studying an overly simplistic MAP of his 
           delivery route. A cluster of houses with big GREEN CHECK 
           MARKS -- with one exception. He stands before the only house 
           on his route with a RED X.

           The milkman glances back and forth between the map and this 
           house. And then Wiley is there, looking back.

                                 WILEY
                        New delivery man.

                                 MILKMAN
                        Yes sir.

                                 WILEY
                        Have you tasted it?

                                 MILKMAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 WILEY
                        Have you tasted it.

                                 MILKMAN
                        The milk?

                                 WILEY
                        Yes.

                                 MILKMAN
                        Why, of course.

                                 WILEY
                        Tell me, does it have a soft hue?

                                 MILKMAN
                        ...A soft hue?

                                 WILEY
                        On the palette. Does it have a soft 
                        hue on the palette?

                                 MILKMAN
                        I don’t believe I’ve ever noticed a 
                        soft hue.
                                 WILEY
                        The soft hue is a sign of an 
                        adulterant in the milk. Namely 
                        formaldehyde. Which is the same 
                        preservative used to embalm dead 
                        bodies. 

           Wiley walks down his porch steps. The milkman seems to be 
           frozen in place.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Over time, the toxin builds up in 
                        the body with some unsavory side 
                        effects. Largely fatigue and 
                        nausea, but also ulceration, and 
                        eventually the perforation of the 
                        oropharynx. Which sounds like a 
                        complex medical term but is quite 
                        simply a hole in the soft tissue at 
                        the back of your throat.

           A CLANKING noise as the milk bottles shake in the milkman’s 
           quivering hands.

           Just then, the MAILMAN walks up beside him. Looks at the now 
           pale milkman and then to Wiley.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Did he ask you about a soft hue?

                                 MILKMAN
                        He sure did.

           The milkman hustles away down the road.

           The mailman hands Wiley a letter.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Take it easy on the kids, Doctor.

           And he heads off.

           Wiley looks down at the letter in his hands. Sent from 
           Capitol Hill.

           INT. RECEPTION - DAY

           Arthur Hutton and SEVEN CHAIRMEN in similar suits and style, 
           sit together on a long bench along the wall, their matching 
           GOLDEN FOX PINS glistening.

           Across, an eager SECRETARY smiles back encouragingly.
           Arthur Hutton clears his throat. A cacophony of HACKS and 
           THROAT CLEARINGS from the other chairmen. CHAIRMAN #4 begins 
           passing out cough drops.

           The secretary gives a stern look.

           Suddenly, the door beside her cracks open and Sumner leans 
           out. He nods to her and then disappears, closing the door.

           The chairmen lean forward in unison.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Congressman Sumner will see you 
                        now.

           INT. CONGRESSMAN SUMNER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Sumner is seated at his resolute desk. And on the wall above 
           him, a splintered desk leg displayed behind glass.

           Hutton leans over the desk, the chairmen flanking behind.

                                 HUTTON
                        My fellow chairmen and I have just 
                        been informed that Dr. Wiley was 
                        approved his grant for a human 
                        trial to test food additives.

           Collective GRUMBLES from the chairmen.

                                 SUMNER
                        Now, now, let’s not get our tits in 
                        a vise. The approval of Wiley’s 
                        grant is little more than political 
                        theatre.

                                 HUTTON
                        I’ll hope you understand we’re not 
                        in the business of drama, 
                        Congressman.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           A wobbly tower of folders, and it looks like it’s moving.
           Strained fingers hold tight as a man carefully staggers down 
           the hallway struggling to keep the mountainous stack upright.

           The dwarfed man enters

           INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

           and dumps it on a lab table. Around it, Wiley and Monty look 
           up from papers to a breathless Louis.

                                 LOUIS
                            (adjusting glasses)
                        That’s the first load.

                        Well alright, kids, let’s find our 
                        guinea pigs.

           INT. LABORATORY - LATER

           A daunting pile of papers blanket the lab table. The guys 
           pull sheets at random.

           Louis hands a stack to Wiley. He flips through indifferently. 

                                 WILEY
                        Too fat, too stupid, too sick. We 
                        need twelve of the best.

           Gafney, sitting off on his own, turns a page in a book.

           Monty, camped out in a lab chair, tosses a folder across the 
           room. It somehow lands on Wiley’s lap. He opens it. Then 
           closes it.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        I feel compelled to impress our 
                        standards here. This man has hammer 
                        toe. Our goal is to find the best 
                        of body and mind that humanity has 
                        to offer so that no one is left 
                        behind. You give me hammer toes, 
                        and we’re leaving all straight-toed 
                        people behind.

           Back to the drawing board. Papers are pulled from the stack.

           Louis jumps up and sprints across the room.
                                 LOUIS
                        Here’s one -- here’s one.

           He hands a folder to Wiley. Labeled: BJ TEASDALE.

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           BJ TEASDALE, 25, a broad tree of a man, sits on a table in 
           his undergarments. He speaks with an Ozarks twang.

                                 BJ
                        Fifteen years ago, I was diagnosed 
                        with seven different diseases. 
                        Doctor said, “BJ, you got six 
                        months to live.” So-- I went home 
                        and, at the advice of a friend who 
                        was close with a slew of medical 
                        doctors himself, recommended that I 
                        ingest a bunch of rocks.

           Wiley sits beside a DOCTOR, whose jaw drops.

                                 BJ (CONT’D)
                        My friend said the rocks would 
                        carry away any maladies that were 
                        livin’ inside my bloodstream. 
                        Fifteen years later here I am. Not 
                        a single illness since.

           He flashes an aw-shucks grin. It’s hard to not be charmed.

           Wiley raises an eyebrow, flips a page on his file.

                                 BJ (CONT’D)
                        Even today I’ll spot a rock and 
                        take a chomp.

           He’s distracted by something on the floor nearby.

                                 BJ (CONT’D)
                        Is that...? Naw, just dirt.

                        Here’s one--

           He wings it at Wiley--

           --but it spins off target and into the wall beside him, 
           SMASHING a line of flasks.

           Unruffled, Wiley reaches and picks it up. Reads.

                                 WILEY
                        Hmm. That’s the most effusive 
                        doctor’s note I’ve ever seen.

           A foot nervously TAPS the floor. It belongs to

           FELIX SMALL. A slight man of 28, who appears to be 
           perpetually on the verge of tears.

                        It’s truly rare to see such an 
                        immaculate bill of health.

           The doctor moves a stethoscope around Felix’s body.

           Sweat collects on Felix’s hairline. He swipes it before it 
           drips down his face.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s all there.

                        bowel obstruction, upset stomach?

           The beat is telling.

           Felix taps his hands.

                                 FELIX
                        No sir.

           The doctor moves the stethoscope to his back.

           His stomach GROANS -- Felix YAWNS to mask it.

                        Looks good, right?

           The doctor looks at Wiley and nods. Wiley makes a note.

           Louis pops out from under the lab table with an armful of 
           folders. He hands one to Wiley.

                        She has everything.

           No look, Wiley tosses it aside.

                        As a child, I contracted influenza. 
                        I missed two weeks of schooling.

           Wiley and the doctor exchange a glance.

           Gafney kicks a pile away as he turns to the last page in his 
           book.

           Wiley leans on a window sill, sifting through the remainder 
           of his stack.

           The long hallway is flanked by doors on each side, and a 
           large window at the end which bathes the space in yellow.

           Our meditation on this hallway is disturbed by the 
           silhouettes of twelve men ascending into frame. As they 
           continue down the hallway, they’re thrown into relief.

           On a wooden desk sits a document titled HYGIENIC TABLE 
           WAIVER. Felix’s alarmed eyes dart about it.

                        forget all about its quirk. 

           Silver lids are dropped on platters. White gloved hands scoop 
           them and butler them out.

           Pressing through the mad tangle of last-minute preparation 
           and busy COOKS, the SERVERS shoulder open swinging doors into

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As Wiley completes his address to his seated group.

                                 WILEY
                        Welcome to the Hygienic Table.

           The room is abuzz. Three tables, four men each; dressed to 
           the nines and marveling at the elegance of the presentation.

           Marion FLICKS a crystal glass with his finger. DING!

           Felix picks up a small card with the evening’s menu:

                                   APPLE SAUCE w. BORAX
                                 SPLIT PEA SOUP w. BORAX

                                     A LITTLE BORAX.

           Felix blanches.

                                 FELIX
                        So then we’re having Borax.

                                 MARION
                        I’ve lined my undergarments with 
                        napkins.

           In a flourish, the servers converge, unveiling platters 
           before each diner.

           BJ produces a small leather pouch from his jacket and shakes 
           a few rocks loose into his palm. Offers some to Irving, who 
           declines. BJ tosses them into his mouth and dry-swallows.

           Like a waiter passing through the room, we dip into 
           conversations:
                                 FELIX
                        So what is it? Trouble in paradise? 
                        What else would drive you to join 
                        us lowlifes?

                                 MARION
                        What can I say? After ten years of 
                        marriage life becomes complete 
                        stillness. Any sort of movement is 
                        a celebration. Breaking out of that 
                        to be here with you fellas, I 
                        couldn’t be happier.

                                 FELIX
                        Whatever you say, Marion. 

                                 MARION
                        Maybe the better answer is, I’m 
                        doing it for the stipend.

                                 FELIX
                        Ha! Finally, something you and 
                        Edwin have in common!

           The two chuckle.

                                 EDWIN
                        Okay, then. Let’s get this out of 
                        the way right now... Yes, my father 
                        is Alfred Carnegie. Most of America 
                        has stood inside or ridden atop his 
                        steel. It’s been quite good to us. 
                        But I’ve always felt there was more 
                        to building society than can be 
                        held up with metal and brick. I 
                        suppose that’s why I’m here.

                                 MARION
                        So you’re out of the will.

           Another dip:

                                 MONTY
                        This was years ago -- and in my 
                        endless ungracefulness I spilled my 
                        drink all over this woman’s dress. 
                        Her drunk husband started to puff 
                        his chest and was preparing to 
                        break me in half. When Harvey -- 
                        out of nowhere -- tipped a server’s 
                        entire tray of drinks onto the 
                        woman.

           Harry laughs.
                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        He’s a misunderstood man. A lot of 
                        people can’t stand him. But what 
                        makes Harvey special is that he’ll 
                        never care about that. He’s always 
                        willing to throw himself into the 
                        machinery to save the rest of us 
                        from the gears.

           Another dip:

                                 CLARENCE
                        Fought my last battle in Palmito 
                        Ranch for the Rebels. Took 15 
                        Yankee lives myself that day. Now 
                        the war had ended a month earlier, 
                        but word just hadn’t reached us 
                        yet. All that fighting for nothing. 
                        But sending those 15 souls to Hell-- 
                        I’ll never need a reason for that.

           BJ and Irving look horrified.

           Another dip:

                                 MONTY
                        So what about you, kid?

                                 HARRY
                        Me?

                                 MONTY
                        What’s your story?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m eighteen. I don’t have a story.

                                 MONTY
                        Every man has one. If you’ve drawn 
                        a breath you have a story. 
                            (beat)
                        You don’t seem too impressed by the 
                        food.

                                 HARRY
                        My mom’s a good cook. We grow a lot 
                        of string beans and turnips back 
                        home. Nothing beats food you pull 
                        up yourself.
                            (deep in it)
                        Don’t know if I’ll ever do it 
                        again.
                                 MONTY
                        It’s only a year.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s not that... Pa’s struggling to 
                        keep the farm. Even sold the 
                        horses. Really only a matter of 
                        time. They sent me to the city 
                        first chance they got. I guess it’s 
                        where I deserve to be.

           Monty leans back, lighting a cigarette.

                                 MONTY
                        Turns out the kid’s got a story.

           Harry smiles.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Darkness filled with cricket chirps.

           A man we will come to know as BILLY CARTER, 42, African-
           American, steps up to the front door, juggling bags and a 
           ring of keys.

           The keys CLATTER to the floor. He bends to pick them up when--

           A BRANCH SNAPS BEHIND.

           Billy whips around -- stillness.

           Eyes wide, he gropes for the keys.

           INT. BILLY CARTER’S HOUSE - SAME

           He closes the door behind him. Sets his bags down. Lights a 
           candle on the sideboard.

           The glow illuminates the square frame of an OLD MAN. Gray 
           hair and heavy, droopy bags under his glazed eyes.

           Billy jumps back defensively.

           The old man just stands there. 

           Just the crickets. Finally --

                                 BILLY
                        Can I help you?
                                 OLD MAN
                        I’m waiting for someone.

           Billy, perplexed. His gaze trails to the man’s side, where 
           candlelight flickers off a long carving knife.

           Billy checks the corner, a suede bag just out of reach...

           Suddenly the door slides open. A familiar Southern accent:

                                 VOICE
                        Mr. Carter. I believe 
                        congratulations are in order.

           Sumner steps into the light, a grin pulling his lips taut. In 
           his hand, a tree branch.

                                 SUMNER
                        A government job, that’s quite the 
                        fancy thing. Even for a bright man 
                        like you. Truly is a remarkable 
                        time, Mr. Carter.

           His lingering smile met with icy nerve.

           Sumner continues.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        A chef hired to poison his fare, 
                        now that’s a strange task. Not that 
                        I know a lick about being a chef.

           He slips the knife from the old man.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        No, I’ve never been much of a 
                        craftsman. When I was a boy, the 
                        most I ever did with my hands was 
                        whittle.

           He runs the carving knife down the branch, flaying shards of 
           bark and twigs.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        Whittling is a thinking man’s 
                        craft. It’s as much a creation of 
                        the mind as it is the hands.

           SHINK! Another strip of bark falls to the floor. Sumner’s 
           beady eyes lift to Billy.
                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        See, the goal is to chop off the 
                        unnecessary parts, make sure 
                        everything is working toward the 
                        same purpose.

           There’s now a pile of wood scraps. And above it, Sumner 
           wields a newly-crafted switch.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. Explaining to a chef 
                        how to do his job. Bet a bright man 
                        like you already knows how this 
                        works.

           The switch goes up.

           Billy lunges for the suede bag, pulling out a pistol and 
           training it on Sumner.

                                 BILLY
                        Get the fuck out of my house.

           Sumner’s smile persists behind surrendering hands.

                                 SUMNER
                        No need for threats, Mr. Carter. 
                        You have a pleasant evening.

           He steps out with the old man. The door slides closed, the 
           switch leaning against the frame.

           Billy exhales.

           INT. WILEY’S OFFICE - DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE - MORNING

           Billy sits back in his chair. 

           He waits out the silence.

           At the window, Wiley absently stares out. Perturbed.

                                 WILEY
                        Fuck. I thought this was going to 
                        be about napkins.

           Billy squirms in his chair.

           Finally turning from the window--

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        And it was just the two of them?
                                 BILLY
                        Yes. Just him and that old man.

           Wiley looks out again.

                                 WILEY
                        If we can be sure of anything,  
                        you’re certainly not the only one. 
                        They’ll come for others. Anything 
                        to compromise this study. 

                                 BILLY
                        You mean like a mole?

                                 WILEY
                        If you see anything -- if anyone 
                        approaches you -- you let me know. 
                        You did the right thing.

                                 BILLY
                        Yes sir.

           Turning to him.

                                 WILEY
                        You can stay at the Chemistry 
                        Building. There’s a spare bedroom 
                        downstairs. You’ll be safe there.

                                 BILLY
                        Thank you.

           Wiley sort of shifts in place. He’s sure he’s supposed to do 
           more here.

                                 WILEY
                        Umm.

                                 BILLY
                        Sir?

                                 WILEY
                        Do you need a... hug, or something?

                                 BILLY
                        No. No thank you.

                                 WILEY
                        Right.

           As he turns back to the window.
           INT. LOBBY - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - MORNING

           The men are lined up along the wall. Felix staggers to join 
           them, looking colorless and shaking.

                                 FELIX
                        Jesus, was everyone else up all 
                        night vomiting?

           Marion and BJ turn to him.

                                 BJ
                        What?

                                 MARION
                        It’s only been one meal. I have a 
                        bit of a headache, but--

                                 BJ
                        It’s going to take a little time. 
                        Why, were you up all night?

                                 FELIX
                        No. Just a headache.

           Suddenly, swinging doors fly open, giving way to an unwieldy 
           contraption. Its caster wheels yield an earsplitting GRINDING 
           under its weight.

           The room falls silent as the men watch.

           Wiley rolls it to a stop at the center of the room.

                                 WILEY
                        Good morning, I trust you all slept 
                        well.

           GROANS from some of the group.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Splendid. I’d like to take a moment 
                        to introduce you all to a friend of 
                        mine that will be assisting with 
                        the experiment.

           Wiley gives a pat to the prominent glass tank that sits above 
           a series of jars and metal piping.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        This device, which I patented 
                        specifically for this study, is 
                        known as a fecal drying machine. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        It accelerates the process of 
                        dehydrating and breaking down the 
                        chemical components of your excreta 
                        to be analyzed.

           Marion leans in to Edwin.

                                 MARION
                        That’s to dry our--?

                                 WILEY
                        You will each use these sample jars 
                        to collect your waste.

           Wiley holds up a pair of half-gallon size jars, and places 
           them into leather slots on a belt around Louis’ waist.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        My associate here will be on call 
                        to gather your specimen from you. 
                        If you require additional jars, 
                        that can be arranged.

           Louis walks down the line distributing the jars.

           Edwin looks into the bottom of the jar. This wasn’t on the 
           waiver.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Lunch is at noon.

           The SCREECHING again as the contraption is rolled back out.

           Felix snatches three jars from Louis.

           INT. WASHINGTON POST OFFICES - DAY

           We track a pair of patent leather shoes walking down the 
           center aisle of the office’s main bullpen. CLOP CLOP CLOP on 
           the hardwood. 

           We pass desk after desk, men hunched, vigorously scribbling.

           The shoes come to a stop at the end of the room, an office 
           door labeled:

                             PHILLIP MACCALL, EDITOR IN CHIEF

           It’s embossed on reflective glass that reveals the face of

           GEORGIA ROTHWELL BROWN, 24, galvanic and bright, with eyes 
           that hint to a relentlessness behind.
           A breath to steady herself and she pushes the door open.

           INT. MACCALL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           PHIL MACCALL, 40, stern eyes beneath bushy eyebrows, leafs 
           through handwritten stories at his desk. The gust from the 
           door sends pages into the air.

                                 MACCALL
                        Brown! How many times do I have to 
                        tell you--

           As he moves to collect the fallen stories.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I have a lead on factory conditions 
                        at Mason Packing. Five limbs maimed 
                        in the last week and there’s no 
                        indication they’re even cleaning it 
                        out of the machinery.

                                 MACCALL
                        Turrell is covering our macabre 
                        factory beat. We have it canvased. 
                        Why don’t you chase something a 
                        little more tender?

           Georgia’s eyes are daggers. We’ve been here before.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Tender.

                                 MACCALL
                        Now, there’s no need to get up in 
                        arms...

                                 GEORGIA
                        Fine. I’ll cover the rally in 
                        Dupont Circle tonight.

                                 MACCALL
                        Dammit, Georgia -- tender. We’re 
                        not running another suffragette 
                        piece.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Well gee, MacCall, you aren’t 
                        giving me a lot to work with. My 
                        dossier here is a scintillating 
                        expose of bridal pieces and cake 
                        recipes. 
                                 MACCALL
                        You want a better dossier? Write 
                        one. Give me something that 
                        captivates everyone. Sell some 
                        newspapers, Georgia.

           MacCall looks back down at his work.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I heard a rumor about this dinner 
                        club.

                                 MACCALL
                        Did you not just hear me? I said 
                        give me--

                                 GEORGIA
                        They poison themselves.

           MacCall looks back up at Georgia. He’s captivated.

                                 MACCALL
                        What do you know?

                                 GEORGIA
                        They meet somewhere in a basement 
                        in DC. Elaborate five course meals. 
                        They sign over their lives to be a 
                        part of it.

           MacCall nods.

                                 MACCALL
                        Get some facts.

           INT. KITCHEN - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - EVENING

           This kitchen belongs to Chef Billy Carter, whose steady hand 
           carves into a slab of pristine marbled beef.

           Gracefully patters salt onto the freshly oiled meat.

           Adroitly chops vibrant green vegetables and slides them into 
           a waiting pot.

           Adorns a cake with a delicate spiral of whipped frosting...

           ...and then adds a final touch from a dropper, which he then 
           screws back onto a bottle labeled with a skull & crossbones.

           Billy stands before his work, a pleased sigh.
           INT. DINING ROOM

           The dinner is again butlered to the tables. This time though, 
           a much more sober reception.

                                 MARION
                        Striking how quickly one’s 
                        reverence erodes.

           He pokes at the roast beef.

                                 BJ
                        How far?

                                 HARRY
                        ...maybe Clarksville?

           BJ and Felix react.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh boy. You really are a farmer’s 
                        son.

                                 BJ
                        Okay, just down the road, bout a 
                        mile from here, there’s a train. 
                        Will take you all the way to 
                        Boston. When this is over, you hop 
                        on that train. It’s like a whole 
                        new world up there.

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know I could afford all 
                        that.

                                 FELIX
                        Nonsense. Hey, Irving, isn’t your 
                        congregation up in Boston? How much 
                        is that Boston train?

           Irving’s caught off guard.

                                 IRVING
                        Oh-- I... hmmm. Can’t remember. 
                        Seems different every time I go.

           He laughs, as Felix’s glance lingers.

                                 BJ
                        That’s all right, I’m sure Edwin 
                        can pull some strings, shut down 
                        the rail so you can pump train up 
                        there.
           A table over, Edwin shoots him a middle finger.

           Off to the side, Wiley stands with Billy, watching over 
           things.

                                 WILEY
                        How’s the new room?

                                 BILLY
                        Nice and quiet.

           They look out at the men.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        They’re eating slower tonight.

                                 WILEY
                        They tend to shy away once they 
                        locate where the poison is. 

           Zeroing in on untouched pads of butter on the tables.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Switch the Borax out of the butter, 
                        I think they’re on to it. Put it in 
                        the salt.

           Across the room, Felix douses his plate with salt.

                                 FELIX
                        This is how we get through the 
                        meal.

                                 BILLY
                        It’s already in the salt.

                                 WILEY
                        Superb.

                                 BILLY
                        I’ll have them plate the dessert.

           Billy turns to leave but Wiley stops him with a hand.

                                 WILEY
                        Actually, hold back a moment.
                            (to the room)
                        Gentlemen, I’d like to introduce 
                        you to the man who has been 
                        preparing your meals. He grew up in 
                        Philadelphia, and was a longtime 
                        head chef for the Queen of Bavaria. 
                        I give you the esteemed Billy 
                        Carter.
           Applause as Billy turns to address.

                                 BILLY
                        Thank you, thank you. If you have 
                        any dietary restrictions, please be 
                        sure to let me know.
                            (pausing for laughs)
                        The next course that will come out 
                        is a dessert that was a personal 
                        favorite of the Queen. I hope you 
                        enjoy it. You know, aside from the 
                        formaldehyde cream.

           Chuckles from the room. 

           Except Clarence, who’s been stewing. He throws a fist onto 
           the tabletop, rattling the dishes.

                                 CLARENCE
                        I didn’t know we were eating the 
                        cooking of a nigger.

           Deathly silence. Even the plates dare not settle back in 
           place.

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll drink straight from the bottle 
                        of poison before I put my health in 
                        the hands of a scurrilous negro.

           Wiley’s face is climbing crimson. Billy takes notice and 
           holds him back.

           Irving stands.

                                 IRVING
                        Clarence, the table is a place for 
                        grace. You are among God’s 
                        children. Act like it.

           Clarence turns his leveling eyes to Irving.

                                 CLARENCE
                        The only thing weaker than a nigger 
                        is a man who defends one. If I 
                        wasn’t already sick...

           Clarence stalks off, the room still quaking.

           EXT. AGRICULTURAL GARDENS - NIGHT

           A summer night thick with heat, as vines and branches tangle 
           in the shadows.
           There’s Wiley, standing alone staring up at the stars. A 
           thousand specks of pure, unfiltered light.

                                 MONTY
                        The great Dr. Harvey Wiley 
                        recharges by starlight, the one 
                        thing in the universe still 
                        untouched by man.

                                 WILEY
                        There’s never a moment out here 
                        with the stars that I’ve felt 
                        resistance to my curiosity.

                                 MONTY
                        What are you going to do with 
                        Clarence? Torched quite a bit of 
                        goodwill in there.

                                 WILEY
                        Oh he’ll be at the next meal.

                                 MONTY
                        Did we watch the same outburst?

                                 WILEY
                        I don’t agree with his views any 
                        more than you do, Monty. It’s a 
                        question of humanity. Bigots have a 
                        right to pure food as well.

           Monty turns his gaze skyward to digest this.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        How are you faring?

                                 MONTY
                        Good so far, until you go and 
                        switch the control groups on me.

           Monty searches his eyes for clues. None given.

                                 WILEY
                        I’m very glad you’re a part of 
                        this. It’s important.

                                 MONTY
                        You don’t have to tell me.

           Wiley sees that flicker again and knows.

                                 WILEY
                        Lily would be proud.
           ZZZ-POP! 

           Their attention is pulled by something new.

           Through the branches, a BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW as street lamps 
           pop to life for the first time, besting the stars above.

           They watch in silent wonderment.

           EXT. ANIMAL PRESERVE - HUTTON’S ESTATE - EVENING

           Night begins to settle on the grounds of an animal preserve. 
           Lush green meadow dotted with audacious enclosures.

                                 HUTTON
                        Majestic, isn’t it?

           The chairmen fidget with their safari glasses as they stroll 
           past pens of increasingly exotic animals.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        The precarious balance of beauty 
                        and brutality serves as a reminder 
                        to us all, the elegant design of 
                        Mother Nature.

           They stop before a pen of ostriches. Glasses go up in unison.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Which one, Declan?

           CHAIRMAN #3 squints through the glasses as he decides.

                                 CHAIRMAN #3
                        I like the one in the back.

           MURMURS of agreement from the other chairmen.

                                 HUTTON
                        Excellent choice. Anyway, I’d like 
                        to take this moment to announce 
                        some good news. I have received an 
                        update on our reinforcements. I 
                        expect it to bear fruit in no time.

           Behind them, a SERVANT steps into the ostrich pen and 
           approaches the one in the back.

                                 CHAIRMAN #6
                        Is this to mean we should be 
                        concerned with the progress Wiley 
                        is making?
                                 HUTTON
                        I like to think of it as a little 
                        insurance policy. And we all do 
                        enjoy insurance, don’t we?

                                 ALL CHAIRMEN
                        Bully!

                                 HUTTON
                        Now who’s hungry?

           In the pen, the servant throws his arms around the giant bird 
           and struggles to pull it to the ground.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Ah, such elegant design.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

           Eggs and bacon. A little bit of Borax.

           Men blankly scoop breakfast to their mouths. 

           And then,

           BANG!

           The swinging doors nearly slam off their hinges.

           A volcanic Wiley STOMPS through the room. Men straighten in 
           their chairs.

           He POUNDS a newspaper onto the middle table. It’s an early 
           edition of The Washington Post with the back page headline:

                          THE POISON SQUAD TESTING HUMANS’ LIMITS

           Eyes move from the headline to Wiley’s boiling face.

                                 WILEY
                        Can someone here tell me what in 
                        the hell “The Poison Squad” is?

                                 BJ
                        I think it’s us.

                                 WILEY
                        This is the kind of uncontrollable 
                        garbage that could sink us!

           Wiley looms over the table.
                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Who here spoke to this
                            (reading byline)
                        Georgia Rothwell Brown?

           Stone faces look back at him.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Let me be clear. You each signed an 
                        oath of confidentiality. If I find 
                        that anyone has revealed classified 
                        information to the press, that man 
                        will be immediately terminated. Are 
                        there any questions about that?

           He studies each face.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        The papers will single-handedly 
                        turn this experiment into a 
                        sideshow.

           As he scuffs away...

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        I will not allow it!

           Annoyed, the men slowly turn back to their meals.

                                 FELIX
                        Can you pass the salt?

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           On Georgia’s face, cautious. Peers left. Right. 

           A SQUEAKING.

           Georgia turns and drops to her knees to see through the now-
           open window and into the eyes of 

           Billy.

                                 GEORGIA
                        This the biggest window you’ve got?

                                 BILLY
                        If you want a bigger one, you can 
                        get a great tour of the coat room. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        In we go.
           She slides her legs through and Billy lifts her down. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           As she dusts herself off--

                                 GEORGIA
                        Thanks for the help. It would have 
                        taken forever to break in.

                                 BILLY
                        Always willing to help a woman in 
                        need.

                                 GEORGIA
                        So, where do you keep the...

           Billy throws his hands up, already walking away.

                                 BILLY
                        No, no, no, my job is done.

                                 GEORGIA
                        ...Is anyone still up?

           He hangs his apron on the hook by the door and walks out.

                                 BILLY
                        I never saw you.

           The door snaps closed leaving Georgia alone in the empty 
           kitchen. She turns to take it in.

           INT. DINING ROOM

           Moonlight spills into the pitch blackness as the door cracks 
           open. Georgia peers inside.

           INT. LOBBY

           CLOP. CLOP. CLOP. Echoes boom through the abandoned lobby. 

           Georgia takes off her shoes and slips silently through the 
           room.

           She stands at the foot of the staircase. Considering...

           Until the CRACK of a floorboard sends her skittering away.
           INT. HALLWAY

           Georgia hurries down the hall, pulling at locked doors along 
           the way.

           Finally, a knob turns, but to her surprise it’s just a closet 
           -- crammed full with the fecal drying machine.

           Fixated, she reaches out to investigate.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You wouldn’t touch that if you knew 
                        what it was.

           Georgia spins around and comes face-to-face with Monty.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I was just--

                                 MONTY
                        --about to cover your hands with 
                        excrement?

           Reflexively glances at her hands.

                                 GEORGIA
                        --about to leave. And you?

                                 MONTY
                        Midnight snack.

           He produces a pipe.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Poison of choice.

           She smiles despite herself.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Are you precious about your work?

                                 GEORGIA
                        My-- what?

                                 MONTY
                        Mind if I give you a few pointers?

           He pulls her article from his pocket. Dotted with notes.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Now, if I were writing an article 
                        about this experiment, I would have 
                        led with something more, colorful. 
                                 GEORGIA
                        Oh, would you.

                                 MONTY
                        Like this for example:
                            (reading)
                        “Night after night these men sit to 
                        dinner to dose their bodies with 
                        the most they can bear.” 

                                 GEORGIA
                        Not good, huh?

                                 MONTY
                        It’s dramatic and factual. Doesn’t 
                        catch the eye. I’d instead start by 
                        saying that we’re superhuman. You’d 
                        sell a lot more newspapers.

                                 GEORGIA
                        It’s too bad I carry the burden of 
                        integrity. And now that I’ve met 
                        you, I’d know it’s a lie.

           She turns and begins to walk back down the hall.

                                 MONTY
                        I’m Monty, by the way.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I didn’t ask.

                                 MONTY
                        It’s a fecal drying machine.

           She stops. Turns around to face him.

                                 GEORGIA
                        What does it do?

           Monty smiles.

           INT. LOBBY

           The dim glow of a lantern bobs through the room. 

           Wiley is on patrol, peeking into rooms as he makes his way 
           down the

           HALLWAY

           Propping a door, he peers into the dining room, when 
           something down the hall draws his attention.
           He hustles to the end, the lantern exposes a door left ajar. 
           Inside, the fecal drying machine askew.

           Wiley scans the hallway. Concerned.

           INT. WASHINGTON POST OFFICES - MORNING

           Rows of men writing. And at the center, Georgia.

           A distant SLAM of a door below. And angry STOMPS up the 
           staircase.

           A shadow announces him before his voice does.

                                 WILEY
                        I’d like to speak to Georgia 
                        Rothwell Brown.

           Wiley stands at the back of the room, holding up a rolled 
           copy of the paper.

           Heads pivot around to face him.

           Wiley zeroes in on the single female face, and without 
           breaking eyes, moves to her desk.

           He drops the paper atop it, revealing the mid-page headline: 
           SECRETS OF THE SQUAD.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        We have a problem.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Oh do we?

                                 WILEY
                        You trespassed upon government 
                        property and are now spreading lies 
                        about official business of the U.S. 
                        Department of Agriculture.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I did my job, Dr. Wiley. Everything 
                        in this article that you’ve kindly 
                        brought to my desk was properly 
                        cited with sources.

                                 WILEY
                        Who do you think you are?

                                 GEORGIA
                        I’m a reporter. I report news. And 
                        like it or not, you’re news.
           Wiley leans in, towering over her.

                                 WILEY
                        I need to know your source. They’re 
                        compromising the study and I have a 
                        right to speak to them.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Actually, you don’t, and while 
                        we’re here...

           She pushes his hand off of her work.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        You’re smudging my notes.

           CHUCKLES from the surrounding desks.

           MacCall opens his door and watches, leaning against the jamb.

           Wiley reddens.

                                 WILEY
                        You persist with no regard for 
                        boundaries. Why do you women always 
                        need to test limits?

                                 GEORGIA
                        Because we have them.

                                 WILEY
                        You’re forbidden from being 
                        anywhere near the experiment, the 
                        equipment, or the subjects. Next 
                        time, I won’t be so friendly.

           Wiley picks up his paper and tromps off.

                                 GEORGIA
                            (after him)
                        Would you like to make a comment 
                        while you’re here?

           Over his shoulder--

                                 WILEY
                        It’s Wiley’s Poison Squad.

           MacCall smiles to himself, shuts the door behind him.

           INT. THE BLACK CAT CAFE - DAY

           A bustling little cafe.
           Georgia sits alone at a small table. She’s studying the faces 
           around her, looking for someone.

           Under her hand, on the table, a note:

                                      ANONYMOUS TIP:
                                    THE BLACK CAT CAFE

                                        RED RIBBON

           She glances down at the note, then back at the crowd. 
           Searching...

           And then a MAN wearing a hat with a RED RIBBON is sitting 
           across from her, hat tilted low on his face.

           She starts.

                                 RED RIBBON
                        I have a shocking revelation about 
                        the Poison Squad.

           Nudging his brim, we catch a glimpse of Monty’s classic grin.

                                 MONTY
                        The men oil themselves up and dine 
                        naked. I would know, I do the 
                        oiling.

           She breaks, a smile escaping her facade.

                                 GEORGIA
                        You have no shame.

                                 MONTY
                        Shame is not one of my stronger 
                        suits. However, I do know you’re no 
                        longer allowed anywhere near the 
                        experiment, and I feel partly 
                        responsible.

                                 GEORGIA
                        It’s not my first time being thrown 
                        out of a building.

           Monty laughs.

                                 MONTY
                        I wouldn’t imagine. The Capitol 
                        Building?

           She smiles.
                                 GEORGIA
                        Twice. They really don’t like women 
                        demanding things there.

                                 MONTY
                        Well how dare you inconvenience the 
                        men like that.

           Laughs.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m not so naive that I don’t 
                        know what this story means for you.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Is it that obvious?

                                 MONTY
                        You carry a lot with you. That was 
                        apparent the moment I met you.

           She looks down.

                                 GEORGIA
                        When I was twelve I was playing 
                        dress-up with my sister. I was 
                        rooting through my mother’s dresser 
                        when I discovered this little box. 
                        And inside it were pages upon pages 
                        of poems. The most beautiful poetry 
                        I’d ever read, to this day. And it 
                        was my mother’s. In my naivete I 
                        showed the poems to her. She looked 
                        down at them without a trace of 
                        feeling and dismissed them like a 
                        childhood boyfriend. That always 
                        sat with me. Cause I knew in that 
                        moment she had made a choice. After 
                        that, I never wanted to have my 
                        life put in a drawer.

                                 MONTY
                        What happened to them?

                                 GEORGIA
                        I still have them. I read them 
                        whenever I need a reminder of why I 
                        do this.

           She absently furls the note in her hand.
                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        And what about you, Monty? What do 
                        you do when you’re not wasting a 
                        journalist’s time?

                                 MONTY
                        I eat poison to save the world. 
                        Other than that, not a lot.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Quite the résumé. And how long have 
                        you wanted to save the world?

           Monty hesitates a moment, his answer caught in his breath. 
           Then:

                                 MONTY
                        Wiley signed me up, I didn’t really 
                        have a choice.

                                 GEORGIA
                        And what was your first answer?

           A conceding nod from Monty.

                                 MONTY
                        I think... we should go dancing 
                        next time.

           He pulls another smile out of Georgia as we

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STAIRWAY - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - DAY

           BJ tenderly holds his wrist as he walks upstairs.

                                 WILEY (O.S.)
                        BJ.

           BJ looks up to see Wiley.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you feeling alright?

                                 BJ
                        Yes sir.

                                 WILEY
                        Tell me, have you seen Monty?
                                 BJ
                        He said the lab was out of 
                        kerosene. He went to get more.

           Wiley freezes at this, his face tightening.

                                 BJ (CONT’D)
                        Why, is everything alright?

                                 WILEY
                        Yes.

           As he briskly heads down the stairs. 

           INT. BJ/FELIX DORM ROOM

           TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP.

           Felix sits on his bed, stomach again in uproar. 

           His eyes land on BJ’s desk. He walks over and picks up the 
           leather pouch. Pours the rocks into his hand. Considers it.

           BJ enters, and Felix quickly turns to hide them.

                                 FELIX
                        Hey.

           BJ sits at his desk and drops his head. For once, he looks 
           tired.

           Felix takes this in.

           Atop the desk, BJ’s fingertips begin to jitter. He grasps it.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        You know it’s funny. Of everyone 
                        here, you’re the only one I haven’t 
                        seen symptoms from yet.

           His forehead on the desk--

                                 BJ
                        Just lucky I guess.

           Sizing him up as he continues...

                                 FELIX
                        No, it has nothing to do with luck. 
                        It comes from an indestructible 
                        body. An unshakable spirit. A will 
                        that refuses to give in...
           BJ is silent.

           Felix steps over, places the leather pouch on BJ’s lap. BJ 
           looks at it, confused. He turns to Felix. 

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have any of those things. 
                        Mine is the worst stomach that 
                        perhaps has ever been made. Doctors 
                        compared me to a goose. And 
                        frankly, I’m lucky this experiment 
                        hasn’t killed me yet.

           BJ looks up with heavy eyes.

                                 BJ
                        I’m scared, Felix. 

                                 FELIX
                        You don’t have to do this alone. 
                        All of us are fighting off monsters 
                        right now--

                                 BJ
                        I feel like I’m losing control of 
                        my body. I’ve got this twitch. The 
                        other night I was in the stall for 
                        an hour waiting for my hand to stop 
                        shaking. All a sudden, I dropped to 
                        the floor and-- I guess it was a 
                        seizure. I don’t know how long I 
                        was there.

                                 FELIX
                        BJ. You need to tell Dr. Wiley.

                                 BJ
                        Yeah. I just-- haven’t felt weak in 
                        a long time.

           Felix places a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

                                 FELIX
                        I know. It’s tough being the goose.

           INT. WEST WING - THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           A hand grips a newspaper. A well-dressed AIDE walks purposely 
           through the stately hall and its clusters of STAFF MEMBERS.

           Pushes her way through the hallowed doors into
           INT. OVAL OFFICE

           She strides up to the desk and drops onto it a copy of The 
           New York Times, headlined: THE SQUAD SWEEPING THE NATION.

                                 AIDE
                        Mr. President, I thought you should 
                        see this.

           Across, TEDDY ROOSEVELT, 44, takes the paper in his hand. A 
           smoldering, domineering force. His silence fills pages.

           He grumbles.

                                 AIDE (CONT’D)
                        News coverage is up. The public is 
                        increasingly in favor of what’s 
                        happening.

           Roosevelt turns in his chair, gazing out the window.

                                 AIDE (CONT’D)
                        We need to be on the right side of 
                        this.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Thank you.

           INT. SUMNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Buried in the same edition of The New York Times.

           The door bursts open, yielding Hutton and the chairmen.

           The paper folds down to a wracked Sumner.

           Hutton steps to his desk as the chairmen fan out behind.

                                 HUTTON
                        What the hell is this, Hickory?

                                 ALL CHAIRMEN
                        Hmmph!

                                 SUMNER
                        Excuse me?

                                 HUTTON
                        Well, it--

           He trails off as he searches behind him.
                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Where the hell is Harold?

           AT THE WINDOW, a knock. Outside, CHAIRMAN #7 holds up a 
           bundle of newspapers. Waves a finger and darts out of sight.

           The room waits for him.

           Finally, CHAIRMAN #7 bursts in, breathless, and makes a show 
           of dumping the newspapers onto Sumner’s desk.

                                 CHAIRMAN #7
                        Hmmph.

                                 HUTTON
                        There you have it. Six prominent 
                        news outlets, all with favorable 
                        headlines about this “Poison 
                        Squad”.

                                 SUMNER
                        They’re just stories, Arthur. I 
                        took you for a tougher scare than 
                        that.

           Hutton leans in.

                                 HUTTON
                        Let me make this clear to you. If 
                        you don’t do something to end this 
                        now, we’ll find someone who will.
                            (standing back)
                        See if it’s just a story when 
                        you’re the headline.

           Hutton leads the chairmen out.

           UNDER THE TABLE, Sumner grips the leg of the desk.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Monty leads Georgia along the road. She’s overdressed for 
           this part of town. She glances around self-consciously.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I have no idea where we are right 
                        now.

                                 MONTY
                        Good, because I forgot to blindfold 
                        you. This place is a bit of a 
                        secret.
           They approach a stairwell leading underground. 

           Monty nods to the DOORMAN, who pulls back a curtain. They 
           duck inside to

           INT. UNDERGROUND DANCE HALL

           A sprawling cellar packed with a life and exuberance unique 
           to the lower class. 

           Men in suspenders and porkpie hats; in loose cotton dresses, 
           women spin wild. Sweat drips, adding still to the thickness 
           of the trapped air.

           Georgia takes this all in, enamored.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I--

                                 MONTY
                        Are you alright with this?

           Couples around them spin with abandon to IRISH FOLK MUSIC.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I need to lose these.

           She pulls off her velvet Louis heels and tosses them away.

           Monty smiles wide, taking her hand and leading her out to the 
           middle of the floor.

           Through the jubilant carousel of bodies in motion--

           Monty spins Georgia out -- and back. The blur of motion WHIPS 
           us to:

           The DORM HALLWAY, where Wiley patrols the night by lantern.

                                                               BACK TO:

           Georgia throws herself into a jig. Monty claps along. The 
           claps sync with:

           FOOTSTEPS. Wiley’s feet stop at a doorway. He looks at the 
           door. It beckons.

                                                               BACK TO:

           Dancers weave, they trade partners. Georgia laughs. She spins 
           freely, matching to:
           A DOORKNOB TURNS. Wiley peeks inside. The lantern illuminates 
           a sleeping Harry -- and an empty bed. Wiley’s stunned...

                                                               BACK TO:

           Returning back to each other, Monty dips her low. Back up, 
           lips tantalizingly close.

           EXT. UNDERGROUND DANCE HALL - LATER

           Monty strikes a match against the brick wall outside the 
           hall. Music THUMPS from within.

           Georgia pulls sweaty hair back, out of her face.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I feel like I could dance forever.

                                 MONTY
                        We wouldn’t object.

                                 GEORGIA
                        That’s real life in there. There’s 
                        not a care in the world.

           He pulls a drag from his cigarette.

                                 MONTY
                        I think if you care to search 
                        enough, you’ll find it hidden in 
                        places you’d never expect.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I’m impressed. I want to know all 
                        your secrets.

           Monty’s eyes drop. A more profound hit than she was going 
           for. A silence passes.

                                 MONTY
                        Listen, Georgia, there’s a lot to 
                        me.

                                 GEORGIA
                        What hurt you, Monty North?

           Monty looks off, deciding whether to go there.
                                 MONTY
                        I’ve only been in love once before. 
                        We met in high school, and I fell 
                        hard for her. I didn’t know what 
                        real meant before that. It was like 
                        I’d finally discovered what forever 
                        was. And then just as quickly, 
                        everything changed. Something came 
                        that I couldn’t stop. They said her 
                        liver was dying. Copper sulfate, 
                        something they add to peas to make 
                        them greener. And I watched her 
                        fight it. Body wilting. Hair 
                        falling out in clumps. All I could 
                        do was try to squeeze hope into her 
                        hand. And then everything I fell in 
                        love with, I watched fade from her. 

           He turns back to her, as she blinks back tears.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        It’s been three years and I didn’t 
                        think I could find real again until 
                        tonight.

           She moves in. Holds his face and kisses him. Deeply.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Don’t ever lose that sense of 
                        forever.
                            (beat)
                        You’re going to need it to save the 
                        world.

           The door flings open beside them. A YOUNG COUPLE stumbles 
           out, music trailing just behind.

           The man tips his hat, the woman smiling as he leads her into 
           the night.

                                 MONTY
                        Speaking of forever... I believe we 
                        have more dancing to do.

           Offers a hand. Glowing more than she realizes, she takes it.

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           On clasped hands against the wall. Monty and Georgia make 
           love. Passion forged by pain.
           Souls connecting, dancing forever...

                                                                CUT TO:

           MORNING

           First sunlight peeks through.

           Monty takes in Georgia, sleeping peacefully.

           A smile.

           He gently shifts his pillow, and notices something.

           His hair. Clumps of it.

           Monty jolts upright, gathering it tightly in his hands. 
           Terror enveloping him.

                                 GEORGIA (O.S.)
                        Is everything okay?

           He swallows it and forces a smile. Turns to her.

                                 MONTY
                        Good morning.

           She smiles back.

           Under fragile notes of a piano, a TENUOUS WALTZ carries us...

           INT. EDWIN DORM ROOM - DAY

           Curtains drawn, the room dark. 

           At the foot of his bed, Edwin leans against the baseboard 
           with a bucket between his legs, rocking... 

           He stares down into the bucket with dread, face wracked. 
           Waiting.

           INT. MONTY/HARRY DORM ROOM - DAY

           At Harry’s desk, a pile of blankets in his chair. 

           Poking from that mound, Harry’s face in a cold sweat. He 
           pulls the blankets tighter, his breath measured.

           His teeth chattering...
           INT. MARION DORM ROOM - DAY

           Sheets thrown clear from the bed, Marion writhes on his 
           mattress. Body twisting, unable to find a position of relief. 

           Something’s not right.

           INT. PARLOR - DAY

           And finally we land on the source of the music. BJ’s fingers 
           dance atop the black and white. 

           He’s also sweating. Laboring as he plays.

           The DELICATE MELODY jitters. And then halts.

           Suddenly, BJ’s head drops to the keys with a discordant 

           BWANG!

           His body convulses. Foam pours from his mouth.

           We sit with his struggle for a torturous moment before we 
           mercifully...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL - DAY

           CLOSE ON a pallid older WOMAN’s face. Broad and scored with 
           deep lines. Eyes teeming, red-rimmed. Silent as she listens.

           Over her shoulder stand two tree trunks of men, uncomfortably 
           shifting through the silent tension. Three echoes of BJ.

           And after what seems like an eternity...

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        I can’t say how long he’s had it.

           Tears logjam and she nearly chokes on them. A stomach punch.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s far enough along to have 
                        manifested in as many ways as it 
                        has.
                            (beat)
                        There’s a chance that his weakened 
                        immune system may have contributed, 
                        but we may never know for sure.
           Sweeping the edges of the room, the Squad lines the walls, 
           fighting off tears, hearts bound to BJ’s broken mother.

           Finally we land on the DOCTOR, as he stands.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you some time with him.

           He offers a whisper of a smile and turns to leave.

           Felix rushes to intercept him.

                                 FELIX
                        Doctor, what’s to be done for him?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Our priority at this point is 
                        making sure he’s comfortable. 

           A solemn nod that levels the room. Felix struggles to keep it 
           together.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        If you’ll excuse me.

           The doctor opens the door, crossing with an entering Wiley.

           The devastated room’s ire stacks onto him. It bears down as 
           he lugs a limp flower to BJ’s bedside.

           Monty watches this.

                                 MONTY
                        Guys-- let’s give them some air.

           He shepherds the Squad as they file out.

           The door SNAPS closed on the emptied room. 

           Wiley slowly lifts his glance across the bed to BJ’s family. 

           They stare back.

           A moment thick with the unspoken. And then:

                                 WILEY
                        I’ve spent a lot of my years 
                        studying life and its confounding 
                        factors. And I’ve come no closer to 
                        understanding death or how to cope 
                        with it.

           He reaches across the bed, offering the drooping flower.
           They stare on, a baffled stupor.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           From a brittle, over-painted tin door, the Squad slips out 
           into the dirt alleyway behind the hospital.

           They sit on a bench along the building. Keeping thoughts at 
           bay with hat adjustments and cigarette lighting. 

           Swallowed in the silence.

           Harry looks about, scanning the glum faces.

                                 HARRY
                        Well comfortable is good, right?

           Felix has had it, angrily stamps to his feet.

           Monty places a hand on Harry’s shoulder.

                                 MONTY
                        Comfortable means end of life care.

           Felix unleashes a wild barrage of punches into the flimsy 
           door, scarring it with dents. 

           Squad members jump in to pry him away, calm him.

                                 FELIX
                        It just isn’t fair.

           Felix shakes them off.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        There’s nobody stronger than BJ. 
                        Doesn’t deserve an end like this.

           It hits hard.

                                 IRVING
                        We all signed death waivers. You 
                        can’t say we weren’t warned.

                                 MARION
                        That’s some damned nonsense. I’ve 
                        been in the control group, and I 
                        could barely summon the strength to 
                        stand this morning. There’s 
                        something wrong with the 
                        experiment.
                                 CLARENCE
                        And Wiley’s to blame!

           At that, tempers flare, angry bursts resounding off the 
           surrounding walls. 

                                 FELIX
                        GUYS -- have some decency! Our 
                        brother is dying in a bed upstairs. 

           A hush falls over. Felix shakes his head.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t a time to stand around 
                        picking one another apart. We need 
                        to look out for each other. Because 
                        no one’s looking out for us. 

           Humbled, they share glances. He’s right. 

           Edwin flourishes, thinking aloud:

                                 EDWIN
                        If it did that to someone like 
                        BJ... what could be happening to 
                        us?

           Their stunned faces belie that this is the first they’ve 
           considered it.

           Suddenly the brittle door BANGS back open, as a HOSPITAL 
           WORKER steps out, lugging a bag of sloshing hospital waste. 

           He takes a hard stare at the battered door, before dumping 
           the bag out into the alley.

           Marion dances away, dusting off his leg.

           The worker shoots a final scornful look as he ashes his 
           cigarette, and returns inside.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON, D.C. - EVENING

           A browned hand picks through tomatoes, pulling out rotting 
           ones and throwing them aside.

           The VENDOR snatches one of the last ripe ones, giving it a 
           playful toss into the air.

                                 VENDOR
                        End of day special, half-price for 
                        the pretty lady.
           Georgia passes arm-in-arm with Monty, waves him off.

                                 GEORGIA
                        You’re lucky I’m here. This time of 
                        evening, I can get us anything we 
                        want.

           Monty laughs.

           Georgia stops as she spots an OLD MAN tending a pastry stand.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        I know you can’t partake, but I 
                        hope you don’t mind if I...

           Monty watches as she bounces over to the stand.

           He smiles. Mind clearly elsewhere.

           Just as quickly, she returns boasting two giant chocolate 
           doughnuts.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t judge me.

           Takes a bite from each doughnut.

           Monty struggles to put on a face. Georgia notices.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                            (mouth full)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MONTY
                        Nothing.

                                 GEORGIA
                        No. You’re a terrible liar.

           Shaking it off...

                                 MONTY
                        I’m sorry. Let’s just get you some 
                        more free food.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Monty.

           She looks to him deeply.
                                 MONTY
                        Listen, something happened. But 
                        before I tell you, I need your 
                        confidence. This is just you and 
                        me.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I promise. What’s going on?

                                 MONTY
                        BJ, one of the Squad. He contracted 
                        meningitis. Be lucky to make it 
                        through the week.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I--

           She struggles to find words. Monty puts an arm around her.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                            (re: the doughnuts)
                        I really wish you’d have told me 
                        before I got these.

           He leads her to a quiet corner.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        How is Wiley handling it?

                                 MONTY
                        I can’t imagine... the whole thing 
                        is a disaster.

                                 GEORGIA
                        What about the Squad?

                                 MONTY
                        Everyone’s shaken up right now. The 
                        whole group was violently ill this 
                        morning... more than any experiment 
                        would call for. We just don’t know 
                        who we can trust.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Something doesn’t add up. I can--

           Monty grabs her shoulders. Looks into her eyes.

                                 MONTY
                        No, you can’t say anything. I’m 
                        placing my trust with you.
                                 GEORGIA
                        Okay.
                            (then)
                        Monty, are you safe continuing?

           He sits with it a moment, then flashes an unconvincing smile.

                                 MONTY
                        I’ll tell you tomorrow.

           INT. MONTY/HARRY DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Wiley roots through Monty’s closet. Opening boxes, checking 
           jacket pockets -- a handful of ticket stubs and a pack of 
           cigarettes. There has to be more.

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        Something I can help you with?

           Wiley stops. Slowly turns to face him standing in the 
           doorway. A tension pulses between them.

           Finally, Wiley stands, straightening himself out.

                                 WILEY
                        No, thank you. I was just looking 
                        for that refill of kerosene.

           And he walks out of the room. Off Monty, thrown...

           INT. WASHINGTON POST OFFICES - DAY

           Rows of men writing broken by Georgia, still deep in thought.

                                 MACCALL
                        Brown.

           Georgia snaps to.

                                 MACCALL (CONT’D)
                        Can I have a minute.

           INT. MACCALL’S OFFICE

           MacCall tosses Georgia a page of notes.

                                 MACCALL
                        I have your next story.

           Georgia takes the page, hesitant.
                                 GEORGIA
                        Kind of have my hands full with the 
                        good housewife tips.

                                 MACCALL
                        Not anymore. I have a big 
                        development in the Poison Squad 
                        story. And since you broke it, I’m 
                        giving it to you.

                                 GEORGIA
                        What happened?

                                 MACCALL
                        I have information from a source 
                        inside the Squad that one of the 
                        subjects has left the experiment 
                        with an illness. I need it for 
                        early edition.

           Georgia is floored. Searches for breath.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Who’s your source?

                                 MACCALL
                        Didn’t want to be named. One of the 
                        Squad.

                                 GEORGIA
                        --I can’t.

                                 MACCALL
                        Georgia. This is a front page 
                        story. Lead reporters don’t run 
                        away from front page stories.

           Across from his desk, she seems a million miles away.

                                 MACCALL (CONT’D)
                        I expect it on my desk by 8.

           INT. DORMITORY HALLWAY - MORNING

           Leather shoes softly CLACK across the groaning floorboards.

           Wiley makes his way down the hallway, past the deserted 
           rooms. A pause as he crosses BJ’s room, the door slightly 
           ajar. Desk bare.

           We follow as Wiley descends the staircase. He reaches the 
           landing, which greets him with eerie stillness.
           INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

           He pushes the door open.

           Tables set for breakfast. Untouched silver platters emit 
           whispers of steam.

           And at the front of the room, eleven men stand defiantly, 
           arms crossed.

           The door closes behind Wiley. 

           They stand on opposite ends of the room, watching each other.

                                 WILEY
                        I can’t imagine you were waiting 
                        for me to begin.

           His humor is met with dead air.

           Edwin steps forward.

                                 EDWIN
                        Dr. Wiley, we’ve all decided this 
                        morning to withdraw from the study.

           The steely eyes behind seem to echo his resolve.

           Wiley weathers.

                                 EDWIN (CONT’D)
                        I joined this experiment to do 
                        something just in a world that can 
                        be anything but. I think I speak 
                        for everyone here when I say that I 
                        don’t feel like we’re doing that 
                        anymore.

           Bracing. But Wiley is soft, contrite.

                                 WILEY
                        I owe you all an apology. I have 
                        nothing that can erase the events 
                        of the last couple of days. The 
                        pain that you all are assuredly 
                        suffering. Nor have I yet located 
                        the cause of the egregious overdose 
                        that transpired.

           His stern eyes fall onto Monty.

                                 FELIX
                        He died on your watch! How do you 
                        live with that?
           Wiley swallows this.

                                 WILEY
                        I’d never been responsible for the 
                        loss of a human life. Then, when I 
                        was about your age, I committed my 
                        life to science. In my mind, that 
                        was how I could help bring about a 
                        world that’s a little more fair. To 
                        make life absolute. But my career 
                        has been a humbling process of 
                        endlessly relearning that science 
                        detests the absolute. You can’t 
                        fathom the devastation when every 
                        victory you claim is paralyzed by 
                        loss. But death and change is a 
                        symbiosis. And sometimes a 
                        sacrifice like BJ’s allows the 
                        world to become a little more 
                        absolute.

           The men soften. Felix chokes back tears.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        I owe it to you to get to the 
                        bottom of what went wrong 
                        yesterday, and to ensure every 
                        safety measure I can. If this is 
                        more than you can bear, I will 
                        understand if you must take your 
                        leave. But my plea to you today is 
                        to persist; to endure an imperfect 
                        attempt to change an unjust world. 
                        Or just to make it a little more 
                        fair.

           The room falls silent. Glances around the Squad break up the 
           guise of their steadfast resolve. 

           And then Harry steps forward. And in front of his cohorts, he 
           takes a seat at the table. Lifts the silver lid. And begins 
           to eat. 

           MURMURS stir.

           Harry finishes the plate, slides over to the next seat. Lifts 
           the silver lid. And does it again.

           There’s worry now beginning to set in. Felix leans into 
           Edwin.

                                 FELIX
                            (sotto)
                        He’s going to kill himself!
           Harry finishes the second plate, and moves to slide over once 
           again --

           But Monty has already taken the seat. He looks up at Harry, a 
           faithful nod, and begins to eat.

           One by one, the other members of the Squad take their seats.

           A warm nod from Wiley, a smile creaking the corner of his 
           lips.

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Harvey.

           Harvey lifts a hand to wave him off.

           Peeking in from the hallway, Louis insists.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Harvey!

           Wiley finally relents, beckoning him over. They huddle. 
           Wiley’s face sinks.

           From his seat, Monty’s attention is with them -- and the 
           newspaper Louis holds: 

                       POISON SQUAD MEMBER FALLS ILL, STUDY IN PERIL

           Monty’s in shock. And being stared at. 

           Wiley glares back as he shepherds Louis out of the room. Off 
           Monty’s bewilderment...

           INT. MONTY/HARRY DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

           A door opens to reveal a guarded Georgia, shoes in hand.

           Harry stares back. Like seeing a ghost.

                                 GEORGIA
                            (hushed)
                        Can we talk?

           A cautious look over his shoulder, Harry snatches a book and 
           slips past her out the door.

           Georgia closes the door, alone with Monty.

           A tense moment. Thick with the unsaid.
                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re mad. You’d be less 
                        mad if you knew what happened.

                                 MONTY
                        You mean about betraying my trust 
                        and destroying everything?

                                 GEORGIA
                        It’s more complex than that--

                                 MONTY
                        It’s more complex? It’s as black 
                        and white as the front page it was 
                        plastered all over.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Monty, listen to me -- I’m trying 
                        to tell you there’s a mole.

                                 MONTY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GEORGIA
                        My editor handed me the lead on 
                        that story. A member of the Squad 
                        leaked BJ’s story to him. Someone 
                        is trying to sabotage the 
                        experiment.

           Monty shakes his head.

                                 MONTY
                        I told you when you’re opening a 
                        story you should make it eye-
                        catching. 
                            (then)
                        If you just wanted to come here to 
                        cover your tracks I could have 
                        saved you a favor.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Monty, I would never betray you 
                        like that.

                                 MONTY
                        I wish I could trust your word.
                            (beat)
                        You should go.

           Monty holds the door open, his eyes lowered to the floor. A 
           last appeal, then Georgia takes her shoes and marches out.
           INT. PARLOR - NIGHT

           In the sprawling darkness the space is barely recognizable.

           In a small corner we can see him illuminated by lamp light. 
           Hunched. Consumed. Engulfed.

           Wiley.

           Like before, he stares ahead into nothing.

           And somewhere inside

           It’s raining again.

           Thick drops collecting, pooling... 

           Swelling and rising...

           As we TRACK IN on Wiley, wrinkles threaten to split his face 
           open. A pencil splinters in his hand.

           The RUSH of water filling to the brim...

           And then the ominous surge of CREAKING--

                                 MONTY
                        Kind of late to be bleeding out in 
                        the corner of a room, isn’t it?

           Wiley looks down at his hand. Blood drips to the floor.

                                 WILEY
                        I was just running some numbers.

           And drops the splintered pencil.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you need something...?

           Monty places a can of kerosene on the desk.

           Wiley’s eyes move from it to Monty.

                                 MONTY
                        One night at a bar you told me to 
                        take my shot. That scared the hell 
                        out of me. For so long it felt 
                        selfish to so much as consider what 
                        I deserve, not to mention to try 
                        and actually get it...

           His eyes fall.
                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        I need to come clean. I’ve been 
                        sneaking out of the dorm at night.

           Wiley reaches into his pocket, places the ticket stubs on the 
           desk.

                                 WILEY
                        I know.

           Stunned, Monty goes to speak--

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        She had better be worth it.

           A smile.

                                 MONTY
                        Harvey, I would never jeopardize 
                        what you’ve worked so hard for.

           Wiley leans back, looking past him into the darkness.

                                 WILEY
                        Do you remember when you showed up 
                        at my door three years ago? It was 
                        right after Lily. You came to me, 
                        this wide-eyed young kid, and said, 
                        “I know very little about 
                        agriculture, and I know nothing 
                        about chemicals, but I want to help 
                        people.”

                                 MONTY
                        I was lying. I knew nothing about 
                        agriculture, either.

                                 WILEY
                        You were an idealist. You wanted to 
                        give yourself to what you believed 
                        in, to step up for others who 
                        couldn’t do it themselves. I hired 
                        you because you reminded me of 
                        myself.

           The first he’s heard of this.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        We just wanted to be good men.

                                 MONTY
                        Harvey--
                                 WILEY
                        Looking back, it’s a foolish 
                        notion. To have any hope of coming 
                        out of this a good man. What we’re 
                        all too idealistic to realize is 
                        that accomplishing anything on this 
                        big a scale requires far too much 
                        sacrifice to come out undamaged. 
                        You can do good things. But there 
                        are no good men.

                                 MONTY
                        Your good things define you. 
                        Whatever happens with this, you 
                        gave that wide-eyed young kid 
                        purpose.

           The two men reflect in the dark. 

                                 WILEY
                        Well I’ve got numbers to run.

           Monty pats his friend.

                                 MONTY
                        Get some sleep, Harvey.

           And leaves him to his thoughts.

           INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

           On an empty seat at the table. 

                                 MARION (O.S.)
                        It’s weird, isn’t it?

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        I don’t know what else they could 
                        have done with it.

                                 MARION (O.S.)
                        Anything. They could have dressed 
                        it up with ribbons or flowers or 
                        something. 

           Across, Irving eyes it, chewing uncomfortably. 

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        Ribbons?

           We land on Marion and Edwin.
                                 MARION
                        I don’t know, I’m not a funeral 
                        director. But I feel like someone 
                        should say something.

           Suddenly, from the background, the swinging doors fling open, 
           Billy yelling frantic.

                                 BILLY
                        Don’t eat anything! The food has 
                        been poisoned!

           Felix freezes, a giant forkful in his mouth.

           Wiley stands from his perch in the corner of the room.

                                 WILEY
                        Billy, what’s this about?

           Billy holds up a small glass bottle.

                                 BILLY
                        Someone was in the kitchen earlier. 
                        He fled into the dining room, and 
                        left behind this empty bottle.

           Wiley snatches the bottle and inspects it. Runs a finger 
           around the rim and taps it to his tongue.

                                 WILEY
                        Gentlemen, there’s a traitor in our 
                        midst. 
                            (then)
                        You’ll be able to spot him from the 
                        blood on his hands.

           Amidst gasps, heads swivel, reconsidering their roommates and 
           neighbors.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Did anyone else notice anything out 
                        of place?

           Edwin turns to Marion.

                                 EDWIN
                        Does he mean other than the chair?

           Meanwhile, Felix’s eyes are locked on Irving. Irving catches 
           his stare and shifts anxiously.

           The room buzzes. Scouring tabletops, scanning faces...

           Tension rises to fever pitch.
                                 FELIX
                        Tell me again about that Boston 
                        congregation.

           Then Felix stands. Raises an admonishing finger at Irving.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        You son of a bitch.

           The room falls silent. Marion looks around.

                                 MARION
                        Is he serious?

           Felix’s solemn face continues to stare through Irving.

                                 BILLY
                        I think we should search him, 
                        Doctor.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Now wait just a God-damned minute. 
                        May we all sooner be swallowed 
                        whole by the scorching fires of 
                        Hell than question the virtues of a 
                        God-serving priest.

           Clarence walks over to Irving.

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        You know what our problem is? We 
                        always fall in with the herd before 
                        we think for ourselves. Follow 
                        blind accusers to the edge of 
                        Perdition. How are we to believe we 
                        haven’t been sabotaged by our negro 
                        cook? 

           Clarence reaches down and grabs Irving’s Bible before he can 
           stop him. Holds it high above his head.

                                 CLARENCE (CONT’D)
                        Proverbs 1:22. “How long, O naive 
                        ones, will you love being simple-
                        minded? And scoffers delight 
                        themselves in scoffing and fools 
                        hate knowledge?”

           The Bible opens to reveal its pages hollowed out.

           THUMP!

           A glass bottle drops to the floor and rolls to Wiley’s foot.
           Wiley picks it up and looks closely. It’s IDENTICAL to the 
           one Billy discovered.

           Shaken, Clarence slowly takes a seat.

           The room turns to Irving.

           He sweats.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Tucked between rolling hills under a singing sky is a winter 
           cabin. An oasis where the rich get away.

           The chairmen approach, bedecked in riding gear and jodhpurs, 
           lugging rifles and the day’s spoils -- including white-tailed 
           foxes that match their still-glistening GOLDEN PINS.

                                 CHAIRMAN #5
                        Three trophies in a scruple’s time! 
                        Bully!

                                 ALL CHAIRMEN
                        Bully!

           As the men ascend the steps, a package awaits them: an 
           elaborately wrapped basket filled with gourmet pastries.

           Hutton pushes his way to the front to get a look.

                                 HUTTON
                        Ah -- Looks to be goodwill from 
                        Washington.

                                 ALL CHAIRMEN
                        Bully!

           The men dig in, filling their faces with the crispy treats.

           As the basket diminishes, a crumb-laden handwritten note 
           appears at the bottom.

           Hutton pauses mid-bite as he notices.

                                 HUTTON
                        Let’s see who we have to thank--

           He plucks the letter from the basket, shaking it free of 
           crumbs. He reads aloud:
                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        Dearest Arthur Hutton et al, I hope 
                        you enjoy these one-of-a-kind 
                        treats, a particular favorite of 
                        the Queen of Bavaria. 

           A wave of awe as the chairmen chew.

                                 HUTTON (CONT’D)
                        It has come to my attention that 
                        someone in your employ has taken 
                        the liberty of contributing his 
                        very own stock to our supply of 
                        adulterants. As a token of thanks, 
                        I have filled the enclosed with the 
                        contents of his bottles. Yours 
                        sincerely, Harvey Washington... 
                        Wiley.

           Hutton stops, color draining. The rest of the chairmen 
           desperately spit out their last bites, knowing it’s too late.

           The chairmen look at each other and the retching begins.

           INT. HALLWAY - DEPT OF AGRICULTURE - DAY

           Journalists swarm outside Gafney’s office. Wiley maneuvers to 
           the front and knocks.

           The door opens, a swinging broomstick keeping the press at 
           bay.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Back, you animals!

           He yanks Wiley in, slamming the door behind.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE

           Wiley sits across from Gafney. 

           The commotion from the hallway pours through the thin door.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Harvey, no one appreciates what 
                        you’ve accomplished with your human 
                        trial over the last eleven months 
                        more than I do. What you’ve done 
                        for pure food is... I mean it’s 
                        groundbreaking.
                                 WILEY
                        How about we get to the point.

           Gafney’s face sours.

                                 GAFNEY
                        The facts here are very simple. You 
                        were already way over budget. Now 
                        one of your subjects is gravely 
                        ill. I get the distinct feeling 
                        there’s more--

           Wiley goes to speak.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        --It’s probably better I don’t 
                        know. 
                            (beat)
                        Effective today, I’m de-funding the 
                        Hygienic Table.

           It stings even though he knew it was coming. Wiley leans 
           forward.

                                 WILEY
                        Jay, we’ve been friends for a long 
                        time.

                                 GAFNEY
                        No, we haven’t.

                                 WILEY
                        Well then I’ll just get to the 
                        point. I have eleven men that have 
                        given themselves up, sacrificed 
                        their bodies and even their lives 
                        for our cause. Not to mention what 
                        we’ve given. It’s been ten years, 
                        and for once we can actually taste 
                        it. You’ve seen the data, Jay, you 
                        know how close we are.

           Gafney re-sets in his seat, listening...

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do this. For once in your 
                        life, when people are counting on 
                        you, stop quivering like a 
                        toothless child and actually stand 
                        for something.

           ...and hardens just as quickly.
                                 GAFNEY
                        Look I don’t know who the fuck you 
                        think you’re talking to, nor do you 
                        comprehend the hail of gunfire I am 
                        under because of you. 

           As he flails an arm at the mounting chaos through the door.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        The BJ story was picked up by every 
                        major newspaper outlet in the 
                        country. There comes a point where 
                        the press outweighs the 
                        performance, and we’ve reached it. 
                        I’m sorry, Harvey, but I’m done 
                        sticking my neck out.

           Wiley stands and walks out, leaving the door open for the 
           press to stream in.

           INT. PARLOR - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - MORNING

           Wiley sprawls across the sofa, a bottle of whiskey resting on 
           his chest. A messy snore.

           Louis bursts in, spilling light into the darkened room.

                                 LOUIS
                        Dr. Wiley!

           Wiley’s bloodshot eyes peel open.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        I-- 

                                 WILEY
                        What is it, Louis?

                                 LOUIS
                        I can’t describe it. Just put on a 
                        shirt--

           EXT. CHEMSITRY BUILDING - MORNING

           Louis leads Wiley out onto the portico.

           His eyes widen.

           Before them, a boisterous throng. Hundreds of SUPPORTERS 
           wrapping around the building, stretching deep into the 
           garden. Handmade POISON SQUAD signs, joyful singing, and 
           supportive chants greet Wiley.
           An unmistakable smile wraps across Wiley’s face. In this 
           moment he’s glowing.

           From the crowd emerges a curly-haired woman we’ve met before. 
           This is the SUFFRAGETTE. She tilts to Wiley a crate 
           overflowing with letters.

                                 SUFFRAGETTE
                        These are yours. I grabbed them 
                        before they could be consumed by 
                        the ravenous pack here.

           Wiley glances across the letters -- all addressed to POISON 
           SQUAD ADMISSIONS.

                                 WILEY
                        Thank you.

                                 SUFFRAGETTE
                        Dr. Wiley, I’m Catherine. I’m a big 
                        fan of your movement. All of us 
                        are.

                                 WILEY
                        Movement?

                                 CATHERINE
                            (looking out)
                        There are people here from Boston, 
                        Chattanooga... 

           He follows her gaze through the diverse crowd.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        They came out cause they believe in 
                        your voice. Feels like you could 
                        use the support. I’m the head of 
                        the Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the 
                        Suffragette Association. Not that 
                        they’d say it, but women are 
                        actually the group most susceptible 
                        to the poisons you’re testing. 
                        We’re the ones getting sick and 
                        dying. 

           This resonates.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Listen, if there’s anything that we 
                        can do to help...

           She hands him a pink pamphlet with the Suffragette 
           Association seal. 
                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Give ‘em the hell we can’t.

           With a smile, she turns and falls back into the crowd. 

           Off Wiley, gears turning...

           A CRACK of a flashbulb and a FLASH of white takes us to:

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           On a photo stage with a simple backdrop, a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps 
           photographs of the ten-member Poison Squad.

           While the camera POPS, a young REPORTER fires questions --

                                 REPORTER
                        Is it true that your Poison Squad 
                        left behind their families for a 
                        full year to participate in the 
                        study?

                                 WILEY
                        Well, now, you can’t believe 
                        everything you read in the 
                        newspapers. -- But yes, that’s 
                        true!

           He flaunts a gaudy smile as the camera FLASHES white --

           -- matching to the black & white cover of Harper’s Weekly:

                               THE BRAVE SOULS OF PURE FOOD

           INT. HALLWAY - CHEMISTRY BUILDING - DAY

           Wiley parades a horde of JOURNALISTS through the halls of the 
           Chemistry Building. 

           Candidly swings open a door to reveal --

                                 WILEY
                        And this is our fecal drying 
                        machine.

           A flurry of camera CRACKLES.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Posed before a dazzling array of additive bottles, Wiley 
           hosts another photo op, Billy at his side.
                                 WILEY
                        Yes, 17 poisons is a lot for one 
                        man to bear. And yet, that’s 
                        exactly what the American people 
                        are consuming every day in this 
                        country.

           Wiley throws an arm around Billy as camera bulbs are 
           eviscerated --

           -- matching to another cover story:

                               YOUR KITCHEN’S SILENT KILLER

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           The frenzy of cameras now surround Wiley at the table. 

           He feigns a bite, a heaping staged forkful to his lips.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        Dr. Wiley -- do you yourself eat 
                        the poison?

           Wiley pauses with the fork, smiling.

                                 WILEY
                        My feeling is a little camaraderie 
                        never hurt anyone.

           And he slides it into his mouth.

           The cameras eat it up. And once again we match to a headline:

                                THE FACE OF AMERICA’S HOPE

           And then match back from the headline to catch Wiley spitting 
           the bite into a napkin.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        What’s your circulation again?

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

           A special night. The tables have been replaced with one large 
           one, around which all the men now begin to sit.

           Down the table, Monty takes his seat beside a dour Harry.
                                 MONTY
                        What’s your story, kid?

           A limp smile.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Look, at least you can go back to 
                        food you pulled out of the ground.

                                 HARRY
                        My parents are sending me to school 
                        instead. 
                            (beat)
                        They’re so close to losing the farm 
                        and they don’t even want me there.

                                 MONTY
                        I see.

           A server passes, dropping platters.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        What are you planning to study?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know. All my life I’ve just 
                        been waiting to take over the farm. 
                        Then I saw all those doctors 
                        running around, pulling stuff out 
                        of medicine bottles... I think I’d 
                        like to look into that.

           Monty grins.

                                 MONTY
                        I could certainly see that. And I 
                        don’t want to hear you talking like 
                        your parents gave up on you. 
                        Succeeding down your own path can 
                        be your own way of keeping their 
                        legacy alive. 

           Harry brightens as he considers this, an assuring nod.

           Monty takes pause as his advice washes over him as well.

           DING DING DING!

           At the head of the table, Wiley stands with fork and glass.

                                 WILEY
                        On our final night, it felt 
                        appropriate to say a few words.

                                 WILEY (CONT'D)
                        I would be remiss not to thank all 
                        of you. Your dedication to the 
                        cause and your enduring spirits are 
                        the real success story. But even 
                        more importantly, you’ve provided 
                        me with hope. Hope that future 
                        generations will have no way to 
                        fathom the horrors that took place 
                        within these walls. The souls that 
                        never escaped them.

           Felix looks across to BJ’s empty chair, now covered in 
           flowers and ribbons.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        And so tonight, I raise a glass to 
                        you, the Poison Squad.

           Glasses go up; a rousing toast.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy your poison-free meals.

           As the Squad digs in, Billy delivers Wiley a separate 
           platter.

                                 BILLY
                        This one isn’t edible, sir.

           Billy lifts the silver lid, uncovering a telegram beneath.

           Wiley picks it up and reads. His eyes dart about it, a 
           satisfied grin stretching his lips.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you got his attention.

                                 WILEY
                        I would say so. This came from--?

                                 BILLY
                        Hand delivered from the White 
                        House.

           Content, Wiley reads it once more.

           INT. MARION DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Marion stands at his bed, carefully folding his shirts over 
           an open suitcase.

           A KNOCK.
           He opens the door on Wiley, vigilantly balancing two pressed 
           suits in his arms.

                                 WILEY
                        Hope I’m not interrupting. I’m... 
                        just doing my rounds.

                                 MARION
                        Not an interruption. Have a couple 
                        of suits there? 

                                 WILEY
                        Oh, these. Well, I was invited to 
                        meet with the President tomorrow 
                        morning. Still... deliberating what 
                        I’ll wear.

           An inquisitive glance lingers.

                                 MARION
                        The more important the occasion, 
                        the darker the suit. That’s sort of 
                        the rule of thumb.

           Wiley looks at the suits again, in a new light.

                                 WILEY
                        Oh. Yes.

                                 MARION
                        Accessories.

                                 WILEY
                        What?

                                 MARION
                        I would not be caught dead at the 
                        White House without a suit 
                        accessory.

           Marion disappears into his closet. He returns with a 
           beautiful, silken white pocket square.

                                 MARION (CONT’D)
                        This brings a whole suit together. 
                        If I were going.

           Wiley takes the pocket square in his hands, regarding it.

                                 MARION (CONT’D)
                        I have others, so if you want to 
                        look at that one for a day... be my 
                        guest.
                                 WILEY
                        Of course. Just a look. It’d be a 
                        little out of my element to wear 
                        it.

                                 MARION
                        It takes courage not to be what 
                        others want you to be.

           An acquiescing smile from Wiley.

                                 WILEY
                        It was a pleasure having you here. 
                        You were an invaluable specimen.

                                 MARION
                        I don’t think I’ve ever received a 
                        more humanizing compliment.

                                 WILEY
                        Yes, well. I’ll bet you’re excited 
                        to get back to your life.

                                 MARION
                        Oh. Yes.

                                 WILEY
                        Wife, kids...

                                 MARION
                        Of course.

           A silence builds. And then.

                                 MARION (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know.

           Marion drops his head, the acknowledgement weighing heavy.

           Wiley steps close, a reassuring hand on the shoulder...

                                 WILEY
                        I hear it takes courage not to be 
                        what others want you to be.
                            (then)
                        Thanks for giving me something to 
                        look at.

           With a wave of the pocket square, Wiley heads back out and 
           down the hall.

           Marion, now alone. Thinking.
           INT. WEST WING - THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           The aide leads Gafney and Wiley, adjusting his pocket square.

                                 GAFNEY
                            (quietly)
                        We’re lucky to be here, okay? He’s 
                        clearly taken by the groundswell of 
                        support we’ve created.

           A side eye from Wiley.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        But he’s a strong-willed man. So, 
                        please-- only speak when you’re 
                        addressed.

                                 WILEY
                        If I’m in the room, I assume he’s 
                        addressing me.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Just let me do the talking.

           The aide pushes open a set of doors, showering us with 
           blinding light as we move into

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 AIDE
                        Mr. President. Dr. Jay Gafney and 
                        Dr. Harvey Wiley.

           The aide slips back out the door.

           Roosevelt twists his chair to them.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Harvard.

           Wiley bemused.

                                 WILEY
                        Yes sir.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Well dressed. Smart men always know 
                        how to dress.

           A knowing smirk.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        Please, have a seat.
           Gafney and Wiley take their seats at the center of the room.

           As Roosevelt plods over, Gafney takes notice of some tiny 
           white objects behind glass by the President’s desk.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Those are beautiful pearls.

           Roosevelt pivots to see.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Teeth, actually. Human!

           Gafney and Wiley’s eyes grow.

                                 ROOSEVELT (CONT’D)
                        I was at a bar years ago in 
                        Montana. Hunting trip. Drinking a 
                        mint julep when a cowboy took 
                        exception to it. Shabby individual 
                        in a broad hat, a cocked gun in 
                        each hand. He chastised my drink 
                        choice as feminine in nature, and 
                        recommended I set up a round of 
                        bourbon for everyone to redeem 
                        myself. So, I did what I had to do. 
                        I struck quick and hard with my 
                        right, and then again with my left. 
                        When he went down he struck the 
                        corner of the table with his head; 
                        a lot of things came out of it. I 
                        don’t enjoy being questioned in my 
                        affairs.

           Gafney and Wiley shift uncomfortably.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Well. They’re beautiful.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        There is a reason I called you here 
                        this morning. Your human trial has 
                        developed into quite the spectacle. 
                        A lot of people hate to see it cut 
                        short. For good reason. The health 
                        of our people should be of the 
                        utmost importance.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Thank you, sir. That is the crux of 
                        everything we do. And our findings 
                        so far only lend to its urgency. A 
                        lot of people are relying on us.
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Now see, I owe my immaculate health 
                        to Dr. Rixey. Every morning he 
                        dispenses me a dose of pressed 
                        herbs and saccharin. Not everyone 
                        is so fortunate to have a doctor 
                        like him to keep them in peak form. 
                        So then -- What have you learned?

                                 GAFNEY
                        My chemist carried on experimental 
                        determinations on healthy young men 
                        and found, principally, Borax to be 
                        an injurious substance when placed 
                        in food.

           Roosevelt leans back as he takes this in.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Dr. Wiley. Do you think Borax is an 
                        injurious substance?

           Wiley looks at him squarely.

                                 WILEY
                        Mr. President, I don’t think, I 
                        know.

           Roosevelt LAUGHS, a bellow just short of a bear’s roar.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        Good answer. I’ve read some 
                        troubling headlines recently about 
                        one of your subjects becoming 
                        greatly sick. Not the most 
                        reassuring turn of events.

                                 WILEY
                        It’s true, and I think that 
                        unfortunate episode only speaks to 
                        the severity of our current state 
                        of affairs. 

           Roosevelt finds himself nodding in agreement.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I must admit, Borax is of personal 
                        concern to me. I saw its dangers 
                        myself during the Spanish-American 
                        War. I led the Rough Riders in to 
                        take Cuba. And what claimed most of 
                        my men wasn’t the battle. It was 
                        the canned meat they ate.
                                 GAFNEY
                        Yes, I--

                                 WILEY
                        It is astounding how little we know 
                        about the effects of what we 
                        consume. For example, the saccharin 
                        you take actually makes the body 
                        resist its own impulses. Probably 
                        the cause of your dry skin.

           Gafney turns to Wiley in horror.

           Roosevelt turns purple with anger.

           He SLAMS a fist on the table. 

           The teeth rattle in their glass case.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        You say saccharin is a poison. Then 
                        either we shall lock up the White 
                        House doctor for sedition, or you, 
                        Wiley, are an idiot!

                                 GAFNEY
                        Mr. President, he misspoke.

                                 WILEY
                        I did not misspeak. Mr. President, 
                        some of the truths behind our 
                        chemicals are unpleasant. And I am 
                        not in the business of sugar 
                        coating them. You don’t have to 
                        like me, only what I’m here to do.

           Off Roosevelt, still stewing...

           INT. SUMNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sumner kneels, screwing a new leg onto his desk.

           The door opens. His secretary enters, letter in hand.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Sumner, we just received this 
                        from the House Chamber.

           Sumner plucks it from her. Flaps it open and reads.

           As his eyes trace, his face darkens.
                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Is it good news?

                                 SUMNER
                        The President just granted approval 
                        for the pure food study to move 
                        forward.

           The secretary looks searchingly from the letter to his face.

                                 SECRETARY
                        That sounds like good news. Is--? 
                        It’s not good news.

           Sumner stares ahead motionless.

           She shows herself out.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DEPT OF AGRICULTURE - DAY

           The door sneaks open and Wiley jostles through, past the 
           swarming press, and closes it behind.

           Gafney looks up from his paper -- ROOSEVELT: PURE FOOD STUDY 
           WILL CONTINUE.

           Gafney waits for Wiley to speak, but instead he just pulls an 
           orange from his coat pocket and begins to peel.

           Gafney drops his head.

                                 GAFNEY
                        Okay, Harvey.

           A smug grin. Wiley continues to peel.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how you did it, but, 
                        well...

           Orange peel drops to the floor.

                                 GAFNEY (CONT’D)
                        Is there actually a reason you’re 
                        in my office? 

           Wiley pops a slice into his mouth. Another insufferable grin, 
           and then--

           He turns back and exits, leaving the door wide, unleashing 
           another torrent of eager reporters.

           Gafney grabs his broomstick.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dressed in a nightgown, Georgia readies for bed.

           She moves to the window to draw the shade, but as she does 
           something catches her eye.

           Below, a SHADOWY FIGURE quietly slides open a first floor 
           window and pulls himself in.

           As he does, SHRIEKS ring out from inside the room.

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry! I’m sorry.

           The look from Georgia says it all.

           Monty tumbles back out the window. Dusts himself off and 
           walks along the building to the next window, directly 
           beneath. Once more, he climbs through.

           Georgia moves to her bed and sits.

           Moments later, from below, BANG... SMASH! And another SCREAM. 
           A CHAIR falls over... and another BANG.

           Georgia sighs to herself, walks to the door and unlocks it. 
           Sits back on her bed.

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS approaches the door, and then a shadow 
           blocks the light beneath it.

           Georgia waits.

           The doorknob’s screws begin to JOSTLE. This is a whole to-do.

                                 GEORGIA
                        It’s open.

           A pause. 

           The door quietly squeaks open, dramatically revealing Monty. 
           He steps in the room, shoes in hand.

                                 MONTY
                        You’re probably wondering why I’m 
                        here.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Not even a little.

                                 MONTY
                        You may have heard, there was a 
                        mole.
                                 GEORGIA
                        I know.

                                 MONTY
                        And you didn’t betray me.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I know.

                                 MONTY
                        This is the kind of thing you don’t 
                        come back from...

                                 GEORGIA
                        You don’t apologize much, do you?

                                 MONTY
                        Downside of being right all the 
                        time.

           She fights off a smile.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I was wrong. I went 
                        somewhere with you that I haven’t 
                        been in a long time. It’s a place 
                        that used to be hers. I didn’t mean 
                        to push you away... I’m just so 
                        used to protecting it. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        You don’t need to make room in your 
                        life for me.

           Off Monty’s confusion, she continues.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        When my mother passed away, I 
                        didn’t think I’d ever see the world 
                        the same way again. When I was 
                        little she would take me and my 
                        sister outside, and we’d look at 
                        the stars. And she would sing a 
                        song about the moon’s adventures. 
                        But then one evening after she 
                        passed, I looked up at the moon, 
                        and I heard her singing. And I 
                        realized she was still there. 
                        Because as long as her gifts 
                        remain, so does she.

           She moves to him, taking his hand in hers.
                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        Monty, your wife will always be 
                        there. Her gift is helping you to 
                        save the world.

           They embrace.

           EXT. 7TH STREET - MORNING

           Crisp morning. Wiley strolls down his morning route, his 
           bicycle at his side, passing bundled locals. The first of 
           winter.

           And then the sky opens. Snow begins to fall from above in a 
           thick blanket. Heads look up in wonder.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wiley wanders onto a side street. He holds out his hand and 
           watches the snow gather. Mesmerized.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dr. Wiley.

           The familiar Ozarks twang jars us from the moment.

           Wiley turns to the source, where a tree-sized man steps into 
           the alley. We’ve seen him before. It’s BJ’S BROTHER.

           Suddenly he doesn’t want to be Dr. Wiley.

                                 BJ’S BROTHER
                        You believe in God, Doc?

           He reaches a hand into his heavily patched tweed jacket and 
           begins to rummage.

                                 BJ’S BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        ...You believe in yourself?

           Wiley freezes as the brother steps closer.

           Removes a piece of paper and SLAPS it into Wiley’s chest.

                                 BJ’S BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        Church we’re taught to believe 
                        those two things are separate.

           Wiley uncrumples the paper: the Hygienic Table death waiver.
           As he goes to speak, a SECOND MAN steps in from the other 
           side of the alley: lanky limbs shoved into overalls; crooked 
           teeth peeking out from his lips.

                                 BJ’S BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        My brother signed his life over to 
                        you. Not to his family. Not to the 
                        Lord. To you.
                            (then)
                        What makes BJ’s life less valuable 
                        than yours?

           Second man takes a step forward. From his carpenter’s loop he 
           pulls a cudgel.

                                 WILEY
                        I would say this made his more 
                        valuable.

           He glances to the street as the men close in.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        He made a sacrifice. That’s 
                        something to be proud of.

                                 BJ’S BROTHER
                        When BJ was a boy, before he got 
                        sick, he usedta sneak his dinner 
                        into his pockets so the dogs didn’t 
                        go hungry. You don’t know the first 
                        thing about sacrifice. BJ was my 
                        pride. My question for you is... 
                        who the fuck are you?

           Just past the brother, Wiley spots a POLICE OFFICER crossing 
           the far side of the street.

                                 WILEY
                        I’m not God. But I’m as close as 
                        it’s gonna get.

           His words still in the air, Wiley moves to mount his bicycle. 
           But before his feet can find the pedals, large hands engulf 
           him and drag him to the ground. 

           The brother tosses the bicycle aside and proceeds to unload 
           on Wiley. A vicious punch to the face. A devastating crack to 
           the ribs.

           The second man hands over the cudgel. The brother holds it 
           high, ready to strike -- as a butcher’s wagon pulls up, 
           blocking our view.
           WORKERS unload beef quarters while underneath, the beating 
           continues. PUMMELS echo from the alley, while the movement of 
           the city continues unabated.

           Drops of blood stain the new snow as we harrowingly drift to 

                                                                 BLACK.

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

           As the morning sun rises, a NEWSBOY stands on the steps of 
           the Capitol Building, a newspaper held high in his hand.

                                 NEWSBOY
                        Extra! Hearings start today to 
                        decide your food’s fate! Read all 
                        about it!

           As SPECTATORS and MEMBERS for the press alike ascend past him 
           into the building, we 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

           In turns daunting and majestic. A spacious chamber with a 
           frescoed dome and chandelier, walls adorned with portraits of 
           former chairmen. The shaping of the nation happens here.

           CHYRON: HOUSE COMMITTEE HEARING, DAY ONE

           As the milling crowd filters to their seats in the gallery, 
           Wiley’s team of Gafney and Louis huddle at the witness table 
           with CONGRESSMAN DAVID FOSTER, 35.

           Foster moves in to shake Louis’ hand.

                                 FOSTER
                        David Foster. Great State of 
                        Massachusetts.

                                 LOUIS
                        It’s a pleasure to be working with 
                        you, Mr. Foster.

                                 FOSTER
                        This is common sense to me, boys. 
                        I’m close with my mother, and Lord 
                        knows she handles a shit ton of 
                        peas.

           They laugh.
           It’s cut short by Wiley, slinking by them to take his seat in 
           the gallery, his arm in a sling.

                                 WILEY
                        Gentlemen.

           Looks abound.

                                                              QUICK TO:

           A right hand raised.

                                 SUMNER (O.S.)
                        Do you solemnly swear that in the 
                        matter now pending before this 
                        committee that you will tell the 
                        truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
                        but the truth, so help you God?

           We move out to reveal Gafney. 

                                 GAFNEY
                        I do.

           Across from the witness table, at a long dais, Sumner is 
           seated center among his committee. 

                                 SUMNER
                        Thank you for joining us this 
                        morning, Mr. Gafney. Your purview 
                        is invaluable on an issue like 
                        this. How long have you been acting 
                        Secretary of the Department of 
                        Agriculture?

                                 GAFNEY
                        Nine years in March.

                                 SUMNER
                        And in this title, you oversee all 
                        matters pertaining to the Bureau of 
                        Chemistry?

                                 GAFNEY
                        I do.
                                 SUMNER
                        Clear as it might be, our 
                        particular point of interest 
                        pertains to the human trials known 
                        as the Hygienic Table, conducted by 
                        your Chief Chemist, Dr. Harvey

                        We tested twelve men of sound body 
                        and mind with the most common food 
                        additives used on the market today. 
                        We found, conclusively, these 
                        additives to have a deleterious 
                        effect on the health of the men.

                        As a subject, I’m not sure I can 
                        answer that. I’d assume it would 
                        involve the unenviable process of

                        It was widely reported in the press

                        I take it you have an intimate 
                        understanding of the additives that 
                        Mr. Gafney mentioned in yesterday’s 
                        testimony?

                                 KREMERS
                        I do. I find that there’s a 
                        fundamental misunderstanding when 
                        it comes to the nature and origins 
                        of the additives we’re dealing 
                        with.

                        I went picking this morning in the 
                        cranberry bushes just outside the 
                        Capitol. Cranberries are a natural 
                        staple of the human diet. Man has 
                        eaten them for centuries. What 
                        people aren’t aware of, however, is 
                        that cranberries naturally contain 
                        benzoate.

                                 SUMNER
                        Well, based on the testimony we 
                        heard yesterday, I would assume 
                        that would render cranberries 
                        poisonous to man.

                                 KREMERS
                        The key is in the amount. The 
                        proportion of benzoate in a single 
                        cranberry is the exact same as what 
                        is used to preserve food.

                        Are you a religious man, Doctor?

                        this amount is good enough for God 
                        then it damn well should be good 
                        enough for man?

                        This is irrelevant, strychnine is 
                        also found in plants, and I don’t 
                        believe anyone would advocate we 
                        eat strychnine. The point of this, 
                        Doctor, is whether or not these 
                        additives are harmful to humans.

                        not poison, but I am very good with 
                        numbers. Forty-three States dispute 
                        Dr. Wiley’s claim that these 
                        chemicals are harmful. And nine 
                        countries have opted against 
                        banning them.

                        market. Preservatives are a 
                        necessity to our business. If they 
                        were banned tomorrow, every food

                        Wiley on this stand, he could argue 
                        that every single ingredient in 
                        catsup is poisonous. The vinegar, 
                        the salt, heck, even the tomatoes. 
                        Lord knows, if I were to sit you 
                        down and pack your stomach full of 
                        tomatoes, you would probably get

                        nothing but the highest of praise 
                        for his commitment to pure food. 
                        But I think all of us manufacturers 
                        shudder at the thought of the whims 
                        of one man deciding food laws that 
                        would put us out of business.

                                 ALL CHAIRMEN
                        Hooey!

           GAVEL BANGS silence the house.

                                 SUMNER
                        I’m going to ask you to clarify 
                        that for this committee. You say 
                        that you have nothing but praise 
                        for Dr. Wiley, and yet you take 
                        exception to his defining a food 
                        law?

                                 HUTTON
                        I take exception to any one man 
                        doing so. I had a brother who died 
                        recently. All of his doctors had 
                        had a different diagnosis. And each 
                        one was positive his diagnosis was 
                        right. But it was just seven wrong 
                        men in a room. Dr. Wiley is as good 
                        a man as lives, as conscientious as 
                        anybody, but he may be wrong, and I 
                        believe he is wrong; and I think a 
                        business such as ours should not be 
                        legislated out of existence because 
                        there’s one wrong man in the room.

           The room erupts, and Wiley looks dazed. Losing color.

           Sumner does nothing to silence the room.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DEPT OF AGRICULTURE - EVENING

           The room is a hive of nervous panic. Gafney, Monty, and Louis 
           pace, but we sit with Wiley, statue-like in his chair.

                                 GAFNEY (O.S.)
                        What the hell happened in there?

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        They’re using parlor tricks!
                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        They’re reducing everything to 
                        trusting the word of...

                                 GAFNEY
                        Harvey. What are we going to do?

           Wiley doesn’t seem to flinch.

                                 WILEY
                        Nothing changes. Tomorrow I 
                        testify, as planned.

           His eyes trail down to his hand, where we see a worn pink 
           pamphlet with a familiar seal...

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

           CHYRON: DAY THREE

           Sumner sits at the dais with his committee, but something is 
           amiss. 

           ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN looks at his pocket watch.

                                 SUMNER
                        Where is everyone?

           Across from them, the room is completely empty. Not a soul, 
           not a sound. Except for...

           A faint COMMOTION from outside the chamber.

           Sumner and the others warily stand.

           INT. LOBBY - CAPITOL BUILDING

           Their footsteps ECHO hollow. The RUMBLE outside grows...

           Sumner cautiously grips the door and pulls it open to

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Absolute chaos.

           A physical chain of SUFFRAGETTES, arms linked, blockade the 
           entrance to the building. Their matching dresses and sashes 
           cement their solidarity.

           The crowd beyond them is whipped into frenzy.
           And at the front, Catherine belts out an address.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Today we take a stand together! 

           The crowd CHEERS.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        We are the silent victims. We’re 
                        stuffed into kitchens to handle 
                        food that’s dangerous. We have been 
                        stepped on and broken. But today we 
                        form something much stronger. A 
                        bond among souls. A duty to each 
                        other. What’s at stake is more than 
                        just the pureness of food. It’s the 
                        wellbeing of your mothers, your 
                        wives. Our women. Now who stands 
                        with me?

           The crowd CRIES OUT its support. Catherine rides the wave and 
           leads them in chant.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I need to be sure our women’s food 
                        is pure!

                                 CROWD
                        I NEED TO BE SURE OUR WOMEN’S FOOD 
                        IS PURE!

           As the chanting crescendoes, we scan the faces of those 
           congressman. Sumner turns to his cohorts, who are swept up in 
           the sheer force of the moment.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        I NEED TO BE SURE OUR WOMEN’S FOOD 
                        IS PURE!

           As GAVEL BANGS take us back to

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           The energy from the rally outside has morphed into breathless 
           suspense in here. The room is filled wall to wall with 
           people, souls squeezing in to get a glimpse of history.

           And before them, Wiley takes his seat at the witness table. 
           He delicately pulls off his sling.

           Sumner boils from the dais. Ready to strike.
                                 SUMNER
                        Dr. Wiley. 

           Wiley returns a firm nod.

                                 SUMNER (CONT’D)
                        Can you please state for the record 
                        your credentials pertaining to the 
                        field of chemistry?

                                 WILEY
                        I received my M.D. from Indiana. 
                        Studied chemistry at Harvard, and 
                        afterwards pursued analytical and 
                        professional studies in Europe, 
                        where my focus was pathology, 
                        pathological chemistry, and 
                        chemistry of foods. I am also a 
                        member of quite a few privileged 
                        societies in the scientific 
                        community. I’ve brought a list--

           Wiley produces a list. Sumner holds up a hand.

                                 SUMNER
                        --That will suffice, Doctor. You 
                        are deeply involved in the field of 
                        chemistry. So I’m sure you’re 
                        familiar with the case Dr. Kremers 
                        made yesterday about the 
                        naturalness of additives.

                                 WILEY
                        I don’t think I’d be sitting here 
                        before you today if I didn’t know 
                        where additives came from, 
                        Congressman.

                                 SUMNER
                        Well I am glad you are, because 
                        there is something unsettling I’d 
                        like you to explain to the 
                        committee. If benzoate, which is a 
                        chemical you have deemed poisonous, 
                        occurs naturally in everyday foods 
                        such as the cranberry, then what 
                        right do we have to forbid 
                        manufacturers from using it? Are 
                        you asking us to redefine God as 
                        The Great Poisoner?

           Sumner has invoked a fire. He leans forward in anticipation.
                                 WILEY
                        Well, I would like to think that he 
                        isn’t. But anyone who has ever 
                        stepped into a patch of poison ivy 
                        before knows, hell, it’s actually 
                        quite possible he might be.

           Laughs ripple through the crowd.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        To your point, however, it’s 
                        actually a misleading question. The 
                        benzoate the manufacturers use 
                        doesn’t come from a cranberry. It 
                        actually comes from the urine of 
                        cattle and horses boiled in 
                        hydrochloric acid. Now, personally, 
                        I wouldn’t want to redefine God as 
                        having a hand in that.

           A stomach punch. Sumner tries to get off the ropes...

                                 SUMNER
                        The point I’m trying to get to is 
                        that the legislation you’re 
                        proposing could be a disaster of 
                        apocalyptic proportions for 
                        manufacturers. You’re denying these 
                        companies from the very means of 
                        preserving their product.

                                 WILEY
                        If you take the manufacturers’ 
                        claims at face value, yes. But do 
                        you know that in many cases, 
                        canners add copper sulfate, a 
                        chemical that has been linked to 
                        brain damage, simply to make 
                        vegetables greener? This isn’t an 
                        issue of survival. This is an abuse 
                        of the American Way. 

           The gallery STIRS, restless. There’s blood in the water.

           Amidst the sea, Monty CLAPS.

           Sumner BANGS his gavel to bring the house back. 

                                 SUMNER
                        There will be order here!
                            (beat)
                        Now let’s say there is a modicum of 
                        poison needlessly being added to 
                        our foods.

                        We’ve heard story after story of 
                        leading scientists who disagree 
                        with your conclusions on what is 
                        safe to consume. There are 
                        obviously many ways to determine 
                        pure food standards for this 
                        country. So Dr. Wiley, why is it 
                        that a scientist who allowed his 
                        subject to die on his watch should 
                        be that one man?

                                 WILEY
                        Well I’m not.

           A smile emerges on Sumner’s face.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        If you can produce a man who has 
                        attempted to change the course of 
                        humanity without so much as an 
                        ounce on his conscience, I’d be 
                        happy to cede the floor.

           Wiley gestures around to a beguiled house.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        In my case I would expect 
                        disagreement from my peers. Because 
                        in my research, I am the only one 
                        who has gone so deep into the woods 
                        that I cannot see daylight. It’s 
                        not fair to expect anyone else to 
                        see me. 

           Sumner moves to interject, but Wiley is already closing the 
           door.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        But Congressman Sumner, I think 
                        what has been lost in this hearing, 
                        and what your constituents back in 
                        Georgia have a particular interest 
                        in, is the hidden implication at 
                        the bottom of this debate. In this 
                        country, our freedom is an accepted 
                        fact. But you and your colleagues 
                        will decide what we are entitled to 
                        with that freedom. Our entitlements 
                        are not stamped on our 
                        Constitution. We carve them out 
                        from sheer will; from the inherent 
                        knowledge that they need to exist. 
                        So you may see me as one man.

                        servant that has willed us to this 
                        moment. And that’s why I am certain 
                        I will see you at the next one.

           At this flourish, Wiley rises from his chair, turns and walks 
           through the gallery. 

           Sumner slumps, his fight gone.

           The crowd APPLAUDS as Wiley passes. Monty jumps into the 
           aisle and wraps his arms around him, tears in his eyes.

           Wiley continues through and out the back door.

                                                               FADE TO:

                        Pardon my phrasing but I do believe 
                        I can taste it now.

           At a table nearby, Foster and a number of CONGRESSMEN labor 
           over a draft of a bill titled ‘THE FEDERAL FOOD & DRUG 
           ACT/WILEY ACT’. The tedious process of bill writing.

                                 FOSTER
                        So we are in agreement on Wiley 
                        heading the oversight agency to 
                        uphold the new food regulations. 
                        Now we move to the matter of 
                        additives we have classified as 
                        inconclusive.

                                 CONGRESSMAN #1
                        We have to consider the 
                        manufacturers here. We have letters 
                        from over 200 companies that depend 
                        on them.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        These are all chemicals without 
                        definitive proof of harm?

                                 CONGRESSMAN #2
                        Potassium nitrate, sulfites, 
                        saccharin...
                                 ROOSEVELT
                        We can’t cripple manufacturers over 
                        chemicals for which we don’t have 
                        scientific certainty--

                                 FOSTER
                        The Federal Food & Drug Act is a 
                        starting point. We can set 
                        reasonable limits to ease practices 
                        in the right direction.

                                 WILEY
                        First of all--

           Wiley stands from his seat on the far side of the room.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        --it’s The Wiley Act. Secondly, 
                        your scientific certainty has been 
                        proven, by a man also named Wiley.

           He paces the room and lands alongside Foster.

                                 WILEY (CONT’D)
                        Thirdly, I don’t care to hear the 
                        words “starting point” again. This 
                        is a finish line, a culmination of 
                        decades of tireless effort. If 
                        you’d like to do things reasonably, 
                        I suggest you stand aside.

           Foster stammers, taken aback.

                                 FOSTER
                        Dr. Wiley, surely you--

           Roosevelt steps in, eyes on Wiley.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        I suggest you leave the politics to 
                        the politicians, Doctor.

                                 WILEY
                        And where would those politics be 
                        without me, Mr. President? One 
                        could wager you’d still be feeding 
                        poisoned meat to your soldiers. 
                        This is my law.

           Roosevelt seethes, spittle sniping through his teeth with 
           each sharp breath.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        It’s not a law until I sign it.
           The room is still. He’s burnt through his last allies...

           INT. HOUSE OFFICE - CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT

           A vacuous space, and in the dead of night, it’s hollow. 
           Desolate.

           Far in the back, hunched against the wall, we find Wiley.

           Unmoving. Beset. Uneasy.

           We’re back underwater.

           Pooling water thrusting, stressed CREAKING exploring 
           limits...

           And then the first sounds of CRACKING under pressure. Violent 
           splitting that gives way to a RUSH of water.

           The door beside him opens, jarring us from the deluge.

           Wiley tilts to the YOUNG PAGE framed in the doorway. Waiting.

                                 PAGE
                        It passed. 143 to 72.

           We expect a response, but instead Wiley remains in the 
           darkness. Still waiting.

                                 PAGE (CONT’D)
                        The “Federal Food & Drug Act”.

           The door closes.

           We TRACK IN on Wiley, alone again. Staring ahead stone-faced.

           Then he drops his head.

           And one by one, tears fall to the floor.

           Like drops of rain.

           The door slits open again, spilling a sliver of light back 
           onto him. 

           In the backlit opening, it’s Georgia. 

           She takes in his slumped frame, rethinks, and quietly steps 
           back out of the room, closing the door.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Georgia stands on the other side of the door a moment, then 
           puts away her pen and note pad.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I don’t think he’s ready for a 
                        statement yet.
                            (glance at watch)
                        I’ve got another hour before we go 
                        to press.

                                 MONTY
                        You’re reporting the biggest news 
                        in the country. So how are you 
                        going to open it?

                                 GEORGIA
                        I was thinking, “Superhumans saved 
                        our food today.” What do you think?

                                 MONTY
                        It’s colorful.

           She turns and playfully presses her forehead to his chest. He 
           puts an arm around her, fingertips landing on an impressive 
           bump.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Hey, congratulations.

           She kisses him, looks down at her belly.

                                 GEORGIA (CONT’D)
                        He never has to know what it was 
                        like.

                                 MONTY
                        I can’t think of a group of words 
                        that more vindicates the enduring 
                        of hell.

           She leans on his shoulder as they walk down the hallway.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Are you going to let me eat in the 
                        cafeteria now that the law passed? 
                        I haven’t eaten in forever.

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t ever lose that sense of 
                        forever.
           And as Monty opens the door for Georgia at the end of the 
           hall, we

           FADE TO BLACK.

           CHYRON: Between 1901 and 1906, dozens of men participated in 
           Harvey Wiley’s Poison Squad.

           Their sacrifices paved the way for a monumental shift in 
           regulating food in America.

           Through their efforts, the Pure Food & Drug Act was signed 
           into law on June 30, 1906. It created what is now known as 
           the FDA.

           After signing it into law, President Roosevelt sent pens to 
           the men who were influential in its passing. 

           Harvey Wiley was not one of them.
