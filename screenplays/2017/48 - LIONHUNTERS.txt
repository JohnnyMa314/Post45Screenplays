           EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

           Moonlight. A MULE DEER steps daintily through grass, 
           silhouetted by LOS ANGELES, shimmering like a mirage. Her 
           ears twitch. SOMETHING else out there in the grass. Tan 
           SHOULDERS and HAUNCHES moving like a shark through water. 
           A MOUNTAIN LION crouches, and prepares to--

           --A LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN MORNING FILLS THE WORLD. THE DEER 
           BOUNDS AWAY AND THE LION ROARS HIS ANGER AT THE SKY, HIS 
           ROAR SWALLOWED BY THE ROTORS OF THE LAPD BELL 206 JET 
           RANGER HOWLING OVERHEARD, TAKING US WITH IT OVER THE 
           HOLLYWOOD SIGN. JUST ABOVE THE TREES, a ROLLER COASTER 
           through THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS. Pastel CREDITS flying with 
           us to The Crusader’s Street Life as we bank over...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           Nothing like Christmas in LA. Colored lights around palm 
           trees. Blow-mold Santas. A fifty-foot cone of lights on 
           the Capitol Records Building. Bedazzled jean jackets and 
           big Bon Jovi hair. PROSTITUTES in Santa hats. Holdout 
           breakdance crews. Jheri curl. Parachute pants. 

                                     Los Angeles, 1987

           Our LAPD helicopter now HANDING US OFF to... A T-TOP 
           PONTIAC FIREBIRD TRANS AM roaring through Hollywood. 
           Behind the wheel is SAM BRADEN (27). Handsome. Fu-manchu. 
           Twenty years we’ll call that a mullet. 1987, they call it 
           a haircut. Tough as a rodeo cowboy. Urban swashbuckler. 
           Reagan’s in The White House. Gates is Chief. And Braden’s 
           got the best job in the world, LAPD UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS.

           EXT. THROUGH THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - CONTINUOUS

           Traveling up the long DRIVEWAY to a MANSION the size of 
           Rhode Island. Two HENCHMEN, matching PONYTAILS, pat 
           Braden down and UNZIP his DUFFLE. It’s packed with CASH.

           INT. HUGE SUNKEN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blue light ripples over every surface of the room, waves 
           refracted from the WALL of the million gallon SHARK TANK. 
           A FIGURE silhouetted by the tank, James Mason at the 
           window of the Nautilus in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GARZA
                        Everybody dies. But in our 
                        business, nobody sees it coming. 

           The FIGURE now turns to face us through waves of blue 
           light. DIOGENES GARZA (40): Ex-Guardia. Somoza’s CIA-
           trained death squad. Fled the Sandinistas. Coke dealer. 
           White linen jacket. Polyester shirt. Sans-a-belt pants. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        But if you knew it was coming, 
                        knew your death was inevitable, 
                        how would you prefer to die?

                                 BRADEN
                        Easy. Fucked to death by the 
                        Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.

                                 GARZA
                        Everybody says that. Say the 
                        cheerleaders weren’t an option.

                                 BRADEN
                        Bullet, I guess.

                                 GARZA
                        Exactly why I never shoot mine. A 
                        bullet is nothing. Polite. A 
                        parting gift, like the Family Feud 
                        Home Game. Thank you for playing.

           Braden’s eyes flick to Garza’s HENCHMEN (mullets, tuxedo 
           shirts, bolo ties and ASSAULT WEAPONS) around the room.

                                 GARZA (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me. The holidays can be 
                        such a stressful time. And I’ve 
                        just learned there’s a policeman 
                        inside my organization.

                                 BRADEN
                        And you want me to kill him, 
                        right? As a test of my loyalty. 
                        Make sure I’m not a cop. Pretty 
                        standard deal. Fine. Bring him in 
                        here. Let’s get it over with.

                                 GARZA
                        No, I don’t need you to kill him. 
                        I just need to look at your face 
                        when you watch this man die.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           And that’s when a MAN SINKS to the bottom of the SHARK 
           TANK, Detective BILL ‘GONZO’ GOMEZ (36) Braden’s partner 
           and mentor, *but we don’t know that yet. Gomez’s ANKLES 
           chained to a CINDER BLOCK. Sharks swooping through the 
           water. Bull sharks. Sand Tigers. Blues. And a monster 10-
           foot HAMMERHEAD. Garza and his henchman watching Braden 
           very closely. Braden’s eyes darting to his DUFFLE BAG. 

                                 GARZA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t go in the ocean anymore. 
                        Because of fucking Jaws. Never 
                        swam again after that movie. The 
                        fear of being eaten, that’s 
                        primal. Nothing else comes close.

           The sharks circling closer, becoming more agitated. Gomez 
           struggling at the center of the maelstrom, his hair and 
           clothes flowing in their current. Gomez’s eyes pleading.

                                 BRADEN
                        They say you got a better chance 
                        of being struck by lightning.

           Braden’s eyes flick to his duffle again. One of Garza’s 
           HENCHMEN catches it, walks over to search the bag, 
           clearing away the first layer of cash to-- BANG! The DYE 
           PACK inside the duffle EXPLODES, staggering him long 
           enough for Braden to use him as a HUMAN SHIELD as he 
           WRENCHES the man’s GUN ARM toward the TANK and BOOM!  

           The tank SHATTERS, the glass turning milky around the 
           bullet holes, SPRAYING water. Everyone in the office 
           watches the cracks SPREADING, joining each other, but the 
           glass still holds together for a pregnant moment... 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Then again...

           Garza turns to run as the glass EXPLODES outward and a 
           TIDAL WAVE CRASHES out into the room, toppling furniture, 
           knocking men over. All the LIGHTS short out, plunging the 
           room into darkness as the water sluices from the tank out 
           into Garza’s office. Men SCREAM and FIRE blindly into the 
           water and their MUZZLE FLASHES strobe the room, SHOWING 
           us dorsal FINS and crescent TAILS now slashing through 
           the water. Chaos. Water filling the room to chest level, 
           like a wave machine. Gomez is on higher ground and safe.

                                 GOMEZ
                                 (coughing)
                        What the hell took you so long?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 BRADEN
                        Hair doesn’t rat itself, you know.

           Braden sloshes through the water, looking for his DUFFLE. 
           He sees it just as a BULL SHARK makes a run at him. 
           Braden GRABS a floating CHAIR, holds it like a lion tamer 
           as the shark RAMS it, driving him back against the wall, 
           biting the chair to splinters as Braden pushes off the 
           wall, knifing through the water for his DUFFLE. He grabs 
           it and OPENS the SECRET COMPARTMENT, drawing out his 
           stainless steel Dan Wesson .357 SUPERMAG, LASER SCOPE 
           mounted on the vent-rib barrel, a snarling WOLF carved 
           into the revolver’s ivory grip, his RED LASER SIGHT 
           sweeping through the dark room as he searches for Garza 
           among the gliding monsters. Another SHARK CHARGES. BOOM! 
           Braden puts a hollow-point down its throat. The shark 
           rolls, twitches, his blood billows, drawing the others.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck is he?

                                 GOMEZ
                        I don’t know. I can’t see him.

           Braden slogs carefully through the water, his LASER SIGHT 
           sweeping the room. Suddenly, Garza SPRINGS from the water 
           like a crocodile, his DAGGER arcing down at Braden--

           --Braden just CATCHES Garza’s WRIST, trying to bring his 
           gun up, but Garza deflects the weapon as Braden FIRES. 
           Bullets fizzing through the water as Braden and Garza 
           struggle. The sharks drawn to the commotion. 

           A scythe-like caudal fin LASHES Braden’s back as the big 
           HAMMERHEAD passes right behind him. The dagger inches 
           from Braden’s throat, forcing him backward underwater, as 
           the HAMMERHEAD banks like a fighter jet, coming around to 
           CHARGE straight at him. Maw open, JAWS distending, white 
           TEETH jutting from red gums... 

           Underwater, all of Garza’s weight is behind the dagger 
           now, trying to push the blade those final inches into 
           Braden’s throat. And at the last moment, Braden uses 
           Garza’s weight against him and SUPLEXES Garza right into 
           the shark’s open mouth! The hammerhead passes right over 
           Braden, chomping away. Garza’s SCREAMS die in gurgling 
           red foam...

           Braden hauls himself out of the water next to Gomez.

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t think he saw that coming.
           I/E. HOLLYWOOD STATION (ESTABLISHING) - LATER TONIGHT

           FOLLOWING BRADEN and GOMEZ into the DETECTIVE’S BULLPEN, 
           past a Christmas Tree decorated with HANDCUFFS and 
           EVIDENCE TAGS. It’s chaos in here, with DETECTIVES trying 
           to interview VICTIMS and WITNESSES of every shade. These 
           COPS wear their hair long, just this side of regulation, 
           with thick sideburns. Marlboro moustaches. Cowboy boots. 
           A lot of brown suits, five years behind the fashion 
           curve. Everybody smokes. When they see Braden and Gomez, 
           the cops break into sarcastic APPLAUSE. Somebody puts a 
           ratty Santa Hat on Gomez as he walks past.

           INT. LIEUTENANT DONIGER’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Braden and Gomez sitting opposite LIEUTENANT WADE 
           DONIGER, who was probably born wearing a suit and tie. 
           Active in his church, scout leader. Decent guy. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Gomez, would you please take off 
                        the goddamned hat.

           Gomez slowly removes his Santa hat. Doniger looks pissed.

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        As is often the case with you two 
                        I don’t know whether to suspend 
                        you or write you a commendation.

                                 GOMEZ
                        You could always suspend him and 
                        write me the commendation.

                                 BRADEN
                        Commendation for what? Holding 
                        your breath? No gratitude. None.

                                 DONIGER
                        Shut the fuck up.

           Doniger pulls a bottle of Bushmills from his drawer, 
           pours a few fingers into three semi-clean coffee mugs.

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        Merry Christmas.

           They all raise their mugs, drink. Then Braden picks up 
           the PET ROCK on Doniger’s desk. Doniger looks at it. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Pet rock. One simple idea made 
                        that son of a bitch a millionaire. 
                        He owns a bar up in Los Gatos now.

                                 GOMEZ
                        Not a lot of millionaires on this 
                        side of the badge, LT.

                                 DONIGER
                        That’s why I got my security 
                        business going. We need extra 
                        bodies this time of year.

                                 BRADEN
                        I spend any more time away from 
                        home Karen’s gonna divorce me.

           INT. BRADEN’S HOUSE (SEAN’S ROOM)- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Braden opens the door, a wedge of light from the hallway 
           finds his son SEAN(5) in a molded plastic BATMOBILE bed. 
           A poster of Fernando Valenzuela. Masters of the Universe 
           figures and Hot Wheels on the floor. Sean doesn’t stir.

                                 BRADEN
                        You know I’m a trained 
                        investigator, right? 

           Sean smiles. Opens his eyes. He was faking it. 

                                 SEAN
                        Catch any bad guys today?

                                 BRADEN
                        What do you think?

           Sean beams up at his father, his idol.

                                 SEAN
                        Shoot any?

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m not saying another word 
                        without my league rep present.

           Braden tucks the comforter around Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        When I grow up and I’m a policeman 
                        I’ll shoot a lot of bad guys.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re hired.

                                 SEAN
                        Will I get to drive the police 
                        car?

                                 BRADEN
                        Sure. Why not? You’ll have to work 
                        that one out with your partner.

                                 SEAN
                        You’re going to be my partner.

           Braden kisses Sean’s forehead. 

                                 BRADEN
                        In that case, no way in hell I’m 
                        letting you drive.

           INT. BRADEN’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT

           Braden leans against the kitchen counter with a Miller

                        You promised to take him up there 
                        this year.

                        To Hertz?

           Karen gives him a withering look.

                        My next day off.

                        That’s what you said before your 
                        last day off.

                                 BRADEN
                        I will. I swear. Emblements are A. 
                        Real property, uh, frook-tus...

                                 KAREN
                        Fructus naturales. It’s Latin. 
                        Means fruits of the land. 
                        Agricultural. Produce. Wild game.

           Braden kisses her neck. His beard scratches.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of wild game. When the 
                        hell are going to get rid of that 
                        thing anyway? You’re scratching up 
                        my thighs.

                                 BRADEN
                        Really?

           INT. SHOWER - MINUTES LATER

           Karen and Braden face to face in a shower. 

                                 KAREN
                        Tilt your chin up, tough guy.

           She begins to shave him. Careful but sure.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking. Once I get my 
                        license, maybe you can transfer to 
                        one of the tables. Burglary?
                                 (Braden winces)
                        Stand still. Regular hours. Give 
                        you some more time with Sean. 

           He tries to cop a feel. She giggles, bats his hand away.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be waiting up for him before 
                        we know it. Ten years, he’s not 
                        going to want to be seen with us. 

           Braden takes this in.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re very persuasive when you’re 
                        naked. Okay. New deployment starts 
                        Monday. I wrap this one up I’ll 
                        put in for a transfer. 

           She sees he’s serious. She kisses him.

                                 KAREN
                        I love you.

           INT. BRADEN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Karen asleep on Braden’s chest. Braden lies awake, he 
           rolls over, slowly picks up the phone, dials...

                                 KAREN
                                 (rolling over)
                        Jesus Christ...

           Even before caller ID, Gomez knows it’s his partner.

                                 GOMEZ (V.O.)
                        Try warm milk.

                                 BRADEN
                                 (whispering)
                        So where’d Garza get X-ray vision 
                        all of a sudden, huh? 

                                 GOMEZ
                        Who cares? Witch is dead. Hail 
                        Dorothy. Now go back to bed. The 
                        rest of it can wait til tomorrow.

                                 BRADEN
                        But what if it can’t. They grabbed 
                        you from that stash house, right? 

           EXT. 7620 SIXTH STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Braden and Gomez in the Trans Am, across from a shabby 
           four-story APARTMENT BUILDING. Lots of movement inside. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        You’re gonna be the death of me.

                                 BRADEN
                        Looks like Union Station up there.

           CONTINUED:

                                 GOMEZ
                        So what? Garza’s dead. Somebody’s 
                        picking over what’s left of his 
                        shit. Happened to the mustache?

                                 BRADEN
                        I was given a choice. Shave or 
                        suffer a loss of consortium.

                                 GOMEZ
                        That’s not a choice.

                                 BRADEN
                        Exactly. Somebody burned us, 
                        brother. This is our last chance 
                        to find out who before these guys 
                        are in the wind.

                                 GOMEZ
                        Well, Lord hates a coward.

           INT. 7620 SIXTH STREET (4TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - SECONDS

           Braden and Gomez move quietly down the dark hallway, 
           stepping softly through pools of light and shadow. Gomez 
           reaches down to try the KNOB... Slowly... It’s locked. 

           INT. WE PASS THROUGH THE WALL INTO APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           To see the BARREL of a SPAS-12 COMBAT SHOTGUN held flush 
           against the door, pressed there by a man in a SKI MASK. 
           Gloved FINGER slowly takes up the slack on the TRIGGER...

           INT. PASSING BACK THROUGH INTO THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Braden and Gomez trade looks. They’ll have to boot the 
           door. Gomez silently mouths counting ONE...TWO...

           --BOOM! Double ought buckshot BLASTS a splintered HOLE 
           through the DOOR and Gomez just DISAPPEARS. Seemingly 
           teleported back across the hall. Thrown up against the 
           wall like a body ejected from a deadly collision. Dead. 

           Braden stumbles backward. FWUMP! FWUMP! FWUMP! The walls 
           seem to EXPLODE around him. Geysers of paint chips and 
           sheet rock. But there’s very little noise because the 
           first BLAST of that shotgun has stolen all the sound, 
           replacing it with a high-pitched TONE shock tinnitus. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Braden FIRES back. BRACK! BRACK! BRACK! His .357 SUPERMAG 
           ROARING. BRACK! BRACK! BRACK! That’s six. Asshole with 
           the SPAS-12 needs no help with his arithmetic. Soon as 
           Braden cracks off his last shot, the guy SPINS into the 
           hall and FIRES. BOOM! Hitting Braden DEAD-CENTER. The 
           BLAST floats him backward to smash through a WINDOW--

           I/E. WE FOLLOW BRADEN OUT THROUGH THE 4TH FLOOR WINDOW

           --FALLING with him. Braden’s ribs buckle as he folds 
           around the FIRE ESCAPE and slumps on to the platform. 
           Shirt blown apart, buckshot imbedded in his body armor. 
           Trying to draw breath into bruised lungs, reaching for 
           his SUPERMAG on the platform, pops the cylinder, empties 
           falling through the grate while he digs a SPEED LOADER 
           out of his pocket. Dropping six more into the cylinder, 
           snapping it closed with a wrist flick just as--

           --The SKI MASK FIRES again. Braden ducks with buckshot 
           fizzing past him like a swarm of bees, throwing SPARKS as 
           off the iron railing. Braden FIRES back. BRACK! BRACK! 
           BRACK! One of his ROUNDS actually punches a HOLE in the 
           RECEIVER of SKI MASK’S SPAS-12, rendering it useless. The 
           guy in the ski mask doesn’t hesitate. He DROPS the SPAS-
           12 and DRAWS a .357 REVOLVER, PRESSING THE TRIGGER FAST 
           AND SMOOTH, a pro. Bullet IMPACTS crawl up Braden’s vest 
           until the last bullet PUNCHES INTO HIS SKULL BELOW THE 
           HAIRLINE AT 950 FEET PER SECOND! Braden looks mildly 
           perplexed as he FALLS backward off the fire escape. 
           TUMBLING thirty feet through the air to--

           INT. THROUGH ROOF INTO THE LIQUOR MARKET - CONTINUOUS

           CRASH down through the water-damaged tar roof, landing in 
           a pile of torn tar paper and acoustic ceiling. Braden 
           CONVULSING, blood flowing from his head wound, spreading 
           slowly across the floor. Braden’s pupils DILATING all the 
           way BLACK as we PUSH in ON BRADEN’S SIGHTLESS LEFT EYE, 
           INTO... FATHOMLESS BLACK. The Kinks In a Foreign Land.

                                                            WE FADE IN ON:

           I/E. RANCHO LOS AMIGOS - DOWNEY, CALIFORNIA - DAY

           Mission-style buildings. Ramps. Anti-slip tape. Hand 
           rails. PEOPLE here move strangely. Many shuffle behind 
           walkers, though they are not elderly. Others giggle and 
           wander distractedly, though they are not children.

           INT. BROAD CENTER FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE (USC) - DAY

           DOCTOR CIARA HALL (40) Attractive. Neurosurgeon. 
           Stanford. Johns Hopkins. Research Fellow at the Keck 
           School (USC), inspecting COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES of 
           BRADEN’S BRAIN while she dictates into a recorder. 

                                 DR. HALL
                        Poor guy can tie his shoes. He 
                        just can’t remember his name.

           INT. DR. HALL’S OFFICE (BROAD CENTER - USC) - DAY

           Dr. Hall at her desk now, reviewing the PATIENT FILES of 
           her POSSIBLE CANDIDATES arrayed on the desk in front of 
           her, shoulder-gripping the PHONE, not particularly 
           interested in this conversation, wanting to cut it short.  

                                 DR. HALL
                        Because my funding is limited and 
                        frankly I think a younger 
                        candidate with a fresher injury 
                        might respond better to the 
                        treatment, so unless you can have 
                        some very compelling reason--

           --Dr. Hall suddenly listening intently. 

           INT. BROAD CENTER FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE (USC) - DAY

           Dr. Hall and her RESEARCH ASSISTANT watch a TECHNOLOGIST 
           slide Braden into a CT SCAN MACHINE. Braden’s eyelids 
           heavy with sedation. He has no idea what’s happening.

                                 (re: Braden’s chart)
                        This one’s older than the other 
                        candidates. Wow. He’s been gone a 
                        long time. Why him?

           INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

           DR. HALL using samples of Braden’s SKIN CELLS to create 
           Induced Pluripotent Stem (IPS) cells. Then using BLAST 
           (Biophotonic Laser-Assisted Surgery Tool) pulses to 
           transfer GENETIC CODE, creating new BRAIN CELLS. *All the 
           technology and its applications are real.

                        Because the project could benefit 
                        from a high-profile success story.

                        ...And apparently this guy’s a 
                        material witness to a homicide.

           HALL and her TEAM performing SURGERY on BRADEN. Crowded 
           around him. Our view obscured. Dr. Hall thumbs a SYRINGE, 
           sending new BRAIN CELLS into Braden’s damaged brain... 

           EXT. RANCHO LOS AMIGOS REHAB CENTER - WEEKS LATER

           Head-bandaged. Braden back to PACING. Hall watches him 
           sadly. Surgery was a failure. He’s still lost on a desert 
           island deep inside his head. He can’t even see the shore.

           INT. DORM (RANCHO LOS AMIGOS) - MONTHS LATER

           Braden in bed. Bandage gone. Hair grown back. PICTURES of 
           his WIFE and SON we last saw on the nightstand next to a 
           CHILD’S HOMEMADE GET WELL CARDS. Magic marker DRAWINGS of 
           a FATHER and SON walking hand in hand. But these drawings 
           have faded with age, yellowed, buckled and brittle. 
           Braden’s EYES flutter OPEN in the dark. And there’s 
           something in them that wasn’t there before. Braden looks 
           around as though seeing this place for the first time...

                                 DR. HALL (PRELAP)
                        What’s your name?

           DR. HALL standing next to Braden’s bed.

                                 BRADEN
                        ...Braden. ...Sam.

           He croaks the words. Like he has a mouthful of gravel.

                                 DR. HALL
                        Sam, can you tell me, what’s the 
                        last thing you remember?

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, somebody shot me.

                        You got a cigarette?

                                 DR. HALL
                        Uh, no. You can’t smoke in here.

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, sure, okay. Get the doc, 
                        willya?

                                 DR. HALL
                        I’m your doctor.

                                 BRADEN
                        Seriously? 

                                 DR. HALL
                        Seriously.

           Braden reaches up to feel the scar at his hairline...

                                 BRADEN
                        ...No sutures. 

           Hall carefully blanks her face.

                                 DR. HALL
                        Can you tell me what day it is?

                                 BRADEN
                        No, but so far it’s a shitty one. 

                                 DR. HALL
                        Who’s the President of the United 
                        States?

                                 BRADEN
                        Reagan.

           Still foggy, Braden reaches for his WEDDING PICTURE...

                        How long was I out?

                        I need to call my wife.

           That’s when he notices his wrinkled HANDS. Braden DROPS 
           the PHOTO on the bed, SHOVING past Dr. Hall-- 

                                 DR. HALL
                        Sam. Wait. Sam! Sam!

           Braden stumbling into other PATIENTS on his way into--

           INT. RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Motion-sensing LIGHT. Braden GRIPS the sink. In the 
           MIRROR, drenched in unforgiving fluorescent light, a FACE 
           he can’t recognize. Wrinkles around his eyes, corners of 
           his mouth. Flesh softer around his jaw. Grey stubble. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What the hell did you do to me?

                                 DR. HALL
                        It’s called neuronal replacement. 
                        I used your own stem cells to 
                        generate new neurons, transplanted 
                        them into your brain. And the 
                        damaged circuitry repaired itself.

           DIGITAL MELODY. SMARTPHONE on Hall’s belt [INCOMING CALL] 
           Hall taps [DECLINE]. He’s never seen a cellphone smaller 
           than a shoebox. Or a touch screen. And it’s like seeing 
           the Statue of Liberty up to her neck in the sand.  

                                 BRADEN
                        What year is it?

                                 DR. HALL
                        Twenty fourteen. You’ve been gone 
                        almost twenty seven years.

           Braden looks back at the face in the mirror. His face.

           LAPD CHOPPER banks through canyons of concrete and glass. 
           PILOT, TACTICAL FLIGHT OFFICER playing chauffeur to an 
           LAPD DETECTIVE: Detective-SERGEANT if we’re being formal, 
           and he’d prefer it if we were. Mid-thirties, young to 
           have attained the rank. But it suits him, like his grey 
           Brooks Brothers three-piece. EYES are like sea glass. 
           Cool, but not cold. Incisive, but not unkind. Borderline 
           ascetic. Bond without the vice. Atticus Finch with eleven 
           percent body fat. LA flying by, reflected in his tortoise 
           shell spectacles, as the chopper swings over... 

           EXT. UNION BANK (FIGUEROA) - SAME

           A STANDOFF. The BANK surrounded by LAPD BLACK & WHITES. 
           UNIFORMS at yellow tape, keeping PRESS and GAWKERS away. 
           Prone SWAT SNIPERS waiting for the word. SKIDS kiss the 
           pavement. Our DETECTIVE walking to the COMMAND POST and 
           DEPUTY CHIEF WADE DONIGER. The years have been good to 
           Doniger (50s). Fit. Distinguished. More politician than 
           cop. Still carries his old .357 REVOLVER with a 
           sandalwood grip, more ceremonial than practical.

                                 DONIGER
                        That was fast. Even for you.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Launchpad McQuack landed in the 
                        middle of my kid’s soccer game. 

                                 DONIGER
                        He must’ve loved that.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        He’ll treasure it always. My wife 
                        not so much. How many inside? 

                                 DONIGER
                        Twelve hostages. Four assholes 
                        with high-powered assault rifles.

           The detective removes his jacket, tie, Oxford shirt, down 
           to his white cotton T-shirt. He’s not one of those top-
           heavy gym rats you see in a patrol car. Think triathlete, 
           or boxer, strength and agility in equal proportion.

                                 DETECTIVE

                        Just the guard, poor guy probably 
                        saw too many Seagal movies.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        One is too many.

           He has the kind of pelagic self-containment that only 
           orphans and astronauts attain. And whatever molten and 
           dangerous things might dwell in him are guarded and deep.

                                 DONIGER
                        Rathborne says his snipers can 
                        probably take them.
                                 (dryly)
                        Without losing too many hostages.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        One is too many.

           DRAWS his GLOCK, removes the mag. Leaving the empty 
           weapon. He fits a flesh-colored earbud into his ear. 
           Doniger tries to hand the detective a KEVLAR VEST.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        I think that would send the wrong 
                        message, don’t you? 

                                 DONIGER
                        I could order you to wear it, son. 
                                 (off his look)
                        Every time I call you out to one 
                        of these I remember I promised her 
                        I’d look out for you and I can’t 
                        get you to wear a goddamned vest. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        It’d be useless at that range. 

                                 DONIGER
                        How close are you planning to get?

           INT. UNION BANK - SECONDS LATER

           The detective walks unarmed through the FRONT DOORS. 
           HOSTAGES huddled facedown on the floor. The detective 
           immediately clocks the SECURITY GUARD in a pool of blood, 
           shot in his leg. GUNMEN are CRIPS in way over their heads 
           here. Pointing new M249 LIGHT MACHINE GUNS and BELLOWING-- 

                            GUNMAN
                                                         GUNMAN
           On the floor!
                                              Get on the fucking floor!

           CONTINUED:

           He’s brushing right past the gunmen, heading straight for 
           the SECURITY GUARD. And no one makes any move to stop 
           him. The detective exudes what those in law enforcement 
           call Command Presence, which is another way of saying The 
           Force is Strong with him. Removing his belt, the 
           detective kneels beside the guard to cinch a tourniquet. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Hold it there. Keep it tight.

                                 JITTERY GUNMAN
                        The fuck are you, a doctor?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Right now, I’m the difference 
                        between five years with good 
                        behavior and a lethal injection. 
                        And I just bought you about ninety 
                        seconds to make up your mind 
                        before this guy bleeds out and 
                        you’re a slam-dunk death penalty 
                        for a DA who’s up for reelection.
                                 (noting his eyes)
                        Anyway, you’re not the one I 
                        should be talking to, are you? 
                        Your pupils look pretty blown, 
                        partner. Meth. Breakfast of 
                        champions, right? And I’m going to 
                        take a wild guess and say you’re 
                        the genius who shot the guard. 

           The jittery gunman throws a look to his SHOT CALLER: a 
           kid just dipping a toe into his twenties. Tattoos look 
           fresh. New to the game. Smart enough to put this 
           together, and dumb enough to actually try to pull it off. 
           He’s trying to mad-dog the detective, and failing... 

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you didn’t get the memo, but 
                        takeover bank robberies are like 
                        Blockbuster Video and the 
                        Republican Party. They don’t 
                        really exist anymore. Because you 
                        get caught. People rob banks with 
                        their laptops now. Safer that way.

           The shot caller raises his MACHINE GUN at the detective.

                                 SHOT CALLER
                        That’s close enough.

                        hell you’re doing, do you? You 
                        don’t lay your hostages down on 
                        the floor. You stand them up, so 
                        the SWAT snipers will have to 
                        shoot through them to get at you.

           They all shift uneasily, eyes on the windows.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t XBox, my man.

                        See how pale he is. Meter’s 
                        running. I’d say you’ve got about 
                        sixty seconds. 

           The scared kid showing through now.

                                 SHOT CALLER
                        Shit wasn’t supposed to go down 
                        like this. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        I know. But it did. And you can’t 
                        change it. What matters is what 
                        you do now. Right now. You can’t 
                        win this. We’re past that. But I 
                        can help you survive it. 

           The shot caller hesitates, sighs, squats down to place 
           his M249 MACHINE GUN on the floor. The others trade 
           resigned looks, do likewise. Fingers laced behind their 
           heads, assuming the position they all know by heart. 

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)

           SWAT OFFICERS rushing in. PARAMEDICS Treating the guard. 
           The detective inspects M249 MACHINE GUNS. In the army, 
           these are known as Squad Assault Weapons. Heavy shit.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)

                        Where the hell’d you get these? 

           The shot caller swallows dryly, shakes his head. Whoever 
           sold him those guns scares him a lot more than prison.

           The unloaded M249s on the FOLDING TABLE under the Command 
           Post’s portable shade, DONIGER and the DETECTIVE watch as 
           SGT. RATHBORNE from SWAT hefts one. *Rathborne is all 
           muscle, spit and polish, subtle as battering ram.

                        M29 LIGHT MACHINE GUN. I carried 
                        one in Panama. Belt-fed 5.56 mm 
                        rounds. Eight hundred rounds per 
                        minute. Adios muchachos. Good 
                        thing you talked them out of 
                        there. Would’ve been a shitshow if 
                        we’d tried to breach. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Well, better locked up in evidence 
                        than out on the street. Good work.

           But the DETECTIVE senses something’s not right here.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        They’re new. No scratches. You can 
                        still smell the factory lubricant. 
                        Probably never been fired. These 
                        were part of a larger shipment.

           Deputy Chief Doniger and Rathborne share a look of dread.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        We need to find out who’s bringing 
                        them in, how many more are out 
                        there, before some poor cop winds 
                        up on the wrong end of one. 

           -CHIRP- INCOMING CALL on the detective’s CELL...

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.
                                 (into phone)
                        Hello.

           He listens for a beat. His face CHANGES. At no time 
           during the ordeal in the bank did he lose his cool. But 
           whatever’s on the other end of this call rattles him.

           INT. RANCHO LOS AMIGOS (CORRIDOR) - 43 MINUTES LATER

           Our DETECTIVE now walking with DR. HALL. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR. HALL
                        He wants to find his family. I 
                        didn’t know what to tell him.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        No, you did the right thing.

           INT. DORM - CONTINUOUS

           The detective hovers, watching Braden carefully wrap his 
           framed pictures in newspaper, placing them in a plastic 
           bag. He holds Sean’s drawings. But can’t fold them. The 
           paper has become too brittle. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Sam. 

           Braden turns and looks this DETECTIVE over: To Braden he 
           looks more like a stock broker than a cop. Wearing some 
           kind of PISTOL Braden doesn’t recognize. *His Glock. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Where’s my wife?

           Braden waits for an answer. This isn’t easy to say. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        She’s dead, Sam. Ovarian Cancer. 
                        She died seventeen years ago. 

           In French literature people die of grief, and watching 
           Braden absorb this we can well believe it. Anguish racks 
           him. Burning through him the way fire guts an old house. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What about my son?

           The detective seems to weigh this question a moment. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Actually, I’m your son.

           Braden searches the detective’s face for some trace of 
           the boy in the race car bed. Twenty seven birthdays. 
           Teenage triumphs and tragedies. First love. Heartbreak. 
           His wedding. The birth of his kid. Braden missed it all. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Sean?
           EXT. RANCHO LOS AMIGOS REHAB (COURTYARD) - SAME

           Sean and Braden at a patio table. Strangers meeting for 
           the first time, with almost nothing to say to each other.

                                 SEAN
                        You’re lucky. They haven’t even 
                        started clinical trials yet. 

           Braden watches other brain-injured PATIENTS shuffle past. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, lucky... So what now?

                                 SEAN
                        Well, I guess now I was hoping 
                        you’d come home with me. Your 
                        grandson really wants to meet you. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Grandson... 

           I/E. ACROSS PARKING LOT - LATER

           Braden leaving here for the first time in twenty seven 
           years. The sun sinking as Sean leads Braden to his car. A 
           PRIUS. Braden reacts. It looks like a fucking golf cart.

           I/E. SEAN’S PRIUS - CONTINUOUS

           The Prius starts with the push of a button. Silent. The 
           GPS NAVIGATION boots up automatically, a FEMALE VOICE 
           asking them to ‘ENTER YOUR DESTINATION...’ Braden reacts.

                                 BRADEN
                        This your wife’s car?

           Sean shoots him a look as they pull away.

           INT. SEAN’S PRIUS (NORTH ON THE HARBOR FREEWAY) - LATER

           Braden takes in the ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS advertizing 
           FREE HIV TESTS and THE GAP in Spanish. Los Angeles has a 
           NEW SKYLINE. The STAPLES CENTER. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I want to see her.
           EXT. FOREST LAWN MEMORIAL PARK - SUNSET

           Spectacular sunset. Sean leads him through a sea of 
           headstones. Braden suddenly hesitant, like Scrooge afraid 
           to follow the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come those final 
           steps. Seeing Karen’s grave will make it real. 

                                 SEAN
                        I’ll be in the car.

           Sean heads back. Braden walks slowly, almost like he’s 
           underwater. And the traffic sounds fade to silence when 
           he’s close enough to read “KAREN BRADEN.” He drops to his 
           knees, palms pressing against the earth between them.

           I/E. SEAN’S HOUSE - 47 MINUTES LATER

           Braden’s still in shock as Sean opens his front door. His 
           wife LAURIE (30s) appears. Successful architect. Works 
           from a home so she can spend more time with their son. 
           Reminds Braden (and us) a lot of Karen. Seeing her 
           prodigal father-in-law, Laurie doesn’t hesitate. She 
           practically lunges at him, immediately wrapping Braden in 
           an unexpectedly warm HUG, something Sean couldn’t do. 

                                 LAURIE
                        This must be so...

                                 BRADEN
                        You have no idea.

                                 SEAN
                        Sam. My wife Laurie.

           Over Laurie’s shoulder he sees Sean’s son SAM (9).

                                 SAM
                        Hey.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey.

                                 SEAN
                        And this is Sam.

           Braden offers his hand. Sam hesitates. Then takes it.

                                 SAM
                        I’m your grandson.

                                 BRADEN
                        Looks that way.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAM
                        I made this for you. Welcome to 
                        the future. You can sleep in my 
                        bottom bunk if you want to.

           He hands Braden a comic strip in magic marker. Three 
           panels. Braden being SHOT through the HEAD by what 
           appears to be an ALIEN, blood SPURTING from the head 
           wound. Braden waking up in a hospital bed. And Braden and 
           Sam playing Xbox together. ‘WELCOME HOME, GRANDDAD.’

                                 BRADEN
                        Thanks... Dig the arterial spray.

                                 SAM
                        I copied from Black Ops II.

           Sean gets his first look at the card.

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, Sweet Jesus. Laurie.

                                 LAURIE
                        He worked on it all afternoon.

           INT. SAM’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden places the plastic bag containing his meager 
           belongings on the bottom bunk of Sam’s bunk bed. Sam has 
           electronics Braden’s never seen, a laptop, XBox, iPod.  

                                 SAM
                        I got this for my birthday.

           Sam shows Braden his IPAD. Braden has no idea. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I just turned nine.
                                 (less subtle)
                        My birthday was last week.

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh, well, happy birthday. Sorry, I 
                        would’ve gotten you something, but 
                        I didn’t know you existed until an 
                        hour ago and I seem to have left 
                        my wallet back in the 1980s. 
                                 (re: Sam’s iPad)
                        Hell is that thing anyway?

           Sam touches the IPad’s SCREEN to un-pause a YouTube of a 
           MAN violently VOMITING, played off by The Keyboard Cat.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        What a time to be alive.

           INT. KITCHEN - HOURS LATER

           Sean and Braden are alone in Sean’s kitchen. Sean packing 
           up the Chinese Food Boxes, starting the dishes. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Kid’s kinda weird. 

           Sean reacts. Braden looking at CHRISTMAS CARDS, SAM’S 
           ARTWORK, FAMILY PHOTOS stuck to the fridge.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You got a nice family, Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        They’re yours too.

                                 BRADEN
                        No. They’re not.

           Picking up a picture of Karen in a head scarf, looking so 
           pale you can almost see through her. Smiling. Beautiful.

                                 SEAN
                        She waited for you. Probably 
                        longer than she should have. 
                        Everyone told her to let you go. 
                        But she wouldn’t. Then she got 
                        sick. Never complained. Not once. 

           Braden alone with her a moment, then he looks at Sean.

                                 BRADEN
                        Who shot me?

           Sean puts down the dishes, turning to Braden...

           INT. SEAN’S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden watches Sean SLIDE a BANKER’S BOX off the closet 
           shelf. The sticker displaying the DIVISION OF RECORD 
           NUMBER and DATE of the incident. 12-21-87. Braden’s case.

                                 SEAN
                        It was buried in the cold case 
                        archives when I found it.
           INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Transcripts. Autopsy reports. Newspaper Articles. Reward 
           posters. CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of that apartment. Tossed. 
           Littered with BODIES. Gonzo dead in the hallway. The 
           blood-spattered liquor store floor where Braden landed. 

                                 SEAN
                        They had a task force up and 
                        running within twenty-four hours. 
                        And they hit it with everything 
                        they had for over a year. They 
                        offered a reward for information. 
                        They even set up a tip line, but 
                        they didn’t generate a single 
                        viable lead. No prints. Every 
                        bullet recovered, including the 
                        one they took out of your brain, 
                        all too deformed for ballistics. 

                                 BRADEN
                        And no witnesses.

                                 SEAN
                        Just you. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Ski mask. Six foot. One ninety.

                                 SEAN
                        We just cracked this wide open.

                                 BRADEN
                        What were you hoping for?

                                 SEAN
                        A lead.

           Braden reading progress reports...

                                 BRADEN
                        They were working from the theory 
                        we walked into a dope rip-off. 
                        This was a hit meant to look like 
                        one. This guy was a professional. 

                                 SEAN
                        And you know this how?

                                 BRADEN
                        Because he took me. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SEAN
                                 (skeptical)
                        Even if it’s true, doesn’t change 
                        anything. I’ve been on the job 
                        longer than you had when you went 
                        down. And I spent most of my 
                        career trying to find the bottom 
                        of it. There isn’t one. For you it 
                        happened last night. But it’s been 
                        twenty seven years. Whoever this 
                        guy is, by now he’s either in 
                        prison for another crime, or dead.

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s still out there somewhere. 

                                 SEAN
                        You want him to be.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m taking over the case.

                                 SEAN
                        You can’t.

           Braden reaches past Sean, gathering up the files.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Sam. You’re not a cop anymore. 

           That never occurred to Braden. He’s a civilian now. 

           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - THE NEXT DAY

           Braden walking toward the new LAPD HEADQUARTERS. 
           Contemporary. Ten stories. Glass. Stainless steel. Symbol 
           of openness, transparency. Fountains. Courtyard. To 
           Braden it looks futuristic. Federation Headquarters. 
           Sleek Caprice PPVs (Police Patrol Vehicles) come and go.

           INT. 10TH FLOOR MEZZANINE (BULLPEN) - MOMENTS LATER

           OFFICER TEAGUE (Doniger’s adjutant) leads Braden through 
           bright new bullpen. Braden can’t believe this is a cop 
           shop. It looks like a tech start-up, if Braden had any 
           fucking idea what a tech-start up is. Open floor plan. 
           Potted plants. Framed motivational posters. Teamwork. 
           Excellence. Ergonomic chairs. A few standing desks.
           INT. DEPUTY CHIEF DONIGER’S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Braden walks into DEPUTY CHIEF WADE DONIGER’S OFFICE and 
           finds Doniger at a TREADMILL DESK. Braden’s look says Oh, 
           you poor bastard. Look what they’ve done to you? Doniger 
           steps off the treadmill to wrap BRADEN in a bear hug. 
           Over Doniger’s shoulder, Braden sees awards commendations 
           covering the walls. But he still has his PET ROCK.  

                                 DONIGER
                        I can’t believe this. I can’t 
                        believe you’re standing here in my 
                        office. If this isn’t a God damned 
                        miracle I don’t know what one is.  

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t know what to call this. 
                        Karen’s dead. I don’t even know 
                        Sean anymore. Woke up in a clinic 
                        wearing this old man suit and I 
                        can’t seem to find the zipper.

                                 DONIGER
                        Yeah, me either. They tell me it’s 
                        stuck on there for good. 

           Braden picks up Doniger’s pet rock.

                                 BRADEN
                        Thought you’d be a millionaire by 
                        now. What happened to your 
                        security business?

                                 DONIGER
                        Gone the way of all flesh. Sold it 
                        off. Years ago. Wasn’t meant to 
                        be, I guess. I know this has to be 
                        a hell of an adjustment for you. 
                        Christ, I can’t imagine. Listen, 
                        there’s anything I can do...

                                 BRADEN
                        Reinstate me.

           Doniger chuckles, then realizes Braden isn’t joking.

                                 DONIGER
                        You’re serious.

                                 BRADEN
                        I was injured in the line of duty. 
                        I got better. I want my job back. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DONIGER
                        Well, sure, legally you’re 
                        eligible for reinstatement. But 
                        you’d have to be remediated 
                        through the academy. You’d never 
                        make it, Sam, not at your age. 

                                 BRADEN
                        This is all I know how to do. 

                                 DONIGER
                        But you don’t, Sam. I’m telling 
                        you, you don’t know how to do this 
                        anymore. Even if you make it 
                        through remediation without having 
                        a fucking stroke, which I doubt, 
                        they changed the rules on us, 
                        brother. This isn’t the LAPD you 
                        remember. Not for twenty years. 
                        Not since Rodney King.

                                 BRADEN
                        Who’s Rodney King?

           Doniger doesn’t know where to begin. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Jesus Christ... Look, most of the 
                        guys you knew, they pensioned out 
                        a long time ago. The few of us 
                        left, we’re just pushing paper 
                        around. Marking time. It’s a lame 
                        new world out there. They don’t 
                        want ass kickers any more. In 1987 
                        you were a hero. Today, they’d 
                        indict you for all that shit, man. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Let me ask you something, Wade. 
                        What would you do? You were me. 
                        Guy kills your partner, takes you 
                        away from your family, punts you 
                        into the Phantom Zone for thirty 
                        years. And he’s still out there. 

           Doniger sighs. Against his better judgment, pulls a 
           LETTER from his drawer. Hands Braden a RECOMMENDATION FOR 
           REINSTATEMENT, made out in Braden’s name, already signed 
           by Wade Doniger, Deputy Chief. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DONIGER
                        I had to at least try to talk you 
                        out of it. Just try not to have a 
                        fucking heart attack.

                                 BRADEN
                        No promises.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY (CHAVEZ RAVINE) - DAY

           Asphalt glimmers like mercury, LAPD RECRUITS seeming to 
           rise out of it as they crest the hill. Buzzcuts. Peak 
           condition. Running through heat that ripples like jet 
           exhaust. BRADEN running way behind. Sweat-drenched T-
           shirt clings to his body like a poultice. He staggers to 
           the SUMMIT. Overlooking a smog-sheathed SKYLINE he 
           doesn’t recognize anymore. He bends over, pukes...

           EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY - OVER SEVERAL DAYS

           PUSH UPS until his trembling arms give way. He flops face 
           down. LATER: RECRUITS on the PULL UP BARS, pumping up and 
           down like pistons. Braden struggles. His traitorous arms 
           shake. Sweaty fingers slip and he drops. LATER: RECRUITS 
           scaling walls, scrambling over cyclone fences. Braden 
           runs through tires with a RECRUIT named TALMADGE right on 
           his ass. Talmadge SHOVES him aside. Braden lying in the 
           mud, watching the other recruits blow through the tires. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY (PT FIELD) - DAY

           RAIN pounds the PT FIELD into a marsh of shoe-sucking 
           mud. RECRUITS soaked, SPARRING in the rain. BRADEN and 
           TALMADGE toe to toe, trading blows, but Braden can’t 
           match his youth and strength. Talmadge hooks an ARM 
           around Braden’s THROAT in a mata leon choke... 

                                 TALMADGE
                        Go home, old man. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Talmadge tightens his grip. Braden struggles, his eyes 
           flutter. He passes out. Talmadge leaves him in the mud.
           INT. FIREARMS ANALYSIS UNIT - LATER

           Sean watches Firearms Analyst OFFICER PAULA TORRES(30s) 
           disassemble one of the M249s from the bank on her 
           examination table, performing an autopsy on the gun. 

                                 TORRES
                        Well, you’re right. These are new. 
                        Direct from the factory new.

                                 SEAN
                        Where’s the factory?

                                 TORRES
                        South Carolina. These guns went to 
                        Afghanistan. Shipment reported 
                        destroyed in an IED attack. 

                                 SEAN
                        From South Carolina to Afghanistan 
                        to gangbangers in Los Angeles.

                                 TORRES
                        If I were more imaginative I might 
                        say it looks like you’ve stumbled 
                        on to a conspiracy here. But I’m a 
                        not very imaginative. Be careful.

                                 SEAN
                                 (turns to leave)
                        Thanks.

           A COPY of the LOS ANGELES TIMES on Torres’ desk, folded 
           open to the METRO section: a photo of BRADEN at the 
           ACADEMY and the headline: “A BLAST FROM THE PAST”

                                 TORRES
                        Think he’s going to make it?

                        Your dad. Think he’s got a chance? 
                        Or they just dicking him around?

                                 SEAN
                        I honestly don’t know.

           INT. SAM’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Braden now sitting on Sam’s bottom bunk with a bag of 
           FROZEN PEAS on both knees, drinking a bottle of 
           Budweiser, while Sam plays around on his iPad.

                        Granddad.

                                 BRADEN
                        No. I don’t want to see any more 
                        cat movies on your Etch-A-Sketch.

                                 SAM
                        You liked the grape stomping lady.

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, that one’s pretty good.

           Braden’s voice horse from getting choked out repeatedly. 

                                 SAM
                        What happened to your voice?

                                 BRADEN
                        Talmadge. 

                                 SAM
                        What’s Talmadge?

                                 BRADEN
                        Me about thirty years ago, which 
                        is another way of saying he’s an 
                        asshole. And he’s been kicking the 
                        shit out of me all week.

           Braden dumps some Advil into his hand and washes it down 
           with a swig of Budweiser, draining half the bottle.

                                 SAM
                        My dad doesn’t drink beer.

                                 BRADEN

                        What’s it taste like?

                                 BRADEN
                        Dodger Stadium. Hermosa beach. 
                        Backseat of a Camaro. Your dad 
                        owes his very existence to it in 
                        fact, so I guess you do too.

                                 SAM
                        Can I have a sip?

                                 BRADEN
                        When you’re fourteen.

                        Hey, Granddad. Maybe Dad could 
                        help you with Talmadge. He knows a 
                        lot about fighting. He used to--

           Laurie enters, snatching Braden’s beer.

                                 LAURIE
                        Uh, Karma Chameleon? My nine-year-
                        old’s room is a dry county. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Right. Sorry. 

           Laurie lifts the bottle to her lips and kills the beer.

                                 LAURIE
                        I’ll let you off with a warning 
                        this time.

           Teasing him. Braden smiles without any conviction. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Night, kid.

                                 SAM
                        Goodnight, Granddad. 

           Braden walks out. Laurie watches him go, concerned.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE ACADEMY (COMBAT RANGE) - DAY

           Pneumatic hiss. SILHOUETTE TARGETS swivel to FACE us. 
           RECRUITS DRAW city-issued GLOCKS. Braden DRAWS and FIRES, 
           unaccustomed to the Glock. BAM! BAM! --BOOM! Gomez blown 
           back across the hallway -- Braden misses the cardboard 
           altogether, KICKS up SAND behind it. Awful. Talmadge 
           SMIRKS. Braden holsters up, feeling old, useless.

           INT. SEAN AND LAURIE’S ATTIC - THAT NIGHT

           Sean and Laurie duck-walking with flashlights, spelunking 
           in their attic for the box of Christmas decorations.  

                                 LAURIE
                        I think the decorations are behind 
                        all the camping stuff.

           Sean stops. Wait a minute...

                        You want to get him killed? 
                        Because that’s what’ll happen. 
                        Sure as you’re standing there.

                                 LAURIE
                        That’s not up to you. He’s a grown 
                        man. And it belongs to him.

           Laurie pushes aside camping stuff, opens a cardboard box 
           to reveal a TEAK BOX.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        You promised her.

           Sean looks at his wife, at the box, torn...

           INT. SEAN AND LAURIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Braden’s on the couch in front of the TELEVISION, 
           watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians. He has a black 
           eye, a gift from Talmadge. Braden’s city-issued GLOCK 
           broken down, its components arrayed on a cheesecloth on 
           the coffee table in front of him while he cleans the 
           weapon. Sean enters, carrying the TEAK BOX.

                                 SEAN
                        What’re you watching?

           Braden wiping down the components.

                                 BRADEN
                        I thought it was an Iranian 
                        sitcom. Now I’m not sure. But one 
                        of ‘ems got an ass like a forty 
                        dollar cow. I haven’t figured out 
                        how this old lesbian fits in.  

                                 SEAN
                        Bruce Jenner?

           Braden squints at the TV...

                                 BRADEN
                        Jesus Fucking Christ. What 
                        happened to his face?

                                 SEAN
                                 (re: his black eye)
                        What happened to yours?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m not gonna make it. I’m not 
                        gonna pass remediation.

           Braden’s begins to reassemble the weapon. He tries to fit 
           the recoil spring back into the slide, fumbles it. Fuck.

                                 SEAN
                        Glock takes some getting used to. 

           Sean takes over, reassembling Braden’s weapon for him.

                                 BRADEN
                        All that new lightweight polymer. 
                        Feels like you’re holding a toy. 

                                 SEAN
                        Maybe this’ll help.

           Sean slides Braden the TEAK BOX from the attic. Braden 
           lifts the lid. INSIDE: Braden’s old .357 SUPERMAG. LASER 
           SCOPE! Snarling WOLF carved into the ivory grip. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        It was your duty weapon. So, 
                        technically, you’re still 
                        permitted to carry it.

           Braden grips his old friend, feeling the heft...

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Mom made me promise to hang on to 
                        it. She said you were going to 
                        want it back someday. 

           He smiles. Like Karen just wrapped her arms around him.

           EXT. POLICE ACADEMY (HOGAN’S ALLEY) - NEXT DAY

           Braden draws his .357 SUPERMAG, FIRES one-handed. BOOM! 
           LOUD. Coughing SMOKE like the tailpipe of a muscle car. 
           BLASTING killshots in every TARGET. RECRUITS turn and 
           stare. BOOM! BOOM! Braden’s getting his MOJO back. 

           EXT. POLICE ACADEMY (OBSTACLE COURSE) - DAY

           Braden dashes through the obstacle course. Faster now. 
           INT. ACADEMY GYM - DAY

           Talmadge and Braden GRAPPLING on the mat while their 
           classmates cheer them on. Talmadge CHARGES Braden. Braden 
           pivots into a kubi nage throw. Talmadge tumbles, 
           recovers, TACKLES Braden, both men CRASHING into folding 
           chairs, scattering recruits. Talmadge rains PUNCHES down 
           on him, until Braden whips his head sideways and Talmadge 
           MISSES and PUNCHES the FLOOR. ARRGH! Braden HOOKS his LEG 
           around Talmadge’s NECK: Triangle choke. Talmadge TAPS 
           OUT! Braden PULLS Talmadge to his feet, CLAPS him on the 
           back. Talmadge nods, respectfully. 

           EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - SUNDOWN

           RECRUITS running that same hill. But Braden’s keeping up 
           with the pack now, leaner, stronger, more distilled 
           somehow. Braden pauses at the summit, enjoying the 
           SKYLINE lighting up against the sky. He digs a pack of 
           MARLBORO REDS out if his sweatpants, taps out a coffin 
           nail and lights up. Figures he’s earned it.

           INT. SALVATION ARMY THRIFT STORE - DAY

           Braden walking the aisles with purpose, pulling a dozen 
           VINTAGE SHIRTS off racks. An armful of faded WRANGLERS 
           and a LEATHER JACKET. Braden brings his haul to the 
           REGISTER, winks at the CHECKOUT GIRL (20s) beaming up at 
           Braden with undisguised lust. Then Braden notices the 
           pair of DINGO COWBOY BOOTS on the shelf behind her. 

           INT. LAPD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY

           Those COWBOY BOOTS walking through the lobby, past 
           plainclothes and uniformed COPS. Corporate, young, fit, 
           diverse. A few recognize Braden, murmuring as he walks 
           past. SEAN sees BRADEN swaggering across the lobby. Oh 
           Christ... Braden looks like a fugitive from a ‘80s theme 
           party. Wranglers. Loud shirt. Leather jacket. Ray-Bans. 
           He notices Braden’s NINJA BELT BUCKLE, which has a 
           SHURIKEN clipped to it. 

                                 SEAN
                        What the fuck is that?

                                 BRADEN
                        Ninja star. Bitchin, huh? 

           Sean doesn’t know how to answer that.

                        Come on. Doniger wants us to 
                        report to the academy.

                                 BRADEN
                        But I just got out of there.

           EXT. LA POLICE ACADEMY (TACTICAL VILLAGE) - MINUTES LATER

           A simulated CITY STREET for live-fire and practical 
           training, and weapons testing. Bullet-riddled VEHICLES on 
           the street painted and re-painted primary colors. Engines 
           removed. Forty MANNEQUINS playing civilians in harms way. 
           A few even have Baby DOLLS in backpacks and strollers.

           EXT. BLEACHERS - SAME

           BRADEN and SEAN take their SEATS next to DONIGER on 
           raised aluminum BLEACHERS overlooking the village. Packed 
           with DIGNITARIES from LA government. The MAYOR, CITY 
           ATTORNEY, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, CITY COUNCILMEN, LAPD 
           Command Staff, including the CHIEF, DEPUTY CHIEFS, 
           MEMBERS of the POLICE COMMISSION and the NEWS MEDIA.

                        Sorry to drag you out to this dog 
                        and pony show, but I’m supposed to

                        committee for whatever the fuck

                        1992: Rodney King Riots, what 
                        you’ve delicately renamed ‘civil 
                        unrest’, left fifty-two dead. 
                        Seven hundred million in damage. 
                        There are currently seventy 
                        thousand registered gangmembers in 
                        LA and nine thousand cops. At its 
                        current strength, the LAPD simply 
                        lacks the manpower to withstand 
                        another armed uprising. 

                                 CHIEF
                        And your solution, if I understand 
                        correctly, is to supplant our 
                        officers with your private 
                        contractors? 

                                 KREUTER
                        Not to supplant, to supplement, to 
                        provide additional security for 
                        your officers. Similar to the role 
                        we played in Afghanistan. 

                                 MAYOR
                        LA has a crime problem, Mr. 
                        Kreuter. We’re not Kandahar.

                                 KREUTER
                        Not yet. But Mara Salvatrucha, 
                        Crips and Bloods, The Aryan 
                        Brotherhood? You’re staring down 
                        the barrel of an insurgency. I’ve 
                        been there. And you’re going to 
                        need all the help you can get. I 
                        want to put a rapid-reaction force 
                        multiplier at your disposal. 
                        You’re in control. You decide 
                        whether and when to deploy us. Let 
                        me show you what I mean.

           IN THE CENTER OF THE VILLAGE: A disabled LAPD BLACK & 
           WHITE, realistic black smoke curling up from the engine - 
           nice touch. Two OFFICERS pinned down behind their Black & 
           White, uniforms bloody, calling for help on their radio.  
           Our cops left out here to die at the hands of ‘STREET 
           TERRORISTS’ firing ‘SIMUNITION’ ROUNDS. Non-lethal 
           training cartridges, but they mark targets with SPLOTCHES 
           of fluorescent PAINT and it’s not hard to imagine blood.

                        terrorists for this demonstration.

                        And of course we’ve asked them to 
                        pull no punches when they engage.

           ARMORED BLACK SUVS screech around the corner, peeling off 
           to block intersections. Kreuter’s SECURITY SPECIALISTS 
           deploy silent and swift. Black fatigues, sectional body 
           armor. Full face HELMETS giving them a mantid appearance. 

           The ‘FIREFIGHT’ is over quickly. Even with the home field 
           advantage, the SWAT guys never stood a chance against 
           battle-hardened high-tech mercenaries. Impressive. But 
           Kreuter has saved his best trick for last. As Kreuter’s 
           men move in, loading wounded officers on to MedEVAC 
           stretchers, they come UNDER FIRE AGAIN! This time from a 
           SNIPER on the ROOF of the BANK BUILDING down the block.

                        one too easy on my boys. Now, in a 
                        riot situation, your air support 
                        is grounded. Too dangerous to fly. 
                        Leaves your rank and file blind, 
                        vulnerable to ambush. Here at 
                        Sentinel we have a solution. 

           It seems to FLOAT up over the back of the bleachers, 
           giving us a view of its belly, bristling with armaments 
           and scanning equipment, it swings around over the street.

                        Gentlemen, meet my friend GABRIEL.

           GABRIEL is a Bell 918 ‘EAGLE EYE’ - a tiltrotor unmanned 
           aerial vehicle capable of flying like a fixed wing or 
           hovering like a helicopter. *Currently employed by the 
           Coast Guard and Homeland Security. Just eighteen feet 
           long, the Eagle Eye appears (no bullshit) to have been 
           patterned after the Hunter Killers from Terminator.

                        Gabriel comes equipped with a 360-
                        degree sensor field, electro-optic 
                        and infrared, parabolic mics.

           GABRIEL takes only seconds to locate the sniper, drops 
           below his field of vision and rises into view BEHIND him.

           The MINIGUN on the nose of the DRONE FIRES a brief BURST, 
           BRRRRR! putting about sixty PAINT splotches across the 
           sniper’s back in seconds. Braden notices Kreuter’s TECH, 
           JANEWAY has a shock-proof case open on the table in front 
           of him, controlling the drone with a JOYSTICK.

           Braden’s IMAGE suddenly APPEARS on TVs surrounding the 
           crowd. Clear VIDEO of Braden saying: It’s just a big 
           fucking toy. Like the drone overheard. Sean reacts. 
           Nervous laughter from the crowd. Kreuter smiles.

                                 KREUTER
                        I see today we are graced with the 
                        presence of a media favorite, Det. 
                        Sam Braden, the noble savage. 
                        Welcome to the future, Detective. 

           Polite laughter. Scattered applause.

                                 KREUTER (CONT’D)
                        You sound skeptical, Detective. 
                        But I suppose that’s 
                        understandable given your history. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Just old fashioned, I guess. I 
                        just don’t think a flying robot is 
                        any substitute for gut instinct.

                                 KREUTER
                        I see. Perhaps you’d like to 
                        attempt to evade Gabriel?

           An anticipatory hush falls over the crowd...

                             SEAN
                                                         BRADEN
                    (sotto to Braden)
                                              Sure. Why not?
           Don’t do this. 
           EXT. TACTICAL VILLAGE (MAIN STREET) - MINUTES LATER

           Braden stands alone in the middle of the street, calmly 
           feeding SIMUNITION ROUNDS into the cylinder of his 
           SUPERMAG. Flicks the cylinder shut. Lights a smoke. UP IN 
           THE STANDS, Doniger and Sean watch with dismay.

                                 DONIGER
                        Your father led the city every 
                        year in felony arrests. And 
                        shootings. And excessive force 
                        complaints. He was uncooperative, 
                        insubordinate, brutal, borderline 
                        racist. He was also the best cop 
                        I’d ever seen. No one came close. 

           Every Cell phone camera in the crowd is on Braden, but 
           Braden looks casual, almost bored. 

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        Nobody expected him to make it 
                        through remediation. Now they have 
                        to let him back out on the street.

                                 SEAN
                        Look at him. He doesn’t know what 
                        he’s up against. He doesn’t 
                        understand cell phone cameras or 
                        viral videos or why you can’t give 
                        a female coworker a high five on 
                        her ass. He’ll be dead or under 
                        indictment in a week.

                                 DONIGER
                        Well, I’m not sending him out 
                        there alone.

           Sean throws Doniger a stricken look. 

                                 SEAN
                        Oh shit.

           GABRIEL floats around the corner, HOVERING at the other 
           end of the street, less than ten feet off the ground. 

                                 BRADEN
                                 (to Kreuter)
                        What are the rules?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KREUTER
                        Tell you what, Detective. You go 
                        thirty seconds without being 
                        marked by Gabriel, we’ll call that 
                        a successful evasion.

                                 BRADEN
                        Sounds fair.

                                 KREUTER
                        It isn’t. So I’ve going to give 
                        you a ten second head start.

           PROPELLERS sending dust and debris (an errant tumbleweed) 
           across the street as GABRIEL moves closer, until the 
           DRONE is HOVERING right in front of Braden. Like two 
           gunfighters facing off in the street. Man versus MACHINE. 
           Sean’s stomach sinking as Doniger lays it out for him.

                        DONIGER
                                                        KREUTER
                                              Ten seconds, Detective...
           You’re the one person on 
           the department he might 
           actually listen to. 
           Braden’s in the spotlight 
           and the Chief feels it’s an 
           excellent PR opportunity.

                             SEAN
                                                        KREUTER
           Out of the question.
                                              Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

           Braden doesn’t move, just stands there, facing the drone.

                                                        KREUTER
                                              Five. Four. Three. Two... 
                        DONIGER
           You misunderstand me, son. 
           I’m not asking you to 
           babysit your father. I’m 
           ordering you to partner 
           with him.

           Without taking his eyes off GABRIEL, Braden EXTENDS his 
           ARM out from his shoulder, pointing his SUPERMAG not at 
           GABRIEL, but at JANEWAY sitting on the dais! Braden 
           FIRES. BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM! Every stinging simunition ROUND 
           impacting Janeway’s FACE...

                                 JANEWAY
                        Fuck!

           Janeway RAISES his HANDS to protect his face, LETTING GO 
           of the controls. And GABRIEL DROPS to earth like a PIANO 
           pushed out a window. CLANG! Not permanently damaged, but 
           impacting street hard enough to rattle servos. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The drone BUZZES like a bee in a swimming pool, unable to 
           fly as Braden returns to his seat amid CHEERS and 
           APPLAUSE. Sean can’t believe it. John Henry beat the 
           locomotive. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden and Sean walking through the parking garage.

                                 BRADEN
                        Looks like we’re gonna be partners 
                        after all, huh?

                                 SEAN
                        Well, we’re going to be working 
                        together anyway.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ll drive.

                                 SEAN
                        You’re joking, right?

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m your father.

                                 SEAN
                        And I outrank you. You’re lucky 
                        I’m letting you ride up front.

           I/E. UNMARKED CAPRICE (STREETS OF LA) - MOMENTS LATER

           We’re riding with Sean and Braden in a sleek CHEVY 
           CAPRICE. Sean behind the wheel. Braden checking out the 
           onboard computer with FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) and 
           ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition).

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s the goddamned Batmobile. My 
                        seat doesn’t eject, does it?

                                 SEAN
                        Not if you behave yourself.

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, I remember you used to love 
                        Batman. You had the bed and those, 
                        hell were they called? Underoos.

                                 SEAN
                        I was six. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Braden searching the center console, glove compartment.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        What’re you looking for? I was 
                        kidding about the ejection seat.

                                 BRADEN
                        Wakeup juice. Your flask, dummy. 
                        Coffee could use some Irish in it.

                                 SEAN
                        Are you kidding? This isn’t New 
                        York. You can’t drink on duty.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m not talking about drinking, 
                        I’m just talking about a little 
                        eye-opener... Forget it.

           Braden taking in our brave new world. Smart Cars. Can-Am 
           Spyders. Segways. Starbucks on every corner with a dozen 
           laptops open in the windows. Everyone is texting. Even 
           DRIVERS. A HOMELESS GUY talking on a cell phone. Dogs 
           sitting right next to their owners at bistro tables. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Used to have a saying on the job, 
                        you get three great loves in your 
                        lifetime. Two great dogs, if 
                        you’re lucky, but only one great 
                        partner. 

                                 SEAN
                        Gomez was yours. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, but that’s not why I bring 
                        it up. I had this German Shepherd 
                        when I was a kid. Great dog. Until 
                        my mom took him to get neutered. 
                        He was never the same after that. 
                        That’s what this reminds me of, I 
                        mean it looks like LA, but it’s 
                        not. Somebody cut off its balls.

           Braden taps out a Marlboro and lights up.

                                 SEAN
                        Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SEAN
                        You can’t smoke in here.

           Braden looks at Sean incredulously. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh for Christ’s sake.

           Before Sean can stop him, he FLICKS the CIGARETTE out the 
           window, in front of a group of SCHOOL KIDS. Ten minutes 
           in the car with his father and Sean’s ready to shoot him.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Where we headed?

                                 SEAN
                        Day you woke up, couple of Crips 
                        tried to take down a bank. It went 
                        sideways on them, ended up in a 
                        standoff. Doniger brought me in to 
                        talk some surrender into them. 
                        They were packing brand new Light 
                        Machine Guns, Government Issue. 

                                 BRADEN
                        They say where they got it?

           Sean shakes his head.

                                 SEAN
                        But I know the guy who used to be 
                        their shot-caller down there. I 
                        think Xavier might talk to us.

                                 BRADEN
                        He might talk to us? What is he 
                        the Wizard of Oz? I don’t get it. 
                        In my day, they either talked to 
                        us or they talked to us. 

                                 SEAN
                        Right, in your day all you needed 
                        was a locked room and a phone book 
                        to beat confessions out of people.

                                 BRADEN
                        No. Sometimes we used to 
                        pillowcase full of oranges.
           EXT. PULLING UP TO 9200 SUNSET BLVD - LATER

           Braden sullen and brooding as Sean pulls the car up to 
           the front of a 9200 SUNSET BLVD, a gleaming 14-STORY 
           BUILDING on the Sunset Strip. Braden looks confused. 

                                 SEAN
                        There’s a supper club on the top. 
                        I’m meeting him there for lunch.

                                 BRADEN
                        The gangster.

                                 SEAN
                        Former gangster. He’s an actor. 

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s an actor. 

                                 SEAN
                        He was nominated for an Oscar. 

                                 BRADEN
                        And they know he’s a gangster?

                                 SEAN
                        He kind of wears it on his sleeve. 
                        Makes him more authentic I guess.

           EXT. SOHO HOUSE (ROOF GARDEN) - MOMENTS LATER

           A terrace garden dining area buzzing because XAVIER DIXON 
           is sitting at a two-top. Sean and Braden can find him 
           just by watching PATRONS subtly turning to sneak a peak. 
           Other not so subtle, craning their necks. That him? 

           XAVIER DIXON(40s): former CRIP shot-caller, Oscar-
           Nominated actor. Bespoke suit. Shaved head. Charismatic. 
           He might be a corporate lawyer or a financial advisor, 
           but for the full-size TATTOO, a perfect copy of his own 
           face on the back of his shaved head, like a Janus (so he 
           literally has eyes in the back of his head). The effect 
           of the tattoo is eerie. Two WOMEN dressed for the wrong 
           kind of attention at his table, trying to chat him up. 

                                 SEAN
                        Sorry I’m late.

           The women quickly steered away by ALLEN, Xavier’s 
           colossal BODYGUARD.

                                 XAVIER
                                 (re: girls)
                        Pharaoh suffered locusts.

                                 SEAN
                        Xavier. This is my... colleague.

           Xavier looks sheepish, maybe even a little star struck.

                                 XAVIER
                        We’ve actually met.

                                 BRADEN
                        We have?

                                 XAVIER
                        I was sixteen. In a stolen ride. 
                        Scared to death. We used to call 
                        you The Big Bad Wolf, said Braden 
                        could sniff you out of a perimeter 
                        faster than the K9s. Think you’ve 
                        made it home to Grandma’s house, 
                        homie? That’s when Braden takes 
                        off his granny suit and eats you.

           Sean raises his eyebrows. 

                                 ALLEN
                        Big Bad Wolf. Shit. He looks a 
                        little long in the tooth to me.

           Allen moves closer, looming over Braden like a rearing 
           bear. Braden ignores him, which only pisses Allen off.

                                 BRADEN
                        How was I?

                                 XAVIER
                        Tough, but fair.

                                 ALLEN
                        You still tough, Dumbledore? You 
                        don’t look tough. You look soft.

           Allen stepping even closer. His broad chest bumps against 
           Braden’s right shoulder. Allen glaring down at Braden...

                                 BRADEN
                        Is he retarded?

                                 XAVIER
                        Just exuberant. Don’t mind Allen. 

           Braden shrugs, signalling a waitress. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Sweetheart, I trouble you for a 
                        couple Tylenol?

                                 SEAN
                        You alright?

                                 BRADEN
                        They’re not for me.

           Braden BOOTS Allen right in the BALLS. Some of the other 
           DINERS and WAITSTAFF react as Allen drops to his knees, 
           then over on his side, groaning. Xavier’s mildly amused. 
           Sean is mortified. He looks at Braden the way, well, the 
           way you look at your dad when he embarrasses you. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        What happened? Is he okay?

                                 XAVIER
                        My friend slipped. He’s fine.

                                 BRADEN
                        We were just on our way out.
                                 (hauling Allen up)
                        Weren’t we, big guy? Come on. Let 
                        Uncle Braden buy you an ice cream 
                        while the grownups talk.

           Allen drapes his big arm around Braden. Braden props 
           Allen up, helping him limp gingerly to the elevator. 

           EXT. 9200 SUNSET BLVD - MINUTES LATER

           Braden and Allen sitting together on the trunk of Sean’s 
           unmarked, both drinking from STARBUCKS holiday cups. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What do you call these again?

                                 ALLEN
                        Caramel Macchiatos. 

           Allen pulls a FLASK, pours some into his cup, hands it to 
           Braden, who dumps the rest into his, and hands it back.

                        I ask you a question? Would you’ve 
                        kicked me I wasn’t a brother?

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m not even gonna dignify that 
                        with a response.

                                 ALLEN
                        Thought so.

           A PORSCHE pulls into the HANDICAPPED SPACE nearby, an 
           able bodied ASSHOLE on his Bluetooth as he gets out...

                                 BRADEN
                        HEY!

           The Porsche asshole looks back. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck’s a matter with you?

                        Excuse me?

                                 BRADEN
                        You can’t park there. See the blue 
                        wheelchair guy? That space is 
                        reserved for cripples and 
                        spastics, you dumb shit. 

           Braden flashes his badge.

                                 PORSCHE ASSHOLE
                        Fine. Write me a ticket. Leave it 
                        on the windshield. I’m in a hurry.

           He turns to walk away.

                                 BRADEN
                        Move your car, fuckface. Or I’ll 
                        give you a lifetime excuse to park 
                        there.

                                 PORSCHE ASSHOLE
                        Fuck you.

           Braden GRABS him, torquing his arm to steer the guy back 
           to his car, shoving him up against it. He yanks the guy’s 
           keys out of his pocket.

                        I gave you a chance. Now my 
                        partner here’s going to have to 
                        impound your vehicle. 

           Braden no-look passes the keys back to Allen, who catches 
           them one-handed as he strolls up to the car. 

                                 ALLEN

                        I stand corrected.

           As Allen hops in the Porsche, REVS the engine and--

                        Owe you one, brother.

                        Wouldn’t do this for anyone else.

                        You gave him a chance. He would’ve

                        Everybody on the floor. Now!

           The CUSTOMERS hit the deck as Goblin VAULTS the counter, 
           OPENS the REGISTER, stuffing the bills into his pockets.

                                 GOBLIN

           MRS. LEE SCREAMS as SMILEY grabs a fistful of her HAIR 
           and PUTS his PISTOL against her temple. 

                                 MR. LEE
                        Please. Don’t touch her. Please.

           EXT. SUPERIOR LIQUOR MART - SAME

           Sean and Braden moving from cover to cover, crouching 
           behind parked cars. Eyes on the action inside.

                        David 14. We’re Code 6 on that 211 
                        on Venice. Multiple armed suspects 
                        and hostages inside. I need units 
                        to respond to the alley rear for 
                        containment only. Notify SWAT and

                        complicated. My day all we had to 
                        remember was N.U.A.S.S. 

           Sean has no idea what the hell he’s talking about.

                        Nut Up And Shoot Somebody.

           INT. SUPERIOR LIQUOR MART - SAME

           The gangsters HEAR the ELECTRIC DOOR CHIME and all look 
           up to see BRADEN strolling up to the register...

                                 BRADEN
                        Gimme a pack a Marlboros, coupla 
                        lottery tickets and do you still 
                        carry Juggs Magazine? 

           They’re all thrown off for a second. Because Braden’s 
           just standing there. Like nothing’s wrong. Like he hasn’t 
           walked into a 211. But it’s more than Braden’s casual 
           attitude that throws them. It’s Braden. The Jacket. The 
           Wranglers. Those fucking boots. These are High Definition 
           Criminals facing an analog lawman for the first time. 

                                 SLEEPY
                        Wallet on the counter, fool.

           Sleepy covers Braden with his sawed off. Braden tosses 
           his wallet on the counter. Beat. Goblin reaches for it. 

                                 BRADEN
                        You wouldn’t believe the 
                        paperwork. Nobody talks about that 
                        part, what a pain in the ass it 
                        is. It’s like you have to fill out 
                        an application for a home loan 
                        every time you pull the trigger. I 
                        always hated that part, the 
                        paperwork. But I gotta tell ya, 
                        man, this part? Right here? 

           The bat in his right hand, Sleepy picks up the wallet 
           with his left. It FLOPS OPEN, revealing Braden’s BADGE. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        This part I really like.

           Braden moves with blurring speed, pulling his .357 
           SUPERMAG. Braden’s first shot not at Goblin, but at 
           Sleepy standing to his right with the sawed off SHOTGUN.

           BOOM! We watch a .357 HOLLOW POINT fly out of Braden’s 
           pistol in slow motion - right INTO THE MUZZLE of the big 
           bore shotgun in Sleepy’s hands traveling straight DOWN 
           THE BARREL to DETONATE the twelve gauge round INSIDE the 
           shotgun, causing the weapon to EXPLODE in his hands. 
           Sleepy drops, SCREAMING, curled up around his hand. 

           Before Sleepy even hits the floor, Braden turns his 
           Supermag on Goblin. BOOM! His baseball bat FLIES APART 
           into a storm of SPLINTERS, leaving him gripping a jagged 
           stump. Dark urine spreads across the front of his pants. 
           Braden reaches up, clamping his hand around the back of 
           Goblin’s neck, savagely bringing it down to SLAM his face 
           into the counter. He sags to the floor. Unconscious. 
           Smiley is using Mrs. Lee as a human shield, handgun 
           grinding against her temple as he backs her toward the 
           STOREROOM. Braden covers him with his REVOLVER.

                        Case you haven’t figured this out 
                        yet, today’s not going to go the 
                        way you thought. Neither is the 
                        rest of your life for that matter.

           SEAN steps through the plastic strip curtains of the 
           storeroom behind Smiley, his GLOCK against the base of 
           Smiley’s skull. Smiley releases Mrs. Lee. Sean cuffs him. 

                                 SEAN
                        Braden!

           The convex MIRROR up behind the register shows Braden 
           that PAYASO is sneaking up BEHIND HIM, his MACHETE 
           raised. Braden FIRES behind him without looking back. 
           BOOM! The guy blown back off his feet, MOANING on the 
           floor, as Braden steps over to survey the damage... 

                                 BRADEN
                        Whoa. Looks like the next place

           A Crime Scene TECH approaches Braden with SOMETHING 
           gripped in a pair of FORCEPS. It’s a BULLET, the one that 
           imbedded in Goblin’s bat. Still in pretty good shape.  

                                 TECH
                        Braden, right? Thought you might 
                        want this to commemorate your 
                        first day back. The one that went 
                        down the barrel of the guy’s 
                        shotgun’s in about a million 
                        pieces. I pulled this one out of 
                        the guy’s bat. Nice work.

           He drops the bullet into Braden’s palm. Braden tucks the 
           bullet into his pocket just as LT. KIM CHILDRESS (40s) 
           enters. Proven herself in gang units that see women as 
           albatrosses of affirmative action. Tries to downplay her 
           beauty, without success. Probably make chief someday.

                                 (mouthful of dog)

                                 (patting his holster)
                        Bullets came out the end of this 
                        and went in some bad guys. We used 
                        to call that police work.

           Sean winces, bracing himself for an explosion. 

                                 CHILDRESS
                        You violated department procedure 
                        for dealing with barricaded 
                        suspects. This I was willing to 
                        forgive because you’re this 
                        unfrozen caveman.

                        the moment it ran out.

                        I’ve got almost ten years on the 
                        job. I’ve made over two thousand 
                        felony arrests and I’ve never had 
                        to pull the trigger. I’m proud of 
                        that. It was just blind luck a 
                        stray round didn’t hit a civilian 
                        back there. Put SWAT in place, I

                        I don’t have a choice. And neither

                                 SEAN
                        We say Asian now. Oriental’s 
                        offensive. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Why?

                                 SEAN
                        I don’t remember exactly. I think 
                        it’s something about the Orient 
                        and a Western-centric worldview.

                                 BRADEN
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about? Jesus Christ. Oriental’s 
                        offensive and we have to be gentle 
                        with gangbangers now. That’s 
                        progress. Asian.

                        no pro football team, traffic’s 
                        even shittier than I remember. And 
                        oh yeah, my wife is dead. 
                                 (Sean reacts)
                        Your century’s got nothing I want 
                        except the son of a bitch who did 
                        this to me. After I find him, I 
                        don’t care what happens after 
                        that. I’ll grab a desk somewhere 
                        and you’ll be a free man. Okay?

           But Sean knows just how hopeless Braden’s quest is. 

                                 SEAN
                        You’re not going to find him.

           He nods to the building they’re parked in front of.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been parked at the crime 
                        scene this whole time. And you 
                        didn’t even recognize it.

           Braden reacts. This is where it happened. Some visionary 
           architect has converted the grim apartment building where 
           he was shot into a modern mixed-used residential and 
           commercial space. The first floor is now stylish retail 
           space occupied by Coffee Bean, a Cold Pressed Juice Bar, 
           American Apparel. Sleek lofts and offices above. 

           INT. VINYASA YOGA STUDIO (FOURTH FLOOR) - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden and Sean step off the elevator. All the walls have 
           been knocked out for a VINYASA YOGA STUDIO. Gorgeous 
           WOMEN wearing Lulemon yoga pants and twist tops contort 
           themselves on yoga mats. Forty tight butts in the air.

                        You might be more flexible than 
                        you think. I also do personal 
                        training. The first session is--

                        --We’re police officers. We’re 
                        investigating a homicide.

                                 BRADEN
                        It happened here-- 

                                 GIRL
                        Oh my God.

                        --Before you were born.

           She relaxes. A little. 

                                 SEAN
                        Mind if we look around?

                                 GIRL
                        Of course. I mean no, go ahead.

           Braden and Sean walk around the perimeter of the class. 
           The space is totally open. There’s nothing left of the 
           hallway. Or any of the apartments. Just bamboo floor.

                                 SEAN
                        I wanted you to see what you’re up 
                        against. Trail hasn’t just gone 
                        cold. It’s been obliterated. 

           On the far side of the studio, Braden looks out the 
           WINDOW. This is the same window. Braden is standing where 
           the guy in the ski mask was when he shot him in the head. 

           BOOM! The BLAST lifts Braden off his feet and floats him 
           backward to smash through the WINDOW on to the fire 
           escape. The SKI MASK FIRES out the broken window--

           Braden looking out the window at four-story modern 
           APARTMENTS where the grubby liquor store once stood, 
           glass and steel and reclaimed brick, rooftop garden.

                        Bad guy got away, Sam. I’m sorry. 

           Braden’s watching a BROTHER(5) and SISTER(6) chasing each 
           other around a spacious apartment while their NANNY 
           watches El Nombre Del Amor on a big FLATSCREEN...

                                                            TRANSITION TO:

           And as they high five we PULL BACK to REVEAL they are 
           standing over an AUTOPSY TABLE with a BODY on it. The 
           frumpy MEDICAL EXAMINER scowls at them.

           INT. CLASSROOM 1 (HUMAN RELATIONS DIVISION) - NEXT DAY

           Braden sitting with a dozen other OFFENDERS, all of them 
           sentenced to Sexual Harassment Training. OFFICER PAULA 
           CHAVEZ(30) sitting next to him. Sexy little fireplug.

                                 BRADEN
                        I called Sgt. Childress 
                        Sweetheart.

                                 CHAVEZ
                        You’re lucky to be alive.

                                 BRADEN
                        You?

                                 CHAVEZ
                        I asked a motor cop if he’d been 
                        working out.

           The INSTRUCTOR sees Braden and Chavez talking and PAUSES 
           the video. Irritated. He puts Braden on the spot.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Before we continue, Detective 
                        Braden, can you tell me what makes 
                        this conduct unwelcome? 

                                 BRADEN
                        They were being insensitive. The

                        there and she feels bad because 
                        she’s not as attractive as the new 
                        girl and she looks like she might

           EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT (OLD GAS STATION) - THAT NIGHT

           In LA, this is what passes for a winter wonderland. 
           Christmas lights strung on what used to be a Chevron 
           station. KIDS tumbling in a MOON BOUNCE. TODDLERS 
           smothering the inmates of a tiny PETTING ZOO. BRADEN, 
           SEAN, LAURIE and SAM hunting for a tree. Braden drifts 
           from the others. Sam, churro in one hand, leads Laurie to 
           the tree he’s decided on, a lopsided Douglas fir.

                                 SAM
                        This one.

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s lopsided.

                                 SAM
                        I know. 

                                 LAURIE
                        Okay, I’ll get your father and you 
                        can explain why you want to turn 
                        our living room into a charity 
                        ward for disabled Douglas firs.

           Braden walks down a ROW of NOBLE FIRS, silently COUNTING 
           each tree he passes. He stops. 

                                 SEAN (O.S.)
                        You okay? 

           Sean appears next to him.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s twenty seven.

           Sean shrugs. So? He doesn’t get it. Not at first. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Christmases he took from me. 

           Beat.

                        And you think if you catch this 
                        guy he’s going to cough ‘em up for 
                        you? That’s why they call it the 
                        past, Sam. We can’t get it back. 

           Braden nods, but there’s no comfort in it for him.

           EXT. SEAN AND LAURIE’S BACK PATIO - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Braden sneaks out, taps a Marlboro out and LIGHT up, 
           taking his first puff when he HEARS the SLIDING DOOR open 
           behind him. Laurie stepping out in her sweats.

                                 LAURIE
                        Mind if I join you?

           Braden holds out the pack. You recognize your own. She 
           pulls one out. He lights it for her. Beat.

                                 BRADEN
                        I really don’t belong here.

                                 LAURIE
                        None of us do. Get used to it.

                                 BRADEN
                        Now you sound like my wife. You 
                        remind me of her.

                        I don’t know what Sean was 
                        expecting. But I know I ain’t it.

                                 LAURIE
                        He’s the reason you’re here. You 
                        know that, right? 
                                 (Braden reacts)
                        Every time they came out with some 
                        new treatment, he’d be on the 
                        phone, writing letters, trying to 
                        get you into clinical trials. For 
                        years. When he talked Dr. Hall 
                        into taking you on, I just figured 
                        we were in for another heartbreak. 
                                 (beat)
                        When they told him you’d come out 
                        of it, Sean was terrified. He 
                        didn’t say it, but I know he was. 
                        After all this time. Afraid he’d 
                        be a disappointment to you.

                                 BRADEN
                        Disappointment to me?

                                 LAURIE
                        You were a legend. He grew up 
                        hearing stories about you. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Well, now he knows better.

                                 LAURIE
                        He could’ve been anything. I think 
                        he became a cop, hoping to get to 
                        know you. I know that’s what your 
                        case was for him, even if he 
                        doesn’t. It was never about the 
                        shooter. It was about finding you. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Looks like I disappointed him. On 
                        both counts.

           Braden digs something out of his pocket - the BULLET the 
           tech at the liquor store extracted from Goblin’s baseball 
           bat, weighs it thoughtfully in his palm. 

                                 LAURIE
                        Is that from your case?

                                 BRADEN
                        No. Just a souvenir. I thought Sam 
                        might like to have it. Shit, if we 
                        had a bullet like this from my 
                        case, we might actually...

           BOOM! Goblin’s baseball bat FLIES APART into a storm of 
           SPLINTERS-- BOOM! The BLAST lifts Braden off his feet and 
           floats him backward to smash through the WINDOW on to the 
           fire escape. The SKI MASK FIRES out the broken window--
           Those KIDS chasing each other around in that spacious 
           apartment, in the building that didn’t exist before.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        We might actually get somewhere.

           INT. BACK AT THE VINYASA YOGA STUDIO - DAY

           Sean watches Braden making a finger gun. The kid in that 
           APARTMENT across the way, crouching behind his couch to 
           fire back at Braden. Bam. Bam. Bam.

                                 BRADEN
                        You said none of the bullets 
                        recovered were worth shit, right? 

                                 SEAN
                        Right. Too distorted.

           Through this WINDOW and another WINDOW in front, Braden 
           can see clear THROUGH the apartment to the STREET beyond. 
           To a WOODEN UTILITY POLE across the street. He smiles...

           EXT. UTILITY POLE ACROSS SIXTH STREET - DAY

           Sean nimbly climbing the rungs of the UTILITY POLE... 

                                 BRADEN
                        Bullet they pulled out of the bat 
                        got me thinking. Guy shot me with 
                        a .357, like mine. Effective range 
                        is only what? About--

                                 SEAN
                        --Fifty meters. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Figure if a round made it across 
                        the street, hit this pole-- 

           Sean finds a decades old HOLE in the wood. Sean pulls a 
           TOOL from his belt and begins digging into it.

                                 SEAN
                        --Most of its kinetic energy spent 
                        on the trip here. Soft wood...

           Sean PRIES something loose and a BULLET plops into his 
           hand. Rust-tinged, otherwise in good condition.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        ...I don’t fucking believe it.

           EXT. DOWN THE BLOCK FROM 7620 SIXTH ST - DAY

           A BRUTE in a Viking beard, WATCHING Braden and Sean 
           behind ‘LOCS’ SUNGLASSES on a SHAVED HEAD covered in Nazi 
           tattoos. He’s ARYAN BROTHERHOOD. Call him VIK.

           CONTINUED:

           On second thought, don’t. Just watch him as he walks 
           around to the back of a FORD F-350 PICKUP with a SHELL on 
           it and casually DROPS the TAILGATE, leaving it OPEN as he 
           slides into the DRIVER’S SEAT, adjusting the big SIDEVIEW 
           MIRROR so he can still keep an eye on Braden and Sean...

           HIDDEN UNDER THE SHELL ON THE BED OF HIS F-350:

           A SNIPER: Prone on the bed of the truck. CLEAN HEAD, wife 
           beater, and tattoos tell us he’s a fellow BROTHER, got 
           his training at the Fallujah Finishing School. So he’s 
           pro. Perfectly still. He’s BARRY. You’d never see him 
           unless you were staring straight into the back of the 
           truck, and you wouldn’t want to because--

           EXT. BACK AT SEAN’S UNMARKED CAPRICE - MINUTES LATER

           Sean POPS the TRUNK LID giving us our first look into the 
           trunk of his unmarked car: fastidiously organized with 
           separate sections for his fingerprint kit, gunshot 
           residue kit, latex gloves, luminol, and so on. 

                                 SEAN

                        Looks like you got the whole 
                        detective playset in there. All 
                        that shit and no booze.

                        This could be the first break in 
                        your case that anyone’s had in 
                        twenty seven years.

           BARRY’S POV: Breathing SLOWLY, making tiny corrections 
           until BRADEN is MAGNIFIED through the scope’s RETICLE. 
           BARRY’S FINGER: As it CURLS slowly around the TRIGGER...

           EXT. AT THE OPEN TRUNK OF SEAN’S UNMARKED CAPRICE - SAME

           Braden pinches the envelope OPEN, but before he can slide 
           the recovered BULLET inside, the BULLET slips through his 
           fingers, rolls under the car. BOTH bend down for it as--

           force to TEAR the lid right OFF its HINGES--

           --BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! PUNCHING out through the DOORS and 
           FENDERS, inches from Sean and Braden, who both PRONE OUT 
           FLAT against the SIDEWALK in a rain of atomized auto 
           glass, because the car offers some concealment, but 
           absolutely no cover against Barry’s armor-piercing ammo.

           under the car to reach for it as the FLAMES spread, 
           Braden’s fingers fumbling for it, CLOSING around it as--

           the trigger of his Glock fast and smooth, peppering the F-

           But when Barry ROLLS smoothly out of the bed, he’s TRADED 
           in his BARRETT for an M249 MACHINE GUN - just like the 
           ones from the bank - posing like Rambo, ammo belt over 
           his arm as he unloads BRACKABRACKABRACKABRACK! Tearing 
           the whole street apart. Braden and Sean dive for cover.

           Barry hops in the bed of the TRUCK as it roars away. 
           Braden RUNS after it, takes a shooting stance. Too far...

                                 SEAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        GET IN!

           Braden turns to see -OH, NO, NO, YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING

                        We’re commandeering it.

           Braden climbs in next to Sean as he STOMPS the PEDAL to 
           the floor. The minivan lurches after the truck. The pig 
           iron piece of shit’s almost as old as Sean, knobs broken 
           off the stock stereo, and there’s a CD stuck in it... 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        --I already tried, okay? The

                        I’m already out of policy by 
                        practically stealing this car, I

           Sean pushing the minivan past its limits, STRAIGHT 
           THROUGH a RED LIGHT to catch up with the F-350. HORNS. 
           Tires SCREECH. Sean SWERVES out into oncoming traffic--

           behind the TRUCK, the wrong fucking way up the off ramp-

           EXT. CENTURY FREEWAY CONNECTOR (100 FEET UP) - CONTINUOUS

           Both vehicles now racing neck and neck along the highest 
           OVERPASS in Southern California, ONE HUNDRED FEET over 
           the 110 Freeway. Barry stands in the truck bed, angling 
           his M249 to BRACKABRACKABRACKA! Perforating the MINIVAN. 
           Braden and Sean hunched as low as they can manage. Braden 
           FIRES, a round catching VIK in the shoulder, causing him 
           to LOSE CONTROL and SMASH through the SAFETY RAIL, the 
           truck STUCK there, but BARRY goes SAILING out over the 
           Harbor Freeway, FALLING a hundred feet into northbound 
           lanes. 

           But the truck REMAINS, somehow TEETERING on its balance 
           point one hundred feet in the air. Braden and Sean exit 
           the minivan, but not before BOOM! Braden BLOWS a HOLE 
           through the CAR STEREO, silencing Abba. He and Sean 
           approach the teetering TRUCK, their guns up on target.

                                 BRADEN
                        Alright. Sir, my partner and I 
                        observed you driving very 
                        erratically. And I’m going have to 
                        ask you to exit the vehicle with 
                        your license and registration.

                                 BRADEN
                        And I was kinda hoping Heather 
                        Locklear would show up here and 
                        sit on my face, but it looks like 
                        we’re both gonna be disappointed.

           And with that, Braden KICKS the BUMPER of the TRUCK! 
           HARD! And the GUARDRAIL SCREAMS OUT, finally giving way 
           and the F-350 LURCHES forward--Sean quickly SNATCHES the 
           HOOK from Braden, hastily LOOPING the cable around the 
           truck’s exposed frame, and manages to set the HOOK just 
           as--THE TRUCK FALLS SILENTLY OFF THE OVERPASS!

           Sean and the tow truck driver watch in horror as CABLE 
           UNSPOOLS from the tow truck’s winch drum with blurring 
           speed, friction smoke curling from the winch until-- 

           -THWANG! The CABLE PULLED TAUT JERKING US to a SUDDEN 
           STOP, like a hanged man - GRAVITY VIOLENTLY RESTORED 
           INSIDE, throwing Vik against his AIRBAG. His CELL PHONE 
           tumbling out, wedged between the dash and windshield.

           EXT. CENTURY FREEWAY CONNECTOR (100 FEET UP) - SAME

           The tow truck driver looks down at the gently swaying F-
           350, dangling fifty feet over the freeway. 

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                        That was awesome.

                                 BRADEN
                        What? They don’t have good-cop-bad-
                        cop in this century?

           INT. DONIGER’S OFFICE - 43 MINUTES LATER

           Braden and Sean standing across the desk from Doniger. 
           Doniger doesn’t have to look back the TV mounted on the 
           wall behind him. He knows what’s on. Because it’s on 
           every channel. KTLA 5 NEWS with footage from SKYCAM 5: 
           the F-350 dangling from the OVERPASS and BUMPER TO BUMPER 
           TRAFFIC to the ends of the earth. 

                                 DONIGER
                        You going for a personal best?

                                 BRADEN
                        Did I make it?

                                 DONIGER
                        One KIA. Property damage north of 
                        half a million. Adjusted for 
                        inflation, yeah. I’d say so. 
                                 (to Sean)
                        You were supposed to civilize him. 
                        You went native for Christ’s sake.

                                 SEAN
                        The cases are connected somehow. 
                        His shooting and these guns. I 
                        don’t know how the hell they fit 
                        together, but they do. We’re 
                        getting close to something, and 
                        it’s big enough to risk trying to 
                        kill two cops in broad daylight. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Wade, if you just give me five 
                        minutes in a room with that 
                        asshole. I know I can--

                                 DONIGER
                        --WHAT?!? Do you have any fucking 
                        idea what’s happening here? What 
                        century we’re in? Either of you? 
                                 (softer)
                        Look, for what it’s worth, I agree 
                        with you. Something hinky about 
                        all this. But I gotta ground you.

                        until further. I’m sorry.

           Sean walks out. Braden lingers. One last try. Pulls the 
           EVIDENCE ENVELOPE out of his pocket and rolls the BULLET 
           from the TELEPHONE POLE out on to the desk.

                                 BRADEN
                        Pulled it out of the telephone 
                        pole across from the building 
                        where I was shot. It’s old. 
                                 (Doniger reacts)
                        I need one more favor, Wade. And I 
                        know it’s asking a lot... 

           Braden rolls the bullet back into the evidence envelope 
           and passes it to Doniger. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Get this analyzed for me.

           Doniger holds the bullet up. Considering...

                                 DONIGER
                        Okay. I’ll see what I can do. Now 
                        get the fuck out of here.

           INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS (PARKING GARAGE) - LATER

           Sean in civilian clothes walking out to his car when he 
           HEARS beeping and sees the CITY TOW TRUCK backing Vik’s 
           F350 TRUCK into a PARKING SPACE roped off with CONES and 
           CRIME SCENE TAPE. Airbags sagging. Windshield shattered. 
           Sean looks closer. SOMETHING wedged between the dashboard 
           and shattered windshield -- Vik’s CELLPHONE.

           INT. THE SHORTSTOP BAR IN ECHO PARK - NIGHT

           The gentrification of Echo Park has turned what was once 
           a beautifully seedy cop bar into one of those self-
           conscious dive bars populated by twenty-something 
           HIPSTERS. A DJ in the corner spinning records. Weird 
           electronic stuff Braden’s never heard before.

                                 BRADEN
                        This was a cop bar. This was THE 
                        cop bar. What the hell happened?

                                 SEAN
                        Gentrification. I told you.

           CONTINUED:

           Braden and Sean make their way to the bar, as the 
           BARTENDER arrives, looking sullen and sarcastic.

                                 BRADEN
                        Budweiser. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        We don’t have Budweiser.

                                 BRADEN
                        Miller?

                                 BARTENDER
                        We carry microbrews. Hoptimus 
                        Prime. Seriously Bad Elf. Arrogant 
                        Bastard. Clown Poison. Farmer’s 
                        Tan. Bitter Bitch. Leghumper... 

                                 BRADEN
                        Are they cold?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yes.

                                 BRADEN
                        Then I don’t give a shit. Pick 
                        one.

                                 SEAN
                        Make it two.

           The bartender walks out of frame. Braden turns to Sean. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Thought you didn’t drink beer.

                                 SEAN
                        Guess it’s a night of firsts then. 
                        Not a blemish on my record. 72 
                        hours with you and I’m suspended. 
                        Kinda liberating, actually.

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, I always did my best work 
                        after I’d been suspended. 

           The bartender returns with two bottles of BELLIGERENT ASS 
           ALE. Sean laughs. Braden raises his glass to his son.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You did alright today.

           Sean digs VIK’S CELL PHONE out of his pocket and places 
           it on the bar between them.

                                 BRADEN
                        What’s that?

                                 SEAN
                        A cell phone. That I pulled out of 
                        that F350 on my way out. So I 
                        guess if you wanna be technical, I 
                        guess it’s stolen evidence. 

                                 BRADEN
                        We used to say you can wear a 
                        badge for twenty years, but you’re 
                        not a cop until you break the law.

                                 SEAN
                        Thanks, Obi Wan. That come off a 
                        bumper sticker? Or a muscle shirt?

                                 BRADEN
                        Memory serves, used to be written 
                        on one of the stalls in back. 

           Sean POWERS up the phone, Braden looks over his shoulder.

                                 SEAN
                        It’s a burner cell. You can buy 
                        ‘em at any 7-11. Buy some minutes, 
                        use them up and dump it. 

           Sean scrolls through VIK’S TEXTS. A lot of local SKANKS 
           have apparently TEXTED NAKED SELFIES to Vik...

                                 BRADEN
                        Wait. Go back to that one.

           Sean scrolls to a PHOTO of BRADEN and SEAN taken outside 
           the LIQUOR STORE with the words ‘GREEN LIGHT’.

                        Pretty straightforward. Run a

           INT. SHORT STOP - LATER

           Braden and Sean hunched over a napkin, jotting the 
           numbers down, circling them like a jumble, crossing them 
           out, tearing off another napkin and starting over.

                        No. Actually, we don’t know.

           The bartender turns the napkin to take a look.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I don’t know about the third 
                        number, but the first two look 
                        like GPS coordinates.

           Braden turns his arm, noticing those numbers Childress

                                 BRADEN
                        Why are you doing this? You’re 
                        risking your job coming out here.

                                 SEAN
                        If I didn’t come with you you’d 
                        find a way out here alone. And 
                        you’d get yourself killed. And I 
                        don’t want to... to have to 
                        explain to my son that you’re not 
                        ever coming home. Sam loves you.

           Silence. So many things Braden wants to say to Sean.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I prayed you’d come back. For 
                        years. Then after Mom died... 
                        that’s when I knew nobody was 
                        listening.

                        And for a while I figured if 
                        nobody’s watching, then it doesn’t 
                        matter what we do. But it’s the 
                        only thing that matters. Honor’s 
                        not between you and God. It’s 
                        between you and you. You think I 
                        follow the rules because I’m 
                        afraid.

                                 BRADEN
                        No. Just the opposite. Sean--

                                 SEAN
                        --Shhh... Hear it?

           Braden does. They both hear it now. In the distance, the 
           snarl of HEMI ENGINES coming fast...

           EXT. ANTELOPE VALLEY (PEAR BLOSSOM HIGHWAY) - NIGHT

           A tight CONVOY of SUBURBANS and FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE PICKUPS 
           all TURNING OFF their headlights as they PEEL off the 
           Pear Blossom Highway, taking an angle across the desert, 
           kicking a nebula of dust up into the night sky.  

           INT. LEAD SUV - SAME

           The DRIVER wearing NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES. His PASSENGER 
           wears a Keffiyeh wrapped around his head, in the Afghan 
           fashion, only his eyes exposed. MERCS in back, scanning 
           the desert, ASSAULT WEAPONS at port arms. These guys 
           might be rolling through Eastern Afghanistan instead of 
           the western Mojave. POV (NIGHT VISION): Bathed in 
           greenish light, the desert looks like the ocean floor. 

           INT. BACK INSIDE THE CRUMBLING RUINS - SAME

           BRADEN and SEAN crouching inside, peering out the pane-
           less windows at the convoy. Sean flips open his NIGHT 
           VISION CAMCORDER, the SCREEN showing him...

                                 SEAN
                        Six vehicles. Maybe more. Running 
                        without headlights. Night vision. 

           The vehicles fan out into a rough semicircle. MERCS 
           jogging out to form a perimeter. Watching the desert, 
           ASSAULT WEAPONS slung barrel-down. Balaclavas covering 
           mouths and noses from dust. This has the look of routine. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Braden and Sean can hear another, larger ENGINE 
           approaching now. A towering wall of sound, battering 
           across the desert like a rogue wave. They trade looks.

           A whale-sized SHADOW races over desert. A V-22 OSPREY 
           tilt-rotor aircraft swooping down over the ruins, 
           nacelles rotating ninety degrees, allowing the aircraft 
           to land like a helicopter, turboprops scattering 
           tumbleweeds. Prop wash raising rust-colored spirals as 
           the OSPREY’S SEARCHLIGHT sweeps over the terrain. 

           Braden and Sean flatten against the stone walls as BEAMS 
           from the OSPREYS’ SEARCHLIGHTS blade through the windows 
           and doorway of their half-structure, bright as sunlight.

           The MAN in the KEFFIYEH steps out of the lead SUV through 
           waves of scudding grit toward the OSPREY as the LANDING 
           GEAR touches the desert floor. Rotors slowing now. The 
           sandstorm settles as the osprey’s CARGO RAMP drops OPEN. 
           Sean and Braden shoulder to shoulder at the window, 
           watching through the camcorder’s NIGHT VISION LCD SCREEN: 
           as the man removes his KEFFIYEH, revealing his FACE.

                        Kreuter.

           INT. OSPREY - SAME

           Kreuter enters the cargo hold, greeted by the equally 
           dangerous MARINE CORPS MAJOR DOUG BRENNAN. Silver 
           temples. Gold oak leaves on the collar of his fatigues. 

                                 MAJOR BRENNAN
                        Mr. Kreuter. 

           Behind Major Brennan, the cargo hold is packed with shock-
           proof WEAPONS CASES. Kreuter slides a case off the stack, 
           pops the lid on a dozen foam-packed M249 MACHINE GUNS. No 
           serial numbers. Identical to those used at the bank with 
           one exception: these are fitted with under-barrel 40mm 
           GRENADE LAUNCHERS. Kreuter touches his THROAT MIC.

                                 KREUTER
                                 (into mic)
                        We’re good to go.

           Four MERCS jog up the ramp now, carrying DUFFLE BAGS. 
           Major Brennan unzips a duffle. Butcher paper bricks of 
           COCAINE stacked inside. Brennan selects one at random, 
           draws his knife and CUTS into it, scoops out a small 
           amount, taps it into a VIAL of cobalt thiocyanate, and 
           SHAKES it. The substance in the vial turns BLUE...
           EXT. LLANO DEL RIO (MERCS ON THE PERIMETER) - SAME

           Heads on a swivel. Years spent in Indian Country. MERC’S 
           POV: Through his FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED (FLIR) SCOPE 
           reading HEAT emanating from the ruins. One of the 
           structures is glowing like a fucking Jack-o'-lantern. 

                                 MERC 1
                                 (into throat mic)
                        Be advised. I’m reading some heat 
                        from one of the structures. 

           The MERC breaks off to check it out, WEAPON up. 

           INT. INSIDE THE CRUMBLING RUINS - SAME

           Braden sees the MERCS closing in on the structure. 

                                 SEAN
                        We’re burned. 

           Sean draws his GLOCK. But Braden touches his arm. Braden 
           and Sean press their backs against the stone wall. Sean’s 
           CAMCORDER is RECORDING on the WINDOW LEDGE. The LED 
           SCREEN, we see Mercs loading WEAPONS CASES on the trucks. 

           The MERC right outside the doorway now, one more step and 
           he’ll see them. But Sean sees Braden removing that stupid 
           SHURIKEN from his BELT BUCKLE. Sean waving his hands 
           desperately. Universal language for No, no, you idiot! 

           Braden HUCKS the NINJA STAR at him. It buzzes through the 
           air to THUNK deeply into the guy’s forehead! And the only 
           person more stunned than the dying merc is Sean. The merc 
           looks to Sean as if for an explanation as he falls. Sean 
           catches him. He and Braden hauling his limp body inside.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay. That was pretty awesome.

           Setting the dead man down easy. Braden grabbing the guy’s 
           RIFLE, spare MAGS. Sean grabbing NIGHTVISION GOGGLES, and 
           RADIO. Sean GRABS the CAMCORDER, stuffs it in his jacket. 

           EXT. RUINS OF LLANO DEL RIO - SAME

           The Osprey’s ROTORS stirring another SANDSTORM. Kreuter 
           and his men shield their eyes. Braden and Sean dash low 
           to where they stashed Sean’s Prius. Pulling tumbleweeds 
           off. A BUTTON soundlessly starts the ignition. There’s 
           almost no sound as they slowly pull away...

                        gotta admit it has one thing going 
                        for it... It’s quiet.

           The car cautiously crawling like a beetle across the 
           desert, heading slowly back toward the highway when-- 

           EXT. RUINS OF LLANO DEL RIO - SAME

           Everyone climbing back into the trucks. Engines revving. 
           Merc 1 jogs back to structure to fetch his idiot comrade. 
           Through his FLIR, sees a glowing TRAIL OF HEAT leading 
           away from the ruins. From a vehicle. Has to be. What the 
           hell? Running now to the structure, seeing the DEAD MERC, 
           his body already starting to cool. Weapon gone.

           I/E. SEAN’S PRIUS - SAME

           Sean drives by NIGHTVISION, but the Prius isn’t exactly 
           an off-road vehicle. Braden wears the dead merc’s EARBUD.

                                 BRADEN
                                 (listening)
                        ....They found the dead guy.

                                 SEAN
                        Maybe they’ll think ninjas did it.

           Sean FLOORS it now, heedless of the noise or dust, 
           driving like hell for the Pear Blossom Highway as HIGH 
           BEAMS flare in the REARVIEW. Braden looks back and sees a 
           half-dozen TRUCKS and SUVS cresting that last rise. 

           MUZZLE FLASHES lighting up the desert, FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! 
           Bullets KICKING up GEYSERS of sand around them. Joshua 
           trees BURSTING like dandelions as Sean CRANKS the WHEEL 
           to SLALOM around BOULDERS. Steerining around hillocks. 
           But the SUVs drive OVER them, PORPOISING them one after 
           another, CATCHING AIR off every slope. Think Baja 1000.    

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s like the fucking Road Warrior 
                        and we’re driving Herbie The Love 
                        Bug. Open the roof, willya?

           Sean hits the button. Braden pops out of the moon roof 
           with the dead merc’s MK 17, FIRING back at them BRACK! 
           BRACK! BRACK! BRACK! RAKING the weapon across their 
           GRILLS and WINDSHIELDS. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The SUVs and PICKUPS SCATTER as though executing some 
           predetermined maneuver, like the Blue fucking Angels. 
           Spreading out in an attempt to encircle them, the way 
           commercial trawlers closing a net. 

           In his REARVIEW, Sean sees a LIFTED CHEVY SILVERADO right 
           on their ass. He GRABS Braden’s BELT, YANKING him down as 
           he SLAMS on his BRAKES. The SILVERADO blowing-right-past-
           them in a thick CLOUD of DUST. Sean then FLOORS it until 
           the Prius is running RIGHT BEHIND the SILVERADO, the nose 
           of the Prius close enough to kiss the Silverado’s tow 
           hitch. They’re TOO LOW to be visible in the DRIVER’S 
           mirrors, and completely SHROUDED by the contrail of DUST 
           trailing behind the truck. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 SEAN
                        Something really fucking dumb.
                                 (nodding forward)
                        Get in the back of the truck. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Wow. That is dumb.

                                 SEAN
                        GO!

           Braden climbs out the moon roof into a wind tunnel 
           whipping his clothes at sixty miles an hour. He balances 
           unsteadily on the hood of the Prius, scrambles into the 
           bed of the Silverado, shielded from view by the big 
           WEAPONS CASES lashed to the truck bed. Sean SETS the 
           CRUISE CONTROL, DRAWS his GLOCK from his belt holster as 
           he YANKS off his BELT, WHIPS it around the STEERING WHEEL 
           and CINCHES it to the ARMREST, keeping the Prius more or 
           less on course. Tucks the GLOCK into his WAISTBAND and 
           follows Braden, scrabbling out on to the hood-- 

           --But the SILVERADO VEERS RIGHT, the PRIUS drifting LEFT, 
           widening the gap. Sean DIVES for the tailgate with 
           nothing below but the desert blurring by... 

           Braden REACHES back through a tornado of dust for his 
           boy’s HAND, CLASPING it tight, Sean’s weight yanking him 
           against the tailgate as Sean dangles, his feet dragging. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I got you.

           Sean REACHES up to GRAB Braden’s other hand, looking up 
           at his father’s face. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Sean’s GLOCK and PHONE fall out of his waistband, lost to 
           the desert as Braden HAULS Sean up, as the PRIUS zips 
           right past the Silverado. 

                                 DRIVER
                                 (into radio)
                        I have the tango at my ten 
                        o’clock, still southbound!

           Kreuter’s men ATTACK as the valiant PRIUS makes its last 
           run across the Mojave, DRAWING their FIRE, shuddering 
           like Sonny Corleone on the causeway as bullets pound it. 
           SHATTERING windows, SHREDDING tires. A stray round SNAPS 
           the belt tied around the wheel and rudderless Prius 
           SWERVES as though to avoid their gunfire. They follow it.

           Kreuter lifts 40mm GRENADE LAUNCHER, and FIRES out his 
           window KUNK! FWOOM! The EXPLOSION obliterates the Prius. 

                                 KREUTER
                        Zero emissions my ass.

           Braden and Sean crouch, watching a column of black smoke 
           rise up into the night. Braden salutes the Prius’s pyre.

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t care if your car was gay. 
                        He died with his boots on.

                                 SEAN
                        I think you’re making progress.

           EXT. SKYFOREST CALIFORNIA - LATER

           The DESERT CONVOY now winding its way through the snow-
           covered San Bernardino Mountains, just outside of LA. The 
           first vehicles in the convoy are being WAVED off the 
           highway by more of Kreuter’s MERCS with FLASHLIGHTS. 

           EXT. LYING IN THE BED OF THE SILVERADO - SAME

           Braden and Sean are huddled together for warmth. Their 
           faces chapped. It’s been a cold fucking ride. Braden 
           feels them SLOWING DOWN. He sits up, peeks around the 
           cases to the MERCS waving the convoy on to a fire road. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Time to bail.

           Sean nods, reaches up and OPENS the TAILGATE and they 
           ROLL out on to the slushy shoulder... 

           EXT. SKYFOREST CALIFORNIA - 52 MINUTES LATER

           Braden and Sean stagger through a forest of centuries-old 
           conifers, boughs heavy with snow. Neither  dressed for 
           the cold, breath pluming as they crunch through deep 
           snow. They STOP dead in their tracks, just staring at--

                                 BRADEN
                        Huh. Guess they must’ve driven us 
                        a lot further than I thought. 

           An eerie SIGN POST at the edge of the forest - A ten-foot 
           CANDY CANE with a sign that reads NORTH POLE with ARROWS 
           pointing to SANTA’S WORKSHOP. PETTING ZOO. SANTA’S HOME. 

                                 SEAN
                        I think I know where we are. 

           As they move quietly past the candy cane signpost, and 
           enter a Rankin/Bass post-apocalyptic nightmare... 

           The ruins of SANTA’S village, the dilapidated amusement park, 
           just outside of LA. Closed back in 1998. GINGERBREAD MEN, 
           zombified by age, guard lollypop fences. The boarded up 
           CAVERNS COASTER - a poor man’s Matterhorn.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re up in Big Bear. This was 
                        Santa’s Village, that old 
                        amusement park. You probably don’t 
                        remember this, but you promised to 
                        take me here once.

                                 BRADEN
                        I meant to, but then I went out 
                        for a pack of smokes and ditched 
                        you and your mom to start a new 
                        family with that stripper in Reno. 

           HALOGEN HEADLIGHTS carve the shadows around them and they 
           DUCK behind a rusty ALPINE TRAIN as a patrol of MERCS 
           astride SNOWMOBILES rumble up to SCAN the area. All the 
           mercs would have to do is lean over to see them. But they 
           REV their engines, and continue patrol...
           EXT. ALPINE TRAIN - SAME

           Braden and Sean move stealthily along the train tracks, 
           which lead to a kid-sized TRELLIS across a fifteen foot 
           RAVINE. Braden and Sean step carefully over the creaking 
           trellis. The village below looks like the staging area 
           for a MILITARY OPERATION. Dozens of MERCENARIES in cold 
           weather gear, on foot and on SNOWMOBILES. 

           The locus of all the activity seems to be the big 
           Bavarian CAROUSEL HOUSE in the center of Santa’s Village. 
           Braden and Sean watch Mercs hauling over those CASES they 
           just picked up in the desert, moving them out of their 
           TRUCKS and placing them just inside the CAROUSEL HOUSE. 
           The jagged sounds of INDUSTRIAL WORK coming from inside.

                                 SEAN
                        We gotta call in for backup.

                                 BRADEN
                        And how do you propose we do that?

                                 SEAN
                        Hike back to the highway. Flag 
                        somebody down. Identify ourselves.

                                 BRADEN
                        Would you pull over for us?

                                 SEAN
                        I’ve got an honest face. Come on. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Not me. I’ve got a good spot here. 
                        Give me the camera. I’ll 
                        reconnoiter while you call it in. 

           Sean doesn’t like that. But there’s nothing for it.

                                 SEAN
                        Braden. Reconnoiter. Don’t engage.

                                 BRADEN
                        Scout’s honor.

           Sean hands Braden the CAMCORDER and heads back into the 
           trees. Not long after he’s out of sight, Braden SPOTS 
           KREUTER in the village. Braden can’t help himself. He 
           creeps deeper into the village, ducking behind a truck. 
           Braden grabs a CASE out of the truck, rests it on 
           shoulder to shield his face he WALKS back through the 
           village. Another worker bee lost in the flurry of 
           activity, as he heads for-- 
           EXT. CAROUSEL HOUSE - SAME

           The carousel is long gone. GENERATORS. POWER TOOLS. 
           SPARKS crackle from BLOWTORCHES as MEN in coveralls weld 
           LIGHT BARS on to TEN CROWN VICTORIA SEDANS. Stenciling on 
           UNIT NUMBERS - TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE. TEN perfect 
           COPIES of LAPD BLACK & WHITES. Braden creeps closer to 
           PEER around the other side, where he can see into OPEN 
           TRUNK of the nearest black & white. It’s PACKED with C4, 
           enough to level a building. They’re making CAR BOMBS!

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh, Jesus. 

           Braden bends down, trying to look busy while he slips 
           Sean’s CAMCORDER under a TOOL CART, and hits RECORD. He 
           sees Kreuter walking across the village square. Braden 
           grabs an empty case and walks after him.

           EXT. HIGHWAY 18 - NIGHT

           Sean trying desperately to FLAG down PASSING CARS. HORNS. 
           Get out of the road, asshole! He has his BADGE in his 
           palm, gleaming in the passing headlights, but it doesn’t 
           mean much up here. Finally, an SUV pulls over to the 
           shoulder in front of Sean, though not too far over, 
           because up here there’s nothing beyond the shoulder but a 
           hundred foot drop-off.

           DRIVER’S POV: Watching Sean shielding his eyes from the 
           GLARE of OUR HEADLIGHTS, jogging around to OUR driver’s 
           side WINDOW as WE hit the button to ROLL IT DOWN...

                                 SEAN
                        Thank you! This is a police 
                        emergency. I need you to-- 

           Relief. A spark of recognition in Sean’s eyes. The ghost 
           of a smile, what the hell are you doing up here? The 
           smile gone a split second later when the answer comes to 
           him. Sean reaches for his GLOCK, knowing he’s too late- 

           --BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Rapid MUZZLE FLASHES light up the 
           dark interior of the SUV as a three-round burst slams 
           into SEAN’S CHEST! Three hundred foot pounds of energy 
           BLOWING Sean BACKWARD off the drop-off behind him. It’s 
           like watching Braden fall off that fire escape... 
           I/E. SANTA’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Kreuter walks into his makeshift command center in 
           Santa’s Home. Braden ducks inside right after Kreuter. He 
           jams the muzzle of his SUPERMAG against Kreuter’s spine. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Boy, Santa’s gonna be pissed when 
                        he finds out you’re using his 
                        house to stage a terrorist attack, 
                        or whatever the fuck this is.

           Kreuter smiles, genuinely impressed.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        I was in the neighborhood.

           That’s when WADE DONIGER materializes from the shadows 
           behind Braden, his old .357 pointed at Braden’s head! 

                                 DONIGER
                        Drop it, Sam. 

           Braden HEARS the HAMMER CLICK behind him, hears DONIGER’S 
           VOICE. And he’s trying to get his mind around it, 
           something ugly and protean and twenty-seven years old. 

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        I’m not gonna ask you again.

           Reluctantly, Braden hands his PISTOL to Kreuter. Kreuter 
           tucks Braden’s SUPERMAG into his waistband.

                                 BRADEN
                        You shit-stinking son of a bitch.

           Doniger SMASHES the BUTT of his PISTOL into the base of 
           Braden’s skull. LIGHTS OUT...

           I/E. CAROUSEL HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           The world beginning to swim back to Braden now as one of 
           the mercs tightens a KNOT around his WRISTS and TOSSES it 
           up over one of the RAFTERS, the other end tied to the tow 
           hitch of a SNOWMOBILE REVVING forward, PULLING Braden UP 
           off his feet, DANGLING by his wrists from the beam.

                                 DONIGER
                        It really was a miracle, you 
                        coming back. It was a gift. And 
                        you fucking squandered it. All you 
                        had to do was nothing, Sam.

                        Collect your disability pension. 
                        Spend time with your family. But 
                        the job always did come first with 
                        you, didn’t it? You’d stayed home 
                        that night Gonzo would still be 
                        alive and Sean wouldn’t have had 
                        to grow up without his father.   

                                 BRADEN
                        You killed Gonzo.

                                 DONIGER
                        Your profligate ego killed him.
                        And now you’ve killed your boy.
                                 (Braden’s face)
                        Had to shoot him, Sam. I’m sorry.

           Braden ROARS. His entire body bucks and twists on the 
           rope, the rage running through him like electricity, 
           until his chin slumps to his chest, eyes closed... 

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        You brought Sean into this. Not 
                        me! I always tried to look out for 
                        the kid after you were gone. He 
                        was fine until you showed up. 

           Braden raises his face to Doniger’s. Eyes ablaze.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m gonna kill you, Wade. You saw 
                        your last sunrise this morning. If 
                        there’s a life after this one, and 
                        brother you better fucking pray 
                        there isn’t, tonight you’re gonna 
                        find out all about it. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY 18 - SAME

           A trembling HAND, reddened by cold, fingernails bloody 
           from the climb, CLAWS the sharp rock face, searching for 
           a decent hold. SEAN struggles, and finally PULLS himself 
           up over the outcropping and rolls on to the shoulder, 
           chest heaving. His shirt is torn and we can see the 
           BULLETS flattened on his KEVLAR VEST like flanged coins.  

           A DIESEL ENGINE. AIR BRAKES. Across the highway, Sean 
           SEES a SEMI towing an empty CAR CARRIER up to the 
           entrance to SANTA’S VILLAGE. Two MERCS pull open the gate 
           and approach the truck, their WEAPONS covering the cab 
           while they verify the DRIVER’s identity...

           CONTINUED:

           Now, Sean ROLLS out from under the CAR CARRIER and dashes 
           for the nearest structure...

           INT. CAROUSEL HOUSE - SAME

           Braden hangs by his wrists, helpless, as the MERCS 
           perform their final inspections of the CAR BOMBS before 
           closing the TRUNKS. Kreuter produces a MAS Zengrange 
           BIRIS (Battlefield Inoculation Remote Initiation System) 
           in shock-proof, air-tight housing. Braden watches... 

                                 KREUTER
                        System consists of one transmitter 
                        ten receiver units, one for each 
                        car. Power up the system... 

           He powers up the system and the LED lights in the clear 
           paddles on two rows of TOGGLE SWITCHES all turn BLUE. 
           Kreuter flips each switch, BLUE to FLASHING RED, arming 
           them. Each trigger protected by a hinged Lexan cover. 

                                 KREUTER (CONT’D)
                        Left to right arms each unit. 
                        Triggers command detonate each 
                        device via UHF digital signal.

           Kreuter closes the case and slides it to Doniger. That’s 
           when Braden notices the MERC in the PARKA, WOOL CAP and 
           GOGGLES walking into the CAROUSEL HOUSE, edging between 
           the black and whites. Something about him... It’s SEAN! 
           His boy’s ALIVE! Braden remembers the CAMCORDER, steals a 
           quick glance at it. The RED RECORD LIGHT is ON!

                                 BRADEN
                                 (to Doniger)
                        Your pet rock. You never sold your 
                        company. You just shuffled the 
                        pieces around, reincorporated 
                        under a new name. Kreuter’s the 
                        CEO, but he’s working for you. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Sentinel Security was smaller back 
                        then. Handful of off-duty cops 
                        watching car dealerships. 
                        Nightclubs. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Fronts. Where Garza laundered 
                        money, stored dope and guns. 
                        That’s why you dropped a dime on 
                        us. You were working for Garza.

                        I was until you killed him. That’s 
                        when things got interesting. You 
                        know, nature abhors a vacuum.

           One by one, MERCS climb into the BLACK & WHITES and START 
           their ignitions. Now, the BLACK & WHITE car bombs are all 
           being slowly BACKED OUT of the Carousel House...

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        They were going to get it anyway, 
                        Sam. They always do. I’ve learned 
                        that much in thirty years. That 
                        market forces are just stronger 
                        than we are. The law has limits. 
                        But there’s no limit to their 
                        appetite for what they can’t have. 
                        The Market wins. Every time. 

           Doniger watches the mercs driving the BLACK & WHITES up 
           on to the FRAME of the CAR CARRIER behind the TRUCK. 

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        Whole landscape changed after 
                        9/11. New frontiers opened up in 
                        Irag, Afghanistan. Turns out our 
                        brave men and women in uniform 
                        have a healthy appetite for it.

                                 BRADEN
                        But why the bombs? 

                                 DONIGER
                        Think of it as a hostile takeover, 
                        of the LAPD.

           As each BLACK & WHITE rolls on to the CAR CARRIER.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DONIGER
                        The rest are mostly freeways, 
                        sever the city’s main arteries.

           One after another. Ten Black & Whites in all. Braden 
           watching the mercs STRAP the vehicles to the CAR CARRIER.

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re gonna murder a whole city.

                                 DONIGER
                        Not quite. But I’m sure going to 
                        kick the shit out of it. When the 
                        Department tries to regroup after 
                        the bombings, they’re gonna find 
                        themselves under attack from all 
                        sides by gangsters armed with 
                        military ordinance. Anarchy’s a 
                        polite word for what you’re gonna 
                        have out there.

           Braden sees it now...

                                 BRADEN
                        Until Sentinel Security comes to 
                        the rescue. Contract negotiations 
                        with the city probably go a lot 
                        smoother when it’s on fire. But 
                        you’re fucking nuts if you think 
                        you’ll be able to take it back.

                                 DONIGER
                        Not overnight. Not without months 
                        of martial law. Years of tactical 
                        support. But that’s the whole 
                        point of a government contract, to 
                        extend it. I’m about to close the 
                        largest no-bid contract of my 
                        career. Biggest financial coup 
                        since Hurricane Katrina. 

           Braden watches Kreuter’s men wheel over a dolly with 
           oxygen and acetylene cannisters on it.

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to save lives in the 
                        long run. Put an end to our gang 
                        problem. No more needless 
                        bloodshed. The cartels will deal 
                        with me directly. Because I’ll 
                        control the biggest gang in the 
                        city: The new and improved Los 
                        Angeles Police Department.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Outside, Braden can see the CAR CARRIER, loaded with 
           black & white CAR BOMBS, pulling out on to HIGHWAY 18.

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        Now, I know you didn’t find this 
                        place by accident. Have to assume 
                        you walked in here already knowing 
                        more than I’m comfortable with. 

           Kreuter dons WELDING GLOVES, turns on the GAS and LIGHTS 
           the oxyacetylene BLOWTORCH. Moves the blowtorch FLAME 
           closer. Heat causes the hairs on Braden’s arms to curl 
           and blacken and disintegrate. Sean edges up behind.

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        I need to know who else you told.

           The FLAME closer to Braden’s skin. It begins to redden... 

                                 BRADEN
                        ANY TIME NOW, KID!

           SEAN YANKS Braden’s SUPERMAG from Kreuter’s waistband -
           Huh? - and steps back to cover Kreuter and Doniger. 

                                 SEAN
                                 (to Doniger)
                        You’re always trying to get me to 
                        wear my vest, Wade.  
                                 (to Kreuter)
                        Cut him down, asshole.

           Kreuter uses the blowtorch to BURN through Braden’s rope. 
           Braden lands on his feet and Sean TOSSES Braden his 
           SUPERMAG, but the moment he does Kreuter OPENS the FLOW 
           on the TORCH, shooting a blinding two-foot FLAME. And 
           Doniger and Kreuter GONE with the BIRIS DETONATOR.

                                 BRADEN
                        Son of a bitch!

                                 SEAN
                        WATCH IT!

           Sean SHOVES Braden out of the line of fire just as a MERC 
           pulls the trigger FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! Snow SPOUTING from 
           the ground all around them as Sean ROLLS, raises his M4 
           to return FIRE! BRACK! BRACK! BRACK! Sean stuffs the 
           CAMCORDER in his parka, pulling him out the BACK toward 
           the TOBOGGAN RUN. Braden RAISES his SUPERMAG, puts the 
           RED DOT on the acetylene cannister and FIRES. KA-BOOM! 
           Jumping on to the toboggan run as the Carousel House is 
           SWALLOWED by a BALL of FLAME that lights up the night. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           FWAP! FWAP! Bullets KICKING up snow all around Braden and 
           Sean as they SLIDE down the toboggan run INTO the back of 
           SANTA’S WORKSHOP. Mercs FIRING as they pursue them.

           I/E. SANTA’S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! Bullets PUNCHING HOLES through the 
           workshop, exploding long dormant animatronic elves as 
           Braden and Sean RUN across the toy assembly line to DIVE 
           out through the STORE WINDOW-- 

           EXT. SANTA’S VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Braden and Sean in a RUNNING GUN BATTLE through the 
           village. Three MERCS come around the corner single-file, 
           like a SWAT team. Braden puts his RED DOT on the LEADER 
           and BOOM! FIRES a SINGLE ROUND FWIP!FWIP!FWIP! through 
           ALL THREE MEN and for a split second the BEAM of his 
           laser SHINES unobstructed through the entry and exit 
           wounds in all three men before they FLOP in the snow. 

           VROOM! A MERC FIRING from the saddle of the SNOWMOBILE. 
           Sean ROLLS and BRACK! BRACK! BLASTS the merc right out of 
           the saddle. The snowmobile coasts forward and Sean climbs 
           on, grabbing the handlebars. Braden jumps on behind him.

                                 BRADEN
                        Go! GO!

           Sean OPENS the THROTTLE and the SNOWMOBILE tears right 
           down Santa Claus Lane. FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! Mercs FIRING at 
           them from pursuing snowmobiles and MORE rushing into the 
           intersection up ahead to cut them off, Sean forced to 
           make a hard LEFT across the CANDY CANE GROVE, slaloming 
           through big candy canes with mercs in close pursuit. 

           Braden sees snowmobiles paralleling them on both sides as 
           they near the end of the Candy Cane Grove. They’re going 
           to be boxed in. Nothing in FRONT but the artificial cliff 
           face of the BOBSLED CAVERNS COASTER. The ENTRANCE covered 
           with sheets of PLYBOARD, spray-painted KEEP OUT.

                                 SEAN
                        Hold on!

           And Sean STEERS straight for the ENTRANCE to the BOBSLED 
           CAVERNS. He EMPTIES his M4 into the PLYBOARD, all but 
           obliterating it before they SMASH THROUGH into--
           I/E. BOBSLED CAVERNS COASTER - CONTINUOUS

           Snowmobile HEADLIGHT illuminating caverns of fiberglass 
           and cement as Sean drives the SNOWMOBILE on the COASTER 
           TRACK down a series of ice tunnels, over dips and curves, 
           under huge fiberglass icicles, past an ANIMATRONIC YETI. 
           Sean can’t help himself, he’s loving this! WHOOOO! 

                                 BRADEN
                        Better late than never.

           FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! Bullets SHATTER fiberglass icicles 
           around them. Another snowmobile pursuing them down the 
           track. A circle of starlight ahead. Sean accelerates. 

           Coming OUT of the caverns, the TRACKS curve steeply over 
           a drop off. But Sean heads straight ahead, airborne off 
           the tracks, landing HARD on the slope below. The other 
           snowmobile LANDING right behind them, FIRING--

           Bullets KICKING up chunks of asphalt around them as SEAN 
           GUNS the SNOWMOBILE across HIGHWAY 18 and down the slope 
           toward the Lake. The pursuing snowmobile a second behind 
           when it crosses the highway AND IS WIPED OFF THE FACE OFF 
           THE EARTH, OBLITERATED by a PASSING TOUR BUS!

           EXT. TREES OVERLOOKING THE HIGHWAY - SAME

           Doniger, Kreuter and Janeway standing at the treeline, 
           watching Braden and Sean getting away. What’s worse, 
           they’re HEADING towards the CAR CARRIER of black & 
           whites. The truck is miles ahead of them, but...

                                 DONIGER
                        You better fucking handle this.

                                 KREUTER
                                 (to Janeway)
                        Wake him up.

           EXT. BIG BEAR LAKE (MARINA) - NIGHT

           Looking straight across the FROZEN LAKE, Braden and Sean 
           can see the SEMI rolling down the HIGHWAY 18. The lake is 
           only a mile wide, but seven miles long.
           EXT. ACROSS BIG BEAR LAKE AT 75 MPH - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden and Sean’s snowmobile SKIMMING across the frozen 
           surface of the lake at 75 mph, taking an angle to 
           intercept the CAR CARRIER on the opposite bank. Another 
           few seconds and Highway 18 will take the SEMI away from 
           the lake. They can see the pier of BIG BEAR YACHT CLUB up 
           ahead, Sean steers them toward the BOAT LAUNCH. When--

           --Buzzing ROTOR BLADES blast the frost off the ice in 
           front of them as GABRIEL swoops down to HOVER low over 
           the frozen lake between the snowmobile and the shore. 

                                 SEAN
                        Shit!

           Sean swerves, skids as the drone’s MINIGUN WHIRS. BRRRR! 
           Bullets PERFORATE the ICE in front of them. The jagged, 
           BROKEN ICE just FOLDS UP all around them--

           --And then all sound is instantly MUTED and they’re 
           riding the GURGLING snowmobile to the BOTTOM of the LAKE. 
           The cold like poison as they kick toward the surface, but 
           when they look up they can still see GABRIEL HOVERING 
           over the break in the ice, so they head for the pier, 
           clothes turning to wet cement in the gelid water. 

           Braden reaches the SHADOW of the PIER and HAMMERS the ice 
           with the handle of his SUPERMAG. When that doesn’t work 
           he SHOOTS UP. FWOOM! FWOOM! FWOOM! SHATTERING it, 
           allowing Braden and Sean to PUNCH  through, GASPING, 
           COUGHING. Hypothermia texts to say he’ll just be a 
           minute. But they DUCK BACK UNDER as GABRIEL makes another 
           SWEEP before heading skyward, toward the mountains...

           INT. BIG BEAR YACHT CLUB - MINUTES LATER

           The Yacht Club’s Annual Christmas Party. A BAND playing 
           Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree. Champagne. Honking 
           laughter. Sloppy dancing. Groping. Suddenly the music 
           STOPS as BRADEN and SEAN STAGGER in, soaked and 
           convulsing, steam rising from their clothes. Forty MILFS 
           and COUGARS and plastic surgery CASUALTIES and FINANCIAL 
           PLANNERS on their second families turn around to STARE. 

                                 SEAN
                                 (shivering)
                        Police... Emergency.
           I/E. DONIGER’S SUV (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Doniger heading back down to Los Angeles. The lights of 
           the city below, a circuit board stretching to the ocean. 
           Lots to do yet. His CELL PHONE chirps. He answers.

                                 DONIGER
                        Doniger... Where? You and 
                        Rathborne get your asses over 
                        there before the sheriffs do. Get 
                        that camera if they still have it. 
                        Then do them both. Hear me?

           INT. BIG BEAR YACHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Braden and Sean letting the fire warm them, steaming 
           rising from their clothes. An attractive WOMAN stumbles 
           over to mash her breasts against Braden while she PLANTS 
           an open-mouth KISS on him, leaving a smear of lipstick. 

                                 SEAN
                                 (into phone)
                        Last seen southbound Highway 18. 
                        You need to notify Sheriffs and 
                        CHP. Yes, I’ll fucking hold! 

           Sean digs the CAMCORDER out of his parka.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Fried. But I think the memory card 
                        might still be okay. We gotta be 
                        careful. We don’t know who else is 
                        in with him. Doniger’s a DEPUTY 
                        CHIEF. He asks for it any cop’s 
                        gonna hand it over to him.

           Sean slips it into his pocket just as--

                                 RATHBORNE (O.S.)
                        POLICE! HANDS IN THE AIR! DO IT!

           RATHBORNE and TEAGUE are charging across the room, with 
           their GUNS on Braden and Sean, barking commands. Braden 
           and Sean on their feet and point their guns back at 
           Rathborne and Teague. A Mexican standoff. The music 
           stops. Party guests scatter to the corners of the room.

                                                         TEAGUE
                                              WE’RE NOT FUCKING AROUND 
                                              HERE, SEAN! DROP YOUR GUNS!
                             SEAN
           FUCK YOU, RATHBORNE! YOU’RE 
           BOTH UNDER ARREST! DROP 
           YOUR WEAPONS!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Braden puts a RED DOT on Rathborne’s forehead.

                                 BRADEN
                        Listen to me. I don’t know how you 
                        wound up on the wrong side of 
                        this, but it ain’t too late to 
                        come back. Don’t die for Doniger.

           But it’s TEAGUE who makes a play, spinning to FIRE at 
           Braden. SEAN BLASTS Teague before he can get a shot off. 
           Rathborne turns to shoot Sean, but Braden BLOWS Rathborne 
           out of his socks! Crisscross. Each man SAVING the OTHER! 

           SIRENS outside. People screaming. Sheriff’s DEPUTIES 
           charging in, responding to the 911. DEPUTIES see Braden 
           and Sean standing over two DEAD COPS, with smoking guns. 

           They know better than to wait for an order to drop their 
           weapons. They let their pistols fall and assume the 
           position, fingers laced behind their heads. DEPUTIES 
           pointing guns at them. All of them looking for a reason.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Down on your fucking knees! Now!

           They’re both SLAMMED facedown on the carpet, side by 
           side, arms TWISTED behind them. The familiar rattle of 
           handcuffs biting deep. Braden turns to his son... 

                                 BRADEN
                        I think we may be fucked here.

                                 SEAN
                        You think?

           EXT. ALL OVER LOS ANGELES (VARIOUS LANDMARKS) - NOW

           Tumorous black thunderheads rolling in. LIGHTNING. The 
           first rain drops spatter the concrete river bed... 

           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - 56 MINUTES LATER

           Slashing El Niño RAIN pounds LA with extreme prejudice. A 
           dozen NEWS VANS in front of LAPD HEADQUARTERS. REPORTERS 
           under umbrellas, talking into CAMERAS and LIGHTS.

                                 LILIAN ENRIQUEZ (FOX 11)
                        Tonight, as what may be the storm 
                        of the decade pounds the city Los 
                        Angeles, the scandal of the decade 
                        has rocked the LAPD...
           INT. SEAN AND LAURIE’S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - NIGHT

           Laurie BOLTING off the couch in front of the TELEVISION, 
           fumbling for the remote, turning up the SOUND...

                                 LILIAN ENRIQUEZ (ON TV)
                        ...Two decorated officers lie dead 
                        and the LAPD has arrested two of 
                        its own - a father and son - for 
                        the crime of murder...

           Her hand clapped over her mouth. On the television in are 
           BOOKING PHOTOS of SEAN and BRADEN. She grabs her phone.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM B - NIGHT

           Burly UNIFORMS roughly hauling Sean into INTERROGATION 
           ROOM B. Sean glances up, calculates the angle of the 
           surveillance camera overhead. It has to be now... 

                                 SEAN
                        Hey. Memorandum of Understanding 
                        says I’m entitled to have a league 
                        rep present, and a lawyer. I want 
                        my phone call.

                                 COP
                        Who gives a fuck what you want?

           Sean manages to TWIST away from the cop on his left and 
           SWING his ELBOW into the other’s TEMPLE, knocking him 
           against the wall. Sean BACK-KICKS the other cop’s solar 
           plexus. Sean REACHES down for his CUFF KEY, yanking it 
           from his belt. But he deliberately FUMBLES the cuff key, 
           dropping it under the table. Pretending to REACH for it, 
           his hands briefly DISAPPEARING UNDER THE TABLE. Sean 
           slips the MEMORY STICK out of his SLEEVE and PRESSES it 
           into the grimy medallion of CHEWING GUM on the underside 
           of the table as the other UNIFORMS are flooding in to 
           WRESTLE Sean to the floor, savagely KICKING him. 

           INT. OBSERVATION (OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM A) - NIGHT

           Braden THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR. No shoelaces. No belt. 
           Handcuffs. He’s used to the other side of the table. 

                                 DONIGER (O.S.)
                        They’ve only been arrested. They 
                        haven’t been convicted. No, of 
                        course I don’t. Not for a second. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           PULLING BACK to REVEAL: DONIGER looking in at Braden as 
           he talks to Laurie on his cell, trying to reassure her.

                                 DONIGER (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        No. The roads are crazy and you 
                        won’t be able to see them anyway. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - SAME

           DONIGER enters. Braden doesn’t move. Only his eyes, 
           tracking Doniger as he sits down across from him.

                                 BRADEN
                        Guess you haven’t had a chance to 
                        get that bullet analyzed for me?

                                 DONIGER
                        What bullet would that be?

                                 BRADEN
                        The one from the baseball bat. 
                        Because that’s the one I gave you, 
                        asshole. I still have the one I 
                        pulled out of the telephone pole.

           Doniger smiles. Nice try.

                                 DONIGER
                        No, you don’t. But I understand 
                        the memory card’s still missing. 
                        Better for everyone, safer, 
                        especially for Laurie and Sam, if 
                        we could recover that tonight. 
                                 (smiling)
                        I was gonna blame the bombings on 
                        the Cartels. They bomb cop shops 
                        in Meh-heek-o all the live long 
                        day. But when the smoke clears the 
                        world’s still gonna want a mug 
                        shot. And I’ll be able to give ‘em 
                        yours. You and Sean just killed 
                        two decorated cops in front of 
                        fifty people. They’ll believe 
                        anything I tell them about you. 

           Doniger stands to leave.

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re making the same mistake you 
                        made twenty seven years ago.

                                 DONIGER
                        Yeah? What’s that?

                                 BRADEN
                        You didn’t kill me. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Oh, didn’t I?

           INT. CORRIDOR (MENS CENTRAL JAIL) - LATER

           BRADEN and SEAN shuffle down a grim corridor. ORANGE 
           JUMPSUITS designate them K 8 [Special Segregation]: child 
           molesters, snitches, COPS. A cacophony of CURSES, THREATS 
           as (4) DEPUTIES escort them past caged INMATES. RIOT 
           SHIELDS deflect FLAMING GARBAGE and God knows what else. 

           INT. WATCH COMMANDER’S OFFICE (MENS CENTRAL JAIL) - NIGHT

           Behind the watch commander’s desk sits CUSTODY SENIOR 
           DEPUTY WILL RICHTER. Hard as the hull of a nuclear sub. 
           Richter the PHONE with Deputy Chief Doniger, listening... 

                                 DONIGER (OVER PHONE)
                        We’re all in shock over here. We 
                        got ‘em dead bang on murder one 
                        with special circumstances.

           INT. DONIGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Doniger sighs theatrically, drinks whiskey. Out his 
           WINDOW, Men’s Central looms through a haze of rain.

                                 DONIGER
                        ‘Course the DA wants to march ‘em 
                        to the Death House himself. And 
                        when I think of what a trial would 
                        do to this department. The city...

                                 RICHTER (OVER PHONE)
                        We take care of our own here, sir.

           INT. CELL (PROTECTIVE SEGREGATION UNIT) - MINUTES LATER

           Sean paces the cramped cell he and Braden now share.

                                 SEAN
                        Doniger’s not going to risk 
                        detonating those bombs, not until 
                        he has that memory stick.

                                 BRADEN
                        Or until he knows we’re dead, 
                        which isn’t gonna be long now.

                                 SEAN
                        We’re okay as long as we’re in 
                        protective segregation. The other 
                        inmates can’t get to us here. 

                                 BRADEN
                        We’re cop killers, Sean. It’s not 
                        the inmates I’m worried about. 
                        Listen, Sean, if we don’t...

           Their DOOR clacks OPEN. BIG DEPUTIES swarm into the cell, 
           SLAM Braden and Sean up against the wall.

                                 RICHTER
                        You murdered brother officers.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s fucking bullshit. 

           Richter drives a STUN GUN into Braden’s kidney. ZAP! 
           50,000 volts crackling through his body. Arrgh! Sean 
           wheels on Richter, but another deputy ZAPS him.

                                 RICHTER
                        Sorry. Cases like yours? Just too 
                        important to settle in a fucking 
                        courtroom. Too many variables. 
                        So we handle ‘em in house. But I 
                        never had to do this to another 
                        cop. And that presents me with 
                        kind of a legal quandary. From a 
                        sentencing standpoint, I mean. 
                        Think I found a solution.

           INT. DONIGER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Doniger sits at his desk, fingers steepled, staring out 
           at the rain. Kreuter sits across the room, waiting...

                                 DONIGER
                        She’s on her way here with the

                        the cars into position.

           INT. MAIN TIER (AFTER LIGHTS OUT) - MINUTES LATER

           A BUZZER sounds. A STEEL DOOR swings open and the 
           deputies SHOVE Braden and Sean out on to the MAIN TIER of 
           the ‘3000 FLOOR’ reserved for the county’s most dangerous 
           inmates, locked up in their CELLS. For now. Eerie quiet.

                                 RICHTER
                        Normally, we’d just hang you from 
                        the bars of your cell with a 
                        bedsheet. But in light of your 
                        years of service to the city, 
                        figure I owed you better than 
                        that. I’m going to give you what 
                        the Maasai call a lion’s chance. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What’s a lion’s chance?

                                 RICHTER
                        Well, I’m about to open up those 
                        cells, let those things out of 
                        their cages. Odds are they’re 
                        going to tear you both apart. But 
                        you still have the option of 
                        kicking all their asses and 
                        walking out of here.

           Richter slides Braden his Monadnock SIDE-HANDLE BATON 
           Aircraft-grade aluminum. This isn’t some spasm of 
           magnanimity. He just wants to see a good fight.

                                 BRADEN
                        Lucky us.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A crow’s nest overlooking the MAIN TIER, giving RICHTER a 
           bird’s eye of the whole floor. Takes hold of the 
           MICROPHONE, pulls a COWBELL from a drawer and SHAKES it 
           in front of the mike. CLANG! CLANG! over the PA SYSTEM.

           CONTINUED:

           CELLS: All over the tier, INMATES on their feet. Swinging 
           their arms, cracking their necks, loosening up. Like 
           Moreau’s animals, they know what that sound means: flesh. 

                                 RICHTER (INTO MICROPHONE)
                        Gentlemen. We’ve got a special 
                        treat for you this Christmas Eve. 
                        As some of you are no doubt aware, 
                        tonight we are hosting two of LA’s 
                        Finest. The Bradens. And they’re 
                        all yours. Merry Christmas. 

           And a collective HOWL goes up from every cell. CRIPS, 
           BLOODS, HOOVERS, KOREAN KILLERS, BIKERS, ARYAN BROTHERS 
           crowding against the doors to their cells. Braden and 
           Sean HEAR four hundred fists POUNDING the doors. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           Richter at the MASTER PANEL with a TOUCH-SCREEN FLOOR 
           PLAN, ICONS to LOCK/UNLOCK each cell. Like Liberace, 
           Richter playfully taps the UNLOCK ICON on EVERY CELL...

           INT. MAIN TIER - SAME

           The rapid-fire CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! of MAGNETIC 
           DEAD BOLTS parting all around them. Heavy cell doors 
           SWING open. INMATES pouring out. LEAPING down off the 
           railing to LAND like panthers. They’re surrounded. Two 
           ORANGE jumpsuits in a ocean of BLUE ones.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m sorry I brought you into this.

           With inmates closing in, Sean turns to Braden and smiles. 

                                 SEAN
                        I’m not.

           And we watch as something breaks open behind Sean’s eyes. 
           Whatever’s been trapped down there all this time now 
           surges up to the surface, molten and scalding. Years of 
           pent up rage suddenly freed by the proximity of death. 

           Inmates stop in their tracks, like they’ve hit a force 
           field. Because there is no fear in Braden’s eyes. Sean’s 
           either. Just the promise of pain and death for the first 
           man to come for them. The first and maybe a few more 
           after that. Hey, we’ll see where the night takes us.

           CONTINUED:

           Braden smiles, gripping his baton. No one moves for a 
           moment. Then, like the crowd of Arabs parting for that 
           Cairo Swordsman in Raiders, they clear a path for VIK, 
           the guy Braden dangled off the freeway. He grips a SHANK. 

                                 VIK
                        I’m gonna cut open your chest and 
                        take a shit in your fuckin lungs.

                                 BRADEN
                        Is lung-crapping a thing now? Like 
                        a Colombian necktie or something? 

                                 SEAN
                        I think he just made it up.

                                 BRADEN
                        Pretty creative. 

           Vik LUNGES. The millisecond Vik comes within range, Sean 
           DRIVES a half-fist into Vik’s THROAT. Vik goes down 
           gagging. The tense, crackling silence broken by a few 
           scattered GIGGLES, inmates trying to hold it together. 
           But laughter spreads among them and builds until the tier 
           thunders with ROARING LAUGHTER. Braden stares at Sean... 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You been holding out on me kid.

                                 SEAN
                        Fifteen years of Muay Thai and Jiu 
                        Jitsu. I said I didn’t like to 
                        fight. I never said I didn’t know 
                        how. You ready for this, old man?

                                 BRADEN
                        You kiddin’? I live for this shit.

           Braden spins, SWINGS the BATON, shattering THREE FACES, 
           like smashing ceramic piggy banks off a shelf. Braden 
           LEAPS over them, wades straight into the INMATES like a 
           samurai with rabies. He spent years swinging a baton on 
           the street and brings every bit of that knowledge to 
           bear. Inmates BLOWN backward as if from a shotgun blast. 
           Snapping ulna. Smashing kneecaps. Ribs snap like wicker, 
           Inmates collapsing, gasping, gurgling moans.

           Sean fights like a man possessed. Everything he has, 
           every atom of pent up rage, flowing into the ugliest kata 
           you’ve ever seen. Father and son fighting back to back, 
           like Alan Ladd and Van Heflin in Shane, flickering among 
           the mob like two orange flames. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           They’re fighting damn near two hundred men, but as the 
           inmates crowd in, their numbers actually work against 
           them. Because no more than five or six can come at them 
           at once. And the men shoving in from behind, push row 
           after row right into the path of Sean’s bloodthirsty 
           fists and Braden’s swinging baton. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM (RICHTER LOOKING DOWN ON THE BATTLE)

           Richter and the other deputy watch Sean and Braden dodge, 
           strike, and move, going for position, trying to put their 
           backs to the wall. The inmates instinctively wheeling to 
           cut them off, men practiced in mass predation.

                                 DEPUTY
                        They’re not making this easy, I’ll 
                        give ‘em that. 

           They’re actually holding their own, after a full minute. 
           A lifetime in a street fight. But adrenaline will only 
           take a man so far and they can’t keep this up much 
           longer. Inmates close in like a collapsing star. 

                                 RICHTER
                        Gettin’ tired. Won’t be long now. 

           INT. MAIN TIER - SAME

           The inmates have found their rhythm now - slash and 
           retreat - wear them down. Hissing shanks LASH Sean’s back 
           and shoulders. Braden sucking wind, lurching drunkenly, 
           swinging wild, trying to hold them off. Sweat making it 
           hard to grip his baton. Braden looks like he’s about to 
           pass out when SMILEY (from the liquor store) comes at 
           him. A young BLACK GANGSTER attacks Sean. And that’s when 
           a Christmas Miracle occurs. The BLACK GANGSTER lunges at 
           Sean, aiming for his throat. But Sean dodges the flashing 
           shank by inches and the BLADE meant for him instead finds 
           the throat of SMILEY, behind Braden! The SHANK buried to 
           its masking tape hilt in the SMILEY’S NECK! Via Con Dios.

                                 BLACK GANGSTER
                        Oh, shit...

           Everything comes to a screeching halt. A spell broken. 
           Somnambulists awakened. Angry murmurs. Growling curses. 

                                 SEAN
                        Now you’ve done it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The black kid stares in horror as the Mexican gangster 
           crumples and dies. He turns to the others as if to 
           explain, but two more MEXICAN GANGSTERS are already on 
           him, stabbing and stomping. BLACK GANGSTERS come to his 
           aid. And the fighting now SPREADS like a Rube Goldberg 
           zombie outbreak. Everywhere INMATES turn on EACH OTHER. 
           Gang rivalries, street vendettas, homicidal grudges 
           blazing back to life as Braden and Sean put their backs 
           to the wall for support as much as protection. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           Richter is now staring down at a full-blown jail riot, a 
           boy who played with matches and set his house on fire. 

                                 DEPUTY
                        This is bad, Richter.

           Richter POUNDS his fist on the ALARM BUTTON. KLAXONS fill 
           the facility. SIREN LIGHTS pulsing everywhere.

           INT. MAIN TIER - 93 SECONDS LATER

           The riot still raging when as TEAR GAS GRENADES land in 
           their midst. The inmates reel and scatter. The gas 
           spreads like pouring gray paint into a glass of water. 

           RICHTER and two dozen DEPUTIES charge on to the tier in 
           BODY ARMOR. HELMETS and FOGGIN GAS MASKS. BATONS. X-REP 
           SHOTGUNS. Advancing behind RIOT SHIELDS. 

           Suddenly, a WAR CRY goes up and INMATES charge the 
           deputies from every side. Little Big Horn in a box canyon 
           of cement and steel, hurling themselves against the 
           deputies’ riot shields, trying to wrench them away. 
           Deputies answer with X-REP SHOTGUNS, firing wireless 
           TASER DARTS, 950,000 volts, inmates buckling, convulsing. 

           In the chaos and confusion, Richter sees TWO BODIES in 
           torn ORANGE JUMPSUITS facedown among the BODIES in BLUE. 
           Richter grips the shoulder of the deputy from the control 
           room. Richter nudges Braden’s body with his boot. No 
           movement. The deputy kicks Sean’s body over on to its 
           back. But the man in the orange jumpsuit is not Sean! 
           Richter flips over the other man. It’s not Braden!

           Two bodies in blue jumpsuits now LEAP to their feet. 
           Braden and Sean playing possum. Braden TACKLES Richter, 
           tears off his gas mask and POUNDS him unconscious. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sean snakes his right arm around the other deputy’s 
           throat, in a mata leon CHOKE HOLD until his eyes roll and 
           he blacks out. They drag both deputies into an open cell.

           INT. CHECKPOINT - TWO MINUTES LATER

           The young DEPUTY manning the checkpoint sees two DEPUTIES 
           coming down the corridor toward his GATE. One has his arm 
           draped over the other for support. The deputy might not 
           recognize them, but we do. It’s BRADEN and SEAN wearing 
           stolen uniforms, body armor, gas masks and helmets. 

                                 SEAN
                        Open the gate! NOW, God damn it! 
                        He’ll bleed out we don’t get him 
                        to the infirmary. 

           The deputy OPENS the GATE and rushes to help his comrade. 
           Kid never sees the PUNCH that knocks him to the floor. 

           INT. FROM THE CHECKPOINT INTO JAIL ADMINISTRATION - NOW

           Sean and Braden walk out into the crowded deputies’ 
           BULLPEN, a maze of cubicles and work stations, buzzing 
           with DEPUTIES. Trying to look casual in full tac gear, 
           gas masks. The deputies too busy to take notice of them. 
           Pulsing, adrenalized breath FOGGING their masks. It’s 
           like crossing a schoolyard full of Hitchcock’s Birds. 

           A DEPUTY on the phone gives them a funny look as they 
           pass. Braden gives him a curt nod. The deputy puts down 
           the phone, walking after them. But before he can ask what 
           the fuck they’re doing in here, Sean raises his RIOT GUN 
           and FIRES a GAS GRENADE. KUNK! Striking the DEPUTY’s 
           chest, knocking him into the wall of his cubicle. Sean 
           FIRING gas GRENADES across the bullpen. KUNK! KUNK! KUNK! 

           Gas hisses out of the grenades, spreading quickly. Sean 
           and Braden running through the rising CLOUDS of TEAR GAS. 
           DEPUTIES choking, staggering from their cubicles, raising 
           their WEAPONS as Sean and Braden run past, but stinging, 
           water-filled eyes make it impossible to shoot without 
           hitting each other. A DEPUTY lurches into Braden’s path, 
           raising his Glock, but Braden twists the GLOCK out of his 
           hand as he flips him to the floor. They keep running--
           EXT. MEN’S CENTRAL (WALLED COURTYARD) - CONTINUOUS

           --Out through the HEAVY STEEL DOUBLE DOORS into the 
           WALLED INTAKE COURTYARD where several DEPUTIES with 
           SHOTGUNS are leading a dozen chained-together ARRESTEES 
           off a JAIL TRANSPORT BUS to be processed. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Whole goddamned facility is 
                        overrun!

           The young deputies trade panicked looks.

                                 SEAN
                        Secure these doors. We have to 
                        hold them here!

           The DEPUTIES scrambling to HANDCUFF the HANDLES of the 
           doors TOGETHER just as the DEPUTIES that were pursuing 
           them begin SHOVING against the doors from the inside. The 
           deputies outside busy holding them shut while Sean and 
           Braden climb into the JAIL TRANSPORT BUS.

           I/E. JAIL TRANSPORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Braden LEVERS the DOORS shut and STUMBLES sideways as 
           Sean POPS the CLUTCH too quickly and the BUS LURCHES 
           forward, STUTTERS and STALLS--

                                 SEAN
                        Come on...

           --Now the DEPUTIES know something’s wrong, swarming the 
           bus. OUT OF THE VEHICLE! Seanwrestling the SHIFTER, GEARS 
           GRINDING. The deputies OPEN FIRE: BOOM! BOOM! The barred 
           windows IMPLODE around them, peppering them with broken 
           glass and buckshot. Braden and Sean hunching low, under 
           the gunfire.

                                 BRADEN
                        Maybe we should ask them for a 
                        push.

                                 SEAN
                        You ask them!

           Braden FIRES back over the deputies’ heads BAM! BAM! SEAN 
           finally slots the shifter into GEAR. Sean FLOORS IT 
           across the courtyard, SMASHING OUT THROUGH THE MAIN GATE--

           Sean CRANKS the WHEEL and the lumbering bus LURCHES south 
           on VIGNES STREET, heading for CESAR CHAVEZ AVENUE. Braden 
           looks back at the Sheriff’s INTERCEPTORS roaring right up 
           their ass. No chance of losing them in this pig. Up 
           ahead, Sean sees more INTERCEPTORS screeching in to block 
           their path. They’re boxed in. Gonna be a short trip.

           Braden narrows his eyes, focused at the street ahead...

           EXT. CESAR CHAVEZ AVENUE - NOW

           The bus comes to an abrupt STOP right in the middle of 
           Cesar Chavez, quickly surrounded. Deputies using their 
           cars for cover, taking up shooting positions.

           Lt. Childress shoots the mayor a disapproving look.

           EXT. CULVERT - MINUTES LATER

           West bank of the LOS ANGELES RIVER, WATER spewing out the 
           mouth of a CULVERT, rushing down the bank to join the 
           RIVER as SEAN scrambles out, hauling BRADEN with him. The 
           river RISING, packing on muscle as it climbs its banks. 
           LAPD HELICOPTERS approaching now, their SEARCHLIGHTS 
           getting closer... And they can’t go back in the culvert. 
           They’ll drown. They’re trapped out here in the open...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The AIR HORN of a TRAIN. The HEADLIGHTS of a CSX ENGINE 
           pulling fifty FREIGHT CARS, rattling down the track along 
           the river, kachunka-chank-kachunka-chank-kachunka-chank.

                                 SEAN
                        Move!

           They scramble up the slope, running to keep up with the 
           train. HELICOPTERS getting closer as Sean levers himself 
           into a FREIGHT CAR. Reaches back to PULL Braden in, both 
           ducking INSIDE just as a helicopter’s SPOTLIGHT hits it.

           INT. FREIGHT CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Catching their breath as the city rolls by outside, 
           kachunka-chank-kachunka-chank...

                                 BRADEN
                        We got anything like a plan here? 

                                 SEAN
                        Recover that memory stick. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Just broke out of County and you 
                        want to break into Headquarters?

                                 SEAN
                        It’s the one place in the city 
                        they won’t be looking for us.

                                 BRADEN
                        Because nobody thinks we’re that 
                        stupid. Everybody in that building 
                        thinks we murdered two of our own. 
                        Four hundred pissed-off coppers 
                        and they’re not looking to put us 
                        in handcuffs. They’ll kill us both 
                        soon as we set foot in there. 

                                 SEAN
                        That’s a distinct possibility. But 
                        this isn’t just about us anymore. 

           The rain-veiled SKYLINE passing by. Christmas lights. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Doniger detonates those bombs, the 
                        whole town tears itself apart. Los 
                        Angeles as we know will cease to 
                        exist.

                        We both swore the same oath. To 
                        protect the people of this city. 

           Braden knows he’s right. His son. His partner. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Whatever happens tonight, Sean. 
                        It’s been a real honor. To serve 
                        with you. See the man you turned 
                        out to be. She’d be proud.  

           Sean takes that in. We HEAR the Harry Simeone Chorale’s 
           The Little Drummer Boy - a haunting ticking clock through 
           the following sequence. Pa rum pum pum pum...

                                                             INTERCUTTING:

           EXT. ANGEL’S POINT ROAD (ELYSIAN PARK) - NIGHT

           Deserted road on a hill crest overlooking Los Angeles, 
           Sentinel MERCS, flawlessly disguised as LAPD OFFICERS, 
           opening the TRUNKS of the BLACK & WHITES and double-
           checking the DEVICES. Done, they peel off, bound for 
           targets all over the city. Rum pum pum pum...

           I/E. CODE 7 UNIFORMS (SOUTH MAIN STREET) - NIGHT

           CODE 7 UNIFORMS, serving the law enforcement community 
           for over thirty years. MANNEQUINS in LAPD UNIFORMS in the 
           WINDOW. SMASH! A CINDERBLOCK flying through the window. 
           Braden and Sean ransacking the place. In and out.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        If we recover that memory stick 
                        and get it to the media, we can 
                        expose Doniger before he detonates 
                        those bombs. Neutralize him. 

           INT. FREIGHT CAR - SAME

           Preparing to jump from the moving freight car.

                                 BRADEN
                        I think I know how to get us in.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah? What’d you have in mind?

                                 BRADEN
                        Something really fucking dumb.
           EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Two UNIFORMED COPS lead an ARRESTEE through a crushing 
           throng of REPORTERS on their way into the building...

           INT. CROWDED LOBBY (LAPD HEADQUARTERS) - CONTINUOUS

           ALLEN, Xavier’s huge bodyguard from the Soho House, 
           lumbers into LAPD HEADQUARTERS in HANDCUFFS, in the 
           CUSTODY of the two UNIFORMED LAPD OFFICERS, GRIPPING his 
           huge arms. You don’t look twice at cops with an arrestee. 
           BRADEN and SEAN wearing stolen uniforms, duty jackets to 
           conceal the fact that their badges and sidearms are gone. 
           Walking him through a forest of BLUE. Rum pum pum pum...

           INT. CORRIDOR (LAPD HEADQUARTERS) - CONTINUOUS

           ALLEN takes up most of the corridor. Braden and Sean 
           mostly concealed by his bulk. Other COPS have to step 
           aside to get out of their way as they move him along. 

                                 ALLEN
                                 (whispering)
                        You know, I said I owed you one, I 
                        was talkin’ about gettin you laid 
                        or breakin’ somebody’s legs. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Like I need your help for that.

           INT. ELEVATOR (ASCENDING) - CONTINUOUS

           Allen practically fills up the elevator, Braden and Sean 
           up against the walls at his sides. 

                                 ALLEN
                        AW, MAN!

                                 BRADEN
                        What?

                                 ALLEN
                        I just realized. I’m CHEWBACCA! 
                        You made me fuckin Chewbacca!

                                 SEAN
                        What’s wrong with Chewbacca? 
                        Chewie’s a hero for Christ’s sake. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN
                        And you look like Chewbacca.

                                 ALLEN
                        Fuck you.

           DING! The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and - Oh shit, why HIM? Why 
           NOW? - Braden’s academy rival OFFICER TALMADGE steps into 
           the elevator! But Talmadge doesn’t really look at them. 
           Just gives them a cursory nod as he PUSHES [6] on the 
           PANEL, turns his back on them to face the DOORS. The four 
           of them riding up together. Pa rum pum pum pum... 

           EXT. 101 FREEWAY OVERPASS (OVER FIGUEROA STREET) - NIGHT

           The first BLACK & WHITE arrives at its target 
           destination: The crowded 101 overpass above Figueroa 
           Street, downtown LA. The MERC pulls to the shoulder, 
           steps out, vaults a guardrail, jogs away down an icy 
           slope into the rainy night. Rum pum pum pum...

           INT. ELEVATOR (ASCENDING) - NIGHT

           Talmadge watching the NUMBERS climb. 3-4-5 Braden, Sean 
           and Allen all staring at the back of Talmadge’s head, as 
           it cocks slightly - did I just see what I think I saw - 
           and now, excruciatingly slowly, Talmadge TURNS to LOOK 
           over his shoulder at BRADEN. And Braden and Talmadge LOCK 
           EYES, the moment stretching out... 

           EXT. LA LIVE (STAPLES CENTER) - NIGHT

           Crowds of SKATERS wobbling around a hundred foot 
           CHRISTMAS TREE in the middle of the ice rink between the 
           Staples Center and the Nokia Theater, as a BLACK & WHITE 
           car bomb pulls into LA LIVE. Rum pum pum pum...

           INT. ELEVATOR (ASCENDING) - NIGHT

           Braden doesn’t flinch from Talmadge’s gaze, doesn’t open 
           his mouth to explain... and doesn’t need to. All the 
           proof Talmadge needs is in Braden’s eyes. DING! The bell 
           loud as a gunshot as the doors OPEN on 6. And before he 
           steps out, Talmadge murmurs over his shoulder...

                                 TALMADGE
                        I hope you know what the hell 
                        you’re doin.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Talmadge steps out into the corridor. Doors CLOSE behind 
           him. Braden, Sean, and Allen all trade astonished looks.

           I/E. LAPD AIR SUPPORT DIVISION - NIGHT

           The GUARD waves a MERC in a BLACK & WHITE past the guard 
           gate and we follow it up the RAMP to the top of PARKING 
           STRUCTURE, pulling up to the base of the CONTROL TOWER. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM B - NIGHT

           Braden and Allen keep watch while Sean pulls the MEMORY 
           STICK from under the table, a dab of gum with it. COPS 
           hustling through the corridor past the interrogation 
           room. Sean passes the MEMORY STICK to Allen. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Counting on you, big guy.

           He hands Allen someone’s LAPD RAID JACKET draped over the 
           back of an empty chair. Allen puts it on, puffing up 
           delightedly. Barely fits him, but he loves it.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re hereby deputized.

                                 ALLEN
                        Don’t I get a gun?

                                 SEAN
                        Absolutely not.

           Allen nods, struts down the corridor in his new raid 
           jacket, saluting cops as he passes them in the corridor.

           EXT. A SERIES OF LOCATIONS ALL OVER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Doniger’s BLACK & WHITE CAR BOMBS are pulling into their 
           TARGET DESTINATIONS all over the city. LAPD Stations. 
           Freeways. MERCS leaving the cars, and slipping away... 

           INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           Sean punches a CODE into a KEYPAD and he and Braden enter 
           the EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM. GUNS. HANDGUNS, SHOTGUNS and 
           RIFLES, bearing EVIDENCE TAGS. Braden recovers his 
           SUPERMAG. Sean grabs a GLOCK and slings a COMBAT SHOTGUN. 
           INT. 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Following KREUTER across the mezzanine toward the empty 
           OFFICES of LAPD COMMAND STAFF. Kreuter approaches the 
           WAITING AREA right outside DONIGER’S OFFICE, where Sam 
           sits on a couch, playing Temple Run on his IPad, not for 
           fun but to escape this nightmare. A dozen MERCS subtly 
           boxing Sam in, their hostage whether he knows it or not. 

           INT. DONIGER’S OFFICE - cONTINUOUS

           Laurie paces Doniger’s office. Her eyes puffy from tears. 
           LIVE COVERAGE of the MANHUNT on Doniger’s wall-mounted 
           TV. A shock-proof BRIEFCASE rests on the CABINET behind 
           Doniger. We recognize it as the BIRIS DETONATOR. 

                                 LAURIE
                        There’s something very wrong here, 
                        Wade. About all of this. There’s 
                        gotta be something else going on. 

           Doniger trying to comfort her, hands her a bottled water.

                                 DONIGER
                        I agree. And I’m trying to get to 
                        the bottom of it. Believe me. But 
                        in order to help them, I need to 
                        know everything Sean told you. 

                                 LAURIE
                        Jesus! I already told you. Sean 
                        didn’t tell me anything. Last 
                        thing he told me was they were 
                        following a lead in the desert.

                                 DONIGER
                        Nothing about a camera? Or a 
                        memory card? Nothing like that?

                                 LAURIE
                        Nothing. NOTHING. 

           Kreuter leans over and whispers to Doniger. 

                                 KREUTER
                        Eight of the ten cars are in 
                        position now. We need to move.

           Doniger nods. Okay. Kreuter RUSHES Laurie, GRABS her by 
           the HAIR, twisting her face up to his. She SCREAMS. WADE!

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Look at me! I’ll say this once, so 
                        you better put your fucking 
                        listening cap on. You either tell 
                        me where it is or I walk out there 
                        and cut your son’s throat.

                                 LAURIE
                        Please...

           Kreuter SHOVES her to the floor. 

                                 KREUTER
                        Sheriffs searched ‘em when they 
                        booked ‘em into County. I’m 
                        starting to think maybe it’s at 
                        the bottom of the fucking lake.

           Then ON THE WALL-MOUNTED TV: LILIAN ENRIQUEZ standing 
           under an umbrella among the other REPORTERS out front.

                                 LILIAN ENRIQUEZ (ON TV)
                        ...And now, this story has taken 
                        another shocking turn. I’ve just 
                        been handed a video by a source 
                        who claims the Bradens were framed 
                        by LAPD DEPUTY CHIEF WADE DONIGER. 
                        This graphic video is a FOX 11 
                        EXCLUSIVE...

           Everyone freezes. Kreuter stares, transfixed, like a man 
           watching his house burn to the ground. Doniger stands, 
           television light reflected in his eyes, looking at the TV 
           like it’s an enemy risen from the grave...   

                                 DONIGER
                        No.

           Laurie reacts with a mixture of terror and triumph.

                                 LAURIE
                        Looks like you’re fucked, Wade.

           Enraged, Doniger DRAWS his .357 and BOOM! BLASTS the TV. 
           It flickers, sizzles as he whirls to CRACK Laurie in the 
           side of the head with his pistol butt. She crumples. 
           Doniger picks up the BIRIS DETONATOR, turning to Kreuter. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Bring the kid.
           INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS (WAR ROOM) - NIGHT

           Lt. CHILDRESS and every other cop in the war room glued 
           to DIGITAL SCREENS receiving ENRIQUEZ’S LIVE BROADCAST. 
           VIDEO: BRADEN HANGS BY HIS WRISTS. DONIGER TAUNTING HIM.

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re gonna murder a whole city.

                                 DONIGER
                        Not quite. But I’m sure going to 
                        kick the shit out of it...

                                 MAYOR
                        The hell is this?

                                 LT. CHILDRESS
                        Where’s Doniger?

           INT. 10TH FLOOR MEZZANINE  - NOW

           Doniger and Kreuter hustle toward the elevators, led by a 
           line of MERCS in ARMOR, HELMETS, BALLISTIC MASKS, holding 
           SHIELDS in front of them like a Hoplite Phalanx. Past 
           subtlety now. They’re going to shoot their way out of 
           this building. Kreuter drags SAM along with him. 

           DING! The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and BRADEN and SEAN walk 
           out, like two gunslingers stepping into the street.

                             SEAN
                                                          SAM
           Sam!
                                              Dad!

                                 DONIGER
                        Kill em.

           ALL FUCKING HELL BREAKS LOOSE. The MERCS FIRING their 
           M4s. Braden and Sean FIRING back as they DIVE for cover, 
           but their bullets ricochet off the mercs’ SHIELDS. 
           Ergonomic chairs and standing desks BLOWN APART. Drywall 
           spurting as BULLETS stitch across the walls, SHATTERING 
           framed MOTIVATIONAL POSTERS - Teamwork, Excellence, 
           Leadership - leaving blackened HOLES in the wall.  

           Braden and Sean pinned down by AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE. 
           The MERCS closing in on them. Suddenly, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
           BACKUP arrives! LAPD COPS rushing in to ENGAGE the MERCS! 
           TALMADGE and LT. CHILDRESS leading the charge. Battle-
           honed MERCS shooting it out with street-hardened COPS. 
           Muzzles FLASH! Gunsmoke ACTIVATES ceiling SPRINKLERS. The 
           FIRE ALARM BLARES. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A strobe-lit rainstorm to match the one outside. Shooters 
           splashing through an inch of water. CASINGS clattering 
           the wet floor. The cops outgunned, but holding their own. 
           *Think HEAT inside LAPD HEADQUARTERS! 

           Doniger rolls a FIRE EXTINGUISHER down the corridor and 
           SHOOTS it, causing it to EXPLODE, filling the air between 
           him and the cops with CHEMICAL FOG, instant SMOKE SCREEN. 
           Doniger and Kreuter are gone. And they’ve taken Sam...

           Braden FIRES his SUPERMAG, killing two mercs by sending 
           BULLETS THROUGH the EYE HOLES in their BALLISTIC MASKS. 
           Sean sees Laurie STAGGER out of Doniger’s Office, into 
           the line of fire. Dazed. Her head’s bleeding. A MERC 
           turns his M4 on Laurie, about to FIRE when--

                                 SEAN
                                 (running for her)
                        LAURIE!

           --LT. CHILDRESS TACKLES Laurie to the floor, just as the 
           MERC FIRES. Bullets hit Childress in the back. Sean 
           charges the MERC, FIRING his COMBAT SHOTGUN. BOOM! BOOM! 
           BOOM! The force of impacts BLOWING the MERC backward 
           through a window to tumble TEN STORIES to the street.

           Braden and Sean rush to Laurie. Sean checks her over, her 
           pupillary response. She’s okay. Just stunned. Braden 
           inspects Childress’ wounds. Her vest caught them.

                                 BRADEN
                        Thanks, Sweetheart.

                                 LT. CHILDRESS
                                 (gritted teeth)
                        De nada, asshole.

           Sean turns to his father.

                                 SEAN
                        Let’s go.

                                 LT. CHILDRESS
                        They’re literally surrounded by 
                        cops. No way they’re getting out 
                        of the building.

                                 BRADEN
                        We got in.
           I/E. PARKING GARAGE - NOW

           DOZEN COPS running through the parking lot after Doniger, 
           A dozen GUNS on him. Doniger holding SAM up as a HUMAN 
           SHIELD, he and Kreuter MOVING as a unit, back to back. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Stand down or the boy dies.

           At the end of the row: the V-100 COMMANDO, LAPD’s 
           infamous seven-ton SWAT “tank.” Doniger SHOVES Sam in and 
           he and Kreuter climb in after him. 

           INT. V-100 (MOVING) - SAME

           Doniger DRIVES. SAM squirms in back, his wrist cuffed to 
           a hold bar. SWAT ENTRY TOOLS clamped to the bulkhead; 
           ROAD FLARES, BOLT CUTTERS, gas-powered RESCUE SAW. Sam 
           stretches, little fingers splayed, but can’t reach... 

           Kreuter opens the BIRIS, flips the first TOGGLE from BLUE 
           to FLASHING RED, pops the Lexan cover off the TRIGGER...

                                 KREUTER
                        Happy New Year.

           EXT. SPRING STREET - NOW

           KA-BOOM! The phony BLACK & WHITE approaching LAPD 
           HEADQUARTERS on SPRING EXPLODES in ROILING CLOUD of 
           atomized concrete. Cars FLIP OVER. Others COLLIDE. 

           The chaos and CLOUDS of DUST distract the COPS blocking 
           the PARKING GARAGE EXIT RAMP just as the V-100 RAMS 
           through two black & whites, spinning the cars like the 
           bat wing doors on a saloon. Loose in LA. Unstoppable. 

                                 RTO
                        All units, Air 18 has suspect

                        Street. Suspect has a hostage.

           Screech! LAPD BLACK & WHITES pinching in to barricade the 
           intersection up ahead. LIGHTBARS twirling, spilling red 
           and blue reflections across the shimmering street. The V-
           100 CLIMBS over THE BLACK & WHITES like a MONSTER TRUCK.
           I/E. UNMARKED CAPRICE - NOW

           Sean DRIVES like a MANIAC on sidewalks, blowing through 
           intersections, spinning out in the rain. Braden riding 
           shotgun with an MP5. Ahead, a HELICOPTER SPOTLIGHT shines 
           down on a dozen LAPD BLACK & WHITES pursuing the V-100. 

           KREUTER pops up through the HATCH with an M4, FIRING, 
           causing them to CRASH. Sean SLALOMS through WRECKS when a 
           shot-up BLACK & WHITE veers into a parked car in front of 
           him, CATAPULTING it skyward like a spinner dolphin and 
           Sean FLOORS it UNDER the airborne vehicle before it 
           CRASHES back down as Doniger STEERS the V-100 UNDER the-- 

           EXT. 101 FREEWAY OVERPASS (OVER FIGUEROA STREET) - NIGHT

           Kreuter ducks back inside, pulling the hatch closed as 
           the V-100 passes UNDER the 101 OVERPASS above Figueroa 
           Street, where we saw one of the CAR BOMBS planted... 

           I/E. V-100 ROARING OUT FROM UNDER THE OVERPASS - SAME

           Kreuter GRABS the BIRIS, flips a SWITCH to FLASHING RED, 
           POPS the Lexan cover off to press the next TRIGGER--
           --KA-BOOM! The BLACK & WHITE DETONATES like Mt. St. 
           Helens, turning the OVERPASS into a GEYSER of grey dust 
           and broken concrete. The first pursuing BLACK & WHITES 
           slam on their brakes too late. Thousands of tons of 
           concrete rains down to CRUSH and BURY them...  

                            BRADEN
                                                          SEAN
           Watch it!
                                              How could I not see that?

           I/E. SEAN’S UNMARKED CAPRICE - NOW

           Sean SWERVES the car to CUT across GRAND AVENUE, catching 
           AIR as it SOARS off the wide concrete stairs leading down 
           into GRAND PARK, blasting through the Memorial Fountain 
           to intercept the V-100, pulling abreast as it heads for--

           EXT. 6TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Below the bridge, the storm-swollen LA RIVER ROARS by, 
           mud-thickened and muscular, like a giant conveyor belt of 
           wet cement, carrying uprooted trees and other floating 
           debris sucked from its banks by the powerful current down 
           a wide concrete channel with slopes on both sides.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN
                        Try to keep it steady.

                                 SEAN
                        You sure about this?

           Braden SLINGS the MP5 to free both hands, OPENS his 
           PASSENGER DOOR and--

                                 BRADEN
                        Fuck no.

           --LEAPS! Braden’s FINGERS finding the LIP of a gun port, 
           CLINGING for dear life, LEGS dragging inches from the 
           back wheel. KREUTER pops out of the hatch, M4 on Braden 
           HAULING himself up. Kreuter SMILES, savoring this moment.

           --As the V-100 crosses the BRIDGE, Braden sees a SEMI 
           TRUCK, towing an ALUMINUM FUEL TANKER, coming the other 
           way. The bridge is TOO NARROW for both vehicles! The 
           TRUCK DRIVER slams on his breaks, causing his TRUCK to 
           JACKKNIFE across both rain-slick lanes of the bridge. 

           Doniger CRANKS the wheel and the V-100 SWERVES toward the 
           edge of the bridge, its BATTERING RAM BLASTING through 
           the CONCRETE RAILING, sailing out into the night. Kreuter 
           goes flying. Braden JUMPS CLEAR, disappearing beneath the 
           waves as the V-100 CRASHES into the roiling LA RIVER! 

           The truck’s cylindrical TANKER TRAILER swings out off the 
           bridge, DANGLING over the river like a Sword of Damocles.  

           Sean SLAMS on his BRAKES, skidding out as the fierce 
           current pulls the V-100 away. He jumps out of his car, 
           running on to the bridge. The V-100 is too far away.

                                 KREUTER
                        Help me! God damn it! Help!

           Sean looks down and sees KREUTER clinging to the TANKER 
           TRAILER as it SWAYS over the river. Suddenly, the tanker 
           GROANS, HOSES SNAPPING LOOSE, WHIPPING free as the FUEL 
           TANK detaches from the truck and FALLS OFF, crashing into 
           the water. Kreuter instantly SWALLOWED by the current. 
           But the TANK floats like a giant pontoon, three hundred 
           GALLONS of GASOLINE now chasing the V-100!

                                 SEAN
                        David 14 to control. We have

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Sean jumps in the car, REVERSING off the BRIDGE into a 
           moonshiner’s turn and SMASHES through a GATE on to the 
           access road that parallels the river. Sean over-driving 
           to catch up with the V-100 as it rafts on the current.

           I/E. V-100 - SAME

           The V-100 is nominally amphibious, but it’s not a boat 
           and the river is now POURING in through the gun ports, 
           FLOODING the passenger compartment. ROAD FLARES, TRAUMA 
           KITS and other debris (including the waterproof BIRIS 
           DEVICE) are FLOATING inside the V-100. Doniger scrambles 
           for the HATCH, tries to open it, but the hatch is stuck!

           Doniger RAMS his SHOULDER against the HATCH. No good. He 
           then GRABS a RESCUE AXE off its spring clamps on the 
           bulkhead and SWINGS it. Sparks spurting as it the axe 
           CUTS through the latch. 

           The RISING WATER now sloshes up over Sam’s legs. Sam 
           SCREAMS, trying desperately to wriggle his wrist free. 

                                 SAM
                        Wait! Help me! 

           Doniger ignores Sam, POPS the HATCH, tosses the AXE out 
           on to the roof, grabs the BIRIS, and climbs out on the 
           hood. A HELICOPTER SPOTLIGHT finds the V-100. Doniger 
           sees a PAIR of sodden BOOTS on the hood in front of him, 
           following them up to SAM BRADEN, The Big Bad Wolf. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Where’s my grandson?

           Doniger nods toward the hatch.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        SAM?

           Blades of light from the helicopter’s SPOTLIGHT briefly 
           illuminate little SAM below. The water inside the vehicle 
           has reached his chest and is still rising...

                                 SAM
                        Granddad! Help!

                                 BRADEN
                        Hang on, kid. Be just a minute.

           Braden TOSSES HANDCUFFS on the hood in front of Doniger. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Put ‘em on. 

                                 DONIGER
                        I don’t think so.

           Doniger’s hand drifts toward the AXE...

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                        You wanna save that kid? Then you 
                        got a problem. Because I sure as 
                        shit plan on resisting arrest.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s not a problem, Wade. That’s 
                        a treat.

           Doniger GRABS the AXE and SWINGS, the blade missing him 
           by inches as Braden LEAPS back, but his HEELS hit the 
           EDGE, and he’s pin-wheeling his arms to keep from going 
           over when Doniger SWINGS again. Braden DUCKS, the blade 
           hissing above him. He catches Doniger with a KIDNEY 
           PUNCH. OOF! Doniger reverses, SMASHING the axe HANDLE 
           into Braden’s FACE, KNOCKING Braden BACK off his feet. 

                                 DONIGER
                        You’re not comin back from this.

           Dazed, Braden manages to ROLL clear just as Doniger 
           BRINGS the AXE down to GOUGE the hood. Braden scrambles 
           back into a wobbly fighting stance, spits blood. 

                                 DONIGER (CONT’D)
                                 (impressed)
                        God, I missed you, man.

                                 BRADEN
                        You always were a pussy, Wade.

           Doniger twirls the axe, changing his grip on it as he and 
           Braden circle each other, constantly shifting their 
           footing to keep from falling off the rocking vehicle. 
           BLACK & WHITES are chasing them along both banks. 

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                                 (circling Doniger)
                        Look around, Wade. Unless you’re 
                        planning to swim to Catalina, 
                        you’re done. It’s over.

           The BIRIS slides back and forth on the hood between them.

                                 (circling Braden)
                        The hell it is. Right there’s my 
                        exit visa. When I detonate the 
                        rest of those bombs, the LAPD’s 
                        gonna have a lot bigger problems 
                        than catching me. I’ll be in 
                        fucking Dubai by the time they 
                        remember to look for me again.

           INSIDE THE V-100: the water is up to Sam’s neck now. 

                                 SAM
                        Hurry! Please!

           EXT. THE RIVER BANK - NOW

           SIRENS wailing, the LAFD’s SWIFT WATER RESCUE TRUCK, 
           RESCUE 88, backs up to the cement river bank. RESCUE 88 
           tows a TRAILER with two KAWASAKI STX-15F JET SKIS on it. 
           Sean pulls up just as the FIREFIGHTERS are getting out. 
           The FIRE CAPTAIN looking over at Sean with dread. 

                                 SEAN
                        The hell are you waiting for?!!??

                                 FIRE CAPTAIN
                        I can’t send my men into that. 
                        We’ll have to get in front of 
                        them, try to catch them downstream 
                        with a throw-line. But we’re not 
                        putting craft in the water. 

                                 SEAN
                        Bullshit! My SON is out there!

           --Sean GRABS the FIRE CAPTAIN by his collar. 

                                 FIRE CAPTAIN 
                        Hey! I’m sorry, I’m SORRY, but I 
                        can’t. Look we got rules.

           The other RESCUE FIREFIGHTERS move in on Sean, but Sean 
           DRAWS his PISTOL, stopping them in their tracks...

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck your rules.

           Sean YANKS the PIN out to UNHOOK the TRAILER and KICKS 
           the TRAILER away from the truck. It ROLLS down the cement 
           bank and PLUNGES straight into the raging river. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The trailer is instantly SWALLOWED by dark water, but the 
           TWO JET SKIS bob up like corks. The current pulling both 
           craft downstream, picking up speed.

           Sean grabs a RESCUE LINE off the truck and loops it 
           across his chest like a bandolier as he RUNS along the 
           bank after the jet ski and LEAPS on to it like a trick 
           rider leaping on to the back of a galloping horse. Sean 
           CRANKS the THROTTLE and the jet ski RIPS open a wake 
           across the river, roaring downstream after the V-100. His 
           son. His father. His city.  

           Meanwhile, the SECOND JET SKI is just BOBBING downstream 
           like a Popsicle stick in a rain gutter, when a HAND 
           sprouts from the water to CLAW the GUNWALE as the current 
           carries it past. KREUTER CLIMBS on the jet ski, still 
           wearing his M4 slung across his chest in a combat sling. 
           Kreuter REVS it like a Harley and TAKES OFF after Sean... 

           EXT. V-100 - SAME

           Doniger SWINGS the AXE upward. Braden WHIPS his HEAD back 
           and the BLADE passes inches in front of him, then before 
           Doniger can swing again, Braden THROWS an UPPERCUT, 
           catching Doniger under the chin, knocking him backward, 
           and the axe clatters over the side into the river. 

           But Doniger ROLLS cunningly and KICKS Braden’s LEGS out 
           from under him and Braden FALLS backward OFF the V-100 
           INTO the muscular CURRENT, like tossing him into a 
           cyclone. Braden instantly DISAPPEARS, pulled UNDER...

           Doniger GRABS the BIRIS, quickly POPS the LATCHES and 
           OPENS the case. The SWITCHES are all FLASHING RED. ARMED.

           UNDERWATER: Raging darkness. The maelstrom SUCKING Braden 
           right UNDER the fourteen-ton V-100. Braden fights panic 
           as he blindly CLAWS at the underside of the vehicle. One 
           flailing HAND just CATCHES the right rear tire, the 
           current flipping Braden around as he reaches up for the 
           wheel well, the gun port, PULLING himself up to... 

           Braden BREAKS the roiling surface, GASPING, and HAULS 
           himself up the opposite side of the V-100, just Doniger 
           pops the Lexan cover off the TRIGGERS.... NO! Braden 
           DIVES across the hood, landing on top of Doniger before 
           he can detonate the bombs. The two men grappling, 
           gouging, both fumbling for the flashing BIRIS as the V-
           100 gallops down the rapids... 
           EXT. ROARING DOWN THE LA RIVER - SAME

           FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! BULLETS STRAFING the WATER in front of 
           Sean and he LOOKS back to see that son of a bitch KREUTER 
           alive and FIRING at him from the saddle of the second JET 
           SKI. FWAP! FWAP! FWAP! Sean SWERVES and DRAWS his PISTOL. 

                                 SEAN
                        You gotta be kidding.

           A high speed pursuit down the LA river. Kreuter and Sean 
           FIRING at each other as their jet skis PASS under a 
           BRIDGE on OPPOSITE SIDES of a cement SUPPORT COLUMN, 
           rounds RICOCHET off the COLUMN between them, Sean’s 
           PISTOL goes to slide-lock -EMPTY- as they come out from 
           under the bridge, their two JET SKIS NECK and NECK. 
           Kreuter brings his M4 up, but Sean GRABS the HOT BARREL 
           of the M4 and STEERS it away, the weapon FIRING WILD as 
           the two craft BUMP and SCRAPE against each other at 60 
           MPH. They are now approaching THE 26th STREET BRIDGE-- 

           Kreuter CRANKS the handlebars, FORCING Sean over and UP 
           an ACCESS RAMP that takes his JET SKI up OUT OF THE 
           WATER, its fiberglass hull SKIMMING up the cement slope 
           on its powerful momentum, heading straight for-- SHIT! 

           Sean’s jet ski actually SLEDS ACROSS 26th STREET, barely 
           missing CROSS TRAFFIC. Cars SKID and CRASH to avoid him 
           as his jet ski SLIDES toward a TACO STAND, scattering 
           PATRONS huddled under the tarp to stay dry and SMASHING 
           through plastic PATIO FURNITURE [Sorry!] before LEAPING 
           the shoulder to LAND--

           --BACK IN THE RIVER BEHIND KREUTER--

           Kreuter STEERS around a nasty looking cement PYLON with a 
           tangle of rebar sprouting from the water. Sean slows his 
           jet ski just long enough to LOOP one end of his RESCUE 
           LINE around the PYLON. Then Sean OPENS the THROTTLE and 
           guns it after Kreuter. Kreuter turns to see Sean pulling 
           abreast of him and Kreuter reaches into his vest for his 
           PISTOL, taking AIM at Sean, who’s SMILING back at him... 

           That’s when Kreuter realizes Sean’s RESCUE LINE is 
           already draped lightly over his shoulders, around his 
           neck, and the SLACK is running out! THWANG! The noose 
           tightens around Kreuter’s NECK and SNAPS it as he’s 
           YANKED off the back of his jet ski at 60 mph.  

           Sean cranks the throttle, heading downstream toward...
           EXT. V-100 - SAME

           Braden and Doniger bruised and bloody, trading vicious 
           PUNCHES. But Braden doesn’t see THE NEXT BRIDGE coming up 
           fast. WHITE WATER curling around its SUPPORT COLUMNS. 
           Doniger grips the hatch as the V-100 broadsides a COLUMN, 
           the IMPACT knocking Braden off his feet. Doniger is on 
           him now, hooking his arm around Braden’s NECK, locking in 
           a CHOKE HOLD, rolling to FORCE Braden’s face UNDERWATER. 

                                 DONIGER
                        I tried to tell you, Braden. You 
                        wouldn’t fucking listen. You don’t 
                        know how to do this anymore.

           Violent bubbles. Braden convulsing, clawing blindly for 
           Doniger, finding instead one of the ROAD FLARES floating 
           near the mouth of the hatch. Braden THUMB-POPS the FLARE, 
           igniting it, as he JABS the BLAZING magnesium FLAME into 
           Doniger’s EYE! ARRGH! Doniger releases Braden, his hands 
           flying to his wound. And with a magician’s aplomb, Braden 
           HANDCUFFS Doniger to the vehicle’s BATTERING RAM. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I still know how to do this, Wade. 
                        And you’re under arrest.

           Braden DISARMS the BIRIS and tosses it into the river.

           I/E. V-100 - NIGHT

           Braden DROPS through the hatch and SWIMS to Sam. Sam has 
           to tilt his head to breathe. He coughs, sputters.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey, kid.

           Braden YANKS the heavy BOLT CUTTERS off their CLAMP, fits 
           them around the cuff chain and snips through it. Braden 
           grabs the boy, hauls him out through the HATCH just as 
           LAFD SWIFT WATER RESCUE arrives on the bridge. The 
           FIREFIGHTERS hustling to deploy their RESCUE LINE. They 
           all see the FUEL TANK hurtling toward the BRIDGE. 

           FIREFIGHTERS lowering a QUICK COLLAR from the bridge. 
           Braden loops harness around Sam, cinches it tight.

                                 SAM
                        What about you?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRADEN
                                 (lying)
                        I’ll catch the next one.

           Firefighters CRANK the WINCH on their VEHICLE, lifting 
           Sam to safety. Laurie wrapping her arms around the boy.   

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        Get them out of here!

           The firefighters bustle Sam and Laurie into RESCUE 88, 
           SLAM THE DOORS and HAUL ASS off the bridge as the FUEL 
           TANK barrels toward the bridge like a runaway train. 
           Braden just watches the FUEL TANK come, too exhausted to 
           swim. As the FUEL TANK CLOSES IN, Doniger braces his feet 
           against the battering ram, twists his wrist, trying to 
           slip his cuff chain. No good. They’re both dead men. 

                                 DONIGER
                        Looks like neither one of us is 
                        going to see the sunrise tomorrow.

           Then VROOM! SEAN LEAPS his JET SKI over the fuel tank, 
           skimming over the V-100 and Braden LEAPS on to the saddle 
           behind Sean just as the FUEL TANK smashes into the V-100 
           with the force of a car wreck. KABOOM! The tanker 
           EXPLODES in a BALL of FLAME that can be seen for miles. 

           For a moment, the river itself is on fire, burning off 
           into islands of flame. NO SIGN of BRADEN or SEAN. Just 
           BURNING PIECES of the jet ski floating down river...

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE MOUTH OF LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAWN

           Christmas morning. Only fitting that there should be 
           BELLS. This one RINGING atop the tower of a RED 
           NAVIGATION BUOY as it rocks with the rolling SWELLS. A 
           SEA LION lounging on the buoy raises its head to BARK at 
           the two interlopers clinging to the rust-streaked 
           aluminum hull below. We didn’t notice them until they 
           came up out of the water. BRADEN and SEAN in up to their 
           necks, DISAPPEARING completely under each rolling SWELL, 
           and RESURFACING as it passes. Not panicked. They’ve been 
           here all night. They have the rhythm now. Swells pass 
           over them. Submerging... Reemerging...

                                 BRADEN
                                 (spits water)
                        How far out you think we are?

           Sean sweeps his wet hair back, looking around.

           CONTINUED:

                                 SEAN
                        Too far to swim, old timer.

                                 BRADEN
                        Speak for yourself. 

           The hostile sea lion BELLOWS at them again.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                                 (to the sea lion)
                        Hey, Salty, why don’t you give it 
                        a rest, you don’t own this thing.

                                 SEAN
                        Actually, he might. I think he’s a 
                        protected species.

                                 BRADEN
                        Of course he is.

           Another SWELL passes over them. We HEAR a MOTOR coming.

                                 BRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You know, they used to have a 
                        saying on the job. You might get 
                        three great loves. Two great dogs.

                                 SEAN
                        But you only get one great 
                        partner. 

                                 BRADEN
                        No disrespect to Gomez. But you’re 
                        the best partner I ever had. 

           Beat.

                                 SEAN
                        You’re the worst. Bar none.

           Both men burst out LAUGHING as another SWELL passes over 
           them. They come up sputtering, coughing, but still 
           laughing when the COAST GUARD PATROL BOAT pulls alongside 
           the buoy. Piloted by a WARRANT OFFICER in a SANTA HAT.

           EXT. SEAN AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           NEWS VANS camped in front of the house. REPORTERS mobbing 
           a CONVOY of LAPD STAFF CARS as they pull up to the front 
           of the house, SHOUTING questions at the tinted windows. 
           TALMADGE and another BIG UNIFORM bull the reporters away 
           from the car as Sean and Braden climb out of the back.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Not so fast, caveman.

           Braden turns to see LT. CHILDRESS stepping out of the one 
           of the other vehicles, striding toward him, PEN in hand. 
           She grabs Braden’s FOREARM and turns it to WRITE 
           something on the inside. Her PHONE NUMBER. She smiles. 

           And when Braden turns back, Talmadge and the other 
           uniforms have PARTED the crowd enough so Braden can see 
           the front of the house now. Sean, Laurie, and Sam are 
           smiling at him. Behind them, their FRONT YARD is a FOREST 
           of CHRISTMAS TREES, every one of them STRUNG with LIGHTS.

                                 SEAN
                        Twenty seven. I know I said we 
                        can’t get ‘em back. But hey it’s a 
                        buyer’s market after the 24th.

           Braden’s face, lit up by a hundred CAMERA FLASHES, as he 
           walks to them. Sean embraces him. So do Laurie and Sam.

                                 SEAN
                        Merry Christmas, Dad.

           And we HEAR Jose Feliciano’s Feliz Navidad as we pull UP 
           and AWAY from the Braden Family, together for Christmas.

                                          THE END
