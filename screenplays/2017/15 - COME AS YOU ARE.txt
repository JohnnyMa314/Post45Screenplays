           FADE IN: 

           ...as a barrage of INTERNET VIDEOS mosaic the screen. Placid  
           at first. Your daily feed. VACATION PORN. YOUR NIECE’S 
           BIRTHDAY. KIM AND KANYE. The world as you want it and then -- 
           a sickness spreads. Lurid content appears. 

           GRAPHIC SEX. ULTRA VIOLENCE. TERRORISM. HATE. A MAN is SET ON 
           FIRE. ANOTHER’s SHOT BY COPS. A WOMAN is RAPED. A PROTESTOR’s 
           BASHED by the POLICE. The world ripping at the seams. Like a 
           virus, this filth seeks to overtake the entire screen until -- 

           One by one -- the images disappear. Deleted. Like pieces 
           removed from a puzzle to reveal in their sanitized absence --

           Our title:          COME AS YOU ARE

                                 BRIE (V.O.)
                        Before I start - for the bleeding 
                        hearts out there - let me give you 
                        a TRIGGER WARNING. What you see 
                        next is gonna disturb you. 

           INSERT VIDEO: BRIE’S WEBCAM - A MANIFESTO

           We’re looking at BRIE SALTER - the hero of this film - 
           addressing the camera in an bleak, bare-bones apartment. 

           Brie’s the girl next door. 28. All-American. Beautiful. But 
           right now, she’s alone. Stripped of make-up or vanity. A 
           thousand yard stare that is undeniably frightening. 

                                 BRIE
                        By the time you see this video, a 
                        lot of people will be dead and the 
                        world’s going to ask why this had 
                        to happen? How did I get here? But 
                        that’s not the right question. The 
                        right question is -- why haven’t 
                        you?

           As she continues, we realize she is seated before an ARSENAL 
           OF WEAPONS. AMMO. TACTICAL VESTS. Ready for a war. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        See, I used to believe the best in 
                        people. Sure, we have our bubbles 
                        but I thought basically we’re good. 
                        Basically we care. But I was naive. 
                        Like you.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Because the truth is when you dig 
                        down beneath the surface, beneath 
                        the artifice and the anonymity, 
                        this is an ugly place, full of hate 
                        and bullies and bigots and racists 
                        and perverts. And I for one can’t 
                        sit back and take it any longer. 

           Her hands are sunk below frame. They emerge holding a GUN. A 
           jet black BERATTA M9.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        This is not a suicide note. I don’t 
                        want to die. But it’s time for 
                        somebody to pull the alarm and wake 
                        this place the fuck up. 
                             (she racks the slide.)
                        I know. I don’t fit the profile so 
                        listen. Let me tell you how I got 
                        here. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. THE COMPANY, LOBBY - DAY (6 MONTHS EARLIER)

           Brie. Bright. Pretty and pure - waiting in the sleek, state 
           of the art offices of a very successful, very ubiquitous 
           SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY.  

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Most people think my generation is 
                        coddled. A bunch of pussies raised 
                        on achievement medals, addicted to 
                        their phones and entitled to the 
                        world.   

           All about this office - overflowing with new-age amenities - 
           cheerful MILLENNIALS, all on devices, hurry about like they 
           are saving the world. Brie watches them with curiosity.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        That wasn’t my experience. I didn’t 
                        have a trust fund. 

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK FARM - DAY

           Impoverished Rural America. A FARMER plows a blighted plot of 
           land. On the back of the tractor, YOUNG BRIE (10) lends a 
           hand. The MAN is her father. They LAUGH at something unheard.
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I’m not complaining. It’s not like 
                        I grew up in Syria or something. 
                        But if there were things I wanted, 
                        like college, a career, I had to 
                        fight. 

           EXT. ARMY BOOT CAMP - FLASHBACK

           A PLATOON of RECRUITS crawl through the muck of an ARMY 
           OBSTACLE COURSE. Land on YOUNG BRIE worming through the dirt. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        To sacrifice. 

           INT. ARMY CAFETERIA - DAY

           Brie, again, in a different queue. A Chow line in a drab ARMY 
           CAFETERIA. As Brie steps up to the trough with her tray.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        It’s just to say - I wasn’t naive. 

           EXT. AFGHANI DESERT - DAWN

           Brie, with her platoon, patrols an Afghan valley at Sunrise. 
           In the distance, a shrouded FARMER herds a flock of sheep. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        A lot of people my age - they talk 
                        about safe spaces. Political 
                        correctness. Trigger warnings. Blow 
                        me. It’s easy to be optimistic 
                        about the world if you’ve never 
                        seen it. It’s harder to know what’s 
                        out there and believe in hope in 
                        spite of it. But I did. 

           Brie, a killer with her ASSAULT RIFLE, takes a moment to 
           admire the majesty of this scene. It’s beautiful. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        That’s what led me here.

           INT. THE COMPANY, LOBBY - AS BEFORE

           Brie, with her perfect resume poised on her lap.
                                 JOY (O.S.)
                        Brie? Thanks for waiting. He’s 
                        ready for you now.

           JOY, an attractive EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, beckons. Brie rises.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Believe it or not, I wanted to help 
                        people. And I thought this was the 
                        place.

           INT. THE COMPANY, GEORGE KNOX’S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT) 

           Brie; seated now in a panty-dropper office across from GEORGE 
           KNOX (35.) An aging tech Hipster. He reads her resume.  

                                 GEORGE
                        BA in Computer Science and 
                        Psychology from Columbia. 2 years 
                        distinguished service, Afghanistan. 
                        Really impressive, Brie. So I guess 
                        the obvious question is - why 
                        Social Media? With your background, 
                        why not Politics. Public health. 
                        Social services?

                                 BRIE
                        Because people live online. I’m 
                        just looking for a purpose. I work 
                        in a women’s shelter in the Bronx, 
                        I reach a hundred families if I’m 
                        lucky. Here, you reach everyone. 

           George eats this up. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Well I know you spoke to Shonda 
                        about a position in Corporate 
                        Social Responsibility but they 
                        kicked your resume over to me. 
                        There was a feeling that, given 
                        your background -- your particular 
                        set of experiences, you might be a 
                        better fit in my department.

                                 BRIE
                        Ok. Where’s that?

                                 GEORGE
                        We call it Safety Net. Brie, what 
                        do you know about Content 
                        Moderation? 
           INT. THE COMPANY OFFICES, VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

           As Brie’s interview continues, George tours her through the 
           facilities. A massive, open office as big as a city block. 

                                 GEORGE 
                        Our community of users is the most 
                        valuable asset of the company, and 
                        giving them the best experience 
                        possible is priority number one.

           As George continues, they pass through an organic modern 
           dream office. Despite herself, Brie’s impressed. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        To do that, we need to make sure 
                        those users have unfettered access 
                        to the content they want, while at 
                        the same time, making sure they 
                        aren’t bombarded with content they 
                        don’t. Content that’s false or 
                        inappropriate or worse -- and 
                        that’s where we come in. Safety Net 
                        is the filter that makes sure this 
                        is a place without fear - of abuse 
                        or bullying or hate. 

           He walks passed the pantry. Think WHOLE FOODS, but better. 
           SUSHI BAR. PIZZA OVEN. Cold Brew on tap. All sustainable and 
           eco-friendly and -- free. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Now, we’re not the politically 
                        correct police and we are not out 
                        to restrict anyone’s first 
                        amendment rights. We’re just here 
                        to create a safe space for 
                        everyone. So what do you think, 
                        does that sound like a place you 
                        could thrive? 

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. Sure, I just - I guess I was 
                        looking for something a little less 
                        visceral. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You’ve read some of the press?
                             (she has)
                        Well I’m not going to lie. Some 
                        days are tough. There’s some ugly 
                        stuff out there but frankly - 
                        that’s why we need tough people 
                        like you. Who can handle it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        As a last line of defense. Cause a 
                        lot of people can’t.

           They’ve come to a stop by a VIDEO SCREEN. An image of a 
           FIREBRAND FEMALE CEO at a lectern like Steve Jobs. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know it’s probably not what 
                        you were thinking but - you do well 
                        here - it’ll open a lot of doors. 
                             (of the CEO on screen)
                        She started out in Moderation. Look 
                        at her now. 
                             (beat)
                        You said you wanna reach people - 
                        you said you want a purpose. We 
                        have a billion users. You don’t get 
                        a bigger reach than that. 

           Off Brie, ready to jump. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        C’mon. What would you have done?

           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           A packed bohemian street. Crowded with BARS. In one of them --

                                 JILL (PRE-LAP)
                        Holy shit. I can’t believe you got 
                        a job there. You know how 
                        competitive it is? 

           INT. LOWER EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT

           Brie’s in a trendy bar, celebrating with girlfriends. JILL. 
           JENNY. SARAH. All mid 20’s. Pretty. Stylish. Pedigreed. 

                                 BRIE
                        It’s just Moderation. It’s not like 
                        I’m Sheryl Sandberg. 

                                 SARAH
                        Still -- you have to get like a 
                        fucking perfect score on your SATs 
                        just to get an interview there.

                                 JENNY
                        That’s not true. My cousin works 
                        there and he’s a fucking mongoloid. 

           The girls laughs. Polite. Vapid. 
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I know what you’re thinking, they 
                        don’t seem like my crowd. Truth is, 
                        they weren’t.

           In unison, the girls turn to their phones. Scan their feeds.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I met them at college. Through my 
                        fiance. They were city kids. What 
                        do you want? It’s hard to find 
                        friends. 

           Brie considers the girls when a handsome, earnest, young 
           intellectual enters from the cold, shaking rain from his 
           coat. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Peter was different. 

           PETER (30) beelines for Brie. Full of apologies. 

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. The fucking 
                        Politics editor is all wound up 
                        cause of these fucking tweets and -- 
                        never mind. Fuck that guy. Tell me. 
                        What’d they say?

           He hasn’t heard. Brie keeps him in suspense. A beat. Then...

                                 BRIE
                        I start Monday.

           Peter explodes. They kiss. The other girls watch. A hint of 
           envy. She loves him. They love Peter.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        He got me the interview in the 
                        first place. He had lots of 
                        connections. He worked at very well 
                        regarded Liberal Publication. He 
                        was one of the youngest editors 
                        they ever had.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Brie and Peter, in the back. A YOUNG UBER DRIVER at the 
           wheel. Console blinking with a dozen devices. 
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        We met in a Journalism Class. He 
                        was my T.A. I told you I wasn’t 
                        some saint. 

                                 PETER
                        Content huh? So I thought most of 
                        these Moderation centers were 
                        overseas. Outsourced. 

                                 BRIE
                        They are. Eventually. But I guess 
                        when they’re launching a new 
                        product - like now - they keep 
                        Moderation in house, to see how 
                        users react to it. 

                                 PETER
                        Ok. Long as it’s what you want.

           She smiles. They kiss. Peter tries for more. Gets handsy. She 
           pushes him off playfully. Of the driver: 

                                 BRIE
                        Not here. He’s probably filming us.

                                 PETER
                        So. He’ll give us a good rating. 

                                 BRIE
                        Home. I’ll give you all the likes 
                        you want. 

           Off Peter’s smile...

           INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kissing, Brie and Peter stumble into a renovated loft. 

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        He was like me. A bleeding heart. 
                        Plus he had his own place in 
                        Bushwick. We were getting married 
                        in 6 months.

           They shed clothes as they move to the bed and --

                                 BRIE (V.O.)
                        So maybe I wasn’t fucking Sheryl 
                        Sandberg but compared to most 
                        people, I had my shit together. Had 
                        a support system.
           Brie pauses, reaches over and turns out the lights. Black.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Man was I wrong. 

           THE RUMBLE OF A SUBWAY TRAIN.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING (A FEW DAYS LATER) 

           First day at work. Brie looks nice, waits on the platform. A 
           BUSKER playing the FIDDLE is drowned out as the TRAIN screams 
           into the station. 

           Brie drops a dollar into his GUITAR case. Enters the train.  

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (MOVING) - MORNING

           Brie’s on a crowded car. Like everyone else, on her phone. On 
           their screens. No one engaging.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Look at us. The internet was 
                        supposed to connect us. To tear 
                        down walls - but we’re further 
                        apart then ever. We all live in our 
                        own little feeds, our own little 
                        bubbles. Believing our own facts. 

           Brie scans a news feed on her phone. THE HEADLINE: “PRICE 
           SAYS OF MUSLIMS - PUT THEM ON A LIST!” The picture: An 
           ATTRACTIVE BLOND FEMALE PUNDIT. A vampire. (Remember her.)

           Brie’s unsettled, flips to the next story. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        What happens when those bubbles 
                        burst?

           EXT. THE COMPANY - MORNING

           A towering Chelsea HIGH-RISE. A monolith. Brie joins the 
           swarms, spinning through the doors.

           INT. MAIN LOBBY. THE COMPANY - MORNING

           Sleek and modern. BADGED EMPLOYEES breeze through the 
           turnstile. Brie queues for security. Like Fort Knox. Steps up 
           to the plate.

           The GUARD checks her ID against his TABLET. 
                                 GUARD
                        Sorry. Not here. Moderation’s on 
                        the other side of the building. 
                        Downstairs. They’ll meet you there.

           INT. DISTINCTLY DINGIER ENTRANCE TO THE COMPANY - MORNING 

           The white light of a body scan passes over Brie. She’s in the 
           metal detector at a more “discreet” entrance. No logos. No 
           company presence. No glamour. BEEP.

           Brie’s waved through, retrieving her purse from the belt when 
           she’s greeted by --

           Joy, THE ASSISTANT from her interview, waiting to escort her. 

                                 JOY
                        Sorry about the mix up. George 
                        should have told you. We don’t use 
                        the main entrance for Safety Net. 
                        Come on. Follow me. Let’s get you 
                        set up. 

           And Brie follows her through a door. It reads: “NO VISITORS 
           BEYOND THIS POINT”. 

           INT. STAIRWAY, SAFETY NET - MORNING

           Brie follows Joy down a staircase like Clarice trailing 
           Chilton into Lecter’s lair. 

                                 JOY
                        Hours are 9-6, but your manager 
                        will let you know what’s expected 
                        for your team.  You have 10 
                        vacation days a year, those 
                        accumulate 1 day at a time, every 
                        33 days. There’s a company discount 
                        at Crunch Gym in the lobby but 
                        you’ve gotta re-enter through the 
                        main lobby to get there so...

           They reach a subterranean floor. Joy swipes a KEYCARD buzzing 
           them into...

           INT. SAFETY NET HALLWAY - MORNING

           The walls lined with INSPIRATIONAL POSTERS designed like Nike 
           Ads, sporting Cultish platitudes: “What would you do if you 
           weren’t afraid?” “Proceed and be Bold.” Brie eyes them with 
           suspicion as they pass. 
                                 JOY
                        That’s the copy room and here’s the  
                        Counselor’s office. You’ll have 
                        mandatory group sessions once a 
                        week but you’re free to schedule a 
                        meeting with her anytime, work 
                        permitting. It’s confidential, of 
                        course. HR’s right here.

           Brie, rightly disconcerted, races to catch up as...

                                 LAWYER (PRE-LAP)
                        This is a confidentiality 
                        agreement. It’s boilerplate but 
                        please take your time and read it. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. THE COMPANY - MORNING

           Brie sits now at CONFERENCE TABLE with Joy as a company 
           LAWYER hands out PAPERS.  

                                 LAWYER
                        The long and short of it is -- by 
                        signing, you agree not to speak to 
                        anyone outside the company about 
                        the specifics of your job, at any 
                        point, whether you remain an 
                        employee here or not. Failure to 
                        comply will result in termination, 
                        and potential legal action. Your 
                        signature is mandatory. 

           Brie shares a look with Joy. Yikes. But she picks up her pen 
           to sign regardless and -- 

                                 MIRZA (PRE-LAP)
                        So this is the moderation tool 
                        you’ll be using. It’s pretty slick. 
                        I made it.

           INT. SMALL LECTURE HALL - MORNING

           Brie watches MIRZA, an handsome Indian coder, click through a 
           demo on his computer which is mirrored on a giant plasma TV. 

                                 MIRZA
                        Here’s the queue, each video is 
                        identified by a unique number. The 
                        full account can only be accessed 
                        with approval from your supervisor. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIRZA (CONT'D)
                        You have three options for every 
                        piece of content: Keep. Remove. 
                        Escalate. 

           The PROGRAM looks like what he described: IMAGINE A YOUTUBE 
           PAGE. A PHOTO or VIDEO appears in a window. A feed of 
           thumbnails to one side.

           A MODERATOR clicks KEEP / REMOVE / ESCALATE to the Video. The 
           next clip loads and so on.

                                 MIRZA (CONT’D)
                        Here’s your personal log of what 
                        you keep and delete each day.  It’s 
                        cleared weekly, or manually if you 
                        prefer. But you should know, every 
                        decision you make is recorded so -- 
                        chose wisely. 

           Off Brie, taking notes. A model student then --

                                 JOY (PRE-LAP)
                        And this is where you’ll call home.

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Joy leads Brie into SAFETY NET’s MAIN OFFICE. Not the Xanadu 
           where she interviewed. A bunker. A step up from a strip mall 
           H&R BLOCK.

           TWO DOZEN “MODERATORS” at isolated desks, clicking away at 
           Mirza’s TOOL on DUAL COMPUTER SCREENS. Each guarded with 
           SCREEN PRIVACY PROTECTORS.  

           It’s a MULTI-ETHNIC GROUP. All shapes and sizes. Most younger 
           than Brie. A few eye her with morbid curiosity, then return 
           like drones to their work. George approaches.

                                 GEORGE
                        You got through the Maze. We’re 
                        glad your here. Ready to dive in?

           He leads her to an unoccupied desk. Identical to the others. 
           A new pair of HEADPHONES is tied like a bow before the 
           monitors. Brie’s head’s spinning. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I know Mirza walked you through the 
                        program. It’s pretty self-
                        explanatory. You spend the morning 
                        on videos, the afternoon on photos 
                        and comments.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We have a group meeting once a week 
                        to discuss questions, memes, new 
                        policies. Things we’re seeing.  As 
                        you can imagine, stuff moves pretty 
                        quickly, so we have to adapt. For 
                        now, while we’re still working out 
                        the kinks on the new product, I’ll 
                        be down here with you so don’t 
                        hesitate to ask me or anyone if 
                        there’s a video or content you’re 
                        unsure about. Any questions?

                                 BRIE
                        Honestly?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s a lot. I know. But you’ll do 
                        fine. Just use your gut. 

           George turns on her screen. It glows across her face as her 
           queue appears. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Go get ‘em tiger.

           He goes. Hold on Brie. Peering over the edge of an abyss.

           Here goes nothing. She logs in. A video loads. A MOTHER 
           BREAST FEEDS her INFANT. A beat. Brie clicks KEEP. Another 
           appears. KIDS BULLYING EACH OTHER ON A PLAYGROUND. REMOVE.

           Another appears. And another. She’s off and running and -- 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        So let me just tell you how 
                        Moderation actually works. Most of 
                        the inappropriate stuff that’s 
                        posted on your social media site 
                        falls into pretty clear categories. 

           BEGIN MODERATION MONTAGE as Brie explains:

           * With each item she describes, that video tiles the screen.

                        You’ve got your clear cut case. Run 
                        of the mill smut. Horse fucking. 
                        Child Porn. Snuff films. Hate 
                        Speech. Most of this stuff, we 
                        never deal with. The Algorithm 
                        catches it.

           * An ANIMATED COMPUTER SCAN (like vector face recognition) 
           webs each image. Summarily deletes them. Gone.

                        It analyzes hate speech. Detects 
                        skin to pixel ratios. Blood to 
                        screen time. It’s like a ratings 
                        board. There’re clear cut guide 
                        lines about what you can and can 
                        not post and most companies have 
                        designed programs to catch it.  

           * A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE. CREATE AN ACCOUNT PAGE. Zoom in on the 
           User Agreement. The Fine print. Brie reads the text.

                        The stuff that filters down to us 
                        human Moderators falls into your 
                        more grey-areas. For example, let’s 
                        say you post a video of your 
                        Toddler at the pool. 

           * A HIPSTER MOTHER films her young DAUGHTER at a Hotel Pool. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You think it’s adorable. You title 
                        it something precious and post it 
                        on your page.

           The MOTHER loads the VIDEO into her feed. Titles it: “Lil’ 
           Ledecky.” Glows as the LIKES pile in.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The only problem is, your 
                        daughter’s three and she’s not 
                        wearing a top and someone with a 
                        healthy dose of paranoia, or 
                        perversion - take your pick - flags 
                        it as INAPPROPRIATE.

           * A decidedly more CONSERVATIVE MOTHER views the video while 
           sitting in church. She’s takes it as a personal affront and 
           flags it. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        And now, that flagged video, sifts 
                        down to someone like me. A 
                        Moderator. 
           * Brie’s working at her Queue. Easy choices. AN OBESE MAN 
           MASTURBATING: REMOVE. A FIERY CAR WRECK: KEEP. Now the 
           TODDLER VIDEO. She pauses.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        99 times out of a hundred, it’s a 
                        black and white policy decision. 
                        Yes. No. Yes. No. The rest, it just 
                        comes down to personal tolerance. 

           Brie considers the video. The innocent giggling girl. Makes 
           her ruling: KEEP.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I know. You thought it was more 
                        sophisticated than that. It’s not.

           * Widen out now. From Brie. To the dozen other Moderators in 
           this room --

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        And this is what happens thousands 
                        of times a day. To every Moderator. 
                        All over the country. All over the 
                        world. 

           -- to the Hundreds of other sweatshops like this in the City. 
           In the Country. In the World. 

           A Thousand tiny Moderators, Yes / No-ing through our lives.

                        We are the ones behind the curtain, 
                        making sure your Grandmother on 
                        Tumblr doesn’t wind up with a feed 
                        full of cockshots. 

           * An earthy Grandmother, flipping through her Grandkids’ 
           TUMBLER, gets that sudden surprising rush when a THROBBING 
           dickpick interrupts her feed.

                        We keep the internet safe for 
                        families and sponsors and the 
                        bullshit propaganda of our lives. 
                        How much Nipple is ok? How much 
                        blood? How much pain? What’s news? 
                        What’s not?

           * A BARRAGE OF THESE VIDEOS. ECU of an Areola. Of a BABY 
           BEING BORN. Of a THROAT being SLIT. A MASS GRAVE in Mexico. A 
           BUS EXPLOSION IN TEL-AVIV. BOOM. A beheading. A child being 
           smacked.
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The real problem is - not the P.C. 
                        Free speech, open airwaves of it - 
                        it’s that there is so goddamn much 
                        of it. So much hate. And violence. 
                        And pain. And chances are, if you 
                        haven’t seen it, it’s because I saw 
                        it for you.  

           * End on Brie, frozen in the glow of her screen as the horror 
           keeps on coming and coming. A BEHEADING. AN ABORTION. A DOG 
           BEING SHOT.

                        Sometimes, all you can do, is close 
                        your eyes and hit Delete.

           Brie swallows hard. DELETE. The video’s gone. Hold On Brie.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Problem is sometimes you close your 
                        eyes, and the image’s still there. 

           INT. BATHROOM, SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie’s using the toilet. On the inside of her stall, POSTERS 
           promote company events. “OVERNIGHT HACK-A-TON.” “COMPANY 
           MUDDER RACE.” Very collegiate. Brie’s shaking her head as --

           O.S. she hears a WOMAN sobbing in a neighboring stall. Brie’s 
           wary to interfere.

           MOMENTS LATER. AT THE SINK

           Brie’s washing her hands when the other stall opens and a 
           young red-eyed FEMALE MODERATOR (NICOLA) exits and moves to 
           the sink. 

           Brie says nothing. Nicola either. Off their silence.

           INT. PANTRY, SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie makes a coffee in the Safety Net kitchen. Nothing like 
           the spread she saw on the tour. Burnt Folgers and powered 
           creamer. She regards it with contempt.

                                 TONY (O.S.)
                        Not exactly Whole Foods, is it?

           TONY (30) a friendly, tattooed skater punk, adrenaline junky, 
           emerges from behind the fridge door with a Red Bull. 
                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        I stick to the hard stuff. What’re 
                        you in for?

                                 BRIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 TONY
                        You look like an upstanding young 
                        person. How’d you end up in the 
                        muck down here with us? Bleeding 
                        heart or -- let me guess, the 
                        promise of upward mobility? 
                             (mimicking George 
                              verbatim)
                        “You know Prisha started in Safety 
                        Net, and look at her now.” 

                                 BRIE
                        Some tough rungs on the ladder?

                                 TONY
                        What ladder?
                             (Brie reacts)
                        Sorry. Hey. Don’t listen to me. 
                        I’ve been here too long. First 
                        day’s the hardest. You make it 
                        through this - the rest is a cake-
                        walk. If you want, a few of us go 
                        out for drinks most nights to a 
                        dump around here, nothing serious - 
                        but, might help to hear some war 
                        stories. 

                                 BRIE
                        Maybe another time. Thanks.

                                 TONY
                        No sweat. But one piece of advice. 
                        Don’t take it home. Find a way to 
                        unwind. It’ll eat you alive. 
                        Believe me. 

           Tony smiles. Goes. Hold on Brie, unsettled. But intrigued.

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICE - LATER

           End of the day. Brie at her screen. Headphones on. Locked in. 
           Breaks her trance when a hand taps her shoulder. George. 

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s past Six. Get out of here. No 
                        extra credit for staying late. 
           She looks around. She’s the last one there. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Good work today. 

           George goes. Brie shuts things down. Removes her purse from 
           her desk then notices something abandoned in the bottom of 
           the drawer. Brie removes it to reveal: 

           A charm necklace. ST. ANTHONY. Brie considers it -- as if an 
           omen...

           INT. COMPANY HALLWAY - EVENING

           Brie’s headed down a hallway for the exit when something 
           stops her. A ROAR of APPLAUSE rising behind closed doors. 

           Intrigued, she approaches. Slipping inside to find --

           INT. AUDITORIUM, COMPANY - SAME

           A sleek auditorium packed with True Believers. Company 
           ACOLYTES cheering like a Pep Rally as --

           ON STAGE. The CEO. PRISHA RAZUL. The attractive, 40 year old 
           Pakistani woman in Alexander McQueen seen previously on video 
           in Brie’s tour, details a product launch. 

                                 PRISHA 
                        For too long, we’ve seen our 
                        platform corrupted. Used not to 
                        connect, but to divide. To 
                        indoctrinate, radicalize, recruit, 
                        and spread hate. Well, not any 
                        more. We’re taking back control. 
                        Imagine if we could identify the 
                        most vulnerable users online, 
                        before they headed down a path 
                        toward violence and offer them an 
                        alternate route. Imagine if we 
                        could eliminate the gap - that 
                        precious time between vulnerability 
                        and radicalization - between 
                        posting and acting - and offer hope 
                        instead of hate. A safe space. A 
                        new community. A new tack. That is 
                        FULL SAIL. 

           On Brie, in the doorway, transfixed. 
                                 PRISHA (CONT’D)
                        Full Sail is a global platform, 
                        that will access not only ours, but 
                        the 15 largest social networks in 
                        the world to analyze video, audio, 
                        text, and search to identify users 
                        headed on a path to destruction and 
                        get them the help they need.  To 
                        stop the next Pulse, Columbine, San 
                        Bernadino before those tragedies 
                        even start by offering direct, pre-
                        emptive alternatives.  Identify. De-
                        escalate. Re-direct. That’s what 
                        FULL SAIL can do. 

           The crowd APPLAUDS. Brie as well. Like she’s seen an Oracle 
           when -- a HAND grabs her shoulder. A SECURITY GUARD.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Let’s go. You can’t be in here.

           He shows Brie to the door. She complies, but she’s tasted to 
           Kool-aid. And she’s hooked. 

                                 LAUREN (PRE-LAP)
                        Will you look at this woman?

           INT. BAYRIDGE PLAYGROUND - DAY

           A breezy fall Sunday. Blue Collar families. Kids tear around 
           a concrete playground. Brie’s here, with her sister LAUREN.

                                 LAUREN
                        Every week. Her kid scrapes his 
                        knee and she acts like he’s severed 
                        a fucking artery. He’s just looking 
                        for a fucking cookie.

           Brie laughs. Lauren’s 30. A teacher. Aggressively anti-hip. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        My sister didn’t give a shit about 
                        any of this.

           They’re watching, with utter contempt, as another MOTHER 
           treats her CHILD’S skinned knee with dramatic attention.

                                 LAUREN
                        Seriously, where the fuck does she 
                        think she is? Hacksaw Ridge? 
           Through their laughter, LUCILLE (Lauren’s 5 year-old-
           daughter) calls from the jungle gym. Lucille’s adorable. Full 
           of life, but with noticeable PORT-WINE STAINS on her face. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Aunt Brie -- did you see how I went 
                        down the slide? Like a ski-racer.

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. I saw. So fast. You’re look 
                        like Lindsay Vonn. Let’s see it 
                        again.
                             (to Lauren)
                        God she’s cute. How’s she doing?

                                 LAUREN
                        Fine. I’m the basket case. These 
                        kids at school, keeping calling her 
                        Gorbachev.
                             (Off Brie’s reaction)
                        They hear it from the parents. I 
                        wanna go in there and kill those 
                        little fuckers.

                                 BRIE
                        You should. You should fucking 
                        Sandy Hook those kids.

                                 LAUREN
                        Well that’s dark. You sure this job 
                        isn’t getting to you? I’ve been 
                        hearing a lot of stuff on NPR about 
                        Moderation recently - it sounds 
                        pretty dark. You sure you’re up for 
                        that?

                                 BRIE
                        I’m fine. Thanks for worrying. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m just saying, you are always 
                        trying to protect everyone. Like 
                        after Mom and Dad died. I just 
                        wanna make sure someone’s looking 
                        out for you.

           Brie pokes her with her elbow. They smile. 

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        See. What did I tell you? What a 
                        putz.

           ANGLE ON: The “injured boy,” who’s now seated on a bench with 
           his MOTHER, watching a video on her phone. Eating a cookie.
           As Lucille approaches, Brie and Lauren die laughing.

                                 LUCILLE
                        What’s so funny?

                                 BRIE
                        Nothing. Your mom’s a nut. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        But she was right. I should have 
                        looked out for myself. But there 
                        were parts of it I liked. 

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICE - DAY

           Brie’s at her desk, laughing at a RAP PARODY video on screen. 
           She KEEPS it. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I had a window into people that no 
                        one else got to see. Unadulterated. 
                        Unfiltered.

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

           Brie cries at her desk, watching a BREAK-UP video.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        And you didn’t just share it with 
                        them, you controlled it. 

           She REMOVES it. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You had the power to edit their 
                        lives. 

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MORNING (COUPLE WEEKS LATER)

           Brie bobs along with the other riders. Only this time, she’s 
           not on her phone like all the rest. She’s watching them. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        It was godlike. 

           A whole world on their phones. Disconnected. Only Brie,  
           watching from above. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        But you can’t avoid the darkness 
                        forever. Because it’s everywhere.
           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Another day. Brie’s at her computer. Reeling. Push in on her 
           as she hits: DELETE. DELETE. DELETE. DELETE.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Hate. Violence. Blood. Guts. Sickos 
                        fucking animals. Fuckheads hurting 
                        kids. People fucking Mannequins. 
                        Faceshots. Blumpkins. Fisting. You 
                        fucking name it. We saw it. 

           Now tight on Brie. Sick in her guts. Shuts off her screen. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        That’s why the counseling.

           INT. GROUP THERAPY SESSION - DAY

           Stale donuts and Plastic folding chairs. Brie and THREE OTHER 
           MODERATORS listening to the COUNSELOR. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        The thing about Trauma is, it can't 
                        be buried. Trauma’s a ghost. It 
                        will come back and haunt you unless 
                        you face it. Unless you come to 
                        terms with what you've experienced 
                        and learn to live with it because 
                        there is no escaping it.

           On Brie, listening diligently. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Believe me. I’ve heard this shit 
                        before. The truth is, you don’t 
                        know how you’re gonna deal with it 
                        until it hits you in the face.

           INSERT MONTAGE. 

           * Tony and ANOTHER MODERATOR bump coke in the bathroom. 

           * A bored JAPANESE WOMAN pops Sour Patch Kids, clicking 
           through porn. 

           * Nicola watches a WAR VIDEO. An INSURGENT standing over a 
           fallen REBEL, about to smash his face. 

                                 NICOLA
                        This is so gross. You gotta see it.
           A FRAT BOY watches over her shoulder. Hold on him for impact 
           as the boot comes down O.S. 

                                 NICOLA (CONT’D)
                        Dude, you got your grape stomped!

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I’ve seen the toughest assholes 
                        you’ll ever meet throw up at the 
                        first sight of blood and the 
                        littlest girl in the world not 
                        flinch at a gun in her face. You 
                        don’t know what people are made of. 
                        You cope in your own way. I used to 
                        go for runs. 

           EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY RUNNING PATH - DAY

           In tailored athletic gear, Brie sprints along the river. 
           Punishing herself. Purging. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You laugh. You cry. You throw up. 
                        You jerk-off. You turn yourself 
                        off. You turn yourself on. But no 
                        matter how you escape - what 
                        everyone will tell you is, there 
                        are things you can’t outrun. Can’t 
                        un-see. Can’t scrub from your 
                        brain. Eventually, everyone catches 
                        theirs.

           INT. BRIE’S DESK - DAY

           Tight on the screen. We only need a second because this 
           should be hard to watch. In her bedroom, an overweight 
           AFRICAN AMERICAN TEENAGE GIRL (CASSIE) cries to her webcam. 

                                 CASSIE (ON SCREEN)
                        You said I was a fat pig and that I 
                        oughta be butchered. Well when you 
                        read about this in the paper 
                        tomorrow, I hope you’re happy. 

           Cassie tilts her camera to reveal a BOTTLE OF PILLS spilled 
           before her.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oink oink.

           REVERSE ON Brie; watching. Through tears. And anger. 
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        For me, I just had to believe I was 
                        helping people. 

           INT. GEORGE’S DESK, SAFETY NET - LATER

           Distraught, Brie waits at George’s desk for an answer. 

                                 GEORGE
                        OK, so I pinged Bernadette, she’s 
                        our liason with outreach.  As soon 
                        as she gets back to her desk, 
                        she’ll review the video and take it 
                        from there. 

                                 BRIE
                        But what if it’s too late? You saw 
                        this girl. She could be ODing right 
                        now? 

                                 GEORGE
                        And that’s why we’re following our 
                        protocol. Don’t worry. You did the 
                        right thing. We’ll take it from 
                        here.

                                 BRIE
                        Look, these guys have been 
                        harassing her for months. I’ve been 
                        reading their comments and it’s 
                        pretty fucking serious so can’t we--

                                 GEORGE
                        You’ve been reading their what? 
                             (Brie’s silent. Caught)
                        You know you’re not supposed to dig 
                        into people’s accounts. You watch 
                        the content and you make a 
                        decision. You do not get 
                        emotionally involved.

                                 BRIE
                             (tacking)
                        Yeah. I know. All I’m saying is - 
                        this girl is in danger. Where’s the 
                        protocol for that? 

                                 GEORGE
                        It exists and we’re following it. I 
                        will let you know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        But I need to make sure I’m being 
                        clear - I know you want to help but 
                        you are not to get involved in 
                        their lives. Do you understand?

           Off Brie, nodding. For now. 

           EXT. THE COMPANY ENTRANCE - EVENING

           End of the day. Pouring rain. Brie stands under the awning, 
           upset on her cell with Peter. 

                                 BRIE 
                        Really? You can’t get out? No. No. 
                        I understand. I just. Tough one 
                        today. I’ll be all right. I’ll see 
                        you at home.  

           She hangs up. Lingers before veil of rain. Tony appears. 
           Lighting a cigarette.

                                 TONY
                        Caught a bad one today, huh? Want a 
                        drink? I’m buying. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - LATER

           Coke den. Every surface sticky. Tony and Brie sharing a 
           booth. A couple drinks in. 

                                 TONY
                        You get used to it. You report it. 
                        You do what you can, but you can’t 
                        help everyone. You’re a janitor. 
                        Not a cop. You’re here to maintain 
                        the illusion. 

                                 BRIE
                        And that doesn’t bother you? All 
                        this shit is out there. We take it 
                        down, but where’re the 
                        consequences? There’s no effect in 
                        the real world. 

                                 TONY
                        Is that why you’re here? To effect 
                        the real world?

           Tony laughs. Downs a shot.

                                 BRIE
                        That’s so naive? 
                                 TONY
                        No. It’s sweet actually.

                                 BRIE
                        Ok. But we’re here. They’re paying 
                        us. They must want to do the right 
                        thing.

                                 TONY
                        Sure. But it’s not altruism. It’s 
                        capitalism. Look what happened to 
                        Twitter. They’re like the biggest 
                        company in the world - they’ve got 
                        a gazillion users but no one will 
                        buy them - you know why? Because it 
                        doesn’t make any money - because it 
                        took them 10 years to realize their 
                        site was infested with assholes and 
                        trolls and Pepsi doesn’t want their 
                        ads running next to a post for the 
                        KKK. That’s why we’re here. We’re 
                        PR. 
                             (she’s clearly dispirited)
                        It used to bother me too, but the 
                        truth is - there’s going to be sick 
                        shit out there whether I see the 
                        videos or not. Anyway, I’m kind of 
                        addicted to it now. 

                                 BRIE
                        That’s fucked up. I’m gonna ask 
                        George to move me to another team. 
                             (off his look)
                        What?

                        I don’t want to just burst all your 
                        bubbles today but that ain’t gonna 
                        happen. You’re tainted goods. They 
                        tell you about the last girl who 
                        had your desk? Marcy something. 
                        Marcy Shea.

                             (sarcastic)

                        Almost. She cracked up. Couldn’t 
                        take it. Bout two months in. Crying 
                        all the time. Paranoid. She started 
                        running to and from the subway, 
                        worried she was being followed.

                        She had a full-on nervous

                        I know. That’s what happens. We’re 
                        filters. And you know what happens 
                        when a filter finally catches too 
                        much shit. 

                                 BRIE
                        It breaks. 

                                 TONY
                        Yeah. And then the shit goes 
                        everywhere. And believe me, the 
                        last thing they want is for the 
                        shit to go everywhere. You want a 
                        job at all, I’d keep your mouth 
                        shut. 

                                 BRIE
                        So what you’re saying is - I’m 
                        fucked?

                                 TONY
                        Yeah. Pretty much. But at least 
                        you’re not alone. 

           Tony smiles. Raises his glass. Cheers. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Tony was right, but he was wrong 
                        about one thing. I didn’t want my 
                        eyes closed. They were just 
                        starting to open. 

           I./E. TAXI (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Brie in the window. Headed home. Upset. On the in-cab TV: A

                        to wake up and realize what the 
                        real hard-working American’s have 
                        known years. This is not your 
                        country anymore.

           Off Brie, unable to escape. Bombarded on all sides...

           INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Brie arrives home. It’s late. The lights are out. She assumes 
           Peter’s asleep.  Careful not to make a racket when...

           She hears VOICES from the bedroom. SOMEONE HAVING SEX. She 
           approaches. Ready to snap, pushing open door to reveal --

           Peter, in bed, jerking off at his computer. 

                                 BRIE
                        Thought you were out with clients?

           Mortified, Peter scrambles for his clothes, retreating feebly 
           to the bathroom to get dressed.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Please. Don’t let me interrupt. 
                        Finish up. 

           For a moment, Brie sees the humor in this. Laughs. But when 
           she sees his computer screen --

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        What the --

           Push in on Brie as she scrolls the page. Her face goes white. 
           Peter emerges clothed from the Bathroom behind her, seeing 
           the screen. Horror struck. 

                                 PETER
                        I can explain. 

                                 BRIE
                        Where did you get this? These are 
                        my friends. What the fuck is this?

           Now we see the screen. A REDDIT page. A thread of CANDID 
           REVENGE PORN VIDEOS shared between creeps. 

           The video Peter’s been indulging in: a surreptitiously shot 
           video of their friend Jenny (met at the bar) naked in the 
           shower. 
                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Who posted this? Joey? Did he send 
                        this to you? 
                             (finally Peter nods)
                        That is fucked up. What are you 
                        guys, sharing videos of us? 
                             (and then it dawns on her)
                        Wait. Are there videos of --

           Instead of an answer, Peter rushes to close the computer but 
           he’s too late. Brie spins it away and --

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Mother fucker. 

                                 PETER
                        I can explain. 

           Cause Brie’s looking at a video of herself which she clearly 
           shot, in a very private moment - for Peter’s eyes only - laid 
           bare on the web for everyone to see. 

                                 BRIE
                        You should go to jail for this you 
                        fucking pervert. 

                                 PETER
                        Brie. Come on. Wait. 

           But she’s already moving for the door. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Brie. Come on. Where are you going? 
                        Wait - don’t - come on. I need that 
                        for work. 

                                 BRIE
                        Tell them where it went. 

           Because she has his computer. Walking out the door. Gone.

           INT. BEDROOM, LAUREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lucille’s bedroom. Cluttered with girly shit. Lauren is 
           making up a mattress on the floor. Her husband TEDDY. A big 
           teddy bear of a CONSTRUCTION WORKER, stands at the door. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Fucking scumbag. I oughta kick his 
                        ass right now.
                                 LAUREN
                        Yeah, that would solve everything. 
                             (beat)
                        I check your computer. I’m gonna 
                        find something like that?
                             (he cuts her a look. Give 
                              me a break. She caves.)
                        Come here, help me with the fucking 
                        sheet. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, LAUREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brie’s on the couch, trying to pull it together, watching 
           FINDING DORY with Lucille, in her pajamas. They can hear them 
           talking upstairs. 

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        I told her not to trust that guy. 
                        You know how he is - Upper East 
                        Side stick up his ass.
                             (beat)
                        The fuck was she doing sending 
                        those videos in the first place. 
                        What’d she think was going to 
                        happen? 

                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        Go easy on her, ok. Just -- she’s 
                        been through a lot. 

           Brie and Lucille look at each. Shake their heads. 

                                 BRIE
                             (loud)
                        Hello! We can hear you!
                             (dead silence. To Lucille)
                        Amateurs. 

           A moment later, Lauren and Teddy come sheepishly down the 
           stairs like teenagers caught fucking by their parents. 

                                 LAUREN
                        So. The bed’s all made up in 
                        Lucille’s room. It’s a little tight 
                        for now -- but Teddy will get the 
                        basement all set for you tomorrow. 

                                 BRIE
                        It’s fine. Thanks. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Stay as long as you want. We could 
                        use the help. 
                                 LUCILLE
                        Where am I going to sleep tonight? 

                                 LAUREN 
                        Well, you’ll sleep with daddy and 
                        me. In our room. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        I don’t wanna sleep with you. I 
                        wanna sleep in my room with Brie.

                                 TEDDY
                        Honey. Aunt Brie needs a little 
                        room for herself right n--

                                 BRIE
                        It’s ok. Really. It’s her room. 
                        It’s cool. It’ll be a sleep-over.

                                 LAUREN
                        Don’t say it if you don’t mean it. 

                                 BRIE
                        No. It’s good. I could use the 
                        company.

           Long beat. Brie starts crying. Lauren goes to her. Astutely, 
           Teddy ushers Lucille out of the room. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Come on honey. It’s really late. 
                        Let’s get back to bed.

                                 LUCILLE
                             (to Brie)
                        It’ll be ok. Listen to Dory - just 
                        keep swimming. Just keep swimming. 

           Brie manages a smile. They go. When it’s finally just the 
           sisters, Brie shatters.

                                 BRIE
                        What the fuck am I going to do?

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re going to stay here and 
                        you’re going to clear all the toxic 
                        shit from your life and go from 
                        there. Peter, this fucking job. Why 
                        expose yourself to this stuff? You 
                        need to get back to square one. 

           Brie leans into her sister. Cries. Agrees. 
           EXT. THE COMPANY ENTRANCE - MORNING

           Brie, pretty ragged, approaches the building.

                                 PETER
                        Brie. Wait. 

                                 BRIE
                        Get the fuck out of here. 

           She pushes inside. He follows.

           INT. THE COMPANY, LOBBY - MORNING

           Brie’s moving to security. Peter on her tail. 

                                 PETER
                        Will you just let me explain. I’m 
                        sorry. I fucked up. I know but... 

                                 BRIE
                             (for all to hear)
                        Know what? You posted a video of me 
                        naked for your friends to see. 
                        You’re sick. You come here again 
                        and I’ll call the police. 

           She passes through security. Peter caught at the gate and in 
           the eyes of the GUARDS.

                                 PETER
                        Can I at least get my computer 
                        back?

                                 GUARDS
                        Pervert.

           INT. SAFETY NET HALLWAY - DAY

           Brie, still in her jacket, pacing outside a conference room 
           where George and other honchos exit a meeting. Sees Brie.

                                 GEORGE
                             (to his associates)
                        I’ll get back to you guys in a sec.
                        Morning Brie. Everything all right?

                                 BRIE
                        Could we talk? Somewhere private.
           INT. GEORGE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Where they first met. Brie’s fighting back tears. George 
           hands her a tissue.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh. I. I’m really sorry to hear 
                        that. I know it was rough yesterday 
                        with that video - that girl - but 
                        all days aren’t like that. 

                                 BRIE
                        I’m sorry. It’s just. It’s more 
                        than I was expecting. I really 
                        think I’d be better off and could  
                        help more somewhere else in the 
                        company. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I understand. I do. And I think you 
                        have great potential. In fact, I 
                        think you’d be perfect for this new 
                        product we’re launching but --

                                 BRIE
                        Is that Full Sail?

                                 GEORGE
                        Where’d you hear that? I can’t 
                        really talk about what it is yet, 
                        but I think you’d be great for it, 
                        if you can just stick it out for a 
                        little while longer. Do you think 
                        you can do that? 

                                 BRIE
                        Honestly, I don’t know. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Well listen - I’m going to set up 
                        you up with a session with Alexis 
                        tomorrow. Not a prescription. Just 
                        a suggestion. Sometimes a little 
                        air is all it takes. We’d hate to 
                        lose you. 

           Brie rises. Stops at the door.

                                 BRIE
                        What happened to the girl? Cassie. 
                        Do you know?
                                 GEORGE
                        I sent it up the chain. That’s all 
                        I can do. Someone else takes it 
                        from there. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Similar to before only now, it’s Brie in the stall crying. 
           She struggles to control it. Finally exiting to see...

           ANOTHER MODERATOR doing her face at the sink. They share a 
           silent recognition.

           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie - back at her desk. Logging in. Stops. Loads instead her 
           own live SOCIAL MEDIA PAGE. Searching for...

           Cassie, the overweight girl from the video. She scans this 
           innocent girl’s FEED. Teenage earnestness met with utter 
           hate. 

           Brie dies inside for this girl. Does the only thing she can. 
           She reaches out. Begins to type. A message:

           JUST WANTED U 2 KNOW. UR NOT ALONE. U HAVE FRIENDS. NEED 2 
           TALK, CONTACT ME ANYTIME. 

           Brie considers it a beat. A glance at THE NECKLACE. Thoughts 
           of Marcy. Fuck it. She hits send. The messages goes. Brie’s 
           on her feet. I’m outta here. Passing Tony on the way. 

                                 TONY
                        Half day? Thought you Army brats 
                        could handle your booze. 

           But Brie never slows. On Tony, watching. Concerned. 

           EXT. CHELSEA STREETS - DAY

           Upset, Brie hurries through the streets. Shielding herself 
           from the cold. From the world. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

           A cold oasis beneath the lights. The running paths vein 
           through it. On one...
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        In threat assessment, there’s 
                        something called the PATH TO 
                        VIOLENCE. 

           Brie runs through the night. Gloves. Hood. On a purge. A 
           pilgrimage. Push in on her.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Most shrinks will tell you it 
                        starts with pain. 

           Flash cut from Brie’s run to: 

            * TEENAGE RURAL BRIE. In the back seat of a car. Trying in 
           vain to ward off the advances of a Steel Mill High School 
           Football Thug. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        With despair. 

           * TO TEENAGE BRIE and TEENAGE LAUREN huddled together on the 
           side of a rural road. They are lit by flames, as an EMERGENCY 
           CREW works in vein to extinguish a fiery car wreck. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        With loneliness.

           * TO TEENAGE BRIE and LAUREN at a funeral. Two caskets. Their 
           parents. Brie supports Lauren as she crumbles.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        With feeling like you’ve been a 
                        victim your whole life. 

           * TO BRIE, as we left her previously in Afghanistan. The 
           Sheppard. The mountains. Brie’s moment of serenity as --

           BOOM! An explosion shatters her tranquility. An IED triggers 
           beneath her Sergeants Boot. White out:

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        But that’s just the back story. 

           Back to Brie. Running faster. No more tears now. Only fire.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The path really begins when you 
                        decide you won’t be a victim any 
                        more. 

           On the path, a rustling in trees. Brie passes it. Stops. 
           Turns. TWO FIGURES struggle behind the brush. 
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I spent my life believing in 
                        goodness, in the face of despair. 
                        Like you, I believed the veneer. I 
                        don’t anymore. 

           Despite the danger, Brie doesn’t flee. She approaches.

           Five feet away. She sees. A BRUISING MAN overpowering a 
           STRUGGLING WOMAN in the dirt. Ripping away her clothes when --

           Brie looks at her feet. A BEER BOTTLE in the grass. 

           The Victim sees her first. Hope in her eyes as Brie considers 
           the bottle and...

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (MOVING) - LATER

           Brie on a seemingly empty train. Frozen. Catatonic. She looks 
           at her hands. They’re shaking. Bloody.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        It’s hardly a choice. Like Dory 
                        said. Just keeping swimming. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - AS BEFORE

           The bottle. Brie reaches for it. Approaches -- the ATTACKER 
           hears -- turns just in time to see --

           CRACK! Brie smashes the bottle across his face. Blood sprays. 
           The ATTACKER staggers. 

                                 BRIE
                             (to the girl)
                        Run. 

           She does. Leaving Brie alone with the dazed ATTACKER who 
           stumbles for her...

                                 ATTACKER
                        You fucking Bitch.

           SWINGING FOR BRIE -- and just as his fist connects with her 
           face -- WHACK!

           Brie’s swung the broken bottle and in a final clean movement, 
           drops him like a brick. Brie stands over him, holding her 
           eye. Blood on her hands then hits him again and again and 
           again...
           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (MOVING) - LATER AGAIN

           Brie’s bloody hands. She looks up - startled to see...

           A HOMELESS MAN at the other end of the car, staring at the 
           blood. Concerned. On Brie as...

           INT. SHOWER, LAUREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Blood into the drain as Brie showers. The water beating off 
           her head. She wretches. Pulls herself together and...

           INT. LUCILLE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Only a night-light on. Lucille asleep in her bed. Brie creeps 
           in. Lays on her mattress. Awake. A sentinel. 

           Eyes bruised but truly open. For the first time.

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lucille and Lauren are having breakfast. Brie, dressed for 
           work, tries to sneak out without being seen.

                                 LAUREN
                        Hey. No breakfast? What happened to 
                        you last night?

           Brie doesn’t answer. Lauren turns her around at the door, 
           revealing a heavyweight black eye. 

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus! What happened?

                                 BRIE
                        I fell. In the park. It’s not as 
                        bad as it looks. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You need to go to a doctor.

                                 BRIE
                             (pushing her away)
                        I said I’m OK. I gotta go. I’m late 
                        for work.

           Brie leaves. Off Lauren’s worry... 
           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MORNING

           On the platform. The BUSKER plays. Brie hides in BIG BLACK 
           SUNGLASSES, waiting with the other riders. Walled off. Tuned 
           in. The train arrives. 

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICES - MORNING

           Brie arrives. Approaches her station. Still in sunglasses. 
           She passes a group of MODERATORS huddled around Tony’s 
           screen, watching a video. 

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Oh my god! Awesome. 

           Brie peaks at the screen: A GOTHAMIST headline ON HIS 
           COMPUTER - “Female Vigilante thwarts Central Park attacker. 
           Suspect remains at large”. 

           A shaky cellphone video begins to play. A shadowy figure 
           emerging from the park, dropping the bottle, disappearing.

                                 TONY
                             (to Brie as she passes)
                        You see this? What a bad-ass.

           Brie manages a smile. Arrives at her desk -- 

                                 GEORGE
                        Wasn’t sure we’d see you again. 
                             (approaches her desk)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Brie’s removed her sunglasses, revealing her shiner.

                                 BRIE
                        I slipped. It’s worse than it 
                        looks. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I hope so. Do you need to go to the 
                        doctor or --
                             (Brie shakes him off then)
                        Well I just wanted to follow up 
                        from the other day. We’d really 
                        hate to lose you and I know it’s 
                        tough, but I hope you think about 
                        what I said. 

                                 BRIE
                        I will. I promise. I’ll think about 
                        it. 
           George goes. A moment. Brie goes into the drawer. Considers 
           Marcy’s necklace. Logs into work. The FEED begins to load -- 

           ON SCREEN: BEASTIALITY. CARTEL DECAPITATIONS. JAPANESE SEX 
           DOLLS. Brie is frozen.

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        This was the true beginning.

           She’s broken from her reverie when a message arrives on her 
           page. Cassie:

           THANKS FOR YOUR NOTE. HELPS TO KNOW I’M NOT ALONE. 

           Brie, for the first time in awhile, smiles. Types back:

           I’M HERE. CALL ME ANYTIME - the follows with her NUMBER.

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        No more being a victim. No more 
                        turning the other cheek. You take 
                        the moral high-ground and lose, 
                        you’re still a loser. It was time 
                        to take a step further. Off-line.

           Brie returns to her feed. With a purpose now. No longer 
           racing through her queue. Now she’s searching. Studying. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You can’t just cut the weeds. You 
                        gotta tear them out by the root.  

           ANGLE ON: Tony, watching Brie. With interest. 

           INT. MIRZA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mirza at his computer. A KNOCK on his door. Brie. Flirty.

                                 BRIE
                        Sorry. You got a minute?
                             (off his smile)
                        I was wondering if you could show 
                        me how to encrypt my computer? 

                                 MIRZA
                        You haven’t encrypted yet?

                                 BRIE
                        I’ve been getting pinged by all 
                        these scammers. Just getting 
                        paranoid. 
                                 MIRZA
                        You should be. They’re everywhere. 
                        Where’s your computer?

           Off Brie’s smile. 

           INT. GROUP COUNSELING - DAY 

           A GROUP OF MODERATORS listen to the testimonial of PREPPY 
           MALE COLLEAGUE. 

                                 PREPPY COLLEAGUE
                        I guess I thought it wouldn’t 
                        effect me, I mean, I’ve seen my 
                        share of porn but -- I don’t know. 
                        After seeing all of this, I don’t 
                        even wanna have sex anymore. I 
                        just...I just wanna turn everything 
                        off. Obviously, my girlfriend 
                        doesn’t understand. 

           The COLLEAGUE gets unexpectedly emotional. The OTHER 
           MODERATORS jump in for support. Not Brie. She tunes him out. 
           She’s on her phone. Headphones on. Watching:

           A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL VIDEO: HOW TO GO ANONYMOUS ONLINE. HOW TO 
           MOVE AROUND THE INTERNET WITHOUT A FOOTPRINT.

                        Fuck therapy. The real problem 
                        wasn’t us. It was them. Hidden. 
                        Anonymous. Pathetic. But I was 
                        starting to understand, to catch a 
                        troll, I needed to go under the 
                        bridge.

                                 ALEXIS
                        BRIE!

           Alexis, the Counselor, an earnest young woman, breaks Brie’s 
           studies.  

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        No headphones in here. This is a 
                        time to unplug. I was asking, do 
                        you have anything to add to Logan’s 
                        experience? Anything you can share?

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. Just, sounds like it sucks. 

           Brie peers back at her phone. Again, on Tony. Intrigued. 
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - AFTER WORK

           Brie’s still at it. Internet research. How to DOX SOMEONE. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The biggest scam about the internet 
                        is that it was supposed to be about 
                        transparency. Democratization of 
                        information. Connecting people. 
                        What a load of shit. It’s just a 
                        place for sick people to hide and 
                        indulge in their darkest Ids. It’s 
                        easy to be ugly when you’re 
                        anonymous. In the dark.

           ON BRIE’S SEARCH SCREEN as she types out: INFO NEEDED TO DOX.

                        But what happens to cockroaches 
                        when you turn on the lights? They 
                        scatter. They’re pussies. No one’s 
                        brave when you take away their

                        It’s surprisingly easy to find out 
                        everything about a person online.

           On Brie, as she copies this info into her notebook and... 

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - EVENING

           Walking back from the subway, Brie passes the open roll gate 
           of a CROSS-FIT facility. Inside, a half dozen FANATICS work 
           out in a bare-bones garage. A RUGGED TRAINER barks orders.
           Brie pauses, watching with fascination, catching the 
           TRAINER’S eye. A moment between them. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I began to think about stripping it 
                        all away. Filtering the scum, not 
                        just from my queue, but from my 
                        life. 

           INT. BAY RIDGE GROCERY STORE - EVENING

           Brie winds through the aisles, checking the labels on 
           everything. Non GMO. Organic. Cage free. No antibiotics. 
           Loading her cart. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The shit we read. The shit we post. 
                        The shit we eat. It was all fake. 
                        All made up bullshit and I was 
                        liberated. Identify the sickness 
                        and rip it out. 

           Brie studies a bag of LOW CALORIE COOKIES. Regarding its 
           ingredients with disgust. 

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brie’s got dinner on the stove, putting away groceries. 
           Methodically removing Lauren’s “unhealthy” food from the 
           cabinets. 

           Lauren arrives, exhausted from work, sees dinner already on 
           the stove. Instantly grateful. 

                                 BRIE
                        Lucille’s watching a show. She had 
                        a bath. This’ll be ready in a few. 
                        Have a glass of wine. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re a saint. 

           She kisses her sister, then she spots the trash can of 
           SNACKWELLS. NON-DAIRY CREAMERS. Her necessities. 

                                 BRIE
                        Had to make some room. 

           Lauren’s a little pissed, but all things considered...
                                 HISPANIC POLITICIAN (PRE-LAP)
                        ...but hold on. What about the 
                        Statue of Liberty? Give me your 
                        tired, your poor, your huddled 
                        masses yearning to breathe free. 
                        What do you say to them?

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ANN PRICE’S CABLE NEWS SHOW on TV in the living room. A 
           HISPANIC POLITICIAN in the ring beside her.

                                 ANN PRICE (ON TV)
                        I’d say - No Vacancy. I’m sorry, 
                        but the inn is full and we don’t 
                        want your wretched refuge anymore. 
                        It’s time to look out for the 
                        American people already here.

                                 TEDDY
                        What a bitch.

           The whole family at dinner. Enjoying Brie’s meal. Teddy’s 
           peering at the TV. Lauren smacks him. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You hate her so much, why do you 
                        watch? It’s dinner. Turn it off. 

           Teddy does. Returns the table. To Brie. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Brie - can you guys do something 
                        about this b-- (catching himself.) 
                        How much are you guys seeing of 
                        this monster at work?

                                 BRIE
                        Well, not her so much but -- her 
                        followers. Pretty ugly stuff. I 
                        have some ideas but --

           Lauren locks Brie’s eyes at the mention of work. Long beat. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I thought you were leaving.
                             (Brie doesn’t answer)
                        We talked about this. It’s not good 
                        for you. 
                                 BRIE
                        I know but -- it’s not so bad. 
                        Anyway, it’s not like I got some 
                        other offer banging down my door.  
                             (off her sister)
                        Look. Don’t worry. Really. 
                        Actually, I think it’s going to be 
                        OK.

           Off Lauren, hoping for the best, but concerned. 

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE / KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lights out around the house. Brie’s doing the dishes. Lauren 
           comes in. Tired. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You cooked. You don’t have to clean 
                        too.

                                 BRIE
                        Almost done. I’m in the zone. Go on 
                        up. I’ll see you in the morning. 

           Lauren kisses her sister on the head. Goes. A moment then 
           once she’s gone...

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE / BASEMENT - LATER

           Brie sits down at a desk in her new little bunker. The half 
           renovated basement. Not much. But it’s hers. And private.

           She’s at her computer. Everyone else asleep and...

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Here goes nothing.

           Once again, Brie logs into her MODERATION TOOL. Pulls up a 
           SCREEN GRAB of CASSIE’S video page. Scrolls to the comments 
           section. We see what set her off. A disgusting torrent of 
           RACIST TROLLING.

            - i’m cum all over your orangutan face. Lulz.
            - yr momz was raped by King Kong.
            - i’d linch you but you’d probably break the tree.

                        First step, find the asshole.

           Brie scours through it all, looking for the originator. The 
           FIRST COMMENTATOR. The SOURCE. There it is.

           Brie’s fingers flying across the keyboard. Scouring Twitter. 
           Facebook. Google. Reddit. 4chan. She cross references screen 
           names against accounts opened -- against other threads and 
           comments made and --

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        For the most part, finding them is 
                        easy. Most trolls are fuckhead 
                        teenagers. It’s no surprise a guy 
                        who chooses Playboy Super Cock as 
                        his screen name’s not the sharpest 
                        tool in the shed.... 

           There she has it. The dots all lead to...

           Brie hits “paste” and Brett’s greatest racist hits copy onto 
           the screen. With a last look, Brie hits SEND. Shuts her

           INT. OKLAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Brett Fisher - King of the nerds himself - walks down his 
           High School Hall, dawning with the realization that --

           EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT HIM. He reaches his locker. Discovers 
           why. Taped to his door -- printouts of BRIE’S (VICTORIA 
           SOTO’S) EMAIL. Brett Fisher’s greatest hits. Juvenile Racist 
           Bullshit.
           Brett, literally probably, shits his pants. He hurries to rip 
           them down. Shoving them into his locker. Wanting to 
           disappear, only when he closes the door he discovers:

           A WALL OF BLACK TEENAGERS - the FOOTBALL TEAM - waiting to 
           rip him to shreds. Off poor Brett, as his stomach hits the 
           floor and...

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I can’t say for sure that’s what 
                        happened. I know his facebook page 
                        disappeared but - a girl can dream. 
                        Whatever went down, I’ve got to 
                        admit - it felt fucking terrific. 
                        And I wanted to do it again. And 
                        again. And everywhere. 

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

           An obese woman BUTTERS A BAGEL WITH HER FINGER on a crowded 
           subway car. PASSENGERS recoil.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I began to imagine, what if you 
                        could filter them all. 

           Brie among them, regards her with disgust.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Because the internet isn’t an 
                        anomaly. It isn’t abstract. It’s 
                        just the purest distillation of who 
                        we are. And we’re sick.

           EXT. CHELSEA STREET - DAY

           Brie exits a DELI with a salad. Headed back to the office she 
           passes a PUBLIC WIFI / PHONE CHARGING stand (like a phone 
           booth) where she sees --

                        And it’s relentless.

           A VAGRANT watching Porn in the booth, masturbating in a 
           sleeping bag. A MOTHER and YOUNG SON flee in horror. Brie 
           turns a cheek. Soldiers on. 
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I read a story the other day about 
                        a boy who was forced to wear a Tony 
                        the Tiger Costume while his Uncle 
                        and Friends raped him at a Furry 
                        party. You can’t make this shit up. 
                        There are real bogeymen out there 
                        and I was just waking up to it.

           INT. OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           George leads our MODERATORS in a presentation. Brie included.

                                 GEORGE
                        Now that The LIVE function has 
                        launched on the platform, I know 
                        some of you voiced concerns about 
                        the volume and tone of videos 
                        you’ll see. I spoke to Bernadette 
                        and she approved a few of your 
                        requests to remove any child 
                        endangerment videos in your queue 
                        so if anyone has concerns about 
                        that, please let me know...

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Here’s the thing about Child Porn. 
                        It’s the hardest to control cause 
                        no one wants to see it. Even Police 
                        Forces have hard times cataloging 
                        it cause it’s so fucked up to 
                        watch.

           George’s voice fades as Brie’s V.O. rises. On screen however, 
           Brie remains calm and engaged.

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You know they have to hold open 
                        hiring sessions just to get eye 
                        balls on these videos but guess who 
                        shows up. Perverts. A bunch of 
                        pedophiles who think they’ve hit 
                        the fucking lottery until they find 
                        out they’ve gotta put their names 
                        in a database to get the job and 
                        big shocker - they all bounce. 

           George’s voice rises back in as Brie raises her hand.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes, Brie?
                                 BRIE
                        Where will they go? The videos. If 
                        no one’s going to clear them?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, I’m taking on a bit of 
                        moderation work until we get the 
                        new center is up and running in 
                        Mexico City. Bern agreed to take 
                        some on as well but --

                                 BRIE
                        You can put em in my queue, I don't 
                        mind.

           The other Moderator’s buzz. OOOOOHHHH.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Just trying to help.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thanks, Brie. That’s great. Now 
                        next up, let’s talk about some 
                        trending memes we need to unpack. 
                        I’m sure you guys have been seen 
                        this? 

           Video plays on the big TV. Pro Ann Price. A rally. On the 
           screen: a video of foreign effigies burning...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        So. Let’s discuss. Free Speech or 
                        Hate Speech?

           Off Brie, as her phone buzzes. CASSIE. Brie rises to take it. 

           INT. SAFETY NET HALLWAY - LATER

           Brie’s on the phone, speaking furtively. Excited.

                                 BRIE
                        Wait! A kid in your school. And 
                        they did what? That’s amazing?

           INTERCUT - ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE. IRL: CASSIE (the 
           victim from the video, in her SCHOOL PARKING LOT.)

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, I can’t believe it. I don’t 
                        know who found it all but they’re 
                        going to suspend the little shit. I 
                        think it’s finally going to stop. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASSIE (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to call. Thought 
                        you’d wanna know. 

                                 BRIE
                        Thanks. I’m glad you did. Keep your 
                        head up, ok?

           Brie hangs up. Heartened. Empowered. A crack in the ceiling. 

           INT. SAFETY NET OFFICE - DAY

           Tony enters with GRAHAM, a slovenly MODERATOR, mid-
           conversation. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        ...no, I guess it’s something that 
                        I’ve been eating but I’ve been 
                        having these just primordial shits. 
                        Like, from the sludge of the earth.

                                 TONY
                        You’re not healthy. 

           They both pauses to discover Brie at her desk, having 
           overheard. Graham and Tony. Mortified. 

                                 BRIE
                        It sounds like you need to cut out 
                        gluten. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’ll give that a shot.

           Graham hurriedly exits. A moment, just Tony and Brie. 

                                 BRIE
                        Nice friends.

                                 TONY
                        He’s evolving. 

                                 BRIE
                        In which direction?

           Tony eyes her as she cracks a RED BULL. Guzzles. Stares 
           unblinking at a video on her screen. We don’t see it but...

                                 TONY
                        That’s awful. You don't have to 
                        watch the whole thing y’know. 

           Brie jots a few notes. 
                                 BRIE
                        Just trying to be thorough.

                                 TONY
                        All right, Columbo. Well, I’m glad 
                        you’re sticking around. I was 
                        worried about you there for a 
                        minute but -- looks like you’re 
                        doing ok. Any chance I’ll see you 
                        at drinks tonight.

                                 BRIE
                             (actually touched)
                        Maybe. I’ll give it a shot.

                                 TONY
                             (on his way out)
                        Hell of a shiner, by the way. Hate 
                        to see the other guy.

           He goes. Brie warms for a moment, then returns to her 
           mission. The VIDEO. 

           A CHILD IN DANGER. With a quick search. Brie quickly finds 
           the Poster. WHITE MALE. A YOUTUBE PAGE, stacked with LIVE 
           TWITCH GAMER VIDEOS. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Now I wanted to see it myself.

           Brie hits a few keys. On the screen. An address comes up. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

           A GROUP OF MODERATORS enter. Approach the bar. Tony comes in 
           last, scans for Brie. Not here yet. Bartender arrives with a 
           beer.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You’re home early. How was the 
                        office? 

                                 TONY
                        Swell.

           Tony swigs his beer. Eyes the door. Hoping. As we find...

           INT. QUEENS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           Brie, with a coffee, making a phone call in a Bohemian Queens 
           Coffee shop as she sets up her computer at a table by the 
           window. On the phone. Brie pumps up her nerve and then...
                                 911 OPERATOR (FILTERED)
                        911- what’s your emergency?

                                 BRIE
                             (pretty on point)
                        I’m stuck. In a house. My 
                        boyfriend. He has a gun. He said 
                        he’s going to kill me. Oh god. I 
                        think he killed my father. I know 
                        he has a bomb. Please help. 

                                 911 OPERATOR
                        You say he killed your father? Can 
                        you tell me what the address is?

                                 BRIE
                        Yes, it’s 601 Foster Ave. Apt. 4. 
                        Please come quick. I don’t want him 
                        to hear me. I think I need to go. 
                        Oh no.

           Click. Brie hangs up. 

           TURN TO REVEAL - she is seated in a coffee shop before THE 
           HOUSE. 601 Foster Ave. 

           Brie calmly puts on headphones. Opens her computer and loads 
           a TWITCH PAGE. A LIVE STREAM MULTI-CAM VIDEO FEED.

           PEDOPHILE DANNY, in his bedroom playing a video game. Other 
           GAMERS on OTHER SCREENS, playing along. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Gametime.

           Brie watches the screen as out the window in the BG -- A SWAT 
           VAN screams to a stop outside 601 and a SWAT TEAM pours out. 

           ARMED OFFICERS set up a permitter. Advances on the HOUSE. 

                                 SWAT LEADER
                        POLICE! SEARCH WARRANT! OPEN UP! 
                        POLICE! SEARCH WARRANT! OPEN UP!

           No answer. Out come the battering rams. PEOPLE in THE CAFE 
           have caught wind, filling the windows. Rubbernecking as...

           BOOM! The SWAT TEAM crashes through the door, invading the 
           house and only Brie has a front row view as...

           ON HER SCREEN: the LIVE GAMER feed is suddenly interrupted 
           by...
           5 ARMED SWAT DUDES - storming DANNY’S BEDROOM - throwing him 
           to the ground with shocking violence...the other GAMERS 
           shitting their pants...

                                 SWAT LEADER (CONT’D)
                        ON THE GROUND. Where’s the Girl? 
                        Where’s the fucking BOMB?

                                 DANNY
                        Bomb? What Bomb?

                                 GAMERS
                        Dude! Oh my god. I think he’s 
                        getting swatted.

           They watch in disbelief as THE COPS rip the place apart and 
           then discover...

                                 SWAT LEADER
                        Lookie lookie lookie. You know what 
                        they do to pedophiles in Rikers?

           Jackpot. No bomb. But a bombshell. Danny’s treasure trove of 
           KIDDIE PORN. Pandemonium. 

           The GAMERS stare in shock as the COPS drag Danny from the 
           room -- 

                                 GAMERS
                        Holy shit! You guys seeing this? 

           The RUBBERNECKS pressed to the window of the CAFE as Danny’s 
           dragged out onto the street -- thrown onto the side walk as 
           NEWS CREWS ARRIVE and...

           There’s BRIE, with a front row seat, in quiet contentment, 
           watching her masterpiece. Off her growing excitement - push 
           in on...

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           ...Tony. Taking a shot. Last man standing. Looks up to see - 

                                 BRIE
                        You wanna get the fuck out of here?

           Brie, entering the bar. Ready to party. SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Brie pounds a line of COKE off her hand. Hands Tony back the 
           vile. He does his own. BOOM. As soon at it hits we’re...
           INT. BUSHWICK DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

           In the middle of a PULSING RAVE. Pounding electronica. Strobe 
           lights flashing over -- Brie and Tony -- jumping in the 
           middle -- then KISSING -- mauling each other and --

           INT. BATHROOM. BUSHWICK DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

           Brie and Tony fuck in the dark. On Brie - liberated. As the 
           music pounds over top, drowning everything else out and --

           INT. TONY’S LOFT - MORNING

           Tony wakes up to discover Brie’s not there. He checks his 
           phone. Still very early then he hears the toilet flush and 
           Brie emerges from the Bathroom, pulling on her clothes.

                                 TONY
                        You leaving? It’s 5 in the morning.

                                 BRIE
                        I got a big day. I’ll see you at 
                        work. Thanks for last night. 

           She goes. No kiss. On Tony, a little hurt. 

                                 TRAINER (PRE-LAP)
                        This isn’t about your fucking beach 
                        body. This isn’t about getting 
                        ripped for some bullshit propaganda 
                        picture on Instagram.

           INT. CROSS FIT GYM - DAY

           Brie, like a soldier again, in a PLATOON of CROSSFIT rookies 
           getting reamed by the RIPPED TRAINER.

                                 TRAINER
                        This is about getting prepared for 
                        life. For the next hurricane. For 
                        the next flood. For the next 
                        attack.

           As TRAINER CONTINUES, SEE:

                        This is about what you are and 
                        aren’t going to be able to do when 
                        disaster strikes. Can you carry 
                        your weight or will you need to be 
                        carried?

                        Nice work. Keep at it. 

           Brie smiles through sweat. Picks up the bar. Keeps pounding.

                        The feeling was -- empowering. And 
                        Tony was right after all. I was 
                        addicted.

                        There’s a dog fighting ring out in 
                        Ozone Park. The man who runs it is 
                        Terrence Littlefield. Posts videos

                                 GEORGE (PRE-LAP)
                        I assume you know why you’re here?

           INT. GEORGE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Brie sits stone faced across from George. Reviewing her logs.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s come to my attention that 
                        you’ve missed some of your 
                        counseling sessions?

           Turn to reveal Alexis, the Counselor, present as well. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        It’s also come to my attention - 
                        that despite our previous 
                        conversation - you've reached out 
                        personally to some of the users 
                        you’re moderating. That can’t 
                        continue. If corporate were to find 
                        out, that’d be it. 
                             (off Brie’s silence)
                        Now is there something going on 
                        that you think we should know 
                        about?

                                 BRIE
                        No. I don’t think so.

           George and Alexis share a look. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        Look Brie, all we’re saying is - 
                        you are not the first person we’ve 
                        seen go through this. You’re doing 
                        great work and you’re very valuable 
                        but you’re exposing yourself to 
                        some very traumatic material. You 
                        might not understand how it is 
                        affecting you til much later, and 
                        by then it might be too late. 
                        That’s what we’re here for. To be 
                        an ear so don’t have to hold it in.

                                 BRIE
                        I’m not. I promise. I’ve just - 
                        found another outlet. Believe me, 
                        I’m not holding it in. 
           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

           Brie and Lucille ride the subway home from school. Brie 
           notices OTHER RIDERS looking at Lucille. Lucille notices too.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Brie. What’s a Gorbachev?

                                 BRIE
                        Well, Gorbachev was the leader of 
                        Russia. A long time ago. 
                             (beat)
                        Did you hear that at school?
                             (Lucille nods)
                        Don’t listen to those kids, ok? 
                        They’re idiots. Gorbachev was the 
                        president of a whole country and he 
                        had a birthmark on his face, just 
                        like you, and it didn’t stop him.  
                             (that only helps a little)
                        You know what people also call 
                        these? (her birthmarks). Firemarks. 
                        You got touched by a dragon and you 
                        survived and you know what that 
                        means? That you got a Dragon by 
                        your side and if those kids don’t 
                        watch out, that Dragon’s coming for 
                        them. 
                             (she smiles)
                        You know who that Dragon is?

                                 LUCILLE
                        You. 

                                 BRIE
                        You’re fucking A right. And I won’t 
                        let anything happen to you. Now 
                        let’s go get some ice cream. I’ll 
                        take you to the place your Grandpa 
                        used to take me and your mommy when 
                        we were little. Best in the city.

           INT. BROOKLYN ICE CREAM PARLOR - DAY

           Sun flooding the windows of a Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop. 
           Brie and Lucille, at the counter, sharing a Sundae.

                                 BRIE
                        I didn’t know you had jobs at 
                        school. What are the teachers 
                        doing?
                                 LUCILLE
                        Not jobs like that! We’re just 
                        helping. Like Line Leader. Or Lunch 
                        helper or something.

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. Ok and what’s yours?

                                 LUCILLE
                        I’m the trash helper. I help clean 
                        up all the toys and books and 
                        trash. It’s the best job. 

                                 BRIE
                        I believe it.

           They’re sharing this little moment when...

                                 JENNY (O.S.)
                        Brie! Oh my god. Hi. 

           Jenny - Brie’s friend from the bar and the videos - is in 
           line with a FRIEND and in dramatic shock over this sighting.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Well you look -- different. How 
                        have you been?

                                 BRIE
                             (sotto to Lucille)
                        Christ. 
                             (then like flipping a 
                              switch)
                        Hey Jenny! Oh my god. How you 
                        doing? 

                                 JENNY
                        I mean, honestly? I’m not really 
                        sure I should even be talking to 
                        you. After what happened with 
                        Peter.

                                 BRIE
                        Talking to me? 

                                 JENNY
                        He’s a real mess, you know. I mean, 
                        it’s none of my business but I 
                        thought we were friends. If you 
                        were seeing some other guy, why 
                        didn’t you just --
                                 BRIE
                        What? Is that what he told you? 
                        That I was cheating on him?

                                 JENNY
                        Well - weren’t you?

                                 BRIE
                        Jesus Christ. That cocksucker. You 
                        don’t know do you?

                                 JENNY
                        Know what?

                                 BRIE
                        I’m sorry. I should have told you.  

           Brie’s steaming. She grabs Lucille from her chair. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, honey. We gotta go. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        I’m not finished. 

                                 BRIE
                        You can finish on the train. 

           Brie’s hurriedly pulling their shit together to leave. On the 
           way out the door. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor - you see Peter - 
                        tell him to go fuck himself. 
                        Actually, you know what - I’ll tell 
                        him myself.

                        In the olden days, public 
                        humiliation was accepted. The

                        In Iran they used to whip people’s 
                        feet. I, for one, am not sure why 
                        we got rid of it.

           His HUSBAND beside him, turns on the light.  

                                 HUSBAND
                        What is it?

                        someone get flogged. 
           EXT. CONDE NASTE BUILDING - DAY

           Peter enters the offices of this publishing powerhouse.

           INT. LITERARY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

           All smiles, Peter HELLOS through the morning office when a 
           Secretary catches him at his desk. Not warm.

                                 SECRETARY
                        David would like to see you. Now. 
                        They’re waiting in the Conference 
                        Room.

           Off Peter, blissfully unaware.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Peter pushes through the glass doors to find DAVID (our 
           Princetonian - revealed to be the Editor of this Magazine) 
           seated with a firing squad of LAWYERS. 

                                 DAVID
                        Peter. Don’t bother sitting. This 
                        won’t take long.

                                 PETER
                        What’s going on?

                                 DAVID
                        You tell us?

           Peter’s knees buckle as he’s passed a PRINT OUT. Knows it 
           before he sees it. Brie’s handiwork. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        The source who sent this to us had 
                        the decency to spare us the videos 
                        but you obviously did not. You know 
                        our legal team here.
                             (the suits)
                        They can run you through the fine 
                        print of it but we have a 
                        responsibility to turn this over to 
                        the authorities, assuming they 
                        haven’t received it already. The 
                        short and sweet of it is - pack 
                        your things and get out of here. 
                        You’re fired.

                                 PETER
                        Do I get a chance to defend myself?
                                 DAVID
                        Sure. You should. Get a lawyer. A 
                        criminal one. You’re going to need 
                        it. Security will escort you out.

           On Peter, watching the GUILLOTINE drop.

           INT. LITERARY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

           All eyes are on Peter at his desk, as he packs the last of 
           his belonging into a sad little box. SECURITY OFFICERS wait 
           to escort him from the building. 

           As Peter makes his walk-of-shame, he searches his co-workers 
           support. For a hint of sympathy. Instead --

           A FEMALE CO-WORKER throws an ELBOW into his gut as he passes, 
           scattering the box and his belongings on the floor. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Pervert.

           Off Peter, weakly retrieving the pieces of his life. 

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        This, I thought, was power. But it 
                        wasn’t long before I realized, I 
                        was actually powerless. 

           EXT. LUCILLE’S SCHOOL - MORNING

           Still disheveled, Brie drops Lucille off at her PRESCHOOL. 

                                 BRIE
                        Your mom’s picking you up. I’ve 
                        gotta work. See you at home 
                        tonight. Love you. 

           Lucille runs off. Joins her class. Brie lingers for a moment, 
           watching. Little Lucille. Incredible earnest. Incredible 
           sweet. With no means of defense when --

           The BOYS begin to tease. Innocent, but merciless. GORBACHEV. 
           GORBACHEV. GORBACHEV.

           On Brie, watching from a far. Boiling. 
           INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           Brie rides a crowded train. Still beaming with some smug 
           satisfaction we don’t understand when - the train suddenly 
           lurches to a stop. A beat then...

                                 TRAIN ANNOUNCER (FILTERED)
                        Ladies and gentleman, we’re being 
                        delayed due to an incident at Union 
                        Square. Astor Place will be the 
                        next and final stop on this train. 
                        We hope to be moving shortly. Thank 
                        you for your patience. 

           Collective GROANS through the train. On Brie - suspicious. 

           EXT. ASTOR PLACE STATION - DAY

           Brie, in a sea of other commuters, ascends the subway stairs 
           as one by one - with eerie synchronicity...

           ALERTS SOUND out on EVERYBODY’S PHONE. In unison, they turn 
           to their screens. Faces pale. Brie reaches the street. Reads 
           her own.

           EMERGENCY ALERT: WANTED - AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI FOR QUESTIONING 
           IN UNION SQUARE BOMBING. CONSIDER DANGEROUS. CALL 9-1-1 if 
           seen.

           A PHOTO of YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN attached. 

           Brie views it in the crowds as an caravan of AMBULANCES roars 
           past. Fear swelling as...

           EXT. UNION SQUARE - DAY

           Like a moth, Brie’s drawn with the crowds flocking north to 
           Union Square where she finds...

           A war zone. A POLICE PERIMETER blocks the whole park. 
           FIRETRUCKS. AMBULANCES. SMOKE BILLOWING. BARRICADES holding 
           back the RUBBERNECKERS. 

           Brie approaches an ONLOOKER.

                                 BRIE
                        What happened?

                                 ONLOOKER
                        There was a bomb in the trashcan. 
                        Just went off like -- (boom!)
           Brie squeezes to the front of the crowds to see...

           THE CRATER OF A BOMB BLAST in the middle of the park. 
           AUTHORITIES EVERYWHERE. A BOMB DEFUSING ROBOT crawling 
           through the wreckage like a rover on MARS. 

           On Brie’s face - in neutered silence. A POLICEMAN ushers her 
           back.

                                 POLICE
                        C’mon. Everyone back. Behind the 
                        barricades. Please. 

           Brie’s slow to move, turning only with the ring of her phone. 
           LAUREN. She answers, moving away. 

                                 BRIE
                        Hey - I’m OK. Lucille’s fine. I 
                        dropped her off. Are you OK?
                             (relief)
                        Ok. No. I’m already here. I’m going 
                        to the office -- I know. I will but 
                        I have to. They need me.

           Off Brie. Hurrying off. Chaos swirling all around her and...

           EXT. THE COMPANY - DAY

           Brie arrives to find the entrance busy with NEWS. POLICE. 
           BOMB SNIFFING DOGS. She slips passed it - to their private 
           entrance where...

           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie walks into Mission Control. Command Central. COMPUTER 
           SCREENS EVERYWHERE run NEWS FOOTAGE of the attack. 

           SENIOR STAFF never seen below ground-level busying about.  
           SUITS that might be FEDS combing through paperwork.

           George and Bernadette scan them through videos as Brie 
           reaches her desk with the other outsiders.

                                 BRIE
                        What’s going on?

                                 NICOLA
                        They’re looking for live videos 
                        from this morning to find the 
                        bomber. George already queued a 
                        few. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICOLA (CONT'D)
                        They’re talking with legal about 
                        turning them over to the FEDS. 

                                 TONY
                        $100 says he learned to make the 
                        bomb on YouTube.

                                 NICOLA
                        You would know. 
                             (to Brie)
                        Wanna see? Don’t tell anyone I 
                        showed you this.

           She does. Nicola pulls up the videos. A YOUNG COUPLE live 
           streaming their dog walk in the park when -- BOOM! A fireball 
           ignites behind them, shaking the image until it crashes. 

                                 BRIE
                        Jesus. 

                                 NICOLA
                        I know. In another one you can see 
                        the Bomber. The Full Sail team’s in 
                        there - 
                             (conference room)
                        -- trying to piece it all together. 
                        They put up a queue for us to dump 
                        anything related so they can check 
                        it out. 

                                 BRIE
                        He was a user? The bomber?

           Nicola and Tony both nod. 

                                 TONY
                        Can’t catch ‘em all Columbo. 

           INT. SAFETY NET - LATER

           Brie’s at her desk. No time for work. She’s devouring NEWS. 
           Bodies carted out of the park. Police lights swirling. 

                                 REPORTER (ON VIDEO)
                        ...and as the manhunt continues for 
                        the bomber or bombers of today’s 
                        attack, large anti-immigrant 
                        protests have gathered in cities 
                        all over the country.

                        And this is what the liberal media 
                        doesn’t want to admit, Chuck. Is 
                        that by worrying about offending 
                        people, by not calling these 
                        attacks what they are - Radical 
                        Islamic Terror - you have made this 
                        country weaker and you should be 
                        ashamed. It is time to stop being 
                        polite. Stop protecting the people 
                        who are trying to kill us and start 
                        looking out for the Americans here. 
                        We need to keep these people out.

           Brie, like she could kill her right through the screen as --

                                 GEORGE
                        Crazy day. You doing ok?

           Brie quickly closes obsessive search windows. Faces George.

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah, just want to do something to 
                        help. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Good. Cause something’s come up. 
                        We’re still waiting for The FBI to 
                        tell us what they want. 

                                 BRIE
                        Full Sail didn’t catch it? 

                                 GEORGE
                        We don’t know. No one knows what 
                        the fuck’s going on but meanwhile, 
                        Bernadette and I are supposed to be 
                        in Vegas tomorrow for this cyber 
                        security conference and now 
                        obviously, we can’t, but we need 
                        someone from our team to support 
                        the LIVE demo. Is this your 
                        notebook?

           George grabs a pen. Jots something down on Brie’s journal. 
           Brie’s nervous he’s so close to her world, but George’s mind 
           is spread too thin to notice. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        That’s my username and password. 
                        You’ll need it for the demo. You 
                        and Tony know the product. You two 
                        seem to work well. Think you could 
                        hop in our shoes?
           INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - MORNING

           Brie and a whiskey, sitting at an AIRPORT BAR, glued to CABLE 
           NEWS. An on screen FACE-OFF: The MAYOR OF NEW YORK (RICHARD 
           CANTOR) vs. ANN PRICE.

                                 MAYOR CANTOR
                        I’m not saying that. Protecting the 
                        people of this city is our first 
                        priority but the kind of blanket 
                        racism and ethnic profiling you are 
                        proposing is not only illegal and 
                        inhumane, it’s flat-out dangerous. 
                        You’re telling us we must sacrifice 
                        our ideals as a country to protect 
                        ourselves, and I’m telling you - 
                        once we sacrifice those ideals, 
                        we’ve already lost. 

                                 ANN PRICE
                        Well there you have it folks. 
                        Another weak leader afraid to call 
                        a spade a spade. Sad. Really. 
                        Because you Mr. Mayor and all the 
                        rest of you Beta’s out there in 
                        sanctuary cities - are the number 
                        one problem. You have blood on your 
                        hands and I’m telling you now, that 
                        will not stand. Not for me and not 
                        for the millions of American’s who 
                        feel the same. Not one more day. 

                                 MAYOR CANTOR
                        Is that a threat?

                                 ANN PRICE
                        Call it a prophecy, cause there are 
                        a lot more people who think like me 
                        out there than you. 

           Behind Brie, Tony arrives, ushering her away. 

                                 TONY
                        You ready? They’re boarding. I like 
                        to get on first.

           On Brie, a last look at the screen. At Price. Fury. She 
           pounds her drink and...

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Brie and Tony in First Class. Vodka nips on their trays. 
           Brie’s on her phone.
                                 TONY
                        Don’t tell me you’re working right 
                        now?

                                 BRIE
                        Do you see what she’s doing? To her 
                        followers. She just put out a hit 
                        on him.

           Because Brie’s scanning TWITTER. Comments flying from ANN 
           PRICE’S followers:

           (((Cantor’s))) a bitch -- problem numero uno is about to get 
           solved. -- 2nd amendment solutions #NOLK.

           Brie reads that again. #NOLK. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        NOLK? What’s that? See Full Sail 
                        didn’t catch it because they don’t 
                        know what to look for. I’m telling 
                        you, this bitch is scary. This is 
                        what we should be worried about.

                                 TONY
                        Yeah, she’s a lunatic. But she’s 
                        not the one reading hate memes on a 
                        first class flight to Vegas. C’mon.

           Tony takes away her phone. Hands her a drink. It takes a 
           second for Brie to warm. 

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever even been to Vegas? 
                        It’s a cesspool. You’re going to 
                        love it. For one night. It’s the 
                        fucking best. 

                                 BRIE
                        I’ve been. One time. On a break 
                        from Ft. Hood. It wasn’t really for 
                        me. At the time. 

                                 TONY
                        Well, good thing for you -- times 
                        have changed. 

           Tony cheers. Kisses her. They down their drinks as...

           EXT. AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING

           Their PLANE touches down in Vegas. A runway lit by the STRIP.
           EXT. LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER - ESTABLISHING

           In the valley beneath casinos, the largest convention center 
           in the country...

           INT. LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Brie and Tony, with their bags, enter a sprawling hall. 
           GAMBLERS. TOURISTS. EX-MILITARY. And TECH-NERDS. SIGNAGE and 
           BADGED VOLUNTEERS all around announcing the conference: 

           BLACKHAT. 2018. THE WORLD’S PREMIERE CYBER SECURITY EVENT

                                 VOLUNTEER
                        You guys here for Black Hat? 

                                 TONY
                        How’d you guess?

                                 VOLUNTEER
                        Well, you don’t look like your here 
                        for the Gun Show. It’s going on at 
                        the same time. Follow me. Check 
                        in’s right over. I’ll get you set-
                        up.

           Off Brie, watching the VETS and RIGHT-WING NUT JOBS angling 
           toward another wing.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Brie and Tony check in at a BLACKHAT reception table. 

                                 VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                        These are your badges. Keep them 
                        with you because you won’t be 
                        allowed in without them. Event 
                        schedule. Booth map. Gift bag. All 
                        set. 

           Brie and Tony, loaded down with gear.

                                 TONY
                        Ok. Looks like we don’t have to be 
                        at the booth until 6. I’m gonna go 
                        to the hotel and dump this shit. 
                        You wanna come and get a drink?

                                 BRIE
                        Actually, I think I’m gonna take a 
                        look around. I’ll catch up with you 
                        later all right?
           Brie heads off. Tony watches her go.

           INT. LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Brie descends an escalator into the abyss. A THOUSAND 
           ATTENDEES swarming the convention center floor, lined with 
           BOOTHS, stoking tech fears, shilling SECURITY SOLUTIONS for 
           every manner of attack. 

           Brie walks the stalls. PRESENTERS hawking their wares. A 
           banner: BLACK OUTS FREAK OUTS STAKE OUTS: “The looming terror 
           attack on your home automation devices.”

           A PRESENTER before a wall display of internet connected 
           devices - Thermostat. Baby monitor. Fridge. Slow cooker.

                                 IOT PRESENTER
                        ...and I, your personal terrorist, 
                        can control any of these devices. 
                        From my phone. From an internet 
                        cafe across the globe. I can demand 
                        a ransom to turn down your 
                        thermostat. Short-out your fridge. 
                        Scare your children to death right 
                        over their baby monitor. Unless you 
                        protect yourself. 

           ON TO THE NEXT: YOU ARE BEING RECORDED

           Brie listens to a RUSSIAN WOMAN with a wireless headset.

                                 RUSSIAN WOMAN
                        It’s not just every conversation on 
                        your phone. It the conversations 
                        around your Alexa. Around you 
                        child’s smart doll. Around anything 
                        with a microphone and an internet 
                        connection - you should assume is 
                        being recorded, mined, studied, and 
                        harvested -- it is like the KGB, 
                        only worse. 

           AND THE NEXT: INVINCEA - OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES

           A MAN. Former Military Intelligence. In a company Polo Shirt 
           preaches before a small rapt crowd. 

                                 INVINCEA REP
                        ...your system has holes that 
                        hackers will exploit. The biggest 
                        of which are your employees. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 INVINCEA REP (CONT'D)
                        We at Invincea bridge the 
                        challenges to patching human 
                        vulnerabilities, starting with 
                        programs to phish your own 
                        employees and weed out the weak 
                        spots. 

           Brie listens to the fear-mongering from the back of the 
           crowd. Bored, she turns away. Spotting in the distance: those 
           same CAMO-CLAD throngs attending another the conference. Off 
           Brie, as she considers..

                                 NRA SPOKESMAN (PRE-LAP)
                        The elites in the country are 
                        waging a war on your freedoms but 
                        we are not backing down. 

           INT. VEGAS GUN SHOW - DAY

           High above the crowds: an NRA commercial proselytizes on a 
           JUMBO-TRON. 

                                 NRA SPOKESMAN (ON VIDEO)
                        Stand up if you want to protect 
                        your right to protect yourself. 
                        Stand up if you want to protect 
                        your freedom. Stand up!

           Brie passes beneath it, entering a crowd offering a very 
           different mode of security. Booth after booth. Table after 
           table. Lined with ARTILLERY.  

           HANDGUNS. ASSAULT RIFLES. HIGH CAPACITY MAGS. TACTICAL VESTS. 
           VIDEO DEMOS showing weapons in action. Anything one needs to 
           wage a war. Brie moves through it - woke.   

                                 TIM
                        Anything catch your eye?

                                 BRIE
                        Everything.

           She’s stopped before a booth lined with HANDGUNS. TIM, a 
           friendly, sunburned, stubbled vet, mans the goods.   

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        That an M9? I haven’t shot one of 
                        those since basic. 

                                 TIM
                        Well go on. Check it out. Like 
                        riding a bike. 
           Brie picks up the gun. Weighing it in her hands like a grail. 
           She speed strips it. Reassembles. Tim likes what he sees.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Annie Oakley. Where’d you serve?

                                 BRIE
                        Fort Lee. Basic-ed there. Two tours 
                        in Afghanistan. Bagram. You? 

                                 TIM
                        Desert Storm. Out in ‘05. Tell ya 
                        what, never thought I’d see the day 
                        when shit was more fucked up here 
                        than over there, but here we are.

                                 BRIE
                        Fucking A.

           Brie, falling back into this familiar patter with ease. Still 
           holding the piece. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Any chance there’s a way for a girl 
                        to test this baby out?

           Off Tim, with a glint in his eye...

           INT. BLACKHAT CONFERENCE HALL - EVENING

           Close on Tony’s phone. 6:05. Tony views it, worried. Brie’s 
           not here. Sends another text. The 5th unanswered. WHERE R U??

           As soon as he hits sends...

                                 PRESENTER
                        Hey man, can you show me that click-
                        through again? I’m still hitting 
                        some glitch.

                                 TONY
                        Yeah. Sure. No problem. 

           Tony returns to the COMPANY’S BOOTH to help the PRESENTERS 
           trouble shoot their demo. Off his last, futile look at the 
           door, we find...

           I/E. TIM’S F-150 - MOVING

           Brie’s in the passenger seat. Dust kicking up out the window 
           as they move into the Desert. Tim at the wheel. Earnest.
                                 TIM
                        Yeah I feel unappreciated. I served 
                        my country. I didn’t lose a leg but 
                        I lost friends. I sacrificed but 
                        who back here gives a shit? No one 
                        wants to know who does the dirty 
                        work - they just want it done. And 
                        have you heard about this Stolen 
                        Valor shit? These fuckers in 
                        Airports, civilians - never served - 
                        who go around in full dress, fruit 
                        salad - medals all over like 
                        they’re fucking General Patton so 
                        they can get upgraded to Business 
                        Class and shit. It makes me fucking 
                        sick. Those dudes need to get tuned 
                        up. Hard. Nothing’s on the level 
                        anymore.

           On Brie, nodding in agreement.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        We’re just up here.

           EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 

           Brie - BERATTA in hand - firing off shots at an outdoor 
           desert FIRING RANGE. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

           She removes hear EAR PRO. Admires her handiwork. Dead on 
           balls. Tim at her side. 

                                 TIM
                        Not fucking bad. You wanna try 
                        something really fun?

           He moves her over to another position. A mounted, crank 
           operated DOUBLE BARREL ASSAULT RIFLE.

                                 BRIE
                        What the fuck is that?

                                 TIM
                        This, my dear, is a custom job. Two 
                        AR-15 uppers. Alternating firing. 
                        Thousand rounds a minute. Just turn 
                        the crank and --

           Tim demonstrates. Turns the crank. With childlike ease. Two 
           assault rifles explode into the desert - PTPTPTPTPPTPT!
                                 BRIE
                        Thousand rounds a minute? And this 
                        is legal? Anyone can buy this?

                                 TIM
                        Yes, ma’am. Anyone with seven 
                        thousand bucks. Per the ATF, this 
                        is not a machine gun. Not a 
                        regulated thing any more than your 
                        run-of-the-mill AR-15. But believe 
                        me, this baby ain’t run-of-the-
                        mill. Wanna give ‘er a go?

                                 BRIE
                        Fuck yeah.

           Brie steps up to the plate. Here goes nothing. She turns the 
           crank - RPTPTPTPTPTP! - unloads a mag so fast it blows her 
           hair back. Brie HOLLERS.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit! 

                                 TIM
                        Right? Fucking trouble maker. How’d 
                        you like to have that back in New 
                        York?

           Off Brie. It’s a joke, but a girl can dream...

           INT. ARIA HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Lobby level bar. Gaming tables in the B.G. Tony, nursing a 
           beer beneath the TVs. Not enjoying the festivities.

           Hours late, Brie finally arrives. Alive. Like she’s come 
           straight from the mountain top.

                                 BRIE
                        Hey. Sorry. I ran into some people 
                        I knew and just lost track of time. 
                        Don’t be pissed. You survive the 
                        demo with out me?

                                 TONY
                        Yeah. But it was a fucking 
                        snoozefest. You know you could’ve 
                        given me a heads up you were going 
                        to bail. At least help me cover for 
                        you.
                                 BRIE
                        I know. I’m sorry. But I’m here 
                        now. Let’s get after it. You said 
                        this place is a cesspool. I wanna 
                        fucking party. 

           But Tony’s sour. Pouting. Finishes his beer. 

                                 TONY
                        Nah. I’m tired. I’m going to bed. 
                        You’ll have to slum it with out me. 
                        Have a fun night. 

           Tony pays his tab. Goes. Leaving Brie alone. Shaking her 
           head. A moment. Her phone buzzes. Call from CASSIE.

           Brie considers. Before she can answer. The BARTENDER arrives 
           with a SCOTCH. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        From the guys down there. 

           Brie looks down the bar. TWO HANDSOME FINANCE GUYS. Predators 
           looking her way. She considers the glass. The phone. Cassie. 
           She sends it to VOICEMAIL. 

           Picks up the drink. Cheers. They approach. 

                                 BANKER #1
                        We weren’t trying to eavesdrop but 
                        I heard your convo. You still 
                        looking to party? I promise, we 
                        don’t plan on getting tired.

           Brie looks down. Off his hand, palming a bag of COKE...

           INT. ARIA HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Brie downs a line. Comes up for air to reveal:

           She’s in her hotel room. High as a kite. Partying with the  
           TWO BANKERS. Everyone getting close. Handsy. Shedding 
           clothes. Tongues. Hands. Everyone at once. 

           On Brie, letting everything go. No holds barred. Taking both 
           of them at once as Vegas neon glows out the window and...

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Brie’s on the plane. Reeling with a hangover. Tony beside 
           her. Utter silence. Finally...
                                 TONY
                        What? No hate memes to read?
                        Fun time last night?

           On Brie, what does he know? Better just not to answer and...

           EXT. JFK - DAY

           Pouring rain. Passenger pick-up. Brie and Tony, enemies in 
           the cab line. They finally get a taxi. Gallant, Tony opens 
           the door. Brie doesn’t enter. 

                                 BRIE
                        You take it. I’ll get the next one. 
                        I think I’m gonna swing by work.

                                 TONY
                        It’s Sunday. 
                             (no use arguing)
                        Suit yourself. That shit’ll rot 
                        your brain. 

                                 BRIE
                        You would know.

           Hurt but managing a smile, Tony gets in his cab. Speeds away. 
           On Brie, as her own taxi arrives. 

           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie enters the office. Empty. Save for the CONFERENCE ROOM. 
           George and a handful of suits; a closed door meeting. 

           Brie studies them curiously on the way to her desk. George 
           sees. Emerges. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Brie. What are you doing here? How 
                        was the trip?

                                 BRIE
                        Good. Easy. I was - I just wanted 
                        to clear my queue. I didn’t have 
                        time before we left. 
                             (of the meeting)
                        What’s going on? Is this Full Sail? 
                        Did you find anything on the 
                        bomber?

                                 GEORGE
                        What? No. Not yet. I can’t really 
                        discuss it. Go home. It’s Sunday. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Your queue can wait. That’s not a 
                        request. 

           Brie, holding a last look at this shadowy meeting then...

           INT. LAUREN’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Brie enters. Locks the door. Doesn’t take off her coat. 
           Doesn’t unpack her bag. Goes straight for her computer. With 
           her notebook. On the hunt. Anything about ANN PRICE. Her 
           followers. Their agenda.

           She’s on REDDIT. 4CHAN. 8CHAN. TWITTER. An army of anonymous 
           ANGRY WHITE MEN retweeting her missives. Trolling her 
           enemies. 

           GIFS of burning BLACK EFFIGIES. LIBERAL WOMEN photoshopped 
           raped. Links to Mass Shooter Manifestos. Elliot Rodgers. 
           Virginia Tech. Dylan Kliebold. Dylan Roof. 

           She’s cataloging the names. The Users. The feeling of an 
           obsession. And over and over again; she’s finds this hashtag.

           #NOLK. #NOLK. #NOLK. On Brie, trying to unpack its meaning.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

           Brie’s flying on a run. But this isn’t a work-out. It’s a 
           reconnaissance mission. She exits the park. Slows as she 
           approaches her target.

           A FIFTH AVENUE TOWER. A CROWD of PROTESTORS across the 
           street, chanting Liberal Memes. THE FUTURE IS FEMALE. AMERICA 
           WAS FOUNDED BY IMMIGRANTS.

           Brie slips in at the back of the pack. Watching:

           The entrance of the highrise where SECURITY PERSONAL appear, 
           ushering ANN PRICE herself out the doors. Into a waiting SUV. 

           The crowd goes RABID. On Brie, watching silently. Scary.

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Brie comes back from her run. On alert. On edge. In a zone. 
           Takes a moment to realize --

           Lauren and Teddy, waiting for her in the kitchen. Silence.
                                 BRIE
                        Geez. You scared me. I didn’t even 
                        see you there.

                                 LAUREN
                             (to Lucille)
                        Honey, go play in the other room. 
                        You can watch a show. 

           Lucille leaves on the double. 

                                 BRIE
                        Loosening up on that huh?

                                 LAUREN
                        Are you crazy? 
                             (beat)
                        Did you threaten a kid at Lucille’s 
                        school?
                             (Off Brie’s pokerface)
                        You didn’t tell this kid Emek you’d 
                        cut off his dick off with nail 
                        clippers? 

           Brie - can’t help herself - snickers.

                                 TEDDY
                        You think this is funny? She had to 
                        talk this kid’s parents out of 
                        calling the police. You’re lucky 
                        you’re not in jail.  What the fuck 
                        were you thinking?

                                 BRIE
                        I was just trying to send a 
                        message.

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh, you sent a message all right. 
                        Loud and clear. What the fuck’s 
                        going on with you? You’re out all 
                        night. You’re drunk all the time. 
                        You stink like sex. This job is 
                        fucking with your head. 

                                 BRIE
                        You know what - nevermind. I can’t 
                        do this right now. I’ve got bigger 
                        things to deal with. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Like what?
                                 BRIE
                        You wouldn’t understand. 

           Brie grabs her purse. Phone. Jacket. Heads out the door.

                                 TEDDY
                        I want her out of here.

           Lauren’s concerned. 

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Some people can’t see what’s right 
                        in front of their faces. You’re 
                        protecting them. And they don’t 
                        even know it. 

           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Still in her running clothes, Brie comes in hot. Tony catches 
           her vibes from across the room. Immediately on alert as --

           Brie beelines for George who’s touring the office with a NEW 
           FEMALE RECRUIT, a striking resemblance to Brie. (At least, 
           when we first met her.)

                                 GEORGE
                             (giving his spiel)
                        You spend the morning on videos, 
                        the afternoon on photos and 
                        comments.  We have a group meeting 
                        once a week to discuss new trends 
                        and --

                                 BRIE
                        Can I talk to you?

           George startles to find Brie blocking their path. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Morning Brie. I’m - uh - kind of in 
                        the middle of something here. Can’t 
                        this wait a few --

                                 BRIE
                        No. It can’t. You need to see this 
                        now. 

           Unsettled, George excuses himself. She pulls him aside. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen this shit?
           She hands George her notebooks. A crazy scrawl of manic 
           scribblings. Code. Usernames. Hashtags. George views it with 
           suspicion. One word circles again and again. #NOLK.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a call to action the Price 
                        trolls are using. It’s popping 
                        everywhere. Do you know what it 
                        means? 

           George reads it. Shakes his head. 

                                 GEORGE
                        What is it? Some Tolkien Reference? 
                        This is not the kind of thing you 
                        should --

                                 BRIE
                        You’re not listening. Look at it! 
                        It’s not a fucking Tolken reference 
                        -- this is a hit. NOLK. It means 
                        Night of the Long Knives. Does that 
                        mean anything to you? No?
                             (beat)
                        It was the night Hitler 
                        consolidated power. The night the 
                        Nazis murdered their opponents. 
                        Purged the dissidents. 

                                 GEORGE
                             (now scared. of her)
                        Where did you find this?

                                 BRIE
                        The internet. It was connected to 
                        the account of 20 different 
                        politicians. Do you see what’s 
                        happening? This is a hit. We should 
                        feed this to Full Sail. This 
                        bitch’s followers are planning 
                        something. Somebody needs to stop 
                        them. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe. Fine. But not you. I want 
                        you to go home. Clean up and come 
                        back to work when you are ready to 
                        calm down. 

           Steaming, George returns to his recruit, now shaken herself. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. Where were we?
                                 RECRUIT
                        Everything ok?

           All eyes on Brie, shaking with urgency. Tony watches her. 

           LATER

           Tony approaches. Despite George’s request, Brie has not gone 
           home. She’s at her computer. Videos streaming. The Manifesto 
           hit list. The last will and testament of America’s most 
           deadly mass shooters. COLUMBINE. ALTA VISTA. PULSE.

           She’s not even in her tool. She’s choosing this shit. Gazes 
           up over her monitor to find...

                        What are you watching?

           Brie jumps. Unaware he’s been watching. Closes her window. 

                                 BRIE
                        Nothing. Research. 

                                 TONY
                        I don’t know what’s gotten into 
                        you. I’m not even sure I should 
                        show you this but -- whatever. I 
                        felt like you should know.

                                 BRIE
                        What?

           He leans over. Types on her board. A User’s PAGE LOADS. 
           CASSIE’S. 

                                 TONY
                        You’d been watching her, right. I 
                        saw it this morning. I’m sorry. 

           Frightened, Brie reads the posts. Heart stops. She pales. 

           ON THE SCREEN. CASSIE’S PAGE: In memoriam. RIP posts. 
           Heartbroken...can’t believe you are gone...God is with you...

                                 BRIE
                             (shattered)
                        What happened?

                                 TONY
                        She hung herself. At school. Guess 
                        it just never stopped. 

           Brie’s just speechless. Gutted. Crying. Remembers something. 
                                 BRIE
                        Oh god. 

           Into her purse. Pulling out her phone. VOICEMAIL. Cassie.

                                 CASSIE (PRE-LAP)
                        Hey Brie.  Sorry to bug you with 
                        all these calls just -- I’m not 
                        doing so hot. 

           INT. PANTRY, SAFETY NET - DAY

           Ear to the phone, Brie listens to the missed call from Vegas. 
           Cassie’s voice from the grave. Brie barely holds it together

                                 CASSIE (VOICEMAIL)
                        I know I’m not great at realizing 
                        when I need help. At asking for it 
                        when I do but -- 
                             (breaking up)
                        I can’t take it anymore. It’s not 
                        just Brett. There’s more of them 
                        now and I just -- I don’t why they 
                        hate me so much. Why everyone wants 
                        me to die. I don’t think I can 
                        handle it anymore and --
                             (last moment of composure)
                        I just wanted to say - thanks. It 
                        was great to know you. I know you 
                        tried to help and -- I guess if you 
                        get this -- give me a call please. 
                        I’m really not sure what to do. I 
                        don’t really think I can be alone.

           That’s it. Brie stands there, with the phone, like it’s a 
           smoking gun and she’s pulled the trigger.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Brie throws up in the stall. Hugs the bowl. Waits for it to 
           come again. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           She exits the booth. Green and sweating. Nicola at the sink.

                                 NICOLA
                        You ok? That didn’t sound good. 
                             (joking)
                        Hope you’re not pregnant. 
           A beat. Brie tosses that thought aside. Bigger stakes at 
           hand. 

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Somebody’s gotta pay. Somebody’s 
                        gotta get got.

           INT. SAFETY NET - MOMENTS LATER

           Brie on her queue. Searching. For a target. Video after 
           video. No thought. Deleting everything she finds until --

           THIS POSTING: Side by side images of a smiling MALE COLUMBIA 
           STUDENT and a smiling FEMALE TEENAGER. The same person. A 
           MEME tacked on top. 

           “THAT TIME YOU THOUGHT YOUR ROOMMATE WAS A PUSSY UNTIL YOU 
           FOUND OUT HE HAD A PUSSY.”

           A torrent of COMMENTS beneath. Some calling this what it is - 
           a dangerous hate-crime. Others piling on with bigoted spite.

           Brie studies it for a moment. Not just this OUTING. But the 
           OUTER. The POSTER. A name. TROY DENIHAN. 

           NEW WINDOW: Troy Denihan’s Facebook page. Columbia Undergrad. 
           Lacrosse player. A1 Douche-bag. A bunch of PHOTOS of his BMW. 
           Derogatory comments about his transgender roommate. The Young 
           Man in the video: Look at this fag - what a homo - Buffalo 
           Bill my roommates- yada yada yada.

           On Brie as she reads it. Anger rising. Studying. She grabs 
           her purse. Out the door. Never even shutting down.  

           Tony watches her go. A beat. Approaches her computer. Seeing 
           the name. Columbia. Remembering. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           Brie - on the move - on busy streets - locked on her phone. 
           All about TROY. She bumps into a PEDESTRIAN. 

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        Asshole! Get off your phone!

           She doesn’t even slow. Soldiers on. To the subway as... 

           INT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Home alone. Lauren tidies up. Finds herself at the basement 
           door. Knowing she shouldn’t but...
           INT. LAUREN’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Door open, Lauren stands at the top of the stairs. Hesitant. 
           Scared. She turns on the lights. At the foot of an abyss. As 
           she descends...

           INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           Brie’s on the train. Agitated. People notice. Back away. Like 
           from a vagrant. Don’t mess with her. 

           INT. LAUREN’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Another light in the darkness. Lauren now in the middle of 
           the room, in the middle of Brie’s universe. Her obsessions. 
           Her mind. It’s chilling. 

           The wall’s now covered with HATEFUL MEMES. 4chan threads. Her 
           notebooks filled with HATE-SPEECH. Violent sketches. With 
           names and dates and bodies counts. 

           Lauren, growing frightened. Then she notices Brie’s computer. 
           Scared but can’t help herself. She turns it on and...

           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

           The campus is crawling. STUDENTS criss-crossing the quad. 
           Exiting classes. Hustling to the next. 

           At one building, among the crowds pouring out find TROY. In 
           the flesh. Yucking it up with his BROS as --

           Brie watches from across the street. Following as...

           EXT. COLUMBIA STREETS - DAY

           Troy parts ways with his friends. Heads down a side street. 
           Away from the crowds. Brie follows.

           As they turn a corner, Troy’s met by a tower of billowing 
           smoke. A CROWD GAWKING. Troy pushing through it to find...

                                 TROY
                        What the fuck! That’s my car. 

           His beloved BMW -- ROARING WITH FLAMES. Troy tries to 
           approach but THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT -- throwing him back. Damn 
           near crying when his phone buzzes. Unknown number. 

           A TEXT: NEXT TIME YOU’LL BE INSIDE
           Off Troy, scared to death. Searching the crowds. Sirens 
           howling. The flames leaping behind him and...

           Brie, already walking away in the other direction as...

           EXT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Quite harried, Lauren’s trying to wrangle Lucille out of the 
           house, as she sits in the doorway changing shoes. Teddy 
           waiting behind the wheel of the car.

                                 LAUREN
                        What did I just say? You are not 
                        changing your shoes again. You’re 
                        going to be late. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        But Brie said I could wear these to 
                        soccer. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Well I don’t know why she said 
                        that, but she’s not here and you 
                        are going to be late so put on the 
                        other goddamn shoes and LET’S GO!

           Lauren immediately regrets raising her voice. Lucille CRIES. 
           It’s at this moment Brie arrives. Still in her running 
           clothes. Looking like hell. 

           Lauren and Teddy share a look. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Lucille. Get in the car.

           Lucille gets in. They take off. On Brie and her sister. 

                                 LAUREN
                        We need to talk. 

           INT. LAUREN’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Dark until Lauren flips on the lights. Revealing Brie’s 
           obsession. They stand there in silence. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t know what this is, but it 
                        can’t be in my house. You need to 
                        leave. Now. 

                                 BRIE
                        I can explain. 
                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t want to know. I want you to 
                        get your shit. And get out. 

                                 BRIE
                        You went through my stuff?

                                 LAUREN
                        What did you expect? You are acting 
                        insane. Do you know who that is?

           She’s looking at a VIDEO on Brie’s computer. A WHITE TEENAGE 
           MALE with shaggy hair and John Lennon glasses, laughing at 
           the camera.

                                 BRIE
                        Do you?

                                 LAUREN
                        Yeah. The kid from Columbine. What 
                        the fuck is he doing in my house? 

                                 BRIE
                        I’m studying him. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Why?

                                 BRIE
                        To understand. So it doesn’t happen 
                        again. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Jesus. You’re fucking nuts. 

                                 BRIE
                        You don’t get it. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re right. I don’t. The Brie I 
                        know wouldn’t even look at this 
                        shit. You need help. And I will 
                        help you get it, but you can’t be 
                        around my daughter until you do. 

                                 BRIE
                        What? What does she have to do with 
                        it? Where do you want me to go?

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t know. Call one of your fuck 
                        buddies, but you can’t stay here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAUREN (CONT'D)
                        You know, I’ve always looked up to 
                        you. You’re my little sister, but 
                        you’ve always taken care of me. You 
                        used to be the most positive person 
                        I knew but now -- I don’t even know 
                        who you are. I’m not sure you do 
                        either. And until you find out, I 
                        need you to leave. 

           Brie. No arguments. Gathering her essentials. Her computer. 
           Her notebooks. Little else.  

                                 BRIE
                        You don’t know it, but all this - 
                        I’m just trying to protect you. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Start by protecting yourself. 

                                 BRIE
                        I’ll get the rest later. See ya 
                        around - sis. 

           EXT. BUSHWICK WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Brie. Drunk. With her one bag, pounding on the buzzer. 
           PEDESTRIANS starting to notice. 

                                 BRIE
                        Come on, man. I know you’re in 
                        there. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. 

           INT. BUSHWICK LOFT - NIGHT

           The BUZZER howling in what’s revealed to be TONY’S LOFT. 
           Tony, stoned. With a FRIEND. Watching SKATING VIDEOS. Pissed.

                                 FRIEND
                        Just let her in man. She’s not 
                        going away. 

           On Tony -- as the BUZZER RINGS - not a fucking chance. 

           EXT. BUSHWICK WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           On the street. Brie just holding down the ringer and -- 

                                 TONY
                        Yo! What the fuck? Are you crazy. 
                        Let go. 
           Tony’s arrived at the door. Not letting her in. 

                                 BRIE
                        Got you down here didn’t I? C’mon. 
                        Let me in. I brought treats. 

           Revealing a bottle of TEQUILA she’s pulling on. 

                                 TONY
                        Not tonight. It’s late. You’re 
                        waking up the neighbors. 

           Moving away. Closing the door. 

                                 BRIE
                        Wait? That’s it. You’re really not 
                        letting me in. 
                             (flirting)
                        What, don’t think you can handle 
                        it?

                                 TONY
                        Go home, Brie. You’re drunk. I’ll 
                        see you tomorrow. We’ll talk.

                                 BRIE
                        Fine. Faggot. 

                                 TONY
                        You know what - Brie. Fuck you. I 
                        know what you’ve being doing and 
                        you’re done. You’re sicker than the 
                        fucks you’re watching.  

           He goes. Locking the door behind him. Leaving her in the 
           cold. Pissed. She slams the BUZZER. Storms away. 

           INT. BUSHWICK BAR - NIGHT

           Packed with HIPSTERS. Brie drinks alone at the bar. Scrolling 
           her phone. Nowhere to go. No one to call. She comes to a 
           CONTACT. Stops as she considers it.

                                 BRIE MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Desperate times. Desperate 
                        measures.

           She takes a drink. Liquid courage. Calls. 

                                 BRIE
                        Hey -- yeah, it’s me -- nothing. 
                        Just seeing what you’re up to.
           Off Brie, downing another shot and...

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Brie opens her eyes. Confused. Pounding hangover. Gathers her 
           surroundings. 

           She’s naked. Alone in a bed. Minimalist decor. Analy clean. 
           Trying to remember how she got here when...

           The TRAINER from her gym exits the bathroom. Primped and 
           polished. 

                                 TRAINER
                        Morning sunshine. How you feeling?

                                 BRIE
                             (now she remembers)
                        Hey. What time is it?

                                 TRAINER
                        Almost 9. I gotta get in. Stay as 
                        long as you want. There’s a juice 
                        in the blender. I’m glad you 
                        called. That was fun.

           He kisses her. Goes. On Brie. Falling back. What the fuck. 

           INT. TRAINER’S SHOWER - MORNING

           Brie showers. The water coming down hard. Brie’s lost in it. 
           Suddenly. Not feeling well again and...

           MOMENTS LATER

           Brie, on her knees. Hugs the toilet bowl. Sick again and...

           INT. PHARMACY - MORNING

           With practiced, shameful stealth, Brie scans the aisle. Finds 
           her target. Looks at it with dread. A PREGNANCY TEST. 

           INT. THE COMPANY. ENTRANCE - DAY

           Another morning. Brie enters with the crowds. Suspicious. 
           Like eyes are on her. She passes through security, scanning 
           her badge. 

           The SECURITY GUARDS. It seems like they’re watching her and --
           INT. SAFETY NET ENTRY HALL - DAY

           As she did long ago, Brie descends the stairs. The SAFETY NET 
           door. Brie scans her KEYCARD but the door doesn’t open. The 
           light blinks RED. Locked. 

           She considers it when another MODERATOR arrives. Swipes his 
           card. Opens the door. She follows.

           INT. BATHROOM. SAFETY NET - MORNING

           Brie sits on the toilet. Face full of dread. Reveal she’s 
           pissing on an EPT stick. Waiting. Waiting. Finally --

           On her face. Fuck. 

           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie enters to find -- a huddled meeting. GEORGE. ALEXIS. 
           MIRZA. TONY. They quiet as Brie enters. Moves to her desk. 
           Trying to ignore only...

                                 GEORGE
                        Brie. Don’t sit. We need to talk.

           On Brie. With George. The eyes of the whole office upon them. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Brie in the hot seat. Across from George. Alexis. Mirza. HR. 
           Legal. George is talking. Livid. Showing Brie a screen. 

           One after another. Her @VICKYSOTO posts. Twitter. REDDIT. Her 
           VIGILANTE highlights. He’s reaming her out only---

           We don’t hear his words and neither does she because... 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        And that gets me here. You want to 
                        think it started with pain. With 
                        suffering. With loss. With a war. 
                        With the death of your parents. 
                        When everything went wrong only, 
                        that’s not the case. It didn’t 
                        start with anyone else. It started 
                        with you. It started with a 
                        thought. 
                                 GEORGE
                        Hello! Brie! Are you listening to 
                        me? Don’t try and deny it because 
                        we know it’s you. 

           The sound comes roaring back. Brie’s awake. Viewing her 
           handiwork. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell have you been doing 
                        here?

                                 BRIE
                        I’m just doing what you hired me to 
                        do.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh. You’ve taken it well beyond 
                        that. I know you Doxed this kid in 
                        Oklahoma. Applied geo-filters to 
                        your queue. I know you went to see 
                        this kid at Columbia yesterday. If 
                        I didn’t think it would tank this 
                        whole company, I’d call the police 
                        right now. Who the fuck is Victoria 
                        Soto anyway? Some Nazi icon?

                                 BRIE
                        Well. I don’t know why you’re 
                        asking me and I could be wrong but - 
                        I believe she was a teacher at 
                        Sandy Hook who was killed 
                        protecting her kids. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Jesus Christ. You’re crazier than I 
                        thought. Is that what you think? 
                        You’re some kind of martyr. Get 
                        your things. And get the fuck out 
                        of here. You are fired effective 
                        immediately. Guys --

           Brie looks to the door. SECURITY ready to escort her away. 

                                 BRIE
                        But what about Full Sail? What 
                        about what we talked about? The 
                        attack. You can’t do this. I signed 
                        a contract. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You need help Brie.  I hope you get 
                        it, but not on my time anymore. 
           INT. SAFETY NET - DAY

           Watched by Security, Brie packs her desk. The one bag. Purse. 
           Notebook. Pauses at the desk drawer. Marcy’s necklace from 
           long ago. She leaves it and...

           Brie, on her long walk from the mound, stops at Tony’s desk. 

                                 BRIE
                        You knew? You ratted on me? 

                                 TONY
                        I came by your room that night. In 
                        Vegas. To apologize. You probably 
                        don’t remember. You were with those 
                        two guys. The Menendez Brothers. 
                        What do you want? I liked you. I 
                        guess I’m not as tough as I 
                        thought. 

                                 BRIE
                        If there’s blood. It’s on your 
                        hands.

           She storms out. Off Tony, watching her go...

           EXT. THE COMPANY - DAY

           Standing on the street with her things. In the cold. All 
           alone. An outsider. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        It begins with a thought. And it’s 
                        not - I’m a victim. I’m a loser. 
                        I’m alone. That’s just what lights 
                        the fuse. 

           On Brie. Steeling herself. Finding resolve. Making a plan. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        The real change is when you 
                        realize, it’s not you who’s the 
                        loser - it’s them. It’s not you 
                        who’s a victim. It’s them. Because 
                        you’re special and you can’t wait 
                        to show the world just how special 
                        you are. That’s when the bomb goes 
                        off. 
           EXT. WILLIAMSBURG WAREHOUSE - DAY

           On the Brooklyn Waterfront. An industrial warehouse. One of 
           the last.

                                 MUSICIAN (PRE-LAP)
                        I crash at my girl’s pad mostly so 
                        this place is mainly for gear. 

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           A long-haired WILLIAMSBURG MUSICIAN escorts Brie into a small 
           apartment. One window. FUTON. MINI-FRIDGE. AMPS. GUITARS.

                                 ARTIST
                        The building’s not really cool with 
                        AIRBNB so if anyone asks, just tell 
                        ‘em you’re my sister. 
                             (off Brie’s reaction)
                        I know. But you need a place to 
                        crash, price is right. 

           Brie takes in this bunker like bedroom. We recognize it 
           immediately as the APARTMENT FROM THE TEASER.

                                 BRIE
                        How’s the wifi connection?

           INT. STUDIO (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - DAY

           Brie moves in. Like a Task Force setting up a detail. 

           She blacks-out the windows. Stacks the music gear to one 
           side. Moving everything away to make room for her agenda.

           Her own personal SAFETY NET here in this bunker. Dual 
           Computer screens. Industrial servers. All of her notes. All 
           of her obsessions. Wiring. Plugging in and finally --

           She boots up the screens. Illuminating her face. The webcam 
           turns on and there it is...

           The very same frame as our opener. Brie. In her bunker. An 
           eerie moment as we see we’re back where we started.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        And once the fuse is lit, what do 
                        you become? A walking time bomb and 
                        you better know where you want it 
                        to blow. 

           INSERT: BRIE’S COMPUTER MONITOR as she opens an application.
                               FULLSAIL 

           Log in page. Username. Password. 

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        Even people in my business, they’re 
                        just like you. A thousand sites. 
                        One password. Idiots. 

           Brie opens her notebook. The day of the bombing. Her flight 
           to Vegas. There it is. George’s USERNAME. George’s PASSWORD. 

           Brie types it in. The interface opens and we’re looking at a 
           DASHBOARD. Tabs across the top. 

                   USERS -- REPORTS -- TRACKING -- KEYWORDS 

           Drop down menus under each. Search criteria. Dates. Regions. 
           Countries. Interactions. Brie begins digging. 

           KEYWORDS: ANN PRICE - NOLK - SAFETY - FREEDOM - ATTACK - NYC

           The program begins its search. Like an Enigma Machine, 
           whirling to life. Plumbing the internet. Breaking the code.

           Brie watches, as one by one, it begins the massive 
           undertaking of making a list of targets. User after user 
           after user. 

           As Brie watches them compile...

                                 DOCTOR CHEN(PRE-LAP)
                        Brie? Hi. I’m Doctor Chen. I 
                        reviewed your ultrasound and you 
                        are correct.

           INT. PLANNED PARENTHOOD - DAY

           Brie, stone-faced on the examining table before a female OB. 
           DOCTOR CHEN (30’s.) 

                                 DOCTOR CHEN
                        It looks like you’re about 8 weeks. 
                        You’re not sure when your last 
                        period was?
                             (Brie shakes her head)
                        Ok. That’s fine. You indicated 
                        you’re looking to terminate. Have 
                        you ever taken mifepristone before? 
                        The abortion pill?

           Brie shakes her head. Steely. 
                                 DOCTOR CHEN (CONT’D)
                        Well I can give you the first dose 
                        here. Let me tell you what you need 
                        to expect. 

           As the Doctor continues...

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        You can get this stuff online, but 
                        I don’t recommended it. The same 
                        freaks who run those fake pregnancy 
                        crisis centers -- who scare and 
                        shame women out of having abortions 
                        -- they also sell fake pills 
                        online. You take ‘em, wake up  in a 
                        month and find out you’re still 
                        preggers. Better to show your face 
                        than get fucked. 

                                 DOCTOR CHEN (CONT’D)
                        ...and that’s really it. You take 
                        the last two pills at home. Any 
                        questions?

                                 BRIE
                        No. I’m ready. 

           INT. STUDIO (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - NIGHT

           ...the ALGORITHM still churning. Spitting out names. Brie 
           still locked in in her bunker. Sleepless. Wired. Following 
           the threads. 

           Names => Facebook Accounts => Twitters posts => Video rants.

           An unending stream of RURAL WHITE MALES. ANGRY. 
           DISENFRANCHISED. SNAPPING. 

           Brie watches their videos. FIRING GUNS. RANTING IN THEIR PICK-
           UPS. IN THEIR BEDROOMS. IN THEIR SCHOOLS.

                        losing our jobs and our way of life

           INT. QUEENS POST OFFICE - DAY

           And now Brie before a wall of P.O. Boxes. She opens her own 
           to find: a small cardboard box. Return address reads:

           INT. STUDIO (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - DAY

           Brie sits on her bed. Opens the package. A box inside. Brie 
           lifts the lid. Pulls out at note:

           Sorry I couldn’t get you the AR’s - Tim ;)

           She smiles as beneath the note she finds: A BERATTA M9. The 
           very same we saw at the beginning of the film.

           Brie admires it as...

                        Whether the mainstream believes it 
                        or not, you’re part of a bigger 
                        extended family, and that race has 
                        a story to tell. It’s a people and

                        they are leftists and cucks. It’s 
                        that in propagating the myth of 
                        ethnic unity, they undermine the 
                        truth that to be white is to be a 
                        striver. A crusader.

           PAN AROUND THE APARTMENT TO FIND:

           The web has grown. Carrie Matheson style. Photos. Travel 
           dates. JAMES KELLEHER at the center. A few new faces around 
           him. 3 in all. ANGRY YOUNG MEN. Their pictures printed out 
           and posted on the walls. 

           ON ONE OF HER COMPUTERS: a stream of videos plays on a 
           disturbing loop. Notorious Snuff films. Assassinations. The 
           Zapruder Film. Sadat in Egypt. Benazir Bhutto. One by one, 
           these LEADERS are blown away as we pan to...

           HER OTHER SCREEN, cluttered with open browsers. 4CHAN. 
           REDDIT. Like a CIA blacksite. Following James Kelleher’s 
           every movement. Every post. Every comment. His circle 
           narrowing down to one day. 

           In red ink, A DATE CIRCLED ON A PIN-UP CALENDAR. November 24. 
           Thanksgiving. In the box, in Brie’s manic hand, she’s written 
           NOLK = MTDP - again and again. As we to try decipher...
                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        She’d heard her son was involved 
                        and she said - while every other 
                        parent was praying their child was 
                        safe, I had to pray mine would die, 
                        so one else would be hurt. I’ll 
                        never forget that. 

           Finally land on Brie. Regarding herself in a full length 
           mirror. Docile and then --

           BAM - just like the video - she lifts a hostler from her 
           waistband, drawing the gun, aiming at herself. Fast. But not 
           fast enough. A long beat then --

           She return the gun to her pants. Draws again. And again. And 
           again. Until it’s flawless. Until it’s fast. Until she’s 
           lethal behind the sight. She mimes the trigger and...BANG! 

           INT. BATHROOM. STUDIO (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - DAY

           Wet from the shower, Brie stands before the mirror. Feral. 
           Wired. Off the grid. She looks down to the sink to see:

           Two little white pills in a little white cup. The package: 
           MISOPROSTOL discarded beside. Brie regards them.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        I’m not taking any chances.

           Brie picks up the pills. Tosses them back. Swallows.

           EXT. LUCILLE’S SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

           From a distance, we see Lucille racing around the playground 
           with her classmates. They are wearing handmade TURKEY and 
           PILGRIM and INDIAN HATS. Playing tag. A child is caught. The 
           others HOLLER in excitement. Lucille’s included and excited.

           Brie watches from across the street with deep affection. But 
           her presence here does not feel safe.

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Lucille is at the swings when she notices her aunt. 

                                 LUCILLE 
                        Brie! Look at the hat I made!

           She runs over in her Pilgrim hat to Brie, who’s come inside 
           the gates.
                                 LUCILLE (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been? My mom said 
                        you weren’t feeling good. 

                                 BRIE
                        She did? We’ll I’m ok. You can tell 
                        her I’m better now. I just -- I 
                        wanted to see you ‘cause - I wanted 
                        say goodbye for awhile. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Where are you going?

                                 BRIE
                        Well, I’ve got something I need to 
                        take care of and -- I don’t know 
                        when I’ll be back. I’m not sure 
                        when I’ll see you again and --

           Surprising even herself, Brie’s grows emotional.

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        And I just wanted you to know that -
                        - I love you very much and I am so 
                        proud of you. And in a few days, if 
                        you hear something bad about me on 
                        the news -- I want you to remember -
                        - things aren’t as simple as they 
                        seem. Always remember, you gotta 
                        stand up for yourself, ok. --

           Brie suddenly realizes that LUCILLE’S TEACHER has noticed 
           her. Summoned her nerve. And coming this way. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        I know. I’m leaving. Don’t worry. 
                        I’m just saying bye to Lucille. 

                                 TEACHER
                        You need to go. Now. I already 
                        called security. 

           The Teacher, big mistake, puts her hand on Brie, which Brie 
           rips off with considerable force. 

                                 BRIE
                        Don’t fucking put your hands on me 
                        again. I said I’m going. 

           The Teacher backs away. Frightened. The kids are watching. 
           Lucille’s a little frightened too. Brie kneels down. 
                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be scared. Remember. Nobody 
                        gets to push you around. I’m always 
                        gonna there to protect you. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Like a dragon. 

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. Like a dragon. See ya kid. I 
                        love ya. 

           She kisses her. Realizes SECURITY is coming. Goes. Off the 
           Teacher, relieved. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           We stay with Brie, hurrying away. Paranoid. Looking over her 
           shoulder. But no one’s coming. Not now at least. She takes 
           out a phone. A BURNER. Dials as she walks. 

                                 911 OPERATOR

                                 BRIE
                        I wanna report an attack. Tomorrow 
                        at the Macy’s Day Parade, 11am. 
                        There will be an attempt to 
                        assassinate the Mayor.

                        Are you listening to me? A 
                        concerned citizen. It doesn’t 
                        matter. I’m telling you someone is 
                        going to try and attack the Mayor 
                        tomorrow at the parade and you need 
                        to stop them. They are supporters 
                        of Ann Price and their names are...

                                 911 OPERATOR
                        Ma’am! Ma’am. Slow down. I want to 
                        help but first you need to tell me 
                        who you are? And how you know this 
                        information?

                                 BRIE
                        I know because I’ve been paying 
                        attention. What have you been 
                        doing?
                                 911 OPERATOR
                        Ma’am. I’m gonna need you to tell 
                        me your location right now? What’s 
                        your name?

                                 BRIE
                        Why do you keep asking that? It 
                        doesn’t matter who I am. It matters 
                        who they are. Are you going to take 
                        this seriously or not? Jesus!

           Irate, Brie hangs up her burner phone. Drops it in a trash 
           can. Storms off and...

           INT. LUCILLE’S SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Pick-up time. The school’s decorated for Thanksgiving. Lauren 
           is gathering Lucille when an ADMINISTRATOR approaches her. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Lucille can you go see if Julie 
                        needs any help? Lauren, we need to 
                        talk. 

           Off Lauren, wondering what’s up. 

           INT. LAUREN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Quite frazzled, Lauren is on the phone while straining to get 
           Lucille strapped into her car seat and having problems. 

                                 LAUREN
                             (re: the car seat)
                        Goddamn it! This thing is --
                             (now the phone. Voicemail)
                        Brie, it’s your sister. Call me 
                        please. I don’t know what you were 
                        doing at school today but I’m 
                        worried about you. Where are you? 
                        Will we see you for Thanksgiving? 
                        Call me back?

           She hangs up the phone. Fights with the buckles. Breaks down.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        This fucking thing!

                                 LUCILLE
                        It’s ok, mom. I got it. 

           Lucille, with ease, clicks it into place. Calming her mother.
                                 LAUREN
                        Did you see Aunt Brie today?
                             (nods)
                        What did she say? She was coming to 
                        Thanksgiving or not?

                                 LUCILLE
                             (shakes her head)
                        She said she had something she need 
                        to do. And I might see her on the 
                        news. And she just wanted to say 
                        goodbye.

           Off Lauren, taking that for what is it, a red alert and...

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - NIGHT

           Back in her bunker. Brie readies for tomorrow. Watching a 
           local NEWS REPORT on her COMPUTER. Night time in the UES. 
           THANKSGIVING EVE.

           Throngs of TOURISTS line COLUMBUS AVENUE to watch the giant 
           PARADE BALLOONS inflate beneath nets like captured game.

                        there to see it and with crowds 
                        even bigger tomorrow, and the NYPD 
                        isn’t taking any chances.

           And all around, NYPD patrol like an occupying force. PACKAGE 
           CUTS TO MAN ON STREET INTERVIEWS:

           A FATHER, YOUNG SON on his shoulders, speaks to the camera.

                                 FATHER
                        We’re feeling concerned about 
                        what’s happening globally but we’re 
                        feeling secure that the New York 
                        City Police Department has got our 
                        back tonight. I think it’s going to 
                        be a great event.

                                 REPORTER 
                        Even Mayor Cantor stopped by...

           PACKAGE CUTS TO THE MAYOR; drawing Brie’s ire as...
                                 MAYOR
                        And of course I’ll be there. It is 
                        a great time to celebrate the city 
                        and to show our solidarity and 
                        we’ve got the greatest Police Force 
                        in the world watching our backs. I 
                        think it’s going to be a fantastic 
                        day.

           Off Brie, watching with a different premonition. She shuts 
           off he screen as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A WEBCAM: An empty frame. Brie enters. Sits. Addressing the 
           camera in her bunker. Back where we began.

                                 BRIE 
                        Before I start - for the bleeding 
                        hearts out there - let me give you 
                        a TRIGGER WARNING. What you see 
                        next is gonna disturb you. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

           Thanksgiving Day. The BALLOONS unleashed. The FLOATS in line. 
           NEWS CREWS and TOURIST already beginning to gather along the 
           route in freezing cold. POLICE at every corner as...

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        By the time you see this video, a 
                        lot of people will be dead and the 
                        world’s going to ask why this had 
                        to happen? How did I get here? But 
                        that’s not the right question. The 
                        right question is -- why haven’t 
                        you?

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BRIE’S AIRBNB) - MORNING

           Game day. Brie dressed in the outfit we first met her in. 
           Winter running gear. Only now we see the full package.

                                 BRIE’S MANIFESTO (V.O.)
                        See, I used to believe the best in 
                        people. Sure, we have our bubbles 
                        but I thought basically we’re good. 
                        Basically we care. But I was naive. 
                        Like you. 

           She straps on her holster. Backpack. Ammo belt. Bowie Knife. 
           Gun. She’s ready to go as we CUT BACK TO:
           Brie, on the camera, as we met her long ago. Palming the gun. 
           The very end.

                                 BRIE
                        So I guess this is how it ends. But 
                        I want you to know, whatever 
                        happens today, it was you who led 
                        us here, not me. I’m just the 
                        filter. It’s you who made the 
                        filth. See ya around suckers. 

           Brie stops recording. A last beat as she considers herself on 
           screen before hitting the button => UPLOAD

           We stay on the screen until the progress bar reaches the end. 
           SUCCESS. It’s live. And then we realize, the door just closed 
           and Brie is gone.

           EXT. SAFETY NET - MORNING

           Thanksgiving quiet. No one manning the store except...

           INT. SAFETY NET - MORNING

           Tony, at his desk, clicking absentmindedly through his queue. 
           Alone in the office. One ear to the phone. 

                                 TONY (PHONE)
                        I’m not mom. I won’t be alone. I’m 
                        going to some friends’. I’m just 
                        doing a few hours of overtime and -- 
                             (his attention turning)
                        Ok. Ok. I love you too. No. I gotta 
                        run. I gotta --

           Tony hangs up the phone. Nearly drops it cause --

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Holy fuck. 

           The video that’s just come across his queue. We know it well. 
           Brie on her webcam. Her Manifesto.

                                 BRIE (ON VIDEO)
                        ...by the time you see this video, 
                        a lot of people will be dead and 
                        the world’s going to ask why this 
                        had to happen? 

           Off Tony’s chair hitting the floor. Because he’s already on 
           his feet. On the phone and...
                                 TONY
                        Come on. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. 
                             (and...)
                        Hello?

                                 BRIE (FILTERED)
                        Hello.

           Tony / we - can’t believe she picked up. 

                                 TONY
                        Brie? Jesus Christ. Where the fuck 
                        are you?

                                 BRIE
                        Exactly where I need to be. 

           INTERCUT NOW WITH BRIE:

           Revealed to be in CENTRAL PARK, moving with the CROWDS and 
           FAMILIES to the parade. 

                                 TONY
                        I saw your video. I took it down.  

                                 BRIE
                             (livid)
                        What?

                                 TONY
                        Whatever you are thinking about 
                        doing, listen to me Brie, don’t do 
                        it. There are people that care. I 
                        care. You are not the reason the 
                        world is fucked up. It’s not up to 
                        you to fix. Whatever you are 
                        thinking about doing, don’t. 

                                 BRIE
                        You took it down?

                                 TONY
                        I was worried. You’re lucky I did.

                                 BRIE
                             (burying anger)
                        Well it doesn’t matter anyway. It’s 
                        too late. Someone’s gotta stop it. 
                        If I don’t. Who will?

                                 TONY
                        Think about your family. Think 
                        about Lucille. 
                                 BRIE
                        Who do you think I’m doing this 
                        for?

                                 TONY
                        Brie! Brie -- 

                                 BRIE
                        I’m sorry Tony, I’ve got to go. I 
                        need this line free. Thanks for 
                        looking out. 

           She hangs up. Blends into the crowds. End on Tony, 
           distraught. He considers the phone. A long tortured beat 
           then...he dials 911. As it rings...

           EXT. GRACIE MANSION - DAY

           A yellow Colonial Mansion on the East River. Security abound 
           as...

           INT. GRACIE MANSION - DAY

           The MAYOR moves through the residence. Greeting STAFF busy 
           with Holiday Preparations as he’s briefed by his ASSISTANT. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        ...the schedule has us leaving here 
                        in 10. You’ll join the Today Show 
                        Crew first and then meet the float 
                        around 81st but again, I and the 
                        security team, strongly advise you 
                        to cancel this appearance. 

                                 MAYOR CANTOR
                             (always on the move)
                        If we canceled an appearance every 
                        time we had a threat, I’d never 
                        leave the house.  

                                 ASSISTANT
                        This is not some crank calling the 
                        Post. This is a credible threat. 
                        You can address the public from 
                        here. 

                                 MAYOR CANTOR
                        And how would that look?

           He’s pulling on his coat as they pass through the DINING ROOM 
           where a MULTI-CULTURAL STAFF dresses an elaborate table. 
                                 MAYOR CANTOR (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful everyone. I’m getting 
                        hungry all ready. 
                             (now to his aide)
                        We’re not canceling anything. If 
                        that bitch Ann Price wants to scare 
                        the rest of the country, go for it, 
                        but this is New York. We are a city 
                        of Immigrants and we will show the 
                        world that today. 

           And then he is out the door as...

           EXT. LAUREN’S HOUSE - DAY

           TEDDY’S PARENTS in town. The house full of Thanksgiving Day 
           activity. Everyone else watching FOOTBALL, while Lauren’s 
           cooking in the kitchen, preoccupied while the doorbell RINGS 
           and RINGS. 

                                 LAUREN
                             (to Teddy. Sarcastic)
                        Don’t worry. Don’t get up. Not like 
                        I’m busy. I’ll get it. 

           Finally she answers. Surprised to find a gaggle of POLICE.

                                 POLICE
                        Ma’am. We’re looking for Brie 
                        Salter? We were told she lives 
                        here. She around?

                                 LAUREN
                        Why? What happened?

                                 POLICE
                        I’m sorry but - that’s really a 
                        conversation we need to have with 
                        her. 

                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        Babe, who’s there?

                                 POLICE
                        Can you tell us where she is?

           Off Lauren and the Cops. Her worst fears come true as...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

           We find Brie - exiting the park with a wave approaching the 
           MACY’S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. 
           POLICE out in force. ONLOOKERS pack the sidewalks for miles. 
           All with their CELLPHONES out FILMING the worst of Americana.

           A cloying mix of patriotism and corporate propaganda flowing 
           down the avenue. School Children. Marching Bands. Broadway 
           themed Floats. Balloons shilling Cereal Box Characters and 
           Cartoon Movie Franchises (often at the same time.) 

           TV CAMERAS everywhere. MATT LAUER and the TODAY SHOW CREW 
           broadcasting from the booth. 

                                 MATT LAUER
                        ...and now look at this. Here’s 
                        comes a balloon you’ve all been 
                        waiting for -- it’s SCRAT! the 
                        hilarious star of Ice Age and Ice 
                        Age 2 and there’s his elusive acorn 
                        of dreams, which is coming back to 
                        theaters for another raucous 
                        adventure this Christmas…

           LAND BACK ON BRIE

           -- spinning among a crowd of thousands, wondering how in the 
           hell she is ever going to find her targets. Desperately, she 
           begins to search...

           Pushing through the crowds, weaving through the cameras. A 
           thousand faces but none are her KILLERS. The clock ticking 
           and desperation spreading when --

           On the North End of the Avenue, she spots THE CITY OF NEW 
           YORK FLOAT entering the PARADE ROUTE. 

           The float is designed as tribute to NYC. The SKYLINE. The 
           STATUE OF LIBERTY. THE EMPIRE STATE. And waving from among 
           these landmarks --

           THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK. Surrounded by a HALF DOZEN IMMIGRANT 
           FAMILIES. A diverse cross-section of the New Yorkers from all 
           over the world. 

           Brie sees it in the distance, coming her way. Her urgency 
           spikes. Jumps off the charts when she sees:

           NYPD OFFICERS patrolling the AVENUES. Searching for a target. 
           Something in their attitude and Brie’s paranoia - tells us 
           that target is her.

           She pushes frantically through the crowds, but stops when...

           She sees A MIDWESTERN TEENAGER GIRL with her phone, 
           broadcasting her own view on FACEBOOK-LIVE. Brie. A light-
           bulb bursting.
           She’s goes to her own phone. Pulling up the LIVE APP. 
           Searching for a user. JAMES KELLEHER. A beat then...

                                 BRIE
                        Holy shit. 

           Because she got him. James Kelleher and his crew of henchman, 
           LIVE STREAMING at this very moment as the move through the 
           very same parade. 

           Like the COLUMBINE SHOOTERS. Like Elliot Rodgers. They are 
           dressed in all black. TRENCH-COATS. FINGER-LESS GLOVES. A 
           teenage boy’s vision of death. 

           Kelleher carries a HEAVY BACKPACK as he moves like a shark 
           through the crowd. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you? Where are you?

           Brie’s frantically studying the video. Trying to pinpoint 
           their location as suddenly, they pass the ICONIC WROUGHT IRON 
           GATES of the DAKOTA BUILDING on 72nd and CENTRAL PARK. 

           Two blocks south of the Mayor’s float. Headed directly their 
           way. 

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Brie, looking up from her phone. The street sign. 69TH ST. 
           She’s about to take off she when turns and finds herself 
           staring face to face with AN NYPD COUNTERTERRORISM AGENT. 

           He locks on her face. A moment. Recognition. 

                                 NYPD AGENT
                        You! On the ground. Don’t fucking 
                        move.

           He’s drawing his gun. Three OTHER OFFICERS, copping the 
           showdown, begin to converge and --

           Brie - no other choice - she takes off RUNNING -- pushing 
           through CROWDS -- knocking PEOPLE down as --

           THE COPS on HER HEELS -- calling in for back-up. 

                                 NYPD AGENT (CONT’D)
                             (radio)
                        Let me get some fucking back-up 
                        over here. I’ve got eyes on the 
                        suspect. East Side CPW. 71st. 
                        Headed North. 
           Brie, never slowing. Tearing through the audience. Eyes 
           always up ahead toward --  

           THE MAYOR’S PARADE FLOAT. Careening to a showdown with --

           JAMES KELLEHER and his GOONS. In the flesh. Gathered 
           furtively together at the gates of the DAKOTA. Their actions 
           obscured as they break their huddle, hurrying for the avenue--

           Something conspicuously absent from James’ shoulder as --

           BRIE, breathless, arrives at the corner of 72nd and CPW - 
           scanning the crowds and finds-

           All parties barreling towards a fateful meeting. 

           THE MAYOR’S FLOAT approaches the intersection as - 

           Brie spots: KELLER and his GOONS taking up positions across 
           the street. And Brie notices -- 

                                 BRIE
                        Where’s his fucking backpack? Oh 
                        god.

           And that’s just when the NYPD AGENT grabs Brie by the arm. 

                                 NYPD AGENT
                        I said don’t fucking mo--

                                 BRIE
                        You gotta get everyone outta here. 
                        I think there’s a --

           BOOM! And just like that - AN EXPLOSION - away from the 
           crowds - erupts from the mouth of the Dakota, rocking the 
           audience and sending the entire proceeding into abject chaos.

           SMOKE BILLOWS from the mouth of the building like a Dragon. 

           PANICKED CROWDS flee in horror.

           THE MARCHING BANDS and BALLOON WRANGLERS abandon their posts 
           and run as the BALLOONS escape into the sky. 

           THE FLOATS GRIND TO A HALT as ATTENDEES pour off like the 
           titanic. All of this of course, CAUGHT ON LIVE TV and...

           The force of the explosion sends Brie to the ground, smashing 
           her head - but freeing her from the grip of the AGENT and --

           As she gets her bearings. CROWDS stampeding. EMERGENCY 
           RESPONDERS rushing to the bomb site while --
           Brie alone notices the THREE DARK-COATED FIGURES moving with 
           lethal intent in the opposite direction. Into the avenue and 
           the quickly evacuated PARADE ROUTE where --

           THE MAYOR, surrounded by SECURITY PERSONNEL, is being ushered 
           off the float, hurried to the entrance of an idling SAFETY 
           VAN but --

           Brie alone sees he will not make it. It’s a trap. The entire 
           thing a diversion. He’s being moved right into the path of 
           THE KILLERS. As they move on the MAYOR, their guns peeking 
           from their trench-coats --

           Brie’s back on her feet -- as practiced -- drawing her 
           Beratta -- running into the fray as --

                                 BRIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Put it down!

           GOON #1 spins in the street -- coat swinging open to reveal -- 
           an AR-15 rising from his hip -- squeezing on the trigger as --

           PTPTPTPTPTPPTPTP! -- rounds spray wildly into the street and 
           into the air where PSSHW! they puncture the BALLOONS high 
           above the trees, bringing them wheezing down but --

           Brie keeps coming -- Beratta leveled through the barrage and -

           BAM! BAM! -- she drops the FIRST GOON with two messy shots -- 
           his chest and neck exploding in a red mist and -- 

           BOOM! A shotgun blasts from GOON #2 waist - shattering the 
           windows of the LOBBY DOORS behind her as --

           Brie comes up firing -- BAM! 1st shot blows off fingers -- 
           blood geysering and BAM! -- 2nd shot right through the eyes -- 
           blowout. He drops to the ground to reveal --

           JAMES KELLEHER - the leader and last man standing - opening 
           on her with an AK. RAT-A-TAT-TAT! and -

           Brie goes down. Drops her gun. Hit. A gut shot. Just managing 
           to crawl away and take cover behind the NYC float as Kelleher 
           moves off --

           Spraying the MAYOR’S ARMORED VEHICLE with shells, sending his 
           Security Team - who’ve been trying to escape inside - 
           scrambling for cover and leaving the MAYOR alone and exposed 
           in the eye of the gunman.

           Calmly, Kelleher approaches. Levels on the Mayor. 

                                 KELLEHER
                        America First Motherfucker. 
           And just before he pulls the trigger -- SHTICKT! -- the blood 
           suddenly drains from James’ face as we reveal --

           Brie, risen from the dead, standing beside him, burying her 
           BOWIE KNIFE deep into James’ back. 

           She unsheathes it from his heart. James’ showers blood. 
           Clatters his AK to the pavement. Drops to his knees. Dead.

           A moment, as Brie holds the bloody knife, eye to eye with the 
           petrified Mayor as the POLICE CONVERGE around her and she 
           drops the knife. Falls to the ground and we -- 

           Pull away.

           Away from Brie - bleeding in the heart of the scattered city. 
           Away from the HOWL of the SIRENS and the parade balloons 
           collapsing around her. Away from the NYPD and the Mayor and 
           the News Camera swarming the scene. And off the vacated chaos 
           of the parade we...

           THE VOICES SUDDENLY MUTE and we find we’re looking at...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A TELEVISION mounted above the bed in a Hospital Room where 
           Brie’s recovering from her injuries. One Nurse checks her 
           bandages while ANOTHER delivers an ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS. 

           In fact, the whole room is covered in impressive BOUQUETS and 
           CARE-PACKAGES and GET WELL CARDS to Brie from across the 
           country. 
           Lauren, aiding her sister’s recovery, reads to her from her 
           admirers while Lucille runs about plundering CHOCOLATE from 
           the gift sets. 

                                 LAUREN
                        ...and here’s another proposal of 
                        marriage -- 
                             (dropping a picture)
                        No thanks. This one’s a mother of 
                        four in Georgia who say’s she’ll be 
                        naming her next daughter after you 
                        and one from the NRA, tasteful, 
                        inviting you to speak at their next 
                        retreat. 
                             (throwing that one away)
                        Oh...and one from Tony, at your 
                        office. I don’t know what this 
                        means but he says - Brie: you’re a 
                        hell of a janitor. 
                             (Brie laughs, wincing 
                              through pain)
                        He also says George is asking when 
                        you’ll be returning to work...

           Brie gives her a knowing look as a KNOCK on the door is 
           followed by a SECURITY GUARD, entering to the room.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Ma’am. I’m sorry but the Mayor is 
                        here. He’d like to pay his 
                        respects. Is now a good time?

           Through the crack in the door, Brie can see a crowd of 
           STAFFERS. PRESS-CORE. SECURITY. Her sister smiles at her in 
           some disbelief. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I think that’s our cue to leave. 
                        Lucille. C’mon. 

                                 BRIE
                        Stay. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m not ready for my close-up.
                        We’ve got homework. Don’t worry. 
                        We’ll be back. We’ll see you in the 
                        morning. 

           She kisses her sister. Then at the door Lucille stops. Turns.
                                 LUCILLE
                        Hey Brie - 
                             (like a dragon)
                        Roar!

           Brie smiles. They go, exiting into the swarms outside leaving 
           finally --

           Brie. Alone. In her bed. Surrounded by accolades. 

           Hold on her here. Her smile fading as her eyes drift to the 
           muted Television where:

           CNN teases a pulpy segment. VIGILANTE’S REVENGE. Brie’s 
           RAMPAGE. Playing on a bloody loop - feeding the beast. Brie 
           with a gun. Brie with a knife. Bodies all around.

           Brie watches it. Surreal. Incredulous. Raising the remote 
           like a gun as graphics appears:

              WARNING. THIS NEXT SEGMENT CONTAINS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE

           And CLICK. She turns it off. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                   THE END
