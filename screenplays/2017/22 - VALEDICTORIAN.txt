           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           A beautiful blond, ALICE (18) places a few books inside her 
           locker. The summer dress she’s wearing and her even tan make 
           her look drop dead gorgeous. All the guys make eyes at her as 
           they walk by. She closes her locker to see... 

           LARRY FIKUS (18) behind the locker door. He holds a rose and 
           a small box of chocolates. His trim and clean cut appearance 
           can’t hide the severe anger in his eyes. He is driven by 
           being number one at everything and has a remarkable talent 
           for not caring about anyone but his self interest. 

           Alice is spooked by Larry. 

                                 ALICE 
                        Larry! 

                                 LARRY
                        Hello Alice. 

           Larry holds a creepy grin for a little too long.  

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I would like to give you this rose. 
                        Freshly cut. I had to put it in a 
                        cooler to keep it firm.  
                             (hands her the rose)
                        And a box of chocolates. 
                             (hands her the box)
                        I made sure... there was no peanut 
                        butter. 

                                 ALICE
                        Oh... that’s... very nice of you. 

                                 LARRY
                        Alice, will you go to the prom with 
                        me? 

           Alice is frozen. She doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 ALICE
                        Um... well... 

                                 LARRY
                        There’s no one who I’d rather go 
                        with. I think we would have the 
                        best time together. 

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t know, Larry. I-- 
                                 LARRY
                        I have it planned out already. You 
                        deserve the best and I’m willing to 
                        pay for it. I’d pick you up in 
                        limousine of course. I know of a 
                        driver who won’t care if we drink 
                        in the back seat. I’d provide the 
                        champagne, a Dom Perignon 2006 is 
                        my preference but let me know if 
                        you have something else in mind. 
                        Now I don’t know what dress you’re 
                        thinking of but I have a few ideas, 
                        I’m flirting with the idea of off 
                        white, maybe even gold. Gold would 
                        be good. Definitely something with 
                        an open back because, well, that’s 
                        just a given. Leave it to me for 
                        the best corsage, I know a guy... 
                        he’ll do a fantastic job. But 
                        enough about the material things, 
                        as a date, I think you’ve hit the 
                        jackpot because well not only do I 
                        know how to treat a lady well, 
                        believe me I do, I know how to 
                        dance. Over winter break last year 
                        I took a Latin dance class and got 
                        hooked. I’ve been taking swing, 
                        ballroom, flamenco, you name it 
                        I’ve learned it. That’s something 
                        no guy can do in this school can 
                        offer. 

                                 ALICE
                        Larry I--

                                 LARRY
                        I’m not finished. I shouldn’t even 
                        be saying this but I’m leading the 
                        prom committee on the student 
                        counsel, the prom committee chooses 
                        the prom king and queen. I could 
                        move some things around, do some 
                        negotiating and make sure you’d be 
                        Prom Queen. I mean you’d probably 
                        be it anyway with no help of mine 
                        but I can guarantee it. That I can 
                        offer. And then of course there’s 
                        always the question of post prom 
                        activities. We could go to a house 
                        party, get drunk, and sleep in a 
                        tent but I was thinking of 
                        something a little more intimate. 
                             (moving in closer)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        I found this beautiful house in The 
                        Hamptons... I could rent it out for 
                        a night. There’s a pool in the back 
                        that overlooks the sound. We could 
                        go for swim and watch the boats 
                        come in and out of the harbour. 
                        We’d have a fun time. I’d treat you 
                        right, Alice. It would be one night 
                        to remember.

                                 ALICE
                        That sounds like a wonderful time. 

                                 LARRY
                             (proud)
                        I know. 

                                 ALICE
                        But... I have to pass. I was asked 
                        out already. 

           Larry is shell shocked. He takes a moment to gather himself. 

                                 LARRY
                        Who? 

                                 ALICE
                        I’m going with Chad. He asked me 
                        last night. 

                                 LARRY
                        Chad... Chad Wheeler? 

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. 

                                 LARRY
                        Did you hear what I’m offering? 

                                 ALICE
                        Larry...  

                                 LARRY
                        Why don’t you leave him for me? 

                                 ALICE
                        I like Chad. I’ve had a crush on 
                        him for a while.
                             (beat)
                        You’ll find someone. 

           Larry grills her. 
                                 LARRY
                        Chad may be cool to you now but who 
                        really is going to make a name for 
                        himself? I’ll give him few years 
                        out of college before his ambition 
                        withers away until the only thing 
                        that’s left is a poor man with a 
                        beer belly pumping gas down the 
                        road. Is this who you want to go to 
                        prom with or do you want to go to 
                        prom with the future president of 
                        the United States?   

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sorry, Larry. 

           Alice hands him the rose and the box of chocolates. 

                                 LARRY
                        Wait... 

           Alice shakes her head and walks away. Larry stands dejected, 
           he looks around if anyone is watching him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Larry walks down the hall. He gets shoved aside by a JOCK who 
           is way more muscular.   

                                 JOCK 
                        Hey watch it Larr-- 

           He continues to walk. Larry makes eye contact with an 
           attractive girl. She looks away rolling her eyes to her 
           friends. They giggle. Larry can’t hear what they’re talking 
           about but he knows it’s disparaging against him. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A large packet entitled “U.S. GOVERNMENT FINAL” slams on top 
           of a desk. MRS. ANTRETTER (60’s) goes down the rows of the 
           desks handing back the finals. The students are socializing 
           amongst themselves and signing each others yearbooks. 

           In the back corner of the class, not talking with anyone, 
           sits Larry eating from the box of chocolates. Mrs. Antretter 
           hands Larry his final. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        Larry... You should be proud. 

           He licks the chocolate off his fingers and flips to the back 
           page of the test... 95%. A shiver runs through Larry. 
           He scans through the test to look where he got points off. 
           The bell rings and all students get up to leave... Larry 
           remains seething at his desk. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Larry approaches Mrs. Antretter at her desk typing at a 
           computer. His demeanor is polite. 

                                 LARRY
                        Mrs. Antretter, I have a question 
                        about my final. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        I had a feeling you would. 

           Mrs. Antretter swivels her chair toward Larry. 

                                 LARRY 
                        I wanted to get clarification on 
                        why five points were taken off this 
                        essay question. 

           Larry hands her the test. Mrs. Antretter puts her glasses on 
           and examines. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        I can’t read this. 

                                 LARRY 
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        This answer is illegible. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Where exactly couldn’t you read it? 
                        Is it--

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                             (Cutting him off)
                        The whole thing. It’s poor 
                        penmanship. 

                                 LARRY 
                        That didn’t seem to be a problem on 
                        my other essay questions. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        And your other answers were fine. 
                        This one got a little sloppy. 
                                 LARRY
                        Maybe if I read my answer aloud to 
                        you then you could hear that my 
                        answer deserves full credit. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER
                        Wouldn’t that be unfair to the 
                        other students? 

           Larry takes a moment to recalculate. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Is there an extra credit assignment 
                        I could do to help my score? 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER
                        Larry, no. How many times have you 
                        come to my desk grade grubbing this 
                        year? 
                             (beat)
                        You should take this as a learning 
                        experience. You may not think it 
                        now but later when those Harvard 
                        professors read something like this 
                        they won’t be as kind as I am. They 
                        wouldn’t think twice before failing 
                        you. You did well. Don’t make me 
                        think twice about that. 

           A tense beat. Larry nods his head and heads for the door. He 
           shuts it. He squares his jaw and hardens his eyes. 

                                 LARRY
                        Mrs. Antretter, how is Mr. 
                        Antretter? 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER
                             (Stern)
                        Excuse me? 

                                 LARRY
                        He’s getting up there in age. 
                             (beat)
                        Tell me are you two still having 
                        sex?    

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER
                             (Standing up)
                        Excuse me?

           Larry smirks.    

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER (CONT’D)
                        Principal Greene’s office. Now! 
                                 LARRY
                        Can we bring Mr. Biladoo?

           Mrs. Antretter freezes. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Biladoo? You know him right? 
                        You know him well don’t you? The 
                        young handsome chemistry teacher? 

           Larry reaches into his jacket pocket to grab...

           A PHOTO. He offers it, Mrs. Antretter snatches it, and 
           immediately she throws it on her desk horrified. 

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER 
                        How did you get that? 

                                 LARRY 
                        I took it myself. I was here late 
                        Tuesday night, down the hall in the 
                        library studying for your final. I 
                        heard some strange sounds, when I 
                        checked I saw you two on this desk. 
                             (beat)
                        I had no idea you were so flexible. 

           Mrs. Antretter slumps to her chair looking at the photo. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I have more pictures you know. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD: VALEDICTORIAN 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Larry leaves the classroom clutching his final with the 95% 
           crossed off and replaced with a 100%. He folds it and puts it 
           in his jacket pocket. 

                                 VOICE 
                        Larry! 

           Larry swings around to see OMAR SADAAR (18), a Pakistani 
           immigrant who wears his heart on his sleeve. What he lacks in 
           social skills he makes up for in academic intellect. 

                                 LARRY 
                             (blank)
                        Hello, Omar. 
           Larry stares... where is this going? 

                                 OMAR
                        Were you just talking with Mrs. 
                        Antretter? 

                                 LARRY
                        I was. 

                                 OMAR
                        Do you mind me asking what was it 
                        about? 

                                 LARRY 
                             (puzzled)
                        I have to get going, there’s a 
                        student gov meeting. Have a good 
                        day.  

           Larry walks away, Omar follows. 

                                 OMAR
                        How did you do on the final? 

           Larry acts like he can’t hear him. Omar gets more desperate.  

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Larry... Larry? Were you talking 
                        about the final with Mrs. 
                        Antretter? 

                                 LARRY
                        Why are you asking?  

                                 OMAR
                        I need the Jacob Newman 
                        Scholarship. 

                                 LARRY
                             (knowing)
                        I see. 

                                 OMAR
                        That money will really help me out. 
                        Most of, all of my college funds 
                        are helping my mom pay for 
                        treatment. I have nothing to pay 
                        for Cornell.  

                                 LARRY 
                        I’m really sorry but there’s only 
                        one week left. If you wanted to be 
                        Valedictorian then you could’ve 
                        done better in the years before.
           They come to the doors of the school auditorium. Larry walks 
           in. 

                                 OMAR
                        You’re not the Valedictorian. 

           Larry stops for a moment, smirks, and continues walking.  

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Bridget Greene is. 

           This freezes Larry, he turns. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Bridget Greene is Valedictorian, 
                        currently. I’m salutatorian, 
                        currently. You’re third. 

                                 LARRY
                        Bridget Greene? 

           Omar nods. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        That’s impossible. 

                                 OMAR
                        It’s true, Larry.

                                 LARRY
                        How do you know this? 

                                 OMAR
                             (anxious)
                        I-I just do.  

           Larry walks back into the auditorium. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Wait. 

           Omar grabs Larry by the arm. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m only telling you because I know 
                        you, Larry. I’ve know you since the 
                        second grade. I know that when you 
                        want something you’re... dangerous. 
                        I need that scholarship and I have 
                        a good shot at beating Bridget but 
                        you-you can’t take that away from 
                        me.  
           The second bell rings. Larry jerks away and goes into the 
           auditorium. 

                                 LARRY
                        Goodbye Omar. Hakuna matata.  

           The doors close on Omar. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 

           The room filled with thirty students. Larry walks to the 
           front row aisle. JAMES, an Asian bro sits manspreading hard. 

                                 LARRY
                        Yo Iwo Jima, would you mind if I 
                        sat here? 

                                 JAMES 
                        I’m Chinese, Larry. Sit over there.  

           Larry leans in. 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m only asking because I heard 
                        Beth talking about you at the lunch 
                        table earlier. I think she’s into 
                        you. She’s sitting back there. 

                                 JAMES
                        Really? 

           Larry nods. James gets up. Larry wins the seat and turns 
           around to see Frank sitting next to BETH (18). 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (smiling)
                        Hey. 

                                 BETH 
                             (dismissive)
                        Hey. 

           PRINCIPAL GREENE (50’s) tall, confident, and commanding of 
           attention. She runs this school. She bobs the microphone at a 
           podium. Larry turns his attention up front.  

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE 
                        Attention. Attention! Thank you for 
                        coming to our last student 
                        government meeting of the year.

                        It has been my pleasure working 
                        with your class as your principal 
                        over the past four years. You’re 
                        class really is one of a kind.

                             (whispering to the student 
                              next to him)
                        Give me a break.

                        But now I have the pleasure of 
                        introducing the senior class 
                        president and my daughter... 
                        Bridget Greene. 

           BRIDGET GREENE, a tiny girl with a perfect pony tail takes 
           the stand. Everything about her is perfect... her posture... 
           her smile... she’s lint free and her clothes are crisp and 
           pressed. We’ve all had a Bridget Greene in our life.  

                                 BRIDGET
                        Thanks mom. 

                                 LARRY
                        Kill me now. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Good morning my fellow classmates. 
                        This marks our last student counsel 
                        meeting of our high school career. 
                        It has been a pleasure working with 
                        you as class president. We have 
                        accomplished so much together over 
                        the past year. We’ve raised over a 
                        thousand dollars through car washes 
                        alone. We’ve organized countless 
                        bake sales, Pizza Friday’s, and 
                        pancake breakfasts. All the money 
                        we raised will be contributed 
                        toward the cost of prom, which will 
                        be the lowest ticket charge of any 
                        class in the history of 
                        Harborfields High School. 

           Students clap.

                        We started “Cookies for Courage,” 
                        providing dozens of plates of 
                        cookies to local policemen, 
                        firemen, and highway patrol 
                        officers.

                        Our “Socktober Drive” gave hundreds 
                        of socks to homeless families to 
                        keep their feet warm during the 
                        winter. We created a Harborfields 
                        High School official twitter page, 
                        updated this school for the twenty 
                        first century. But today we must 
                        make one final decision. Now I know 
                        this issue has divided us over the 
                        past couple of weeks but we must 
                        come to a conclusion... Who will be 
                        the graduation speaker? We must 
                        take this to a vote. Please 
                        carefully consider the candidates 
                        and pick the teacher who best 
                        reflects our grade as a whole. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A PIECE OF PAPER...

           CIRCLE ONE:

           “Mr. Maravel 

           Or

           Mr. Incorvaia”

           The students overwhelmingly circle Mr. Maravel. 

                                 MS. GAVIN 
                        Hands the ballots up to the front 
                        of the room. 

           All the papers comes to Larry. He looks to Principal Greene 
           who is chatting with Bridget. Larry then...

           CRUMPLES the ballots discreetly. He places them in his jacket 
           pocket then pulls out a wad of ballots from the other pocket 
           of his jacket. Incorvaia’s circled in all of those ballots 
           too.  

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Is everyone finished? Yes? Can I 
                        take the ballots? 

           Larry hands them over. 
           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY 

           MR. INCORVAIA (30’s) sits at a desk grading papers. There are 
           various Shakespeare posters all around the classroom. 
           Incorvaia looks up. Larry enters. 

                                 INCORVAIA
                        Mr. Larry Fikus... how was the 
                        student government meeting? 

                                 LARRY 
                        You’re in. 

                                 INCORVAIA 
                        Are you sure? 

           Larry nods.

                        Maravel was heavily favored. 

                                 LARRY
                        I took care of it. 

           Larry hands Incorvaia a packet. Incorvaia opens and skims 
           through the pages. Incorvaia writes 100 on the back with red 
           marker.  

                                 INCORVAIA
                        An excellent paper. 

           Larry motions to leave but then turns back. 

                                 LARRY
                        Did anyone else get a 100? 

                                 INCORVAIA
                        Just you, Larry... and one other 
                        person? 

                                 LARRY
                        Who was that? 

                                 INCORVAIA
                        Bridget Greene. 

           INT. MATH CLASS - AFTERNOON  

           Mr. Baltrusitis goes down the rows to give the math quizzes 
           back. 

                                 MR. BALTRUSITIS 
                        Larry... 
           Larry is handed his quiz... 82. The student behind him gets 
           his test... 95.

                                 MR. BALTUSITIS
                        You should be happy with that. It 
                        was the highest grade in the class. 

                                 STUDENT 
                        This was your highest grade?

                                 MR. BALTRUSITIS
                        In this class yes. In the class 
                        behind Omar Sadaar and Bridget 
                        Greene both received perfect 
                        scores. 

           Mr. Baltrusitis heads to the front of the class. Larry 
           crumbles up his quiz. 

                                 MR. BALTRUSITIS (CONT’D)
                        Okay class, put everything away 
                        except for a pencil and your 
                        calculator. 

           INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY

           An adorable WHITE MOUSE is pinched from behind by a human 
           hand. The mouse dangles in front of the class. MR. ELLICK 
           (50’s) holds the mouse.  

                                 MR. ELLICK
                        If anyone who wishes to leave the 
                        room, please exit now. 

           One chubby boy waddles away, hyperventilating. 

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        No one else? 

           Mr. Ellick drops the mouse into an empty aquarium. Empty 
           except for...  

           A BLACK MAMBA. The snake rises as the mouse scampers in the 
           tank. Larry watches. Bridget Greene sits in front. Students 
           lean in. Students in the back stand on their chairs.  

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        You see the Mamba’s tongue is 
                        flicking out into the air. 
                        Receptors on the tongue pick up 
                        minuscule chemical particles, which 
                        are perceived as scent. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Essentially, the Mamba is tasting 
                        the mouse now. 

           The mouse tries to climb out of the tank, there’s nothing to 
           hold on to. 

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        When the tongue is retracted into 
                        its sheath, the tips of the tongue 
                        fit neatly into the... Brian?

                                 BRIAN
                             (looking away)
                        The brain.  

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                        No, it’s an organ specific to the 
                        snake. This will be on your final. 
                        Anyone? Omar?

                                 OMAR 
                        The Jacobson’s organ. 

                                 MR. ELLICK
                        That’s correct.  

           The mouse gets close. The snake...

           BITES. 

           The class jumps back. Larry doesn’t move. 

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Like cobras and coral snakes, the 
                        venom of a black mamba contains 
                        neurotoxins, specifically 
                        dendrotoxin. The venom shuts down 
                        the nervous system and paralyzes 
                        victim.

           The Mamba watches the mouse twitch. So does Larry.

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Can anyone tell me what this mouse 
                        is going through? 

                                 STUDENT  
                        He’s dying. 

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                        Yes. But how? 
                                 OMAR
                        A bite from a black mamba causes 
                        initial neurological and 
                        neuromuscular symptoms which may 
                        commonly include headache and a 
                        metallic taste in the mouth, which 
                        may be accompanied by a triad of 
                        paresthesias, profuse perspiration 
                        and salivation. Symptoms typically 
                        progress to more severe reactions 
                        such as tachycardia and neurogenic 
                        shock, leading to death by 
                        asphyxiation, cardiovascular 
                        collapse, or respiratory failure.

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                        Yes that would be true if this guy 
                        still had his venom glands. They’ve 
                        recently been removed. That’s why I 
                        was able to bring him in today. 
                        However, it’s been known that these 
                        snakes can regenerate their venom 
                        glands. Rare but possible.
                             (beat)
                        The mouse has been paralyzed from 
                        the shock of the bite. He will be 
                        swallowed alive.

           The mouse’s feet stick out of the snakes mouth. Larry 
           scribbles down notes. 

           INT. SPANISH CLASS - DAY 

           “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” plays on an outdated TV 
           screen. The three way stand off scene plays with the trumpets 
           blaring. 

           The students talk amongst themselves instead of watching. 
           Larry checks the clock. He gathers his things and walks to 
           the front of the classroom. He comes to SENORA LOPEZ (30’s) 
           who is very pregnant. She files her nails with her feet up on 
           the desk. 

                                 LARRY
                             (terrible accent)
                        Hola Senora Lopez, may I go to the 
                        nurses’s office? I’m not really 
                        feeling well at all. 

                                 SENORA LOPEZ
                        Oh Larry... are you okay? 
                                 LARRY
                        My tummy hurts. 

                                 SENORA LOPEZ
                        You poor thing. Go to the nurse. 

                                 LARRY
                        Gracias. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Larry leaves the classroom and walks at a brisk pace. Ennio 
           Morricone’s music still plays. 

           INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE RECEPTION AREA - MORNING

           Larry enters an office and walks over to a SECRETARY (50’s) 
           who hates her job and life. 

                                 SECRETARY 
                        Can I help you Larry? 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m looking to speak with Mrs. 
                        Kimotech. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        She’s in a meeting with another 
                        student. You can come back next 
                        week. 

                                 LARRY
                        This is rather urgent. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        You don’t have an appointment... 
                        Come back next week. 

           Larry walks over to Mrs. Kimotech’s office.

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me. You can’t go in there. 

           The door swings open...

           Bridget Greene walks out of the office of MS. KIMOTECH 
           (30’s). They giggle together.  

                                 MRS. KIMOTECH
                        And Congratulations on your hard 
                        work. I’m sure you will do just 
                        fine at Stanford. 
                                 BRIDGET 
                        Thank you! Say hello to little 
                        Bobby for me will you. 

                                 MRS. KIMOTECH
                        Of course.

           Bridget’s warm disposition drops when she sees Larry. She 
           walks over to him. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        Bridget.  

                                 BRIDGET
                        I heard about Alice denying your 
                        prom invitation this morning. 
                        That’s got to be really hard. Is 
                        that why you’re in the guidance 
                        office... to talk about your 
                        feelings?  

                                 LARRY
                        Maybe you could help me, when you 
                        found out people were taking 
                        Snapchats of you after you walked 
                        out of the girls bathroom with your 
                        skirt tucked into your thong, how 
                        did you cope? Did the counselors 
                        here help you or did you cry to 
                        mommy in her office?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Everyone who shared that was 
                        suspended. 

                                 LARRY
                        Well then that answers my question. 
                        It’s good to have a fire breathing 
                        mommy you can whip out to do what 
                        you want.   

                                 BRIDGET
                        Are you still angry about losing 
                        class president to me? It’s been a 
                        year, Larry, you need to get over 
                        it. But seriously, why are you 
                        here? 

                                 LARRY
                        I have a meeting. 
                                 BRIDGET 
                        You don’t think I’ll find out? 

           Ms. Kimotech buts into their conversation. 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH 
                        Larry... you’re looking to see me?  

                                 LARRY
                        Yes! Good to see you, Bridget. 
                        Let’s do lunch sometime before 
                        school ends, huh? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’ll see you later, Larry.  

           INT. MRS. KIMOTECH’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Mrs. Kimotech sits behind a desk. Larry slumps in a chair. 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        We haven’t talked in a while. Is 
                        everything okay with you? 

                                 LARRY
                        Never been better! 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        Good... that’s good. Are you still 
                        by yourself at home?  

                                 LARRY
                        I am... but that’s not what I want 
                        to talk about. I’m here to check in 
                        about the top ten of the class.  

           Mrs. Kimotech’s expression drops. 

                                 MRS. KIMOTECH
                        What about it?

                                 LARRY
                        I know that information is very 
                        private but I just want to know 
                        where I am on the list. 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        You know I can’t give that out. I’m 
                        sorry. They’ll announce it the last 
                        day of school. 
                                 LARRY
                        I’ve been working on this since the 
                        day I stepped in this school. I 
                        just want to know that I’m in the 
                        top ten. 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        Larry... 

                                 LARRY
                        My mother would be so proud of me 
                        if I was. 

           Mrs. Kimotech sighs and takes a moment. 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        You don’t have to worry. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        You know what I mean. 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m the...  

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                             (warm smile)
                        Yes.  

                                 LARRY
                        I’m the Valedictorian. 

           Mrs. Kimotech shakes her head. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        What?

           The smile turns to a frown.

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        That’s not what you asked.

                                 LARRY
                        So... I’m not the Valedictorian?

           Pause. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Am I the Salutatorian? 

           Long pause.
                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m third?  

           Mrs. Kimotech nods. Larry is shell shocked.  

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m third... 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        Some students would kill to be 
                        that... it’s an amazing 
                        accomplishment. 

           Larry coils and puts his hand over his head.  

                                 LARRY
                        Bridget Greene... Omar Sadaar.

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        Well... technically the top ten 
                        won’t be solidified until the last 
                        day of school.  

           Slowly, Larry move’s up and looks at Mrs. Kimotech. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do you mean? The standings 
                        could change? 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH 
                        It’s highly unlikely at this point.   

                                 LARRY
                        But it’s not outside the realm of 
                        possibility for me to move up? 

                                 MS. KIMOTECH
                        Larry, you’re going to college at 
                        one of the best academic centers of 
                        the world. At this point, who cares 
                        if you’re Valedictorian?   

           Larry stares... she doesn’t get it.

           INT. NURSES OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           MS. CAROL (60) the grumpy school nurse is taking the 
           temperature of JULIO, a Mexican immigrant who can barely 
           speak english. Larry enters.   

                                 MS. CAROL 
                        98.7. That’s normal. 
                                 JULIO 
                        No por favor. Estoy enfermado.  

                                 MS. CAROL
                        Get back to class Julio.

                                 JULIO
                        Este es terrible. Estoy enfermo no 
                        me siento bien. 

           Julio leaves. Ms. Carol looks at Larry. 

                                 MS. CAROL
                        You don’t look sick. 

                                 LARRY
                        I was looking to get my student 
                        file. 

                                 MS. CAROL
                        Why? 

                                 LARRY
                        This is embarrassing but I don’t 
                        know my locker combination. I’ve 
                        always just used my briefcase. I 
                        need to hand in my lock soon so 
                        that’s all I need.   

           Ms. Carol opens a drawer and pulls out a key, she moves to a 
           large file cabinet, unlocks it, and pulls out a large file. 
           She hands it to Larry. 

           Larry flips through the file. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Okay... got it. 

           Larry motions to put his file back in the drawer.  

                                 MS. CAROL 
                        Stop. I’ll do it. 

                                 LARRY
                        Really? I can just put it back. 

                                 MS. CAROL
                        No. It’s school policy. 

           Larry hands her the folder. 
                                 MS. CAROL (CONT’D)
                        No one is allowed to look at anyone 
                        else’s medical or personal 
                        information.

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           Students chit-chat at the lunch tables. Smiling faces and 
           summer clothes. In the back corner, all alone is Larry 
           looking over to see Alice, the girl that rejected Larry, 
           giggling with CHAD WHEELER (18), a piece of meat. They walk 
           over to a vending machine. 

           Larry eyes her food tray.  

           INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           From outside the Nurses office we see a teacher rush in. 

                                 TEACHER 
                        We need you! Alice Walker ate 
                        peanut butter and is going into 
                        anaphylactic shock. 

                                 MS. CAROL
                        Jesus! 

           Ms. Carol rips open a drawer, pulls out an auto injector, and 
           exits with the teacher. Ms. Carol exits the nurses office. 
           Larry creeps from behind a corner and watches her and the 
           teacher run to the cafeteria. 

           He enters the Nurses office. 

           INT. NURSES OFFICE - CONTINUOUS   

           Larry goes around to her desk drawer, checks if anyone is 
           around, and takes out the key. He moves to the file 
           cabinet... He flips through the names. It is listed 
           alphabetically by last name. Larry gets to the G’s... 

           GREAR... GREATHOUSE... GROMER 

           No Bridget Greene. 

                                 LARRY
                        Where is it? 

           Larry checks again... Still no Greene. 

           Larry moves to the S’s. 
           SABATA... SABATINO... SADAAR 

           Larry takes Omar Sadaar’s file out and shoves it down his 
           pants. 

           INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Larry exits the nurses office. He looks down the hall to see 
           a crowd of people gasping in horror at the sight of... 

           ALICE, lying on the ground, FOAMING at the mouth. Chad and 
           Ms. Carol kneel by her. 

                                 CHAD
                        Oh God. Babe... you’re going to be 
                        okay. 

                                 MS. CAROL
                        Did she hit her head? When she 
                        fell, did she hit her head?

           Ms. Carol shoves a needle in her chest. 

                                 MS. CAROL (CONT’D)
                        Call 911! 

           Larry walks in the other direction. 

           INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM - DAY 

           Larry enters the locker room and pulls the file out of his 
           pants. He methodically analyzes Omar’s folder. He flips 
           through pictures of Omar as a little boy. 

           He takes notes on a separate note-pad. His address... his 
           phone number... his social security number. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry peers in to a classroom through the cracked door...

           Students on computers type away with varying degrees of 
           speed. Larry finds Omar in the back plugged in, furiously 
           working away at the computer. All of a sudden Omar raises his 
           hand and a teacher walks away to check the screen over Omar’s 
           shoulder. The teacher gives a warm smile and shakes Omar’s 
           hand. 

                                 COMPUTER TEACHER 
                        We have a winner! 
           The other students deflate.    

                                 VOICE 
                        What are you doing? 

           Larry is shocked, he hits his head on the door and looks up 
           to see... 

           PRINCIPAL GREENE.

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Are you spying? 

                                 LARRY
                        No... I was just waiting for a 
                        friend. 

           She shakes her head and grins. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        I have to congratulate you on 
                        making the top ten. Third... that’s 
                        a huge accomplishment. 

                                 LARRY
                        Thank you. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Ms. Kimotech told me you were 
                        shaken when you found out your 
                        class position... Why was that?

                                 LARRY
                        I don’t know what Mrs. Kimotech is 
                        referring to. It’s good news.  

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Look.  

           Principal Greene points though a doorway where a student, 
           DRAKE (18) is arguing with a teacher. He’s a white boy 
           wearing do-rag and a sleeveless shirt.  

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know who that is? 

                                 LARRY
                        That’s Drake Farkas. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Ms. Jackson caught him dealing an 
                        ounce of marijuana underneath the 
                        lunch table today. He’ll get 
                        expelled. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE (CONT'D)
                        The police are on their way to 
                        arrest him right now. It’s a shame. 
                        He won’t graduate. If he had just 
                        waited to sell after school he’d be 
                        walking. But rules are rules. It 
                        doesn’t matter if someone breaks 
                        them the first week of school or 
                        the last. This school used to have 
                        this kind of stuff happen daily... 
                        You know how I got it to be so 
                        clean? I threw out the snakes. 
                             (beat)
                        My daughter will be up on that 
                        podium giving the valedictorian 
                        address and if you do anything to 
                        keep that from happening I’ll throw 
                        you out of this fucking school 
                        myself.  

           The bell rings. Students starts filling the hallway. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE (CONT’D)
                        Now go to class.    

           Principal Greene walks away. Larry stands still, petrified. 

           EXT. HARBORFIELDS HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON  

           School buses are lining up along the end of the curb. 
           Students fill the buses or walk over to their cars. Larry, 
           watching from his Mercedes, eyes Omar get into his beat up 
           Honda Civic. Omar tries starting the ignition multiple times 
           before the car turns on. Omar drives off, Larry starts up his 
           car and follows him.    

           EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Larry turns the radio on to listen to the Carl Orff’s opera 
           song “O Fortuna.” He is close behind Omar’s tail and follows 
           him down a winding road. 

           EXT. CUL DE SAC - DUSK  

           Omar parks his car in his driveway and enters his shabby run 
           down home. 

           Larry, not far behind, parks his car on the side of the road. 
           He turns off the radio and looks around, taking in the grim 
           neighborhood. Cracked roads with weeds popping out, shopping 
           carts on lawns, and boarded up houses. Omar’s front lawn is 
           covered in weeds and litter. 
           A pitbull growls behind a fence. The dog has his eyes on 
           Larry. 

           Larry looks to Omar’s smashed in mailbox. Larry is curious 
           about the mailbox... he pulls out a pen and a notebook to  
           writes down Omar’s address.

           Larry gets out of the car. The pitbull starts barking 
           uncontrollably.

           Larry rings the doorbell. He waits... no answer. Larry rings 
           again.

                        Mario, we don’t have any money! 
                        Please stop trying to sell us pop 
                        tarts for your bad habits.  

           Larry rings the door bell once more. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        We don’t want any. Please leave! I 
                        will call the police. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s Larry. 

           The door swings open. 

                                 OMAR
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LARRY
                        I didn’t think it was safe to talk 
                        in school so I followed you. 

                                 OMAR
                        I’m sorry-- you followed me? In 
                        your car?

                                 LARRY
                        Good thing I did. The address the 
                        school has is different then this 
                        one. You just move here?  

                                 OMAR
                        Why are you following me to my 
                        home, Larry? 
                                 LARRY
                        I know you hacked the school’s 
                        online security system to find out 
                        the standings.

           Omar is floored. Larry’s got him. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ah! There it is... the guilty face. 

                                 OMAR
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. I didn’t hack into anything. 

           Omar goes to slam the door but Larry catches it. 

                                 LARRY
                        Hold it. I’m not done. I confirmed 
                        what you said... Bridget will be 
                        the valedictorian. But it doesn’t 
                        have to be that way. I’m 
                        thinking... you and me partner up. 
                        Take her down. You would be 
                        valedictorian and I would be 
                        salutatorian. You’ll get the 
                        scholarship you need. Either that 
                        or I tell principal Greene what you 
                        did.

           INT. OMAR’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Omar and Larry walk into a grimy kitchen. There are moving 
           boxes everywhere. 

                                 LARRY
                        You just move here? 

                                 OMAR
                        Since July. Had to relocate. Would 
                        you like some water? 

                                 LARRY
                        Please sit. 

           A frail voice can be heard from the living room... 

                                 VOICE O.S.
                        Omar? Omar? 

                                 OMAR
                        Excuse me. 
           Omar walks into the living room. OMAR’S MOM sits in a wheel 
           chair with an oxygen tube below her nose. She wear a hijab 
           and is watching TV. Omar adjusts her morphine drip. 

           Omar comes back to the kitchen. Larry looks away as if he 
           didn’t see. 

                                 LARRY
                        I think it’s important to go over 
                        what’s involved with this. 

                                 OMAR
                        I don’t want to do anything 
                        illegal. 

                                 LARRY
                        You won’t have to. Neither will I. 
                        But you need to understand what 
                        we’re going up against. Bridget 
                        Greene. She’s a different animal. 
                        She’ll do anything to win. I know 
                        from experience. 

                                 OMAR 
                        You’re referring to the election 
                        last year? 

                                 LARRY
                        I should have been president. I was 
                        polling way ahead and then what? 
                        She starts spreading these vile 
                        rumors about me that I’m racist 
                        towards the Trinidadian lunch 
                        ladies after I vowed in my campaign 
                        a need for school employees who 
                        know how to speak english! That’s 
                        not racist! She spread that I 
                        sexually harassed the cheerleaders,  
                        that I masturbate in the bathroom 
                        during my free periods, and this 
                        was the nail in the coffin... she 
                        had her mother schedule the 
                        Christian club to go on a bible 
                        study field trip in Appalachia on 
                        the day of the election. She knew 
                        that was my constituency. I pushed 
                        hard for an audit on the vote but 
                        the school board didn’t take me 
                        seriously. The point is Bridget 
                        knows what she’s doing. Her and her 
                        mom -- The Greene Machine.  
                                 OMAR
                        So how are we going to both move 
                        past her? There’s only one week 
                        left of school.  

                                 LARRY
                        Right now we need to focus on those 
                        daily math quizzes. You’re in her 
                        class right? 

                                 OMAR
                        Yes. 

                                 LARRY
                        She sits next to you? 

                                 OMAR
                        Yes. 

                                 LARRY
                        And she’s been acing the quizzes 
                        just like you right? 

           Omar nods. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        She’s copying your answers. Or at 
                        least verifying them with yours. 
                        That needs to change.   

                                 OMAR
                             (realizing)
                        She has been copying my answers. 

           Omar’s mom starts to wheeze. 

                                 LARRY
                        So what you need to do is feed her 
                        the wrong answers. Don’t make it 
                        obviously wrong. Make it subtly 
                        wrong so she’ll bite. And then in 
                        between periods you’ll give me the 
                        correct answers.

                                 OMAR
                        Okay I’ll do all that but I have to 
                        ask... what’s in it for you? Why do 
                        you want to be Salutatorian so 
                        badly?

                        or salutatorian of their high 
                        school class. 
                             (beat)
                        You will get the Jacob Newman 
                        scholarship. A blank check. Use it 
                        on whatever you need. So, Omar, do 
                        we have a deal? 

           Omar’s mother’s wheezing grows loud. Larry extends his hand.

           EXT. LARRY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Larry’s drives up to a large iron gate. He pushes the 
           automatic opener and the gate part. Larry drives through and 
           up a long straight pathway. The hedges are perfectly 
           manicured and a row of lights along the pathway lead up to an 
           enormous Victorian estate. 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens up and Larry parks his car in the pristine 
           four car garage. The floors don’t even have a speck of dust. 
           Larry gets out of the car and looks to the empty car spaces.    

           INT. LARRY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Larry enters and without flipping the switch the lights turn 
           on automatically to reveal a pristine kitchen with all 
           stainless steel appliances. Larry walks over to the phone and 
           presses PLAY.

                        other people or any other

           Larry moves closer to the screen and sits criss cross on the 
           floor, eyes glued to the TV like a kid watching Saturday

                        Good Morning. Would everyone please 
                        rise for the pledge. I pledge 
                        allegiance to the Flag of the 
                        United States of America and to the 
                        Republic for which it stands, one 
                        nation under God, indivisible, with 
                        liberty and justice for all. You 
                        may be seated. There are a couple 
                        of announcements today...

           INT. HALLWAY- MORNING

           The bell rings. A bunch of students exist a classroom, Omar 
           hurries out and runs to the men’s room. 

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Drew runs into a stall. Larry is sitting on the toilet with 
           his pants on. He stands up.  
                                 LARRY
                        How’d it go? 

                                 OMAR
                        I think it worked. I slid my test 
                        all the way to the side of my desk 
                        with all the wrong answers, just as 
                        we discussed, and she wrote 
                        everything down. I switched my 
                        answers right before I turned it 
                        in. 

                                 LARRY
                        Perfect! So what were the right 
                        answers? 

           There’s a bang on the stall door. 

                                 LARRY & OMAR 
                        Occupied. 

                                 STUDENT 
                        Jesus get a room. 

                                 LARRY
                        Hurry... what were the answers.

                                 OMAR
                        Um, the first was I two equals cos 
                        X plus five over one half sin X 
                        parenthesis four plus k to the 
                        second power. 

                                 LARRY
                             (closing eyes to remember)
                        Okay, I two equals cos X plus five 
                        over one half sin X parenthesis 
                        four plus K got it. 

                                 OMAR
                        The second was uh... one half 
                        parenthesis M plus one to the 
                        second power parenthesis minus n 
                        squared bracket parenthesis M plus 
                        1 N--

           The bell rings. 

                                 LARRY
                        Wait, N or M?

                                 OMAR
                        M... 
                                 LARRY
                        N? You said N. 

                                 OMAR
                        No no. M plus one N. 

                                 LARRY
                        M. M as in mark? 

                                 OMAR
                        Right... It’s M plus N.

                                 LARRY
                        M plus M? 

                                 OMAR
                        No. Mmmmmm plus Nnnnn.

                                 LARRY
                        But the equation started with M

                                 OMAR
                        No, no. The equation started with 
                        an N.

                                 LARRY
                        You said M. 

                                 OMAR
                        Wait. I can’t remember. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Which is it M or N? 

                                 OMAR
                        M? Is it M?

                                 LARRY
                        I don’t know you took the damn 
                        test!

                                 OMAR
                        I think you’re right it’s M.

                                 LARRY
                        You sure? 

                                 OMAR
                        Not really. 

                                 LARRY
                        Okay, come on we have to hurry! 
                                 OMAR
                        Where was I?

                                 LARRY
                        You were getting to the bracket 
                        with the M plus N. 

                                 OMAR
                        Which bracket? 

                                 LARRY 
                        Write this down! 

           Larry rips out a piece of paper from his briefcase. Omar uses 
           the wall to write it on the paper. 

           INT. MATH CLASS - MORNING

           Larry enters the classroom late. The students are already at 
           their desks taking the quiz. Larry walks over to Mr. 
           Baltrusitis, who hands him a quiz.  

           Larry rushes to his desk and writes down the answers as fast 
           as he can to remember them. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           Larry and Omar sit in a secluded corner table.

                                 OMAR
                        I don’t know man, this is-- this 
                        is... not right. 

                                 LARRY
                        You already did it once before!  

                                 OMAR
                        There’s a higher probability of the 
                        school catching me if it’s done 
                        multiple times. I would get 
                        expelled, maybe even go to jail. I 
                        can’t do jail, Larry. Scrawny 
                        Muslims are the first to get 
                        shanked. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s not like this public school 
                        has a cyber security task force 
                        waiting to catch hackers. 
                                 OMAR 
                        You don’t know that... I can’t do 
                        it. I never should have done it in 
                        the first place. It was a messed up 
                        thing for me to do.  

                                 LARRY
                        Think about your mom, Omar. What’s 
                        more important than family? 

           Omar looks down. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        We have to take risks, that’s the 
                        only way this thing can work. 
                        There’s no way we can beat her if 
                        we can’t see the scoreboard.  

           INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

           Omar is hacking into the school’s online network on his 
           laptop. Larry stands over his shoulder, looking to see if 
           anyone is approaching. 

                                 OMAR
                        Almost there. 

           Drew types some more. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we’re in. 

           Larry sits down next to Omar. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Bridget Greene. 

           A profile of Bridget is on the screen. 

                                 LARRY
                        Go to her transcript. 

           Omar clicks around. He gets to the current transcript. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the GPA?

                                 OMAR
                        99.8... I don’t know if we can do 
                        this. I’m at a 99 flat. 
                                 LARRY
                        Did Baltricitus upload the math 
                        quiz? 

                                 OMAR
                        She got a... 90.    

                                 LARRY
                        A 90!? What did you get?

                                 OMAR

                                 LARRY
                        Then how the fuck did she get a 90?

                                 OMAR
                        I guess she didn’t copy my wrong 
                        answers.

                                 LARRY
                        You didn’t do it right. You made 
                        them too wrong! 

                                 OMAR
                        No, I made them slightly wrong, 
                        little mistakes. 

                                 LARRY
                        Omar, we’re not going to go 
                        anywhere with a 10 point 
                        differential. We need her to bomb 
                        big!

           The school LIBRARIAN (80’s) dart her eyes over. 

                                 LIBRARIAN 
                        Shh! Be quiet! 

                                 LARRY
                        Sorry Fran, We’ll keep our voice 
                        down. 

           Larry and Omar whisper.

                                 OMAR
                        Her record is immaculate. Perfect 
                        attendance since elementary school. 
                        Never had detention. Straight A’s 
                        across the board. She’s perfect.

                                 LARRY
                        Does she have any allergies?  
                                 OMAR 
                        Why? 

                                 LARRY
                        Just check. 

                                 OMAR
                        None that are listed.

                                 LARRY
                        Damn it.

                                 OMAR
                        I don’t think we can mathematically 
                        beat her. I thought I had a chance 
                        but at this point she would have to 
                        absolutely bomb some tests which 
                        she won’t do or be expelled for 
                        something which she’ll never be.  

           An idea sparks in Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        Expelled... she can be expelled... 
                        What’s her class schedule?

           INT. CHOIR ROOM- AFTERNOON 

           The students sing a lovely melody. Larry peers through the 
           window of the room through the hallway.   

           Bridget sings a solo. Her voice is pure and beautiful. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Students walk out of the classroom. Larry follows Bridget. 
           Bridget comes to her locker. Larry stops and turns to a 
           locker opposite hers. He removes a small glass fragment and 
           positions it so he can see behind him. 

           Bridget unlocks her the locker. Larry can see the numbers... 

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Larry enters a dumpy 1990 Honda Civic passenger side. Drake, 
           the kid who was expelled earlier, sits in the front seat.

                                 DRAKE 
                        Larry Fikus. I didn’t take you for 
                        a ganja man.  
                                 LARRY
                        You have weed? 

                                 DRAKE 
                        Do I have weed? Is that even a 
                        question? I’ve got a mobile 
                        dispensary up in this bitch. What 
                        are you lookin’ for? 

                                 LARRY
                        I need something... rancid. 

                                 DRAKE 
                        Well that’s a first. Usually people 
                        are looking for the opposite. 

                                 LARRY
                        I like it to stink. 

                                 DRAKE
                        Ohhhh my man. I agree wit you. Just 
                        let the scent roam free, it’s part 
                        of the experience. I’ll tell you 
                        what, I’ve got a discount going on 
                        the green hornet hash. Here, get 
                        yourself a whiff. 

           Drake gives Larry a bag with a weed in it. Larry opens the 
           top and smells. 

                                 DRAKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s yours for 25 an eighth. You 
                        can’t find a better price than 
                        that. 

                                 LARRY
                        Do you have something stronger? 

                                 DRAKE 
                        That’s pretty strong, Larry. 
                        But I think I have what you’re 
                        looking for.  

           Drake reaches into his back seat, fumbles around. He 
           retrieves a small tupperware container. He opens it and pulls 
           out a plastic bag with a prescription bottle in it and then 
           takes the bottle out of the bag. 

                                 DRAKE (CONT’D)
                        Now this is new, you can’t find 
                        this on the market. It don’t have a 
                        name yet... 
           Larry takes whiff and starts coughing. His eyes water. This 
           is the first time we see him blink. 

                                 DRAKE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah that’ll give you a contact 
                        high just by sniffing. 

                                 LARRY
                        This is good. 

                                 DRAKE
                        That’s some pro weed right there, 
                        big leagues Larry and for that it’s 
                        going to cost you a pretty penny. 

                                 LARRY
                        How much for a pound? 

           Drake’s eyes widen.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

           TITLE CARD: TUESDAY 

           INT. HALLWAY- EARLY MORNING 

           Empty. Peaceful. Quite. Then... 

           Larry enters. He comes to Bridget’s locker, he looks around 
           the hallway... No one. 

           ON THE LOCK: 18... 24... 36.

           The lock comes undone. Larry opens, the door creaks... a few 
           textbooks, a magnetic calender, and a pencil box. Very clean.   

           Larry removes a large plastic bag of weed from his briefcase 
           and unzips the lining. He coughs, he covers his mouth. 

           Weed is sprinkled around the locker. He places the bag 
           inside. He shuts the door and locks the lock. 

           INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING 

           Larry furiously washes his hands. He can hear from outside...

                                 STUDENT
                        You smell that? 
                                 ANOTHER STUDENT
                        Oh man that’s bad. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING 

           Larry waits in a stall. There’s a knock... then a double 
           knock. Larry opens the door. Omar comes in. 

                                 LARRY
                        I have a pencil and paper. 

                                 OMAR
                        Good. 

           Omar starts writing the math answers down. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Have you been down the south 
                        hallway? Someone brought some weed 
                        into school. 

                                 LARRY
                        We’ll see what happens. 

           Omar turns to Larry. 

                                 OMAR
                        Did you bring something in? 

                                 LARRY
                        After today Bridget Greene won’t be 
                        a problem for us. 

           INT. HALLWAY- MORNING

           A GERMAN SHEPARD sniffs the hallway. A policeman holds the 
           leash. Another policeman follows. Principal Greene is close 
           by.  

           Students and teachers find this all very entertaining. A 
           crowd watches from either side of the hallway, Larry is in 
           the front row. Omar joins him.  

                                 OMAR
                        What’s going on? 

                                 LARRY
                        Just watch. 

           The dog sniffs to Bridget’s locker. Pauses. Silence... 
           BARK! BARK! 

           The crowd moves in closer. Larry tries to hide a smile. He 
           see’s Bridget on the opposite end. Her calm expression makes 
           Larry wonder.  

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Everyone step back! 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Cut the lock. 

                                 BRIDGET 
                             (stepping forward)
                        That’s my locker. I will open it 
                        for you, if you’d like. I have 
                        nothing to hide.

           Larry rolls his eyes. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Yes Bridget, please do so. 

           Bridget unlocks the lock and the door. It creaks open...

                                 POLICEMAN
                        There’s nothing in here. 

           Larry’s confused, he steps closer to see for himself.

                                 POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
                        Sir, step back. 

           Larry steps back. 

           The German Shepard continues to sniff. Bridget glares at 
           Larry.

           The German Shepard, sniffing harder, comes to...

           LARRY’S LOCKER. Bridget’s piercing stare is now accompanied 
           with an evil grin. Principal Greene rolls her eyes at Larry. 
           Larry’s eyes dart to his locker. 

           BARK! BARK! BARK! 

           The dog jumps up and scratches the locker. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        I think we’ve got it. 

           Larry steps forward. 
                                 POLICEMAN
                        Sir, I’m not going to ask you 
                        again. 

           Larry steps back. 

                                 OMAR
                             (whispering)
                        Isn’t that your locker? 

           Larry is frozen. BARK! BARK! BARK! 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Is this anyone’s locker? 
                             (starring at Larry)
                        Anyone?

           Bridget waves and mouths “Goodbye” to Larry. 

                                 PRINCIPAL HOWARD
                        Going once, going twice, Okay! Cut 
                        the lock. 

           Heart pounding. Breath shortening. Larry jolts away. 

           The Policeman brings huge BOLT CUTTERS to the lock, it snaps 
           clean off... 

           A FIRE ALARM: PULL IN CASE OF FIRE. Larry pulls the lever 
           down.

           BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

                                 RECORDED VOICE
                        Fire! Fire! This is not a drill. 
                        This is not a drill. Fire! Fire! 

           The overhead sprinkle system down pours...

           Everyone gets soaked. Students scream. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        WAIT! OPEN THE LOCKER! 

           Pandemonium... 

           Teachers and students, holding books over their heads, sprint 
           to the nearest exit. The stampede of students move Principal 
           Greene and Bridget out of the school. Alice (peanut allergy 
           girl) slips right before the exit... 

           BAM! She hits her head hard on the floor, rendering her 
           unconscious. Students trample over her. 
           The two policemen rush over to Alice.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Miss. Miss! She hit her head. We 
                        need an ambulance. Miss, stay with 
                        us. 

                                 OTHER POLICEMAN
                        Let’s get her out of the building. 

           They hoist her up and walk out. 

                                 OMAR
                        You coming? 

                                 LARRY
                        Go! 

           Omar sprints out. The only one left in the building is Larry. 
           A drenched suit. 

           He comes to his locker, opens it... 

           The pound of weed is sprinkled all over his locker. Larry 
           looks around. No one. 

           He gathers the weed up, holding it with his shirt. 

           Larry sprints to the... 

           MEN’S BATHROOM. 

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           No sprinklers in here. Larry rushes in. He goes to the first 
           stall... 

           SHIT EVERYWHERE. 

           The toilet it filled to the brim with yellow and green 
           diarrhea. Some is on the floor. Some is smeared on the wall. 

                                 LARRY
                        Jeez.  

           Larry tries the second stall. It’s locked. He kicks it. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT 
                        Occupied. 

                                 LARRY
                        Open up! 
                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        I’m taking a shit. 

                                 LARRY
                        There’s a fire alarm going off! 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        I’m not finished. I can’t just 
                        leave mid poop.  

           Larry punches the stall. 

                                 LARRY
                        How much longer? 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        What?

                                 LARRY
                        How much longer will you be in 
                        there? 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        I can’t tell! Just use the other 
                        stall. 

                                 LARRY 
                        It’s disgusting. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Hey man, when you got to go... you 
                        got to go. 

           Larry gulps. He enters the first stall and locks the door...

           There’s a lot of poo in that toilet. A lot. 

           Larry makes a horrid, disgusted face. He drops the weed into 
           the toilet. 

           He flushes... 

           The handle falls off, landing into a pile of poo on the 
           floor. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on in there? Are you 
                        okay?

                                 LARRY
                        Everything’s fine. 
                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        You trying to fix the toilet? My 
                        dad’s a plumber.

                                 LARRY
                        What do I do?

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Wait why are you trying to fix the 
                        toilet? 

                                 LARRY
                        JUST HELP ME! 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Okay... You’ve got to open up the 
                        top.

           Larry removes the top of the toilet... poo in there too. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        Now what do you see? 

                                 LARRY
                        Shit. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        What? What do you see?!

                                 LARRY
                        Feces. A lot of feces.  

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Oh jeez. Is it overflowing with 
                        water or just straight up poop? 

                                 LARRY
                        I can’t tell. It’s very watery. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Oh boy. Okay. You need to reach in 
                        there and the lift the lift chain 
                        up. 

                                 LARRY
                        What? Is there another way? 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Nope. You need to go in there. 

           Larry contemplates, makes a face, then reaches into the poo 
           feeling around in the tank. He hoists the lift chain up...

           Nothing. 
                                 LARRY
                        Nothing. 

           Larry pulls his sludge smeared hand out.

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Okay, the water valve is not turned 
                        on, reach around back and twist the 
                        black nozzle, to the left. Right? 
                        No. To the left. 

                                 LARRY
                        Which is it?

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Definitely left. Turn it left. 

           Larry gets down on his knees. His face is very close to the 
           toilet contents. His poopy hand gets to the nozzle. He tries 
           to twist it...

                                 LARRY
                        It won’t budge. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Harder. Twist harder. You’ve got to 
                        give you’re all.

           Larry uses all his strength. The nozzle...

           BREAKS OFF. 

           Water RUNS in the toilet. 

                                 LARRY
                        It broke off. 

           Pause.

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        That’s no good. That’s like really 
                        bad. 

                                 LARRY
                        Why?

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        The toilet will overflow. 

           Larry gets up, his eyes widen as the toilet start to...

           RUMBLE

           Then...
           OVERFLOWING. Green and yellow sludges plop and splash down. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do I do?!

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        You have to reach in the toilet and 
                        remove whatever’s clogging it... Do 
                        it! It’s moving into my stall. 

           Some weed nuggets fall to the floor. 

                                 POOPY STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           Larry shoves his hand in through the diarrhea.

                                 POOPY STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up in there! 

           Larry is shoulder deep in. 

                                 LARRY
                        I think I’ve got it. 

           Larry clenches his teeth and using all his strength to remove 
           it. He’s using the toilet for leverage. His whole body is 
           wrapped around the toilet. 

           All the poo is splashing on him. Larry rips out... 

           A SHOE. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Got it!

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Now flush it. Flush the toilet!

           Larry yanks down on a pipe where the flush handle use to 
           be...

           The toilet SUCKS everything away. Gone. No more poo. No more 
           weed.  

                                 LARRY
                        There! It’s done! 

           Larry is covered in poo. Then hears a... 

           PLOP. SPLASH.

                                 POOPY STUDENT
                        Me too. 
           Flush. 

           INT. HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS

           Larry walks out into the hallway. The sprinklers still going. 
           Larry wipes off the shit from his suit. He then goes to the 
           fire alarm button and wipes it down with his shirt. 

           EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY 

           Larry walks outside to see... 

           The entire school soaked in water. A girl rinses out her hair 
           by twisting it. Another guy smacks his shirt pocket and water 
           squirts out. A group of students watch Alice, on a stretcher, 
           being hoisted in an ambulance. The two cops assist the 
           paramedics. Principal Greene stands by. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Alice, are you okay? 

                                 PARAMEDIC 
                        Please step back. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Are you coming back to open the 
                        locker? 

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Ma’am we are going with Alice to 
                        the hospital. We can come back 
                        after.  

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        After?! The weed will be gone by 
                        then! 

           The policemen and paramedics hop into the ambulance. 

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        Let’s go! 

           They close the doors and drive off leaving a trail of dust 
           which Principal Green gets covered in. Several fire trucks 
           arrive, firemen jump out and run into the school.  

           Larry joins the crowd of students. Some of them turn their 
           heads, sniffing in disgust. 
           INT. SPANISH CLASSROOM - DAY 

           A full class chit chats amongst themselves. Students are 
           still wet from the sprinklers. 

           Larry sits in the back nervously clicking his pen repeatedly. 
           One student sniffs in Larry’s direction.  

                                 STUDENT
                        Yo Larry, you smell like shit. 

           He gets up and moves to the front of the class. 

           THWACK!

           Everyone looks to the front. A white pole comes through the 
           doorway. A blind Spanish man, Señor Shuler enters with the 
           help of MS. PURCELL.  

                                 MS. PURCELL
                        This is the classroom. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER 
                        Gracias. Close the door por favor.  

           Ms. Purcell leaves. Students looks around confused. 

           THWACK! 

           Senor Shuler slams his pole on the ground. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        Escucha!

           Silence. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        Señora Lopez went into labor a few 
                        hours ago. She will be gone for the 
                        reminder of the school year. I will 
                        be your new profesor. Mi nombre es 
                        Señor Shuler. It is my 
                        understanding that Señora Lopez 
                        graded you on class participation 
                        only. 

           THWACK! 

           Senor Shuler shakes his head. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        No! Las cosas van a cambiar. Things 
                        are going to change. 
                                 STUDENT
                        Normally we just watch movies in 
                        Spanish. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Silencio estúpido! Yo no juego 
                        juegos. I don’t play games. No 
                        Finding Nemo español! We will have 
                        a final exam. 

           Gasps. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        An oral exam tomorrow. We will 
                        talk, one on one. Uno a uno. You 
                        will need to demonstrate your 
                        mastery of the language. 

           Larry sinks into his seat. 

           INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           A janitor sweeps up a puddle of water as students walk around 
           him. Larry comes to his locker and opens it. Omar comes close 
           in to Larry. 

                                 OMAR
                             (whispering)
                        Did you have something to do with 
                        what happened today?  

                                 LARRY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 OMAR
                        The weed, Larry. The weed. Your 
                        plan back fired didn’t it?

                                 LARRY
                        Here is not a great place to be 
                        discussing this. 

           Larry locks his locker and walks away. Omar follows him. 

                                 OMAR
                        Aren't you going too far with this? 
                        I mean can't you think up of 
                        something that's not incriminating?

           Larry doesn’t respond. 
                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        A thing like that could destroy 
                        Bridget's future. She's a hard 
                        worker, she may not be the best 
                        person but she has potential. She 
                        can do great things. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Oh stop that! Let me give you a 
                        lesson they don't teach in any 
                        class here. When you have an enemy, 
                        which is what she is, you don't 
                        sympathize with it. You attack it 
                        with everything you got, you 
                        understand? Sympathy, empathy, any 
                        feelings only weakens your resolve. 

                                 OMAR
                        But don't you think you'll feel 
                        guilty after? 

                                 LARRY
                        Do you want to be Valedictorian, 
                        Omar?

           Omar takes a moment... 

                                 OMAR
                        Yes.

                                 LARRY
                        Then cut that thinking out. Just 
                        turn it off. Listen you're a 
                        sensitive guy and that's a good 
                        quality to have but take a guy from 
                        your tribe, Muhammad Ali, when he 
                        threw a punch in the ring, he 
                        didn't worry how it made them feel. 
                        Come on! He threw punch, after side 
                        jab, after upper cut until that 
                        motherfucker went down. Black and 
                        white thinking, Omar, it helps... 
                        and as far as I'm concerned Bridget 
                        deserves anything we throw at her. 
                        She's been strutting around this 
                        school with her goodie two-shoe 
                        outfits and her rehearsed 
                        diplomatic behavior like she owns 
                        the place. Everyone knows she's a 
                        phony, they can see right through 
                        her. If she were to drop dead today 
                        people might go to her funeral... 
                        but would they really care? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        The only one who would shed tears 
                        would be mommy and seeing that 
                        would be worth the price of 
                        admission right there. 

                                 OMAR
                        That's pretty grim. 

                                 LARRY
                        That's the reality, my friend like 
                        it or not but the wheels on the bus 
                        go round and round. 

           Larry pats Omar on the shoulder and exists the school. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Students exit the school. 

           Larry walks to his car, half deflated. He throws his 
           briefcase in the back seat and turns to see...   

           Bridget Green, arms folded and her hair in a perfect bob. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        How is it that you both look and 
                        smell like shit at the same time? 

                                 LARRY
                        Careful, Bridget we’re on school 
                        property, swear words can get you 
                        detention. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Did you flush down the weed you 
                        stashed in my locker and then take 
                        a bath in the toilet bowl?  

                                 LARRY
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. But maybe smoking would be 
                        good for you, I hear it helps with 
                        psychosis. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh yes, Larry Fikus, the shining 
                        apotheosis of mental stability. Let 
                        me tell you if you ever try to pull 
                        a trick like that again-- 
                                 LARRY
                        You going go cry to mommy now? 
                        She’ll make it all better for you 
                        won’t she?

           Bridget gives a sharp look.

                        Can I leave?

                        You ever hear of Darla Kane? 

                                 LARRY
                        The vegetable?  

                                 BRIDGET
                        Darla and I were in the same music 
                        class in the 2nd grade. We were 
                        best friends... at the time. There 
                        was this one class Ms. Wilbur 
                        picked each student to play a 
                        different instrument. Some kids 
                        played the maracas, some kids were 
                        on the tambourine, there were 
                        drums, bells, a couple of 
                        triangles... but there was only one 
                        Vibraslap. I’m guessing you don’t 
                        know what a Vibraslap is. 

                                 LARRY
                        No... but you’re going to tell me. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        It’s a percussion instrument you 
                        hold with one hand on a stiff wire 
                        connecting a wood ball to a hollow 
                        box of wood with metal “teeth” 
                        inside. When you hit the ball it 
                        makes this powerful rattle sound. 
                        It was the best instrument. I 
                        raised my hand high to play it but 
                        Darla was chosen instead. She 
                        crossed me... Darla knew I wanted 
                        to play it. The next day at recess 
                        Darla and I were on the monkey 
                        bars... she lost her grip. In the 
                        fall her head hit a rock and 
                        cracked open. The school had to 
                        replace the wood chips there 
                        because they were soaked and 
                        stained with her blood. Darla’s 
                        been in a vegetative state since.

                        That was when I was 7, imagine what 
                        I can think up at 18. Stay where 
                        you are Larry and tell that to your 
                        little Omar too... and... take a 
                        shower. 

           Bridget walks away. 

           INT. LARRY’S LIVING ROOM- EVENING 

           Barack Obama is on the plasma TV screen.

                                 OBAMA
                        That's not what I'm talking about. 
                        I'm talking about something more 
                        substantial. It's the hope of 
                        slaves sitting around a fire 
                        singing freedom songs; 

           Larry, defeated, watches in a white robe with his hair 
           slicked back wet. He’s fresh and clean but his eyes look as 
           if he rubbed shampoo in them. There are no lights on in the 
           room. The house is empty. 

                                 OBAMA (CONT’D)
                        The hope of immigrants setting out 
                        for distant shores; the hope of a 
                        young naval lieutenant bravely 
                        patrolling the Mekong Delta; the 
                        hope of a millworker's son who 
                        dares to defy the odds; the hope of 
                        a skinny kid with a funny name who 
                        believes that America has a place 
                        for him, too.

           The audience cheers. Larry is catatonic on the couch.

           TITLE CARD: WEDNESDAY

           INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING 

           Larry sits alone reading the local paper. Other around him 
           chat and exchange yearbooks to sign. Omar slides down across 
           the table. 

                                 LARRY
                        You read this? 
                                 OMAR
                        What? 

                                 LARRY
                        Bridget’s in the paper. 

           Larry slams the newspaper down so Omar can see. 

                                 OMAR
                             (reads from the article)
                        “As a participant in Our Lady Queen 
                        of Martyrs Project Nicaragua 
                        Mission, Bridget Greene raised over 
                        $30,000 to support the rural 
                        village of Amatitan, Nicaragua, 
                        where Greene served as a translator 
                        and helped to build homes and 
                        refurbish schools.” 

                                 LARRY
                        Oh how wonderful. Nicaragua -- 
                        please. She only went down there so 
                        she could refurbish her Instagram 
                        with pictures of her holding little 
                        Latino babies. That bitch. You know 
                        how many times I’ve written a press 
                        release to get into this paper? 
                        Nine times. I’m the Harborfields 
                        Chess Champion. No coverage. Winter 
                        track last year -- I broke an 
                        Eleventh grade record on the 300. 
                        No column inches for me! But 
                        Bridget Greene gets in no problem 
                        with her saving the whole bullshit. 
                        If it’s any consolation she looks 
                        horrible without makeup. By twenty 
                        those bags under her eyes will be 
                        bigger than her boobs.     
                             (sighs)
                        It’s times like this I wish I was a 
                        cute girl. 

           Omar laughs. Larry giggles with him. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Then I’d be in the paper.

                                 OMAR
                        Come on it’s the local paper no one 
                        is going to read this. 
                                 LARRY
                        Wrong. You know how many Long 
                        Island moms subscribe to this crap 
                        paper? How many old people? Way 
                        more than you think. 

                                 OMAR
                        Okay -- so what? What does this 
                        have to do with you? 

                                 LARRY
                        What are you my therapist? It 
                        matters. The press matters. I just 
                        never found a way to have my name 
                        featured. Don’t you want that?

                                 OMAR
                        It would be nice but I’m not 
                        obsessing over it. That’s 
                        debilitating. 

                                 LARRY
                        For me it’s motivating. 

           INT. DARK ROOM - AFTERNOON

           A photo of a beautiful blonde woman sitting in a park lies in 
           a puddle of chemicals. A pair of tongs picks up the corner of 
           the photo. 

           Larry hangs the picture on a line with several other photos 
           of the same women all in different locations in different 
           outfits. 

           MR. MARAVEL, a jolly man, (60’s) enters. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Nice work... beautiful subject. Is 
                        she a relative?

                                 LARRY
                        No. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        A girlfriend? 

                                 LARRY
                        No. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Then how do you know her? 
                                 LARRY
                        I don’t. 

           The photo’s include the woman at the library, in a coffee 
           shop, driving in her car, etc. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I was always far away. 

           There is a silence. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Well, you have some nice work here. 
                             (beat)
                        So is Incorvaia really the 
                        graduation speaker? 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m really sorry. I heard it was a 
                        close vote.   

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Well thanks. I was shocked to hear 
                        that announcement. Every student I 
                        checked with said they would vote 
                        for me but I guess a lot of them 
                        lied. You voted for me right, 
                        Larry? 

                                 LARRY
                        Of course I did. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        You’re not lying to me are you? 

                                 LARRY
                        No... 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Good. I just wouldn’t want this 
                        kind of thing to effect anyone’s 
                        grade in my class. 

           Mr. Maravel pats Larry on the back and leaves. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry exists a classroom. Over the loud speaker...

           INT. MATH CLASS - DAY 

           Larry enters. Mr. Baltricitus and Omar sit at the front of 
           the room. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS 
                        Larry, please come here. 

           Larry walks towards them. Omar is petrified. 

                                 LARRY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        Sit down. 

           Larry and Omar sit in chairs placed right in front of Mr. 
           Baltricitus’s desk. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           Mr. Baltricitus hands Larry a piece of paper with a math 
           problem on it. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS (CONT’D)
                        Solve this. 

           Larry looks over.

                                 LARRY
                        Mr. Baltricitus, I’m not really in 
                        the frame of mind to approach this. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS 
                        What is the Sandwich Theorem?

                                 LARRY
                        The what?

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        The Sandwich Theorem. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s um. It ah. It’s a theorem in 
                        which--

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        Omar, what’s the Sandwich Theorem?
           Omar’s head hangs over. 

                                 OMAR
                        It allows the computation of the 
                        limit of an expression by trapping 
                        the expression between two other 
                        expressions which have limits that 
                        are easier to compute.

                                 LARRY
                        Right, yes. That’s correct. I was 
                        paraphrasing a little.  

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        Hmm. Maybe you can explain what a 
                        Rectangle form is.  

                                 LARRY
                        It’s when the shape we’re dealing 
                        with, in any given problem, is a 
                        rectangle. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        Omar, what’s Rectangle form? 

                                 OMAR
                        It’s um A function or relation 
                        written using x, y or x, y, z 
                        coordinates.

                                 MR. BALTUSITIS
                        Do you even know what an integer 
                        is? 

           Larry nervously laughs.

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        What do you make of this? 

           Mr. Baltricitus hands Larry a piece of paper.  

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS (CONT’D)
                        Read it. 

           Larry leers over, takes a breath, and reads. 

                                 LARRY
                        “This is an anonymous tip. Larry 
                        Fikus and Omar Sadaar have been 
                        cheating on your daily math

                        correct answers. Signed deeply 
                        concerned student. 

                                 OMAR
                        Oh God. 

           Omar palms his face. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        What do you make of this? 

                                 LARRY
                        These allegations are false.

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS 
                        I don’t think they are Larry. You 
                        see I checked the grades. You two 
                        have been receiving the same 
                        perfect scores for five days 
                        straight now. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s a coincidence. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS 
                        This is no co-wink-eee-dink. You 
                        were a B student until five days 
                        ago, then you magically improved. 
                        Explain that. 

                                 OMAR
                        I’m sorry Mr. Baltricitus.

           Omar breaks down.

                                 LARRY
                        Don’t-- 

                                 OMAR
                        What the paper says is true, we 
                        cheated. I gave Larry the answers 
                        before your class. 

           Larry is fuming. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS 
                        Larry? 

           Larry looks away. 
                                 MR. BALTRICITUS (CONT’D)
                        What you boys did was serious and 
                        you will be punished. 

           Omar turns to Larry, red in the face and eyes watery.  

                                 OMAR
                        It’s all your fault. I should have 
                        never listened to you. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        After I notify Mr. Howard and the 
                        administration about this I will 
                        fail you both and personally notify 
                        your colleges of what you’ve done.

           Omar weeps.

                                 LARRY
                        You won’t do that.  

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        I will Larry. You did a terrible 
                        thing and you should be ashamed of 
                        yourself. 

                                 LARRY
                        If you say anything to anyone about 
                        our cheating, I will report you for 
                        inappropriately touching me. No, 
                        both of us will report you of 
                        inappropriately touching. 

           Omar turns to Larry. 

                                 OMAR
                        Larry--

           Larry grabs Omar on the shoulder. 

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        You’re crazy. 

                                 LARRY
                        You’re up for tenure at the end of 
                        the school year right? 

           Mr. Baltricitus stands up.

                                 MR. BALTRICITUS
                        Get out of my classroom.

           Omar moves to get up, Larry pushes him down. 
                                 LARRY
                        You know what would be just 
                        terrible in front of the tenure 
                        committee? Two separate accusations 
                        of inappropriately touching 
                        students. Now you could tell the 
                        truth, we cheated. Blah. Blah. Show 
                        them what you showed us but we’ll 
                        go to the newspapers with this and 
                        you can bet that this will be news. 

           Mr. Baltricitus sits. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Both Omar and I are going to get 
                        perfect one-hundreds in your class 
                        as an average. You do this and we 
                        won’t report anything. 

           Mr. Baltricitus grits his teeth. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. B you’re a young man. A whole 
                        career in front of you. A recent 
                        father, yes? Don’t let something 
                        like this get in that way of that. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry exits the classroom buttoning his jacket. Omar follows, 
           catching up to Larry. They walk down the hall.  

                                 OMAR
                        Larry... Larry!

                        You’re fluent in Spanish, right?

                                 OMAR
                        I’m not okay with what you did in 
                        there.  

                                 LARRY
                        He was going to expose us. You 
                        should be thanking me, we’re both 
                        getting hundreds.    

                                 OMAR
                        I was going to get that anyway. 

                                 LARRY
                        Omar, I need you to take this 
                        Spanish test for me today.

                        Spanish.

                        You know Larry wouldn’t it have 
                        been easier to just do the work on 
                        your own then think up of ways of 
                        cheating?

           Larry doesn’t have an answer.

                        We haven’t even come close to 
                        knocking Bridget off. She’s always 
                        two steps ahead of us. There’s no 
                        way it can be done.  

                                 LARRY
                        So you just want to give up? Just 
                        like that? 

           Omar stands still. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Fine. 

           Larry walks away. 

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - DAY 

           Larry enters into the stall he unclogged previously. He looks 
           into the toilet... at his reflection. He’s livid. 

           BAM!

           Larry kicks down on the toilet. 

           BAM! BAM!

           The toilet is destroyed.
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry limps down the hall. He passes by a small classroom 
           with an open door with a teacher going over english words 
           with... JULIO, the student from before in the nurse’s office.  

           An idea sparks in Larry.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           The bell rings. Julio walks out of the classroom. Larry’s 
           right there.

                        Julio. 

           Julio’s startled. He speaks in broken English and has a thick 
           accent. 

                                 JULIO
                        Oh, hello Larry. 

           Larry speaks slowly. 

                                 LARRY
                        Julio, how would you like to make 
                        one hundred dollars? 

           Julio’s confused. Larry thinks..

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Um... cien dolares. 

           Julio’s light up. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           Larry and Julio sit at a lunch table, alone. Larry still 
           speaks slowly. 

                                 LARRY
                        You are going to act as me, got it?

                        Yes, very good. Teacher is blind, 
                        he can’t see you. You speak

                        You get hundred dollars.   

           Julio doesn’t understand. Larry points to his eyes.

                        Good, lets just take a practise 
                        test.  

           Larry has an awful Spanish accent.

                                 LARRY
                        No. Slow. Repeat after me. Tengo...

                                 LARRY
                        Verde.

                        No, stop. Stop repeating me!

                                 JULIO
                        Oh lo siento. 

           Larry sighs. 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s okay. Don’t roll your R’s! 
                        Carrrrro is Car-o.
                                 JULIO
                        Carrro. 

                                 LARRY
                        See there you’re rolling your R’s. 
                        It needs to be believable. Say car. 

                                 JULIO
                        Car. 

                                 LARRY
                        Good. Now say O.

                                 JULIO
                        O. 

                                 LARRY
                        Car-O. 

                                 JULIO
                        Carrrrro. 

           Larry palms his face. 

                                 JULIO (CONT’D)
                        Mister Larry I will get this, let’s 
                        keep practising. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry stands outside a classroom. He checks his watch a few 
           times. He get his phone out and calls Julio, it goes straight 
           to voice mail. 

                                 JULIO VOICE
                        Por favor, deje un mensaje. 
                        Gracias. 

                                 LARRY
                        Julio! Where are you? The test is  
                        now!   

           The classroom door opens, a long pole comes out hitting the 
           floor. Señor Shuler holds the end of the pole.  

                                 SEÑOR SHULER 
                        Larry Fikus! 

           Larry looks around... empty hallways. No Julio.   

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        LARRY FIKUS! 
           Larry takes a deep breath. 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m here. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Come in. 

           Larry wide eyes, walks in. The door slams behind him. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Larry sits in a chair in front Señor Shuler. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Cómo estás, Larry? 

                                 LARRY
                        Um, not so well Señor. If we could 
                        postpone-- 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        En español! The test has started. 

           There’s a knock at the door, Julio peeks in.  

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me! We are in the middle of 
                        an oral examination! 

           Julio backs away. Larry frantically pantomimes for Julio to 
           come over.  

                                 LARRY
                        The door just opened, I can close 
                        it.

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Rápido!

           Larry runs over and grabs Julio over. 

                                 JULIO
                        Mister Larry, he knows your voice. 

           Larry covers Julio’s mouth. 

                                 LARRY
                             (Whispering)
                        You’re going to do this. I’m paying 
                        you good money. Now get in that 
                        chair. 
                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Larry! We’re losing time. 

           Larry closes the door. 

                                 LARRY
                        Coming. 

           Larry walks Julio to the chair. Julio sits, Larry stands 
           behind him. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Cómo va tu día? 

           Julio is silent. Larry pantomimes for Julio to speak.  

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        Larry! Cómo va tu día? 

                                 JULIO
                        Estoy teniendo un día muy bueno. Es 
                        cálido y el sol hacia fuera, no hay 
                        quejas. Deseando que llegue el 
                        verano.

           Señor Shuler gives a suspicious look.

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        That’s an accent. 

           Señor Shuler leans forward with his ears first.  

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        Where are you from?... In English 
                        please.

           Julio looks to Larry. Larry leans in next to Julio. 

                                 LARRY
                        Long Island. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        Muy extraño. You sound so different 
                        in English... Cuánto tiempo ha 
                        estado hablando español?

           Larry mouths “Answer! Answer!” Julio is petrified. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER (CONT’D)
                        What is going on here?... Answer 
                        the question! 
                                 LARRY
                        Señor Shuler, I have a confession 
                        to make. 

                                 SEÑOR SHULER
                        What?

                                 LARRY
                        I lied.

           Larry sighs. Julio is petrified. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I am not from Long Island. I grew 
                        up in small village called Veracruz 
                        in Mexico. There was terrible 
                        crime. People killed on the 
                        streets, children kidnapped from 
                        their families... The cartel owned 
                        the area. We sought to America for 
                        a new home. I was four years old 
                        when we moved. First we went to 
                        South Carolina, my father found 
                        work there but it wasn’t easy. The 
                        community hated us. Every day I 
                        would be bullied for being an 
                        immigrant. After our dog, Pedro was 
                        decapitated we knew we had to move. 

           Larry sniffles. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        We found Long Island. 
                             (soft)
                        Beautiful Long Island. We were 
                        finally treated with respect but... 
                        what I realized here is that no 
                        matter how liberal the people are 
                        no matter how accepting the people 
                        are, they look at you differently 
                        if you have an accent, especially 
                        one from a Spanish speaking 
                        country. 

           Julio turns to Larry. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        I worked hard to neutralize my 
                        accent. Don’t get me wrong, I am 
                        proud of my Mexican heritage but 
                        now people see me as their equal. I 
                        can talk with my peers without them 
                        feeling uncomfortable. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        The only time my true colors show 
                        is when I speak Spanish. I can’t 
                        hide my accent and that’s why I 
                        take Spanish here... I know it... 
                        but I feel like I’m home.  
                             (beat)
                        I hope you understand Señor. 

           There is a silence. 

           From behind Señor Shuler’s glasses, a single tear slides down 
           his face.   

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry leaves the classroom with Julio. 

                                 LARRY
                        What the hell happened? 

                                 JULIO 
                        Qué?

                                 LARRY
                        You were late! If I didn’t come up 
                        with that bullshit story I would 
                        have failed the test. I gave you 
                        simple instructions. Get there at 
                        twelve o’clock!

                                 JULIO
                        Lo siento mister Larry. 

           Julio puts his hand out. 

                                 JULIO (CONT’D)
                        Por favor.

                                 LARRY
                        Are you serious? You gave me 
                        nothing, I give you nothing.  

           Larry walks away. 

                                 JULIO 
                        Miss Greene. 

           Larry turns. 

                                 JULIO (CONT’D)
                        She pay double for this.

           There is a pause. 
                                 LARRY 
                        This is between you and me. 

           Larry talks out his wallet and hands Julio a hundred dollar 
           bill. 

                                 JULIO
                        Eh... More. 

           Larry grits his teeth and gives him the rest of what he has.  

                                 LARRY 
                        That’s all I have. 

                                 JULIO
                        Thank you mister Larry.

           Larry grabs Julio. 

                                 LARRY
                        You won’t tell Bridget? No tell 
                        Bridget?

                                 JULIO
                        Not today mister Larry. 

           Julio walks away. 

           INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

           Larry sits in the bleachers, tired and disheveled. 

           MR. AGOSTINO, a stout man with a hoodie and gym shorts holds 
           a bunch of packets and scantrons. He address’s his students. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        Okay here’s your test, make sure 
                        you write in pencil on the 
                        scantron. There are ten questions. 
                        Yes, you can work on it together I 
                        don’t care. 

           Mr. Agostino hands the test’s and scantrons out.

                        Hand them back to me at the end of 
                        the period. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Students work in groups helping each other with the 
           questions. Larry works on his alone. The first question 
           reads... 
           Which one is the basketball? 

           A) (picture of a baseball bat) 

           B) (picture of a whistle) 

           C) (picture of a basketball) 

           Larry circles the correct answer and looks up... BRIDGET 
           GREENE is at the front of the room. She hands the test in to 
           Mr. Agostino who is on his phone. Larry sneers. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO (CONT’D)
                        Hey! No cell phones! 

           Chad Wheeler, the guy going to prom with Alice Kelly, is  
           talking on his cell phone. 

                                 CHAD
                        I’m on the phone to see if Alice is 
                        okay. She’s in the ICU. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        Put it in the phone tray. 

           Chad ends the call and hands his cell to Mr. Agostino. 

                                 CHAD
                             (whispering)
                        Bullshit.

           Students wait on a long line to hand their test in. The bell 
           rings. Larry is in the back. Mr. Agostino is still on his 
           phone. Larry hands in his test. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        Larry do me a favor. Could you shut 
                        the door to the outside? I’m gotta 
                        take a whiz bad.   

           Mr. Agostino exists. Larry walks to the end of the gymnasium. 
           He goes to close the door but hears voices outside. He peers 
           to see Principal Greene and Bridget. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Everything will be fine, Bridget. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        You talked with Mrs. Antretter? 
                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        She will give you a hundred on the 
                        final. I made sure of it. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        I know Larry is up to no good. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Larry will not be a problem for 
                        you. I have eye witnesses that 
                        confirm he was the one who pulled 
                        the fire alarm. Tomorrow morning he 
                        will be expelled. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Couldn’t come soon enough. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        You have nothing to worry about. 
                        Just enjoy your last three days of 
                        high school. Come on. 

           Principal Greene and Bridget motion to walk into the gym. 
           Larry hides behind the opposite door. When they walk through. 
           Larry goes unnoticed. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Larry walks past the gym office with the door open... He 
           comes back to the office and see’s...

           THE PILE OF SCANTRONS 

           Larry looks to the right. No one. He looks to the left. 
           Empty. 

           INT. GYM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Larry creeps into the office and picks up the pile of 
           scantrons.  

                                 VOICE
                        Hey! 

           Larry freezes. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? 

           Larry puts down the scantrons but can’t tell where the voice 
           is coming from. He peers out of the office. 
           The voice is of a jock who talks to another jock.  

                                 JOCK #2  
                        What’s up my man? 

           They bro hug. Larry shuts the door and locks it. He moves 
           back to the scantrons. He flips through the names, finally 
           getting to... 

           BRIDGET GREENE 

           He takes a pencil out of his jacket pocket then frantically 
           erases answers. He leaves some bubbles filled in the way they 
           are but erases half the test. Larry wipes the eraser shaving 
           into his hand and puts them in his pocket. 

           Larry then fills in the bubbles with the wrong answers. Larry 
           emulates the pencil bumbles from Bridget’s other answers 
           which are perfectly filled in. Larry finishes the test off.    

           He brings the test up to the light and has a moment with it. 
           This is Bridget’s downfall. But suddenly... 

           The door handle is jerked! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO O.S. 
                        Is someone in there? 

           Petrified, Larry, can hear Mr. Agostino from outside the 
           office. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO O.S. (CONT’D)
                        Which key is it? 

           Keys jiggle. Larry looks around the room. He’s trapped. 
           There’s a desk with an opening under. Larry tries to squeeze 
           himself under there... He’s too big. 

           A key comes to the lock... it goes through. Larry tries to 
           cram himself into the opening. The key is forced but the door 
           doesn’t open.

                                 MR. AGOSTINO O.S. (CONT’D)
                        Not that one. 

           Larry comes out of the opening. He looks around again. He 
           spots Chad’s phone in the phone tray. He grabs it then goes 
           back under the desk. He dials a number. 

                                 AUTOMATED MESSAGE

           A sweet looking SECRETARY (30’s) is typing away at her 
           computer. Other administrative people have desks close to 
           her.  Her phone rings... she picks it up.

           The secretary screeches! She throws down the phone.

                        It’s ISIS! There going to bomb the 
                        school! 

           The other administrative people go frantic. They all 
           immediately leave their desks.

           All the students gets up and run. Almost all the girls 
           scream. Some guys push others to the side to get to the door 
           first. It’s chaos.  

           INT. SCHOOL FRONT DESK - CONTINUOUS

           The secretary gets on the loud speaker.

                        to blow us all up if we don’t leave 
                        now! 

           She pushes down a lever and the school alarm goes off.

                        Move it! 

           Mr. Agostino’s voice fades away. Larry gets out from under 
           the desk. Larry puts the phone down and wipes it with a 
           tissue then he places Bridget’s scantron in with the others. 
           He creeks open up the door...

           Madness. Students running outside. The alarm is blaring.  

                                 STUDENT

           Larry joins the crowd.

           EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Hordes of students runs out of the school. Three SWAT vans 
           pull up in the parking lot. A squad of fully armed SWAT men

           EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - EVENING

           A local news reporter, JAN DAVIS, talks into the camera. The 
           entrance to the school is behind her. Yellow DO NOT CROSS 
           tape is everywhere. Policemen and a SWAT team come in and out 
           of the school.  
                                 JAN DAVIS 
                        Good Evening -- I’m here at the 
                        entrace of Harborfields High School 
                        where just two hours ago the front 
                        desk received a phone call 
                        threatening to detonate a bomb 
                        inside the school. The SWAT Team 
                        has not found any bombs as of yet. 
                        I spoke with the SWAT team leader 
                        and while they’re treating this an 
                        active bomb investigation he 
                        believes this to be a prank call by 
                        a student. They were able to track 
                        the phone number and it came from 
                        student here by the name of Chad 
                        Wheeler.

                        Only time will tell if that’s 
                        actually the case. It should be 
                        mentioned that not just a day ago 
                        police were called into the school 
                        for an apparent weed smell in the 
                        hallway. The police were never able 
                        to find marijuana because the fire 
                        alarm went off.

                        I think it’s safe to say the school 
                        is in a bit of disarray. It’s 
                        extremely troubling that one day we 
                        have weed in the school and the 
                        next there is prank call from ISIS.

                        I think Principal Greene has done a 
                        wonderful job of keeping the school 
                        safe but lately it doesn’t feel 
                        that way.

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        I would like to apologize to our 
                        school community for the turbulent 
                        past couple of days. They are not a 
                        representation of our school. I am 
                        disappointed that this call was 
                        made, and doubly disappointed that 
                        one of our students would harbor – 
                        let alone express – such a hateful 
                        viewpoint. This isn’t who we are.

           Larry parks his car in front of Omar’s home. He looks to the

           Larry rings the doorbell. The door is immediately swung open 
           by Omar.

                        Why are you here, Larry? I told you 
                        I don’t want part in your scheming 
                        anymore.

                        There’s a clear way to take down 
                        Bridget but I need your help. 
                                 OMAR
                        Well you’re going to have to find 
                        something else. 

           Omar moves to close the door.

                        Wait... Omar, please. I’m going to 
                        be expelled. I overheard Principal 
                        Greene talking with Bridget. She 
                        has witnesses that confirm I pulled 
                        the fire alarm. She will expel me 
                        tomorrow.

                        Why should I care about that? It’s 
                        not my problem.

                        You know what people are saying 
                        online right now? They’re saying I 
                        was the one who made the call. I’m 
                        probably going to be interviewed by 
                        the FBI. This story is making 
                        national headlines and last thing I 
                        want is my dark skinned face 
                        blasted over CNN and Fox as a 
                        suspect when you and I both know 
                        you were the one to make that call.

                                 LARRY
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for that 
                        to happen.

                        But it did and now I have to deal 
                        with this.

                        I changed Bridget’s gym test. It 
                        will be a major blow to her GPA.

                                 LARRY
                        I had to. It was the only way out. 
                        Now when Bridget gets back the test 
                        tomorrow she’ll just get mommy to 
                        take care of it for her. We can’t 
                        have that again. Principal Greene 
                        has been her force field. She’s 
                        been protecting and advancing 
                        Bridget in every way. We need to 
                        take out Principal Greene first, 
                        then we can get to Bridget.

                        You can’t do that. It’s the last

                        Principal Greene has helped Bridget 
                        out academically but no one can 
                        prove it. We need evidence and 
                        there is something we can get to... 
                        her emails. She’s left a digital

                                 CNN REPORTER
                        What would you like to happen as 
                        result of emails becoming public. 

                                 LARRY
                        Oh I don’t think that’s up for me 
                        to decide I leave that to the 
                        school board. I’m just very sorry 
                        this all had to happen in my last 
                        week of high school. 
                                 CNN REPORTER
                        Do you know if you are in the 
                        running to be Valedictorian? 

                                 LARRY
                        I believe I am. Even with the 
                        actions taken against me I am very 
                        close to that. 

                                 CNN REPORTER
                        Do you think that Bridget should be 
                        disqualified to be your grades 
                        Valedictorian? 

                                 LARRY
                        It’s hard not to want that. 
                             (Larry and the reporter 
                              giggle)
                        If you read Principal Greene’s 
                        emails you’ll see that the system 
                        has been rigged against me. She 
                        actively campaigned against me. I 
                        think action needs to be taken but, 
                        again, that’s for the school board 
                        to decide. 

           EXT. SCHOOL ENTRACE - MORNING

           The school BOARD PRESIDENT (60’s) stands before reporters. 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT 
                        Good morning. I’m Wilber Kellog, 
                        president of the board for 
                        Harborfields High School. Given the 
                        news of the recently released 
                        emails by Principal Greene on our 
                        school twitter page earlier this 
                        morning the board has decided to 
                        let Principal Greene go.

                        Recently fired High School 
                        Principal, Helen Greene was 
                        arrested on charges of intimidation 
                        and charges of threatening 
                        government employees, that would be 
                        Bridget Greene’s teachers.

                        Apparently right before Greene was 
                        arrested she was deleting her past 
                        emails  off of the school server.

           Principal Greene, hands in cuffs, walks with a Police Man 
           holding her arm. Reporters hustle with her. 

                                 REPORTER #1 
                        Principal Greene, is it true you 
                        were deleting the emails in your 
                        office before the police arrived? 

                                 REPORTER #2 
                        Did you threaten and bribe teachers 
                        because you wanted your daughter to 
                        be Valedictorian?

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        This is all one big 
                        misunderstanding.  

                                 POLICE MAN
                        Please step back. 

           Principal Greene is put into the back of a police car. 

           EXT. SCHOOL ENTRACE - MORNING 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        We will also be investigating every 
                        teacher in the email exchanges with 
                        Ms. Greene to see if any wrongdoing 
                        occurred.

                        Mrs. Antretter, do you admit to 
                        changing Bridget’s grade in your 
                        class?

                        In the email exchange you had with 
                        Principal Greene, it mentions that 
                        you were having an affair with 
                        another teacher and performing 
                        sexual acts in the school, is this 
                        true?  

                                 MRS. ANTRETTER
                        Please, I have a class to teach.

           The board president takes questions. 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        And the school will also be 
                        monitored by local police under a 
                        24 hour surveillance for the final 
                        days of school after the prank ISIS 
                        call was made. I now open it up to 
                        questions.  

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Will Bridget Greene still be 
                        allowed to be the valedictorian? 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        As of now every student of the 
                        senior class is still in 
                        competition to be the 
                        valedictorian. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        What about Larry Fikus? His grades 
                        were lowered because of Principal 
                        Greene. 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        That has not been proven.  

                                 REPORTER #3
                        Who is the current valedictorian? 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        I cannot answer that because I 
                        don’t have that information.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 

           Larry walks down the hallway with sun glasses on. Girls eye 
           him. A JOCK comes up to him.  
                                 JOCK
                        Hey Larry, I’m rooting for ya. 

           Larry nods and “pounds it” with the guy. An attractive girl 
           bites her lip when Larry walks by. Other students whisper 
           while eyeing Larry. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 

           Larry puts a few books in his locker. Omar comes up to him. 

                                 OMAR
                        What did we do? 

                                 LARRY
                        Revealed the truth to the people. 
                        It’s a good thing.   

                                 OMAR
                        It’s a media circus. The video of 
                        Principal Greene being shoved in 
                        the police car -- it’s the second 
                        most trending video on Facebook.  

                                 LARRY
                        I saw that. 

                                 OMAR
                        They love you. You see there’s a 
                        Fikus for Valedictorian hashtag?
                             (beat)
                        There’s not a Sadaar for 
                        Valedictorian hashtag. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Don’t worry about the media. They 
                        come up with their own hero’s and 
                        villains. 

                                 OMAR
                        Well did you see the board will not 
                        take action against Bridget? She 
                        can still be the Valedictorian.  

                                 LARRY
                        Bridget will be blown away by the 
                        end of today. Believe me. 

           INT. GYM - DAY 

           Some students sign yearbooks, others are on their phones, and 
           a few people play basketball. 
           Larry sits on a bench watching a CNN video on his iPhone. The 
           video is the president of the PTA talking to the press. Her 
           title is under her on the screen.

                                 PTA PRESIDENT 
                        As president of the PTA council we 
                        endorse Larry Fikus to be the next 
                        Valedictorian of Harborfields High 
                        School. 

           There are cheers and some people clap. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Does your endorsement hold any 
                        weight in the choosing process?

                                 PTA PRESIDENT
                        No it does not but we felt the 
                        egregious actions taken by our 
                        former principal and her daughter 
                        should be stated. Larry is the only 
                        honest candidate.  

           Mr. Agostino stands in front of the room. He hold a thick 
           batch of scantrons in his hand. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        Carl Fagan!

           Carl walks to Agostino, who gives him his test. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO (CONT’D)
                        Larry Fikus! 

           Larry walks up, receives his test... perfect score. Larry 
           folds it and places it in his inside jacket pocket. 

                                 LARRY
                        Thank you Mr. Agostino for a 
                        wonderful four years. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        You’re welcome Larry. 

           Larry sits on the first row of the bleachers. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO (CONT’D)
                        Bridget Greene... Bridget Greene!

           Larry watches Bridget walking to the front of the room. He 
           sits really still like a dog waiting with dinner scraps. 

           Bridget is handed the test. Her expression changes. Larry’s 
           eyes light up. 
                                 BRIDGET 
                        Excuse me, Mr. Agostino there must 
                        be some kind of mistake here.  

                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        I checked it twice. That’s what you 
                        got... Holly Griffiths!

           Bridget opens her mouth to fire back but then swallows the 
           rage.  

                                 BRIDGET
                        Would you mind checking another 
                        time? 

           Larry slides in closer. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        Here’s a copy of the test with the 
                        correct answers, you can check 
                        yourself. 

           Mr. Agostino hands her the test, Bridget flips through it.  

                                 MR. AGOSTINO (CONT’D)
                        Lisa Harris! 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Mr. Agostino, I answered these 
                        questions correctly.  

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        We can talk about this after class. 

           Bridget steps aside. As a student gets her test Bridget cuts 
           in almost knocking her over.   

                                 BRIDGET
                        How could I get this wrong! I know 
                        that a score beyond the three point 
                        line is three points! It’s common 
                        sense. 

           Some students turn to the front of the room.

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        Bridget--

                                 BRIDGET
                        MR. AGOSTINO! I’ve never failed 
                        anything in my life! 

           Everyone is now looking to the mess in front of the room.
                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        Sit down and take a deep breath--

                                 BRIDGET
                        Basketball became an official 
                        Olympic event at the 1936 Summer 
                        Games in Berlin. It wasn't until 
                        the 1950s that the orange ball 
                        became the norm and for nine years, 
                        starting in 1967, slam dunks were 
                        illegal. Now was this on your test? 
                        No. Did you know any of that? No. 
                        Have I been the Harborfields point 
                        guard for four years in a row? Yes.
                             (beat)
                        I did not get these questions 
                        wrong. 

           Bridget turns to Larry.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Larry Fikus changed my test. 

           Larry gives a “Who me?” look. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO 
                        You are way out of line, I’m this 
                        close to giving you detention.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Are you not listening? Larry, did 
                        this. He’s trying to take me down 
                        as Valedictorian. He’s the one who 
                        should be getting detention. He 
                        should be expelled! 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        That’s it. Bridget get out. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Look at him! I know he did it. 

                                 MR. AGOSTINO
                        GET OUT!

           Bridget slams the door and exists.

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           Omar sits alone at the lunch table. Larry arrives and stands 
           across from him.  
                                 LARRY
                        It worked. Bridget failed the gym 
                        test. Had a meltdown in front of 
                        the class. 

                                 OMAR
                        Is she okay?

                                 LARRY
                        Stop that! We need to check her 
                        GPA.  

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY 

           Omar, using a laptop hacks into the school server. Larry 
           hunches over. They sit a a table in the far corner of the 
           room so no one can see what they’re doing.

                                 OMAR
                        Okay, we’re in. Bridget. Greene. 
                        Gotcha. 

           Larry moves in closer.  

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Her average... wow. You’re right. 
                        The gym test killed her. 

           Larry tries not to sound too excited. 

                                 LARRY
                        What is she at?! 

                                 OMAR
                        97.4. She dropped a point and a 
                        half. All her classes are locked in 
                        besides bio and she won’t beat me 
                        on that final. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m going to be valedictorian. 
                             (beat)
                        My moms going to be so proud... 

           Larry lets Omar have a moment with that realization. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to have a write a speech. 
                        I’m a terrible public speaker. 
                        You’re good at that stuff, maybe 
                        you can help me--
                                 LARRY
                             (soft)
                        Where am I?   

                                 OMAR
                        Oh yes, let me check... Okay... 
                        Larry Fikus. 
                             (beat)
                        Oh. 

                                 LARRY
                        What? 

                                 OMAR
                        Your average... it went down... 

                                 LARRY
                        That’s impossible. 

                                 OMAR
                        You’re at a 96.4. 

           Omar points to the screen...

                                 LARRY
                        WHAT. 

           People in the library are disturbed. Larry gets in front of 
           the computer.

                                 OMAR
                        It’s right there... your art class. 

           Drew points to the screen... 

           GENERAL ART... 65 

                                 LARRY
                        Maravel.

                                 DREW
                        I’m sure it’s a mistake. I mean, 
                        who gets a D in Maravel’s class? 
                        He’s the nicest guy. 

           Larry jolts up and exists the room. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Mr. Maravel holds a small blue piece of folded paper in front 
           of students who hold the folded pastel paper.  
                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Inside reverse fold the sides along 
                        the creases you just made and oh 
                        there you have the legs. There you 
                        go Trevor. Nice.  

           Larry peers into the room. He waits outside. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL (CONT’D)
                        Inside reverse fold again on the 
                        opposite side to make the head, 
                        then fold down the wings. Then 
                        voilà! Finished crane. Origami 101.

           The bell rings. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL (CONT’D)
                        Okay! Make sure to put your crane 
                        in your cubby so I can check it. 

           Students leave with their origami figures, all of varying 
           quality.

                                 STUDENT
                        Mr. Maravel, mine’s all lopsided. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        That’s okay Mikey, I saw that you 
                        tried. 

           The student exists, Larry enters.

                                 LARRY
                        Mr. Maravel. 

           Mr. Maravel turns... his sunny demeanor is dropped.   

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Oh. Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        I want to talk with you about my 
                        photo project. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL 
                        You will be getting it back today. 
                        We can talk then. 

           Larry steps forward. 

                                 LARRY
                        Why did I get a 65? 
                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        How do you know the grade?

                                 LARRY
                        When I handed it in last week you 
                        said “nice work.” Those were your 
                        words. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        I didn’t say that, Larry. Don’t 
                        lie. 

                                 LARRY
                        You’ve never given a D in your 
                        career here. What was it about my 
                        project?

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Your project showed no evidence of 
                        original thought. You chose 
                        something very easy and completed 
                        it with minimum effort.

           Larry steps towards Mr. Maravel.

                                 LARRY
                        Is this about you not being 
                        graduation speaker? 

           There is a pause. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        Don’t feel bad, Larry. A lot of 
                        people have no talent. 

                                 LARRY
                        I will report you. 

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        I know you cut a deal with 
                        Incorvaia.

                                 LARRY
                        What do you want?

           Mr. Maravel laughs, takes a breath, then...

                                 MR. MARAVEL
                        You know Larry when I was in high 
                        school, I had this American history 
                        teacher... Mr. Kramer. He was 
                        everyone’s favorite teacher. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. MARAVEL (CONT'D)
                        Great personality, commanded the 
                        room, you could feel the passion he 
                        had for his subject. Mr. Kramer 
                        inspired me to be a teacher, only 
                        in a subject more personal... Art.  
                        I wanted to make the same impact on 
                        my students as he did for his. I 
                        worked hard, to make things 
                        entertaining so students would be 
                        engaged in the lesson and take 
                        something from it. Some graduates, 
                        they come back for a visit but 
                        eventually... they all disappear. 
                        Eventually... no one remembers my 
                        class. It fades away.  
                             (beat)
                        They see me as an easy A, a break 
                        where they don’t have to work hard. 
                        After forty two years of teaching I 
                        tell the school I’m retiring... 
                        they promise me I’ll be the 
                        graduation speaker. 
                             (beat)
                        The graduation speaker! This is my 
                        opportunity. Here’s where I make my 
                        impact. I wrote a wonderful speech, 
                        rehearsed it. Perfected it. 
                             (beat)
                        You took that away from me... But I 
                        think-I think it was a blessing in 
                        disguise because no matter how 
                        brilliant my speech would have 
                        been... it would eventually fade in 
                        the audience’s memory. I know that. 
                        But do you know what won’t fade? 

           Mr. Maravel gets in Larry’s face.

                                 MR. MARAVEL (CONT’D)
                        Your memory of me. You won’t forget 
                        me Larry because I’ll be the one 
                        who blocked you from being 
                        Valedictorian.... 

           Larry steps back.

                                 MR. MARAVEL (CONT’D)
                        And I know you’ll keep that with 
                        you for the rest of your life. 

           Larry doesn’t respond, he knows he’s fucked. 
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

           Larry, sweating and breathing heavy, barges into a stall. 
           Vomit. Coughing. More vomit. He lays on the ground... He lets 
           out a whimper.   

           KNOCK. KNOCK. 

           Larry checks to see the locked door. 

           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

           Larry closes his eyes.  

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Larry shuffles to his locker. Eyes watery and face red. He 
           tries to hide his face... people notice. He opens his locker 
           and puts his books into his briefcase. Omar comes up to him.

                                 OMAR
                        Are you okay? 

           Larry closes his locker. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Did you really get a 65 on the art 
                        project?

                                 LARRY
                             (screaming)
                        YES! 

           A few students turn. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s over. It’s over.   

                                 OMAR
                        Wait! It doesn’t have to be. There 
                        is a way...

           Larry turns. 

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        You can still move up. I mean... 
                        it’s a slim chance but not 
                        impossible. 

                                 LARRY
                        What are you talking about? 
                                 OMAR
                        The bio final tomorrow, If you ace 
                        it and Bridget gets below a 85... 
                        then you become salutatorian. 

                                 LARRY
                        She’s not going to get below a 85. 

                                 OMAR
                        She could. Mr. Ellick didn’t budge 
                        when Principal Greene tried to 
                        bribe him to help Bridget so she’s  
                        been cheating off me all year. It 
                        won’t happen this time.  

                                 LARRY
                             (new energy)
                        You’re sure of this? 

                                 OMAR
                        It’s her Achilles heel. 
                        My advise, go to the extra help 
                        session after school. 

           INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - AFTERNOON 

           Students fill the classroom, every seat is taken. Dozens 
           stand in the back with notebooks in hand. 

           Larry enters, he sees Bridget sitting in the front row. He 
           finds a spot in the back next to the Black Mamba tank.  

           Mr. Ellick address the class... 

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                        Okay here’s how this goes, I will 
                        tell you the major concepts on the 
                        test. 

           Mr. Ellick flips through a packet, it’s SALMON COLORED. 
           Students furiously write down, Larry included. 

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        The topics are... Characteristics 
                        of Water... Characteristics of 
                        Carbon... Macromolecules... and The 
                        Cell Cycle.

                                 LARRY 
                        Oh, that’s not bad--
                                 MR. ELLICK
                        Chromosomal Inheritance... 
                        Molecular Inheritance... Origins of 
                        Eukaryotic Diversity... 
                        Prokaryotes... 

           Larry’s eye’s widen, he misspells everything. 

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Animal Evolution... Invertebrate 
                        Animals... Vertebrate Animals... 
                        Animal Nutrition... Chemical 
                        Signaling in Animals... Animal

                        Development... Animal Behavior... 
                        and... Fungi.    

           Students nod. Larry looks to the Black Mamba coiled up.  

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Now I’ll ask some questions similar 
                        to what you’ll see on the test 
                        tomorrow. I’ll start off very 
                        easy... In DNA replication, the 
                        role of DNA polymerase is to...

                                 LARRY
                        What the fuck did he say? Poly 
                        what?

                                 MR. ELLICK
                        a. Bring two separate strands back 
                        together after new ones are formed 
                        b. Join the RNA nucleotides 
                        together to make the primer
                        c. Build a new strand from 5` to 3`
                        d. Unwind the tightly would helix
                        e. Join the Okazaki fragments

                                 STUDENT  
                        Is it C?

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                        That’s correct. 

                                 STUDENT
                        Is that the test?

                                 MR. ELLICK 
                             (smiling)
                        Could be...

           Larry zero’s in on the test. 
                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Next question... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Students exit the room.

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        I will see you tomorrow. Study 
                        hard, get a good night sleep. 

           A few students talk with Mr. Ellick. Larry eyes the SALMON 
           COLORED TEST on the desk. He slowly walks toward it. The 
           packet is flipped to the back side. 

           Larry reads... 

           There’s a diagram of a Black Mamba with lines next to 
           different parts of the body. 

           Please write the proper name of each of the Black Mamba’s 
           body parts. Larry pulls out his cell phone... 

           TAKES A PICTURE.

                                 MR. ELLICK (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Fikus, are you looking at the 
                        test? 

           Mr. Ellick picks up the test. 

                                 LARRY
                        No, no sir. 

                                 MR. ELLICK
                        You’ll be leaving now. 

           Larry exists. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Larry peers through the door to see Mr. Ellick put the Black 
           Mamba tank aquarium in a closet. He also puts the salmon 
           colored test in the closet too. As Mr. Ellick moves to the 
           door, Larry springs behind a wall.

           Mr. Ellick passes by... He whistles... Mr. Ellick turns a 
           corner. Larry waits until the whistling becomes faint. 

           Larry goes to the door... LOCKED. 

                                 BRIDGET 
                        Locked.  
           Larry turns around... Bridget Greene. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        No way in there. Believe me, I’ve 
                        tried. 

           Bridget walks to Larry. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        You still think you have a chance. 

           There is a silence. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Well, mathematically it’s possible. 
                        You get a 100 and I get a 85 
                        then... we switch spots but both 
                        you and I know that’s not going to 
                        happen. 

           Bridget takes out a... SALMON COLORED PACKET. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        I have the test. 
                             (beat)
                        You want it?

           Larry eyes are on the test. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do you want, Bridget? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Right now Omar is number one but if 
                        he is... expelled... you and I move 
                        up. I will be Valedictorian you 
                        will be... Salutatorian. 

           Larry sneers. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        It’s your best option. We can take 
                        down Omar but I need your help. 

                                 LARRY
                        What do you need me to do? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Tomorrow morning you go into 
                        Principal Howard’s office. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGET (CONT'D)
                        You tell him you saw Omar slam me 
                        against a locker, there was a 
                        heated discussion, you couldn’t 
                        hear what but before Omar stormed 
                        off he slapped me. I fell to the 
                        floor, crying. You went over to 
                        help but I begged you not to tell 
                        anyone.
                             (beat)
                        Got it?

           Larry sighs. 

                                 LARRY
                        I’ll do it. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Good. 

           The two shake hands. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        You know, Larry...

           She leans in, whispering seductively in Larry’s ear. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        I always thought we were better 
                        together. 

           Bridget exists. Larry flips through the test. A police 
           officer approaches Larry.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Hey, Lar I gotta kick you out. The 
                        building is closed. 

                                 LARRY
                        Oh, of course. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        And just between you and me. Man to 
                        man, I think you should be up there 
                        giving that Valedictorian address 
                        graduation day. Bridget don’t 
                        deserve that. 

                                 LARRY
                        Thanks Mike. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        No problem. Have a good night. 
           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

           It’s pouring. Thunder strikes. Larry runs to his car, 
           covering the test in his jacket. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS  

           Larry gets in. He opens up the test, smiling. He goes through 
           the questions. He flips to the back of the test. There is a 
           diagram of a cell with lines next to different parts of the 
           body... 

           Please write the proper name of each of the Cell’s parts. 

           Larry is confused. He takes out his cell phone, refers to the 
           picture he took of the test of the... Black Mamba diagram. 

           He looks but to the test. He flips through, ripping off 
           pages... No Black Mamba. 

                                 LARRY
                        Bitch... FUCK. 

           He punches his car. Thunder strikes. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

           The car moves a little as Larry has a tantrum. He gets out of 
           the car and runs to the school... The door is locked. He 
           moves to the second door... Locked. The third door... locked.

           He looks around to see a JANITOR throwing out bags of trash 
           into a trash can outside. Larry sneaks over. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Larry walks against the wall of the school so he’s unseen. 
           The janitor goes inside to grab a bag of trash and then walk 
           over to the trash can. When he goes in for the second time 
           Larry walks in behind him. 

           INT. JANITOR’S AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Larry enters, he’s soaked. The janitor grabs the bag and as 
           he turns Larry does too in a sly way. He makes for the 
           hallway. 
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Larry hides in the doorway alcove as a Police Officer walks 
           by whistling. When he walks by Larry comes out, however, his 
           sneakers, very wet, squeak on the floor. The officer turns 
           around to see... nothing.  

           INT. JANITOR’S AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Larry hides behind the door. He takes his shoes off. The 
           officer opens up the door.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Hey Frank, you almost done. 

                                 JANITOR 
                        You want to help? 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Yeah right. 

           Larry goes behind the officer and enters the hallway again. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Larry walks briskly with his socks on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Larry walks up stairs and sees the door to the Biology Class. 

           A CUSTODIAN riding a floor cleaning machine circles around 
           and Larry ducks to the stairwell so he’s unseen. When the 
           custodian drives by Larry sees he has headphones on and sings 
           to his music. His keys are on the side of his pants.  

           Larry comes out and walks behind the cleaning machine. He 
           reaches for the keys and misses. He almost trips. He tries 
           again and this time he unlatches them from the custodians 
           pants. Larry still walks to keep up with the cleaning 
           machine. As it turns to the biology door Larry moves to it. 

           There are countless keys on the chain. Larry tries one... 
           doesn’t work. He tries another... doesn’t fit. Larry looks 
           behind him... the cleaning machine is about to make a turn... 
           he tries one more key... it works. 

           INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           The door creaks open... 
           THUNDER. 

           Larry enters, a dark silhouette. He closes the door. A sliver 
           of light comes from out of the closet. A noise comes out from 
           there too. Larry slowly walks over. 

           Larry peers in through the closet window... 

           BRIDGET GREENE. 

           She kneels looking through the test. Larry takes a moment 
           before... 

           SWINGING the door open. Bridget yelps. Larry towers over her. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Larry! 

           THUNDER. Larry towers over her. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        What now...

           Next to the door is the... Black Mamba in an aquarium. The 
           snake raises to make eye contact with Larry. Larry looks back 
           to Bridget.  

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        No...

           Larry pushes the aquarium off the self. Glass SHATTERS 
           everywhere. Larry slams the door shut. 

           The Black Mamba slithers toward Bridget. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        HELP! HELP! 

           SCREAMS. THUNDER.  

           Bridget tries to get up but slips on the glass. The snake 
           slithers over to her, THE MOUTH OPENS.  

           Bridget wails. 

           Larry eyes light up.

           The snake lashes. BITE. 

           The fangs grip to Bridget’s thigh. BLOOD DRIPS. She flails 
           her leg. The snake is hoisted up in the air... lands on 
           Bridget’s lap. 
           LASH. BITE. Fangs on Bridget’s neck. She jolts back... 
           THWACK.  Her head hits against the wall. She falls forward... 

           CHOKING. EYES BULGING. Her skins turns red. She’s stops 
           moving but continues to choke. 

           FOAM comes out of her mouth. Bridget twitches until 
           finally...

           GONE... still clutches onto the test. 

           The snake slithers off. 

           Larry looks to his hands. With his tie he rubs off the door 
           handle and all the other areas he’s touched.  

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Larry creeps out of the classroom.

           The custodian sings along to his songs with his head phones 
           in. Larry locks the bio class door. Larry puts the keys back 
           on the custodian’s pants and exists.  

           INT. JANITOR’S AREA - NIGHT

           Larry puts his shoes back on. He opens the door. It’s still 
           pouring rain. He leaves. 

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Larry runs to his car, getting drenched.  

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

           TITLE CARD: FRIDAY 

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Larry drives in to see pandemonium. COP CARS. NEWS VANS. 
           AMBULANCES. Students and faculty weep. The flag is at half 
           mast. Paramedics bring out a stretcher with a BODY BAG. 

           A cop holds Mr. Ellick in hand cuffs and puts him in a police 
           car. Mr. Ellick sobs. Larry gets out of the car with his 
           briefcase and walks past a CNN news reporter. 
                                 CNN REPORTER
                        Academic pressure turns deadly. 
                        Harborfields High School student 
                        Bridget Greene has been found dead 
                        this morning. Paramedics are 
                        telling us the cause of death was 
                        from venomous snake bites from a 
                        Black Mamba used for instructional 
                        purposes by Doug Ellick, a biology 
                        teacher, who has been arrested. 
                        Bridget and the snake were found in 
                        the biology classroom where Police 
                        are telling us she broke into to 
                        steal her Biology final. This is 
                        just one day after her mother Helen 
                        Greene was fired as the Principal 
                        of this school-- Larry...

           The reporter turns to Larry. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Larry, can we get a response from 
                        you?

           Other reporters from major news company see Larry and swarm 
           to him. 

                                 FOX NEWS REPORTER
                        Larry can we get a statement? 

                                 MSNBC REPORTER
                        What’s your reaction to this? 

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 

           Students mourn the loss of Bridget. Omar is quiet in the 
           corner of the room. Larry sits next to him. 

                                 OMAR
                        Can you believe it? You know she 
                        was found with the test in her 
                        hands?

                                 LARRY
                        I know.  

                                 OMAR
                        Well... your plan worked out. 
                        You’re the Salutatorian and I’m the 
                        Valedictorian. 

                                 LARRY
                        I will be Valedictorian. 
                                 OMAR
                        What? The numbers--

                                 LARRY
                        When your mom got sick two years 
                        ago you moved. You moved outside 
                        the district but still attended 
                        Harborfields. Legally you should 
                        have went to Eastwood. 
                             (beat)
                        Your parents are subject to major 
                        tax penalties and criminal charges 
                        of falsifying documents.

           Omar stares down Larry. 

                                 OMAR
                        Fuck. You. 

                                 LARRY
                        I don’t want to make this harder 
                        than it is. Take the Bio final as 
                        you normally would but write my 
                        name at the top and I’ll write 
                        yours on the test I take. I know 
                        you’ll get an A. Do that so I don’t 
                        have to report you to the New York 
                        State Department of Taxation and 
                        Finance.    

           There is a pause. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Do this for your own sake. The 
                        public won’t take it kindly when 
                        they find out the Muslim 
                        Valedictorian, they so secretly 
                        resent, wasn’t paying his fair 
                        share.

                                 OMAR
                        You killed Bridget.  

                                 LARRY 
                        Do we have a deal? 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Larry gets out of his car in cap and gown. Media vans 
           surround the area. A few reporters run to Larry. 
                                 MSNBC REPORTER
                        Larry, can we get a comment from 
                        you?

                                 LARRY 
                        Sure Jan. 
                             (beat)
                        I wasn’t suppose to be 
                        Valedictorian... Bridget was. I 
                        will be deferring the Jacob Newman 
                        Scholarship money I receive today 
                        towards a memoriam for her, here at 
                        Harborfields so the memory of 
                        Bridget will live on for 
                        generations to come...

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY 

           All of the major news outlets film the graduation ceremony. 
           The senior class sits on a field in cap and gown, their 
           parents and loved ones sit in the bleachers. 

                                 BOARD PRESIDENT
                        And now the Valedictorian address. 
                        May I present Larry Fikus... 

           The crowd goes wild. 

           Larry Fikus stands holding his speech, he walks to a podium. 
           Mr. Maravel, Mr. Incorvia, Mr. Baltricitus, Julio, and Omar 
           all watch him walk by. 

           INT. PRISON CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Principal Greene, looking like she hasn’t slept in a year, 
           watches Larry get to the podium with dozens of microphones 
           including CNN, FOX, MSNBC on the prison TV. 

                                 PRINCIPAL GREENE
                        Turn this off!

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Assorted flowers surround Bridget Greene’s senior photo next 
           to the podium. Larry lays out his speech then looks up to his 
           audience who is stands cheering for him.  

           Camera’s flash. He looks presidential.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
