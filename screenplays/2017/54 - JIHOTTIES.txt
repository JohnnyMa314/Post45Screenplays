          The Gotham Group
                           This is a wildly fictionalized story 
                             based on completely true events. 
           EXT. RAQQA, SYRIA 

           A dusty, rundown TOWN SQUARE. 

           BULLET HOLES and GRAFFITI litter every surface.  

           BEHEADED CORPSES swing from a distant overpass.

           A TOYOTA PICK-UP filled with ISIS FIGHTERS waving ASSAULT 
           RIFFLES and BLACK DAESH FLAGS speeds by.

           This is ISIS COUNTRY. Hell on earth. No place for a lady.  

           The camera focuses on a WOMAN IN A BURQA, hustling through 
           the crowded square, subtly texting on an OLD FLIP PHONE. 

           EXT. BAZAAR, RAQQA - CONTINUOUS

           A chaotic afternoon at the marketplace, VILLAGERS packed 
           asses-to-elbows into every inch of available space. 

           HEMSWORTH -- a natively dressed Navy Seal, sexy AF -- cuts 
           briskly through the sea of shoppers. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                             (to the phone)
                        Come on, Claudia. You can do this. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN BURQA’D WOMAN AND HEMSWORTH

           The Woman In A Burqa (AKA CLAUDIA) arrives at a dehydrated 
           FOUNTAIN -- she circles it -- sits above a PLAQUE. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Come on, Hemsworth. Don’t fuck me.  

           Dodging aggressive street vendors, Hemsworth presses forward. 

           Claudia adjusts the endless folds of her burqa, nods 
           submissively at MEN nearby.  

           Hemsworth checks the time, breaks into a seductive jog. 

           A handful of SCARY DUDES emerge from surrounding buildings, 
           hone in on Hemsworth. Sensing their presence, Hemsworth ducks 
           into a KIOSK. 

           With a sleight of hand, Claudia transfers a PALM-SIZED 
           PACKAGE from the layers of her burqa to a CRANNY BEHIND A 
           ROCK in the fountain’s foundation. She quickly gets back on 
           the move, pulls out her cell. 

           Hemsworth’s cell DINGS with a text. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           CLOSE ON PHONE, the text from Claudia: THE PRIUS IS PARKED. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        Good girl! 

           Hemsworth exits the kiosk, jumps on the back of a PASSING  
           VAN -- 

           -- HOPS OFF at the fountain. He makes a beeline for the seat 
           the Burqa’d Woman just left -- he sits -- and covertly 
           retrieves the PACKAGE. 

           As he stands, the SCARY DUDES surround him. Motherfuck! 

                                 SCARY DUDE
                        Hand it over. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        Hand what over? 

                                 SCARY DUDE
                        Do it or I’ll murder you where you 
                        stand.

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        Good luck with that.   

           The Scary Dude lunges forward. Hemsworth swiftly seizes him 
           by the arm, flips him onto his back, straddles him -- THREE 
           QUICK JABS -- A BACK-HANDED STRIKE -- A BLOW TO THE THROAT. 
           The Scary Dude is OUT. 

           One down, six to go. 

           Two SCARY DUDES step-up on either side of Hemsworth --  

           BOOM! CRACK! 

           He knocks ‘em out cold with a ferocity reserved for evil. 

                                 HEMSWORTH (CONT’D)
                        Which one of you ladies wants the 
                        next dance?  

           The remaining Scary Dudes come at him, hungry for blood. 

           With a SWEEPING KICK, Hemsworth knocks them over like bowling 
           pins -- QUICK, PUNISHING PUNCHES -- HEADS SLAMMED INTO THE 
           GROUND -- NECKS SNAPPED -- THROAT SLIT -- he finishes them 
           off. 

           The townspeople don’t even flinch. 

           Hemsworth dusts himself off, heads out. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HEMSWORTH (CONT’D)
                        Peace out, Syria. 

           But he’s a hot white dude in a corrupt Middle Eastern world. 
           In seconds, Toyotas carrying ISIS FIGHTERS ambush him on all 
           sides. 

           ZAHEED -- a cranky, Middle Eastern Danny DeVito -- jumps from 
           a truck, saunters up to Hemsworth.  

                                 ZAHEED
                        My friend, I fear you’ve involved 
                        yourself in business that isn’t 
                        yours.  

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        I could say the same about you. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Search him! 

           The ISIS Fighters quickly locate the package -- 

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        Seize this filthy animal. 

           -- and throw Hemsworth into the back of their pick-up, peel 
           out, Hazzard County-style.   

           INT. ISIS COMPOUND - LATER

           A crude, cement warehouse. 

           In one corner, a ransom video production unit: FLOOD LIGHTS, 
           ISIS FLAG, TODAY’S NEWSPAPER, CUE CARDS. 

           In another, a WALL OF COMPUTERS manned by a crew of YOUNG 
           ISIS FIGHTERS trolling TWITTER, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM. 

           Zaheed and his guys shove Hemsworth inside, handcuff him to a 
           chair. Opposite him is Claudia, HANDCUFFED and beaten to 
           shit. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Beautiful, well-built woman, why 
                        would you tempt death like this? 

           Tears fall from the Claudia’s eyes. She knows she’s fucked. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Please don’t kill me. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 ZAHEED
                        Stop trying to manipulate me with 
                        your graceful tears or I‘ll give 
                        you something to cry about. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        She’s innocent. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        All women are guilty of something. 
                        They’re cheats and liars disguised 
                        as flowers. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        True, but she doesn’t deserve to 
                        die. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I really don’t. 

                                 HEMSWORTH
                        We both know she got caught in a 
                        shitty situation and did what she 
                        had to do to survive. Let her go 
                        and our government-

           POP! POP! POP!  

           Hemsworth’s bullet-riddled body falls to the floor. Claudia 
           FREAKS. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You didn’t even let him finish his 
                        sentence! 

                                 ZAHEED
                        HE’S CIA, YOU DUMB SLAG. He doesn’t 
                        get to finish his sentence. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        But-

                                 ZAHEED
                        But nothing. 
                             (to the ISIS guys)
                        Take her to ‘the hole’.
                             (to himself)
                        Even though part of me just wants 
                        to sit here and stare into the 
                        ocean that is her eyes.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        NO! Please, no! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The ISIS Fighters drag her away. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The cell’s low-rent OPERATIONAL HEADQUARTERS -- maps canvas 
           the walls, a busted conference table with mismatched chairs, 
           clutter the room.     

           Zaheed kicks open the door -- ANOTHER BURQA’D WOMAN stands 
           with her back to him, studying the maps. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        The situation has been handled. 

                                 ANOTHER BURQA’D WOMAN 
                        And the girl? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        In ‘the hole.’ 

                                 ANOTHER BURQA’D WOMAN
                        Excellent. 

           Just then, a GUST OF WIND blows the windows open -- 

           -- the folds of the Woman’s burqa whip and twirl bewitchingly 
           around her as she turns to face Zaheed --  

           -- Beyoncé’s “Bow Down” mysteriously fills the room --

           It’s THE VIPER. The Baddest Bitch in Town. So damn fine she 
           wears her burqa like a ball gown. With the GOLD PLATED AK-47 
           slung over her shoulder, her looks actually could kill.   

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Any woman who crosses me will beg 
                        for death by the time I’m done with 
                        her. 

           A snake HISSES wildly in the distance.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE, NYC - SUNSET

           A chaotic evening at the corner of 46th and Broadway, 
           TOURISTS packed asses-to-elbows into every inch of available 
           sidewalk space. 

           LUCY -- 27, a sweet, slightly neurotic, hopeless romantic -- 
           cuts briskly through the sea of pedestrians. 

           Her cell DINGS with a text.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                             (to herself)
                        You better not cancel on me, 
                        motherfucker.  

           CLOSE ON PHONE, text from MY FUTURE HUSBAND: Runnin’ late. 
           See u in a sec. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Ugh. 

           Dodging aggressive HOT DOG VENDORS, Lucy presses forward. 

           CLOSE ON PHONE, Lucy types: Clearing out my bank account for 
           Hamilton tix with my future husband. Smart or Not Smart? 

           THEA texts back: True love has no price tag. However, the 
           cost of getting TamPots up and running does :(

           Lucy types: We’ve gotta find you $$! The world needs TAM-
           POTS! 

           Lucy’s FACETIME rings. It’s Thea. 

           INTERCUT LUCY AND THEA 

           THEA -- 27, an overconfident tomboy with sass for days -- 
           sits in her apartment. TAMPON APPLICATORS, PLASTIC WRAP, and 
           WEED sit scattered on the floor beside her. 

           She seals a TAMPON SHAPED BALL OF WEED in plastic wrap with a 
           LIGHTER. 

                                 THEA
                        I found a special plastic wrap in 
                        Chinatown today that can preserve a 
                        dead body up to a week.  

                                 LUCY
                        If it’s good enough for corpses 
                        it’s good enough for TamPots! 

           On her laptop, Thea clicks from the TAMPOTS website to her 
           MINT.COM homepage. Her finances are in the RED.  

                                 THEA
                        Can you think of a way to raise 
                        $1,326 to cover my start-up costs 
                        that doesn’t involve hooking, 
                        temping or hitting up my parents?   

                                 LUCY
                        Unfortunately, I cannot. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Dammit. 

           EXT. 46TH STREET, NYC

           Lucy checks the time, breaks into a seductive jog towards the 
           RICHARD ROGERS THEATER. 

           Her phone DINGS with a text. 

           CLOSE ON PHONE, a text from MY FUTURE HUSBAND: Here!

                                 LUCY
                        Gotta go! True love awaits! 

                                 THEA
                        If you end up back at his place, 
                        drop a pin so I know where you are 
                        in case he’s a skin-wearing 
                        murderer.

                                 LUCY
                        Will do. 

           They both KISS at their phone screens, hang-up.  

           Anxious and excited, Lucy scans the crowd. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Be cool, Lucy. The rest of your 
                        life is about to begin.  

           Just then, NICHOLAS -- 13, a scrappy, fast-talking ginger -- 
           comes up behind Lucy, EYE-FUCKS her. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Ooooh, yeah. Daddy like.  

                                 LUCY
                        Keep it moving, perv. I’ve got 
                        adult business to attend to.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        You’re actually way hotter than 
                        your profile pic. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry, what? 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        It’s rare a solid 7 doesn’t use a 
                        filter to cheat her way to a low 9.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        Oh, no, no, no...

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Oh, yes, yes, yes. 

                                 LUCY
                        You’re Nicholas? 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        The one and only. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’ve been emailing, G-chatting, 
                        texting, and talking with a 12 year-
                        old the past three months? 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        I’m 13. 

                                 LUCY
                        You look 25 in your photos. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Thanks to the magic of questionable 
                        angles and terrible lighting. 

                                 LUCY
                             (whispering)
                        We sext’d! 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Relax, I haven’t sext’d with anyone 
                        else since we met. 

                                 LUCY
                        Your parents could probably sue me 
                        for some kind of statutory text 
                        rape.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Like I have the type of parents who 
                        care about that kind of thing?   

                                 LUCY
                        Dammit. 
                             (then)
                        Dammit. Dammit. Dammit. 
                             (then)
                        You either pay me for this ticket 
                        right now or I’m scalping it.  

                                 NICHOLAS
                        You said it was ‘your treat’! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, back when I thought we were 
                        gonna live happily ever after. 
                             (yelling to the crowd)
                        Anyone looking to buy a ticket?!? 
                        Mezzanine, third row, center.

           A bunch of peoples’ hands SHOOT UP. 

                                 CROWD
                        ME! / OMG! / YES! / TOTALLY! / YES!

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Alright, alright, alright. How 
                        much? 

                                 LUCY 
                        $583.

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Jesus, woman. You made of Benjamins 
                        or what? 

                                 LUCY
                             (to crowd)
                        I’m just looking for face value!

           Nicholas whips out his phone. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        I’m Venmo’ing you what’s left of my 
                        bar mitvah money as we speak! 

           Lucy waits until the PAID NOTIFICATION flashes on her phone. 
           She hands him his ticket. 

                                 NICHOLAS (CONT’D)
                        Now, let’s chill you out with a 
                        couple chardonnays My treat. Well, 
                        I’ll give you the money, but you 
                        have to buy them.

           She rolls her eyes as she follows him inside. 

           INT. LUCY AND THEA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A teeny two-bedroom trapped in post-college adolescence. 
           Knickknacks, souvenirs and photos of Lucy and Thea’s decades 
           long friendship fill every surface. 

           Lucy and Thea sit on opposite ends of their couch, legs 
           intertwined, talking, sharing a DOOB. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        You got catfished, dude! 

                                 LUCY
                        No!!! Wait, what? 

                                 THEA
                        When someone emotionally 
                        manipulates you via fake social 
                        media? Duh. 

                                 LUCY
                        I thought catfishing was when you 
                        hooked up with a trash person 
                        because catfish are like, bottom-
                        feeders.  

                                 THEA
                        I see your logic, but alas. It’s 
                        much more devious than thus. 

                                 LUCY
                        Man, I was so stoked at the 
                        prospect of finally bringing a man 
                        friend to our annual Night Before 
                        Thanksgiving Party back home. 

                                 THEA
                        I can’t even with that right now. 
                        The idea of facing those 
                        suburbanites with Sky Miles and 
                        savings accounts makes me want to 
                        die. 

                                 LUCY
                        Trying to be an adult is the worst. 

                                 THEA
                        It’s like being trapped in 
                        Groundhogs Day - without Bill 
                        Murray.  
                             (then)
                        You wanna go get fucked up? 

                                 LUCY
                        Have we met? 

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS: 

           - They empty GATORADE, LA CROIX, SPRITE, WHITE WINE and VODKA 
           into a PITCHER. 

           - They shake it, divide it into GIANT BEER STEINS.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           - They toast, CHUG IT.  

           - They’re profoundly fucked-up. 

                                 THEA
                        We need to go on a Money Diet. 

                                 LUCY
                        Like, all we eat is coins?    

                                 THEA
                        No. Like, you know how we’re trying 
                        to be more conscious of what we put 
                        in our bodies? 

                                 LUCY
                        I haven’t had cheese in four days 
                        which is basically proof God 
                        exists.  

                                 THEA
                        Good girl. It’s terrible for your 
                        long term digestive health. Ditto 
                        with our funds. We need to be more 
                        conscious of both our spending AND 
                        saving. 

                                 LUCY
                        I like that you think I have 
                        savings.

                                 THEA
                        We need to creatively generate more 
                        funds and then not spend them all. 
                        It’s a two-pronged approach. 

                                 LUCY
                        How do we engage on such an 
                        ambitious journey-

                                 THEA
                        I never thought you’d ask.

           GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN’ MONTAGE

           MUSIC CUE: “Hustlin’” by Rick Ross 

           After each hustle, they put the $$ they earn/would’ve spent 
           into an ALMOND MILK CARTON via the SPOUT. 

           - AT A DONUT SHOP. Lucy “accidentally” spills HOT COFFEE on 
           Thea. Thea LOSES HER SHIT. The OWNER gives them BOXES of 
           DONUTS to calm her. They walk over to the SUBWAY entrance and 
           SELL the donuts to commuters. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           - AT A DUMPSTER. They CLIMB IN, pick out RECYCLABLES like 
           homeless people, take to a RECYCLING CENTER, pocket the CASH. 

           - RETIREMENT HOME. They babysit old people and steal money 
           from their PURSES/WALLETS/CHANGE DISHES.

           - A KISSING BOOTH IN TIMES SQUARE. They dole out quick PECKS. 
           Then, Lucy gives a sweet, long CLOSED-MOUTH KISS to a cute 
           guy. Thea MACKS HARD with some Eurotrash as she PICK-POCKETS 
           him. 

           A few days later, they excitedly huddle around their Almond 
           Milk Bank. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        I must say, I’m way proud of us. 

                                 LUCY
                        We just solved our financial crisis 
                        like a couple of bosses. 

                                 THEA
                        Ready? 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        As I’ll ever be. 

           Thea rips open the bank -- LOOSE CHANGE and FOLDED UP PIECES 
           OF PAPER tumble out.  

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s all the money? 

                                 THEA
                        I might’ve pulled it all out with 
                        tiny tweezers to pay for our take-
                        out. 

           Lucy unfolds a TINY FOLDED-UP PAPER.  

                                 LUCY
                        And replaced it with Soul Cycle 
                        coupons? 

                                 THEA
                        They’re worth like $48 a piece.  

                                 LUCY
                        Dammit! Those mean nothing to 
                        someone with my complete lack of 
                        cardiovascular endurance. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Please don’t be mad!  

                                 LUCY
                        I’m not. I’m just disappointed. I 
                        thought we were on the fast track 
                        to making our dream come true. 

                                 THEA
                        Me, too buddy. Me, too. 
                             (then)
                        Wanna get fucked up? 

                                 LUCY
                        Have we met? 

           Back in their usual position on the couch, they pass a BONG 
           and CHINESE LEFTOVERS between them, watching a rerun of LAST 
           WEEK TONIGHT with JOHN OLIVER.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What if no one ever loves me? 

                                 THEA
                        What if I never become a female 
                        tycoon? 

           Depressed, they turn their attention towards the TV.  

           ON SCREEN, A LAST WEEK TONIGHT with JOHN OLIVER SEGMENT --

                                 MALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Three young Chechen women have 
                        apparently had more success 
                        battling ISL fighters than some 
                        fighting forces. They swindled 
                        fighters out of thousands of 
                        dollars.

                                 FEMALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The trio made fighters believe 
                        they’d be their brides. The plot 
                        went like this; The girls would 
                        meet ISL recruiters online and tell 
                        them they had no money to travel 
                        from Chechnya to Syria. That’s when 
                        ISL offered to send them funds.  

                                 JOHN OLIVER (O.S.)
                        Holy shit! They catfished ISIS. 
                        And, it just goes to show, forget 
                        the CIA.

                        There are no more intimidating sci-
                        ops masterminds in the world of 
                        warfare than scheming teenage 
                        girls. 

           Thea grabs the remote, turns the sound up.

                        ISIS is like the Taliban but 
                        instead of Jesus clothes they wear 
                        GI Joe clothes.

                        I feel confident I’ve got their 
                        virtual dicks wet enough to go for 
                        the gold.

           but no fund$ for religious texts. Super bummer :(

                             (to Dhakir)
                        Brother, may you authorize funds 
                        for a copy of the Qu’ran and other 
                        religious texts for these magical 
                        creatures?

                        Why didn’t we think of this before? 

                                 LUCY
                        Because I didn’t know what 
                        catfishing was?

                        What? 

           Lucy shows her the pic.

                        Oh, I’ve already got like twelve of 
                        those. It must be the Middle

                        Bleed those suckers dry. The minute 
                        they get aggressive, ghost ‘em and 
                        set up a new profile. Capicé?  

                                 LUCY
                        I just wanna say, this is the exact 
                        amount of danger I’m comfortable 
                        with.

           - At WORK, on the SUBWAY, in line at DUANE READE, on the  
           TOILET, the girls message with ISIS.  

           - PAYPAL NOTIFICATIONS pour in.

           - After they secure funds through one profile, they GHOST ‘EM 
           -- shut the profile down, start another. 

           - Thea updates her DEBT PIE CHART on MINT.COM, her debt 
           quickly declining.  

           - Lucy lays in bed, her sleepy smile illuminated by her 
           cellphone, messaging with @mujahid4life.  

           INT. THEA AND LUCY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Lucy joins Thea in the kitchen for breakfast. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        Where we at? 

           Thea grabs her computer -- pulls up her completely DEBT FREE 
           PIE CHART on her Mint.com page. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        That’s amazing! 

                                 THEA
                        I took the liberty of dividing the 
                        funds and transferring yours to 
                        your bank account. 

           Lucy pulls up her bank account on her phone -- her jaw drops. 

                                 LUCY
                        Duuuude. We’re Charlie Sheen rich.

                        Catfishing ISIS is literally the 
                        best idea we ever had.

                        Well, that a couple of Chechen

                        I say we celebrate. This weekend,

                        Have we met?

           INT. ISIS COMPOUND

           At the bank of computers, the fighters sit glued to their 
           Facebook/Twitter/Instagrams. Zaheed paces behind them.  

                                 ZAHEED
                        Anything intriguing, my brothers? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Crickets.   

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        I said, ANYTHING INTRIGUING? 

                                 FIGHTERS
                             (mumbling)
                        Maybe. / Not Really. / Who can say? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        It appears something has stolen 
                        your attention. Or should I say, 
                        someone?  

           The fighters go silent like school boys caught with their 
           dicks in their hands. 

           Suspicious, Zaheed steps closer. He swiftly skim the myriad 
           of feeds, his eyes landing on --

           -- @ALLAHBAE’S Twitter, with ALYSSA MILANO’s pic, #JHOTTIE --  

           -- then, the computer farthest from him catches his eye -- 

           -- @JIJANE Instagram profile, with Danica Keller’s pic, 
           #JHOTTIE --

            -- he continues scanning, quickly discovering @JHOTTIE 
           Instagram feed, with Danica Keller’s pic, #allahbae4ever. 

           Finally, he spots J.I. JANE’S Facebook page, with ALYSSA 
           MILANO’S pic, #naughtyjhottie.

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        Have you sent money to any of those 
                        women? 

                                 MEEK FIGHTER
                        Which ones? 

           Zaheed points to the profiles with Alyssa & Winnie’s photos. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Those!

                                 FIGHTERS
                        Yes. / Yeah. / Uh-huh. / Oh, sure. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        I want a calculation of every 
                        dollar sent to profiles with those 
                        photographs and/or any of those 
                        handles or hashtags-- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           He points to @ALLAHBAE, #JHOTTIE, @JIJANE, #allahbae4ever.

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        --by the time I return.  

                                 ISIS FIGHTERS
                             (quietly)
                        Yes, sir. 

           Zaheed stomps away as the fighters log into the ISIS Paypal 
           account to assess the damage. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The Viper bursts in, Zaheed in tow. 

                                 THE VIPER
                             (fuming)
                        How much? 

           The Fighters mumble. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

           Again, mumbles. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        Speak. The F. Up.

           A bit more audible, still not intelligible. 

                                 MEEK FIGHTER
                             (barely audible)
                        $56,000. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        ARE YOU MOTHERFUCKING KIDDING ME? 
                        You’re supposed to be tracking down  
                        ransom for that American whore 
                        journalist, not getting scammed by 
                        a couple basic bitches!

                                 MEEK FIGHTER 
                        We’re so sorry. We didn’t realize 
                        what was happening until it was too 
                        late. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        If those girls aren't in front of 
                        me within 48 hours, I’ll rape and 
                        kill each and every last one of 
                        you.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 DHAKIR
                             (under his breath)
                        I don’t know how that’s possible. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Excuse me? 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Anatomically speaking. 

           She grabs Dhakir by his collar, bends him over his chair and 
           THRUSTS HER MACHINE GUN UP BETWEEN HIS LEGS. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        How about now?

                                 DHAKIR
                        Yes, it is very clear to me now.

           The Viper slams him back down into his seat. 

                                 MEEK FIGHTER
                        But we don’t know who these girls 
                        are, or where they are. 

                                 AL-FARID (O.S.)
                        Yes, we do. 

           AL-FARID -- a dead ringer for Rodrigo Santoro -- turns to 
           address The Viper. From the look in his eyes, he could fuck 
           the shit out of you and/or murder you with his bare hands.

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        They’re in America. 

           Everyone turns their attention to the map of MANHATTAN on his 
           computer screen, two GLOWING RED DOTS pulsing in the WEST 
           VILLAGE. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        New York City, to be exact.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Easily. I traced the withdrawls 
                        from Paypal to their bank, hacked 
                        into their accounts, got their cell 
                        numbers, then hacked into the 
                        location services on their phones.

                        Eh.  
                             (to The Viper)
                        Allow me to retrieve them as 
                        penance for our foolishness.

                        I shall accompany you, my brother. 
                        Together we’ll restore pride to our

                                 THE VIPER
                        If you fail, kill yourselves and 
                        save me the trouble. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You have our word. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        The clock is ticking. The debt must 
                        be paid. 

           TIME LAPSE - ON TO AMERICA

           The sun sets over Syria, followed by quick a series of 
           SUNRISES and SUNSETS that end on the glittering New York 
           skyline.    

           INT. THE STRIP HOUSE, NYC - NIGHT

           Lucy and Thea sit at banquette, their table piled high with 
           Surf and Turf. They’re 3/4 drunk. 

                                 LUCY
                        Reasons you’re my Ride or Die: you 
                        always include me in your takeout 
                        orders whether I’m home or not. You 
                        know the exact amount of Chardonnay 
                        I can handle, and you’re the only 
                        person who can take a decent photo 
                        of me. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Reasons you’re my Ride or Die: 
                        you’re always down for Taco Bell 
                        even if you’ve already eaten, you 
                        roll the BEST joint east of the 
                        Mississippi, and you don’t freak if 
                        I wear your underwear. 

                                 LUCY
                        If it’s clean, I really don’t see 
                        the big deal. 

                                 THEA
                        Most importantly, our Crimson Tides 
                        were synced BEFORE we even met. 

                                 LUCY
                        Scientific proof that our 
                        connection is bio-fucking-logical. 

           They clink glasses. A WAITER sets down a bottle of Dom 
           Pérignon. 

                                 WAITER
                        Mademoiselles, a gift from the 
                        gentleman at the bar. 

           The girls look over to where Al-Farid and Dhakir -- now clean 
           shaven and dressed to the nines -- wave flirtatiously from 
           the bar. 

                                 THEA
                        OMG. Dibs on Diego Luna’s 
                        doppelganger. 

                                 LUCY
                        Come on, man! I’m the one who’s 
                        placed a higher priority on love 
                        and relationships - he’s mine. 

                                 THEA
                        Ugh, fine. I’ll take poor man’s 
                        Benicio Del Toro. 

           AT THE BAR

           Al-Farid and Dhakir wave at the girls, whispering through 
           their sexy smiles.  

                                 DHAKIR
                        Man, they do not look like their 
                        profile pics. 
                                 AL-FARID
                        Not even close. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        We’re talking apricots and 
                        pomegranates. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        That’s being kind. 

                                 DHAKIR
                             (licking his lips)
                        But still, you think maybe what 
                        happens in America stays in 
                        America? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Insh’allah. Only you can decide if 
                        Sharia Law is worth breaking. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        You sound like my dad. 

           AT THE TABLE

           The girls wave the boys over. 

                                 THEA
                        FYI, if a group sexual experience 
                        presents itself this evening I 
                        don’t know that I’ll have the 
                        strength to turn it down. 

                                 LUCY
                        Noted. 

           The boys slide serpent-like into the banquette on either side 
           of the girls. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Ladies. 

           Dhakir pours himself, Lucy, and Thea glasses of champagne. He 
           offers one to Al-Farid who opts for water. 

                                 THEA
                        Handsome fellows. What brings you 
                        to this fine establishment this 
                        evening? 

                                 DHAKIR
                        When you spend your week dealing 
                        with large sums of financials, 
                        there’s nothing like fresh meat.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        You’re bankers? 

                                 AL-FARID 
                        Deutsche Bank. 

                                 LUCY
                        Impressive. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Not as impressive as your ability 
                        to hypnotize from the across the 
                        room. 

                                 LUCY
                        Really? That’s something I 
                        typically struggle with. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        How do you spend your days, 
                        enchantresses? 

                                 THEA
                        I’m the CEO of the TamPots Limited 
                        Liability Corporation and my 
                        enchanting friend is my most 
                        trusted advisor.

           Dhakir puts his hand on Thea’s upper thigh.

                                 DHAKIR
                        Behind every successful woman is an 
                        army of men trying to please her. 

                                 THEA
                        Amen, brother. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        So tell me, successful ladies, 
                        would you like to party?  

           Lucy and Thea look to each other, then back to the boys. 

                                 LUCY/THEA
                        Have we met?

                                 DHAKIR
                             (signaling)
                        Waiter! 

           The waiter brings over another bottle of Dom. Dhakir pops the 
           top and fills the girls’ glasses. 

           A FEW GLASSES OF CHAMPERS LATER
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Dhakir and Thea FLIRT, FLIRT, FLIRT, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK as 
           Al-Farid sips water beside Lucy. 

                                 LUCY
                        You don’t drink? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I do not. 

                                 LUCY
                        Are you like an AA person? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        No. 

                                 LUCY
                        Paleo? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’m not sure what that is, so no. 
                             (then)
                        Drinking alcohol is considered a 
                        sin where I’m from.  

                                 LUCY
                        Bummer. More for me then! 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Indeed. 

           Lucy pours herself another drink. 

           THEY HEAD TO THE ROOFTOP BAR 

           Thea and Dhakir can’t keep their hands off each other, Lucy 
           and Al-Farid sit an awkward distance apart.  

                                 LUCY
                        You have a girlfriend? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I do not. 

                                 LUCY
                        A wife? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        No. 

                                 LUCY
                        Are you into dudes? I am, so I 
                        totally get the appeal. 

           Al-Farid reluctantly lays a hand on her thigh. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, OK. Cool. 

           THEY HOP IN THE BACK OF A TAXI 

           Thea and Dhakir MAKE OUT as Lucy and Al-Farid sit smashed 
           together, forcing smiles.

           THEY POP BOTTLES IN DA CLUB 

           Thea and Dhakir dance like maniacs as Lucy and Al-Farid watch 
           from a couch off the dance floor. The look on Lucy’s face is 
           a cross between confused and bummed.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        It’s not you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sure, whatever. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You’re a stunning, kind-hearted 
                        woman and if I was a morally 
                        bankrupt American I’d be all over 
                        you.  

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks, I guess.
                             (confused)
                        So, wait. What are you? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I am an American. I just grew up in 
                        a very religious household. 

           Drunk and sweaty, Thea and Dhakir flop down on the couch 
           beside them. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        My beautiful birds, where to next? 

           Lucy’s EYES WIDEN -- a Kaiser Soze moment happening in her 
           brain. 

                                 LUCY
                             (suddenly sober)
                        Who wants another round? 

           Dhakir and Thea raise their hands. Lucy grabs Thea by the 
           wrist, drags her to --

           THE BAR
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        No matter what I say next, you have 
                        to keep the EXACT same look on your 
                        face. 

                                 THEA
                        Done. I love this game.

                                 LUCY
                        While you were off living each 
                        moment like it was your last, I was 
                        stuck with that non-drinking, non-
                        fun-having, religious zealot. 

                                 THEA
                        And...

                                 LUCY
                        And, I think those might be the 
                        guys we catfished.

           Terror flashes across Thea’s eyes as her DRUNK GRIN remains 
           intact. 

                                 THEA
                        Just because he doesn’t want to get 
                        down doesn’t mean he’s a terrorist. 

                                 LUCY
                        Your boyfriend just called us 
                        ‘beautiful birds’ like every 
                        message from @Brohammad. And let’s 
                        be honest, if those dudes grew 
                        their beads out and dressed up like 
                        Jesus, they could pass as Bin 
                        Laden’s brothers. 

           Thea sneaks a peak back at the boys. 

                                 THEA
                        Holy shit. What do we do? 

                                 LUCY

           Lucy leads Thea through the crowded dance floor, towards the 
           restroom. 

           BACK OVER ON THE SEXY COUCH

                                 AL-FARID
                        They’ve been gone awhile, yeah?  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 DHAKIR
                        Probably doing cocaine. American 
                        girls love cocaine. 

           Al-Farid stands, scans the bar -- then the rest of the club -- 
           he spots the girls racing towards the restroom.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        They’re onto us.

           The boys jump up, take off after the girls. 

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLUB 

           A LONG LINE of women stand waiting outside the RESTROOM DOOR. 
           Lucy and Thea push to the front. 

                                 THEA
                        ‘Scuse me, pardon me. 

                                 CLUB GAL #1
                        Watch it! 

                                 CLUB GAL #2
                        Hello? There’s a line!

           A WOMAN exits the restroom, Club Gal #2 tries to enter. 

                                 LUCY
                        If you don’t move, I’ll diarrhea on 
                        your Louboutins. 

           Grossed out, Club Gal #2 steps back. Just as Lucy and Thea 
           race inside, they glimpse Al-Farid and Dhakir running towards 
           them. 

                                 THEA
                        Hurry, hurry, hurry. 

           WOMEN’S RESTROOM

           They slam and lock the door. 

                                 LUCY
                        This is like that moment in TAKEN 
                        where Liam Neeson’s daughter is 
                        about to get taken.  

                                 THEA
                        Yeah, but Liam isn’t here with a 
                        particular set of skills to save 
                        us. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        What’re we supposed to do? 

           Thea looks to the window high above the toilet. 

                                 THEA
                        Get the fuck outta here. 

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Next thing, Thea is outside the window, helping Lucy through. 
           Once Lucy hits the pavement, they RUN FOR THEIR LIVES. 

           INT. RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dhakir and Al-Farid burst in. The sound of a SIREN wafts 
           through the open window. 

           Dhakir jumps up on the toilet, spots the girls through the 
           window. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        ‘Hard to get’, huh? I like.  

           In a flash, they’re through the WINDOW --

           -- IN THE ALLEY. 

           The chase is ON. 

           Ahead, the girls run as fast as they can --

                                 LUCY
                        Where do we go? The police? The US 
                        Embassy? The FBI? Empire State 
                        Building? 

                                 THEA
                        If I had ANY idea where ANY of 
                        those places were, sure. 

           The girls spot a SUBWAY STATION, sprint towards it. 

           Al-Farid and Zaheed keep pace with them, watch them descend 
           into the station. 

           INT. SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The girls jump the turnstiles -- push through COMMUTERS, A 
           STEEL DRUM BAND, a HIP HOP DANCE GROUP, and a VIOLIN PLAYER -- 
           struggling to keep their lead.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           A few yards behind them --

           Al-Farid and Dhakir attempt to jump the turnstiles and TWO 
           COPS step in their path -- the train rumbles towards the 
           station. They quickly buy Metrocards, enter. 

           The girls fight to stay ahead. The boys gain momentum. 

           WHOOOSH. The train roars into the station. 

           BING BONG -- subway doors open -- commuters rush in and out 
           of the train. 

                                 THEA
                        Get down.

                                 LUCY
                        What? 

           Thea yanks Lucy’s sleeve, forcing her to hunch down. 

           The boys crane their necks above the crowd -- where the hell 
           did those two slip off to? They board the train.   

           BING BONG -- subway doors close -- the train lurches forward. 

           Still on the platform, the girls POP UP just in time to make 
           eye contact with Al-Farid and Dhakir as the train exits the 
           station. They SMILE AND WAVE (Lucy) / FLIP THEM OFF (Thea). 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls ascend the stairs. 

                                 LUCY
                        My poor cardio performance this 
                        evening has forced me to reevaluate 
                        the value of those SoulCycle 
                        coupons.  

                                 THEA
                        No doubt. 

                                 LUCY
                        You OK? Your hands are shaking. 

                                 THEA
                        It’s the adrenaline. I’m gonna need 
                        about six cocktails to even out 
                        while we formulate a plan.  

                                 LUCY
                        Done and done. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Lucy hails a taxi. 

           INT. TAXI

           The girls relax into the backseat. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do you think they know where we 
                        live? 

                                 THEA
                        If they can track our date night 
                        whereabouts, then yes, I’m pretty 
                        sure they know where we sleep. 

                                 LUCY
                        Does this mean we can never go 
                        home? 

                                 THEA
                        Quite possibly. 

           I/E. ARLENE’S GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

           The BOUNCER waves the girls inside.

           It’s LIVE BAND KARAOKE night. On stage, TWO GIRLS (20’s) ruin 
           Jay Z’s “Empire State of Mind”. 

                                 THEA 
                        As if this night couldn’t get any 
                        worse. 
                             (to bartender)
                        Bartender, two shots of 151. 

           He pours, they shoot. 

                                 LUCY
                             (wincing)
                        That was a terrible decision. 

                                 THEA
                        Just another one of many. Seeings 
                        how we already saved ourselves once 
                        tonight, what do you say we go save 
                        those two? 

           Lucy nods YES. 

           They rush the stage, take over the mics just as the CHORUS of 
           the song kicks in.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY/THEA
                        “In New York/Concrete jungle where 
                        dreams are made of/There's nothing 
                        you can’t do/Now you’re in New 
                        York”

           The whole bar joins in, cheering them on. 

                                 LUCY/THEA (CONT’D)
                        “These streets will make you feel 
                        brand new/Big lights will inspire 
                        you/Let's hear it for-- 

           Just then, Dhakir and Al-Farid enter the bar -- they spot the 
           girls -- elbow their way forward through the crush of sweaty 
           bar patrons. 

           A COMMOTION in the crowd steals the girls attention -- the 
           boys found them! They drop their mics and haul ass -- 

           BACKSTAGE

           The girls flee -- CLIMB over SPEAKERS -- DUCK under MIC 
           STANDS -- SWITCHBACK through piles of SOUND EQUIPMENT -- 
           CRASH through A DRUM SET. 

           Nowhere left to go, they scale a METAL STAIRCASE to the --

           STAIRWELL

           The door slams behind them, alerting the boys of their 
           location. 

           The boys SUPER ATHLETICALLY follow in the girl’s footsteps -- 
           they LEAP over SPEAKERS -- SLITHER past MIC STANDS -- HURDLE 
           OVER SOUND EQUIPMENT -- BYPASS THE DRUMS COMPLETELY. They 
           scale the metal staircase and enter --

           THE STAIRWELL

           The girls are THREE FLIGHTS UP, climbing as fast as they can. 

           The guys close in, taking three, four stairs at a time.  

                                 THEA
                             (shouting down at them)
                        We both have handfuls of STD’s! Not 
                        really worth all this effort!  

                                 DHAKIR
                        Doesn’t matter! We just wanna 
                        cuddle! 

           Thea looks back at Lucy, FINGER TO HER LIPS to quiet her. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        You’re gonna have to catch us 
                        first. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        That’s the idea. 

           Thea OPENS then SLAMS SHUT the 6th floor door -- A FAKE OUT! 
           She motions to Lucy to TIP-TOE and continue climbing.  

           The boys FALL FOR IT -- they hurry up to, and enter --   

           THE 6TH FLOOR

           RESIDENTS peer through their peep holes, the guys peep back. 

                                 DHAKIR (CONT’D)
                        Here kitty, kitty, kitties. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Come out, come out wherever you 
                        are. 

           The guys KICK THEIR WAY INTO APARTMENTS, tear them apart.

                                 DHAKIR
                        We know you’re here somewhere.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        We just wanna talk. 

           NOT having it, the residents hustle them back into the 
           hallway, slam doors in their faces.  

           AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL

           The girls kick through the door, stumble onto --

           THE ROOFTOP

                                 LUCY
                        Now what? 

                                 THEA
                        It looks like our options are A) 
                        leaping to our deaths, or B) 
                        getting kidnapped by ISIS. 

                                 LUCY
                        Which is worse? 

                                 THEA
                        I’m not sure. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           THWACK! -- the door slams open, the boys burst through. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Oh hey guys. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Hey. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Hey. 

                                 LUCY
                        Hey. 

           An awkward, dangerous tension hangs in the air. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What happens now? You ruffians just 
                        gonna kill us? 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Questions are not yours to ask.  

                                 THEA
                        Welcome to America. It’s a free 
                        country. I can do whatever I want. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Like steal, you deceitful cunt?

                                 LUCY
                        Whoa! Easy with the anatomy-
                        shaming!

                                 THEA
                        We didn’t have to steal because you 
                        were dumb enough to give us the 
                        money. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Those funds were meant for a higher 
                        purpose, for furthering our cause. 
                        Not fueling your cocaine habit. 

                                 LUCY
                        Cocaine? 

                                 THEA
                        So, you have a few less sheckels 
                        for suicide bombs? Big whoop.  

                                 DHAKIR
                             (losing it)
                        You tricked us!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Do you hear yourself? You sound 
                        like such a little bitch. 

           Dhakir backhands Thea across the face. HARD. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        Wise women don’t talk back to me. 

           Thea steadies herself, then, SMACKS him back twice as hard. 

                                 THEA
                        And wise men don’t lay their hands 
                        on me. 

           A smile washes over Dhakir’s face. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        I’m going to savor crushing the 
                        life out of you with my bare hands.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Be cool, brother. Their fate isn’t 
                        ours to decide. 

                                 THEA
                        Yeah, our fate isn’t yours to 
                        decide

           Dhakir grabs Thea by the neck, pulls her close. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        I dare you to keep talking. 

                                 AL-FARID
                             (to Lucy)
                        Tell your friend to stop talking. 

                                 LUCY
                        E, shut-up. 

                                 THEA
                        Or what? 

           Dhakir reaches for the gun in his waistband. Al-Farid lunges, 
           grabs at the gun simultaneously. 

                                 DHAKIR
                        What the-!

           The men wrestle for control of the gun.

                                 LUCY
                        Should we? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Yep! 

           The girls take off towards the door -- 

           BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           They look back -- Al-Farid stands above Dhakir’s dead body.

            Al-Farid aims the gun at the girls. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Do you want to live? 

                           THEA
                                                          LUCY
           What is going on!?!?
                                              Holy shit. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll only ask you once more. Do you 
                        want to live? 

           The girls nod ‘yes.’ 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Follow me.

           And they do -- back down the stairs -- through the bar -- 
           into a taxi -- 

           EXT. BARUCH HOUSES, LOWER EAST SIDE - CONTINUOUS

           The taxi pulls up outside the straight-up most dangerous 
           projects in NYC -- we’re talking New Jack City-style. 

           Al-Farid climbs out, motions for them to follow.

                                 THEA
                        Oh, hell no. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry but we’re not about to walk 
                        into Jay-Z’s childhood. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Shut-up and keep your head down. 

           Lucy and Thea obey, follow Al-Farid inside -- past a bunch of 
           THUGS -- into an elevator -- down a long hallway -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           I/E. APARTMENT

           Al-Farid knocks on an apartment door -- inside, the sounds of 
           footsteps, a chain sliding, locks and bolts unlocking.

           COVETTE -- an antagonistic, Black Ops sexbomb -- throws open 
           the door. 

                                 COVETTE
                        What up, dicks? 

           Al-Farid ushers the girls inside.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Ladies...

                                 COVETTE
                             (to Al-Farid)
                        You clean?  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Yep.  

           Covette crosses to a MURPHY BED, pulls it down.  

                                 THEA
                        I knew this was gonna end in some 
                        weird sex game! 

           Covette FLIPS A LEVER within the bed frame. The back of the 
           Murphy Bed cabinet SLIDES OPEN to reveal --

           A CIA SAFE HOUSE

           Two HOT CIA AGENTS sit behind the HIGHEST TECH computers. On 
           the monitors: 

           - A thermal map of the ISIS compound. 

           - Passport photo of CLAUDIA. 

           - Surveillance photos of THE VIPER.   

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        No, really. What in fuck is 
                        happening?

                                 AL-FARID
                        Six months ago, Claudia Morro, a 
                        VICE journalist infamous for her 
                        “I was a _____ Bride” columns--
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           ON THE MONITOR, photos of CLAUDIA as a DIA DE LOS MUERTOS 
           BRIDE, A MORMON SISTER WIFE BRIDE, and a JUGGALO BRIDE 
           appear.

                        --traveled to Syria. She talked her 
                        way into a ‘maqar’, where women new 
                        to ISIS live while waiting to be 
                        assigned a husband. That’s where 
                        she met The Viper. 

           ON THE MONITOR, a surveillance photo of a WOMAN IN A BURQA. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure that’s her? 

                                 COVETTE
                        Yeah. Maybe?  

           ON THE MONITOR, various photos of WOMEN IN BURQAS. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        It’s so hard to tell. 

           ON THE MONITOR, countless photos of WOMEN IN BURQUAS. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        Wait! That’s definitely her. 

           ON THE MONITOR, one last image of a WOMAN IN A BURQA. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        No. Sorry. THIS is her. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Are you sure? 

                                 COVETTE 
                        Yes. 

           He zooms in on the photo. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        Well, there’s a very good chance 
                        it’s her. 

           He zooms in even more. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        Hell, I don’t know.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Anyhow, Claudia was welcomed into  
                        The Viper’s inner circle which gave  
                        her access to ISIS’ every move. 

                                 COVETTE
                        Thanks to the NSA and Twitter, we 
                        established contact with Claudia 
                        and sent an agent in to retrieve 
                        intel on The Viper’s next mission. 
                        Our guy ended up dead, the intel 
                        intercepted, and we haven’t heard 
                        from Claudia since. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I was sent in undercover-

                                 THEA
                        OK, so you’re definitely a CIA 
                        agent. 

           Everyone looks at her like, “Duh.” 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Just wanted to be super clear on 
                        that front. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        But The Viper considers men second 
                        class citizens. No way I could get 
                        close enough to learn any valuable 
                        information. 

                                 THEA
                        What does this have to do with us? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Thanks to that hustle you ran on 
                        The Viper’s men, she demands your 
                        debt be paid.

                                 THEA
                        You’re kidding.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        If we could somehow get you inside 
                        the Al-Khansaa-

                                 THEA
                        The what? 

                                 COVETTE
                        The Al-Khansaa. The Viper’s all-
                        female morality brigade.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           ON THE COMPUTER MONITOR, an Al-Khansaa training video. An 
           army of WOMEN IN BURQAS, CHANTING, SHOOTING UZIS. 

           NOTE: The Al-Khansaa is comprised entirely of women. Unless 
           noted, they’re covered head-to-toe in black burqas at all 
           times. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        They’re the only ones privy to The 
                        Viper’s plans. If you could  
                        infiltrate them and acquire the 
                        same intel as Claudia, it would 
                        enable us to stop her mission. 

                                 THEA
                        Hold up, homies. Isn’t there a 
                        female CIA agent you could send? 

                                 COVETTE
                        This set-up is too perfect not to 
                        take advantage of. 

                                 THEA
                        What if we refuse? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You’ve committed fraud, are facing 
                        jail time and worse... ISIS will 
                        hunt you down and kill you either 
                        way.   

           Covette pulls an old FLIP PHONE from his pocket. 

                                 THEA
                        Arsenio Hall called, he wants his

                        through the camera app. Gimme your 
                        cell.

           She hands him her phone -- he pops it open, takes out the SIM 
           CARD, places it into the FLIP PHONE. 

                                 COVETTE (CONT’D)
                        In case they want details on how 
                        you swindled them, you’ve still got 
                        your electronic paper trail.   

           He shoves it into Thea’s pocket, hands her a TAMPON.

                        A tamp-BOMB. 

           He unwraps it, pulls the string and -- KA-BOOM!

                        Damn! That’s solid gold money right 
                        there. 

           Covette hands one to each of the girls.

                        like, look behind you and stuff. 

           Covette pulls Thea close, puts all the gadgets in her 
           pockets. 

                                 THEA
                        This is unexpected. 

                                 COVETTE
                        It’s protocol, ma’am.

                                 THEA
                        Protocol away. 

           With his arms wrapped around her, Covette rearranges the 
           gadgets in her pockets, pulling her closer and closer each 
           time. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 COVETTE
                        That should do it. 

                                 THEA
                        Oh, it definitely did. 

                                 LUCY
                        What now? 

                                 COVETTE
                        You go to Syria and try not to die. 

                                 THEA
                        Jesus. 

                                 LUCY
                        Is this really happening? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’m afraid so.

           Al-Farid leads them back through the Murphy bed passage way. 

                                 COVETTE 
                        Hope to see you on the flipside, 
                        ladies. 

           With that, the Murphy Bed folds back up. Al-Farid leads the 
           girls out and into --

           AN SUV

           A SECRET SERVICE-Y DRIVER sits behind the wheel. Al-Farid 
           climbs in front, the girls in back. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Ready? 

                                 LUCY/THEA 
                        Um.... / Uh....

           From the terrified looks on their faces, the severity of the 
           situation is finally setting in. 

                           LUCY
                                                          THEA
           I guess. 
                                              Sure. Yeah. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        And, my apologies, but your travel 
                        accommodations aren’t exactly first 
                        class. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Al-Farid nods to the driver -- he starts the car, pulls into 
           traffic. 

           The girls clasp hands, squeeze hard.   

                                 EMILA
                        Ride or die, dude. 

                                 LUCY 
                        Ride or die. 

           SLOW FADE TO BLACK

           TIME LAPSE - ON TO SYRIA 

           The sun RISES on a PLANE flying over Manhattan, then SETS on 
           the plane landing in Syria.  

           DARKNESS 

           The sounds of a CAR ENGINE coming to a stop, BOOTS trudging 
           across gravel, MEN talking, a TRUNK popping open. BRIGHT 
           SUNLIGHT BLINDS Lucy and Thea as their HOODS are removed. 

           Welcome to Syria, ladies. 

           EXT. ISIS COMPOUND

           Every patch of earth, every plant, every animal, every 
           building is sun-bleached and desperate for sweet relief. 

           A pack of ISIS Fighters -- BANGED UP and BLOODIED from battle 
           -- file past, trying to decide if they should FUCK, MARRY OR 
           KILL the girls.  

           A few yards away, Zaheed WHISTLES to Al-Farid. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        As-salamu alaikum, brother. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        As-salamu alaikum. 

           He motions for Al-Farid to follow him. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Bring the girls? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Nah. Let the boys keep an eye on 
                        them. 

           As Al-Farid jogs over to Zaheed, the fighters MADDOG Lucy and 
           Thea -- they smile and wave back sheepishly. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. SITUATION ROOM

           The Viper toys with a MINIATURE MODEL OF A CITY as Zaheed and 
           Al-Farid enter. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Throw them in ‘the hole.’ We’ll 
                        execute them alongside The 
                        Journalist. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Considering their technological 
                        prowess, put one of them with Al-
                        Khansaa, see what they can learn 
                        from her.

                                 THE VIPER
                        Interesting idea. And the other? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’m next in line for a wife. The 
                        taller one appeals to me.

                                 THE VIPER
                        Fine. But if either of them give me 
                        trouble, I’ll behead them on the 
                        spot.  

           EXT. ISIS COMPOUND

           The Fighters surround Lucy and Thea like a pack of hungry 
           wolves.

                                 FIGHTER #1
                        Why would you tweet someone again 
                        and again, steal their attention 
                        from all other activities, then 
                        just stop? 

                                 FIGHTER #2
                        What lust crimes have you endured 
                        that you would think that was OK? 

                                 FIGHTER #3
                        You have the hearts of vampires.

                                 MEEK FIGHTER
                             (to Thea)
                        You are more beautiful than I 
                        imagined in my dreams.

           Al-Farid approaches -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                        Don’t waste your breath, brothers. 
                        Their fates are sealed. 

           -- and whisks the girls away through the labyrinth of 
           buildings comprising the compound.   

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the deal. 
                             (to Thea)
                        You’re going into the Al-Khansaa. 
                        Keep your eyes open and your mouth 
                        shut. These girls do not mess 
                        around. 

           MACHINE GUN FIRE rings out.  

           They round a corner to find thirty WOMEN WEARING BURQAS, 
           shooting AK-47’s at MALE MANNEQUINS -- their BURQAS ripple in 
           the wind making them resemble HEADLESS HORSEMEN.  

                                 THEA
                        Dude, this is some Revelations, 
                        End-Of-The-World shit right here.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        And it’s our job to end it. 

                                 THEA
                        Am I just supposed to be like, 
                        “What up G’s?” 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Wait here. 

           Al-Farid jogs over to The Viper’s HBIC -- SHAJEEAH. 

                                 LUCY
                        This is so intense. 

                                 THEA
                        I regret every choice I’ve made up 
                        to this moment. 

           Al-Farid waves Thea over. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        This is Shajeeah. Whatever she 
                        says, you do. No questions asked. 

                                 THEA
                        Why not?  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Shajeeah whips a cane out from her burqa, smacks the back of 
           Thea’s legs. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHH!

                                 AL-FARID
                        Luck to you both. 

           He bows and heads out. 

                                 SHAJEEAH 
                             (to Thea)
                        Follow me, ya ka-lib.   

           As Shajeeah leads Thea away, Al-Farid takes Lucy by the hand. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You’re sticking with me. 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh, thank God. 

           INT. PRAYER HALL

           As Lucy and Al-Farid enter, RAAHIMA -- 25, a quiet, obedient, 
           young woman -- pulls Lucy behind a changing screen, undresses 
           her. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Ahlan wasahlan! Today is a good 
                        day. Marriage unites us in 
                        sisterhood. 

                                 LUCY
                        Marriage? 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        But also a bad day because marriage  
                        is a prison sentence only death can 
                        end. 

           Raahima helps Lucy into a WHITE BURQA.   

                                 RAAHIMA (CONT’D)
                        Mashallah! You look like an angel. 
                        Go! Your destiny awaits. 

           Lucy emerges. Al-Farid takes her by the arm, leads her down 
           the aisle of the packed prayer hall.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                             (whispering)
                        This was the only way I could 
                        guarantee your safety. It creates 
                        the perfect opportunity for you to 
                        connect with the wives, see what 
                        they know about Claudia. 

                                 LUCY
                             (whispering)
                        Awesome. Thank you. 

                                 AL-FARID
                             (whispering)
                        Considering ISIS’ complete lack of 
                        regard for women, it’s the least I 
                        could do. 

           The Meek Fighter steps to the podium and begins the ceremony.

           EXT. TRAINING AREA, COMPOUND

           Thea, now wearing a burqa, follows Shajeeah past the Al-
           Khansaas SHOOTING UZI’S at far away targets. 

           Shajeeah throws Thea an AK-47. Thea tries to catch it but the 
           fabric of her burqa tangles and she FUMBLES IT.  

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Idiot. 

                                 THEA
                        DUDE! I feel like I’m trapped in a 
                        duvet cover. 

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Again. 

           Shajeeah throws her another AK. Struggling with the burqa, 
           Thea catches the trigger -- it FIRES before CRASHING TO THE 
           GROUND. 

                                 SHAJEEAH (CONT’D)
                        You are stupid and uncoordinated. 

           Shajeeah grabs a WOODEN STICK the size of an AK, throws it at 
           Thea. Thea barely catches it, drops it, picks it back up. 

                                 SHAJEEAH (CONT’D)
                        I hate you. 

                                 THEA
                        Bummer. 
                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Once you figure out how to handle 
                        that, I’ll let you handle this. 

           Shajeeah taunts her with a SHINY, NEW KALASHNIKOV. 

                                 THEA
                        Ooooh. Mama like. 

           INT. PRAYER HALL 

           The fighters and their wives cheer as Lucy and Al-Farid walk 
           back down the aisle.

                                 LUCY
                        How crazy would it be if we got 
                        married for real and told this 
                        story at our actual wedding? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Considering this is a classified 
                        mission, that couldn’t happen. 

                                 LUCY
                        Us getting married or us talking 
                        about it? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Talking about it. 

                                 LUCY
                        Duh. Of course. 

           Zaheed bursts in. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        The Yazidi’s have crossed onto our 
                        land. 

           The celebration breaks up, the fighters head out.

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’ve gotta go. 

                                 LUCY
                        Really? Isn’t this our honeymoon? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Not really. 

                                 LUCY
                        Well, try not to die!    
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’ll do my best. 

           He awkwardly kisses her goodbye. Raahima ushers her out 
           alongside the other wives.

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE

           A handful of ISIS wives help Lucy get settled in. 

           NOTE: When the wives are inside they remove their full 
           burqas, revealing flashy, clashy clothes.  

                                 LUCY
                        You guys seem super chill about 
                        your husbands leaving to fight.  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        If they don’t return, there’s 
                        always more to choose from. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        Sometimes you’ll get lucky and end 
                        up with a better one than you 
                        started with. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        Sometimes not. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        I gathered some essentials for you- 

           Raahima unpacks her basket, hands Lucy a BLUE BURQA -- 

                                 RAAHIMA (CONT’D)
                        When you’re with us, your hair, 
                        hands, and feet can be exposed. 
                        Otherwise, you must be completely 
                        covered or risk overly-severe 
                        punishment.  

           -- and, EARPLUGS -- 

                                 RAAHIMA (CONT’D)
                        These will quiet the screams that 
                        echo through the night.  

           -- and, BAND-AIDS, ADVIL, STYPTIC PENCIL.  

                                 RAAHIMA (CONT’D)
                        These will cover the wounds the 
                        burqas don’t. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        And to think, I was so looking 
                        forward to getting married. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Many of us were. Isn’t it funny how 
                        horribly unfair life can be? 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        At least we have each other. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        Until one of our husbands beats us 
                        to death.

           Raahima picks up the TAMP-BOMB, admires it. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        I haven’t seen this brand since I 
                        was on vacation in Croatia. 

                                 LUCY
                        DEAR GOD NO! 

           Startled, Raahima drops the TAMPBOMB. Thea dives and catches 
           it right before it hits the ground. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        We have more of those if you run 
                        out. 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh yeah, of course. I just- I have 
                        a very tiny vagina and these fit 
                        perfectly. 

           Lucy slips it in her back pocket. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        Not to worry, a few years here and 
                        that won’t be an issue anymore. 

           EXT. TRAINING ZONE   

           As the sun sets, Thea practices with her WOODEN STICK. With 
           each move, she becomes sharper, more adept. 

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE - LATER

           Lucy cooks dinner, contentedly humming to herself. 

           Thea enters. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        Hey girl! How was your day? 

                                 THEA
                        Exhausting. Maneuvering in this 
                        blanket dress was like trying to 
                        swim in a Snuggie.  

                                 LUCY
                        I know, right?  

           IN THE DISTANCE, the CALL TO PRAYER can be heard over 
           loudspeakers. 

           Lucy crosses to the sink to wash her hands, motions for Thea 
           to copy her.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        In an effort to keep our cover, 
                        I’ve decided to just embrace all 
                        the Muslim stuff.  

                                 THEA
                        Smart. You get any intel on ol’ 
                        Claudia? 

                                 LUCY
                        Not yet. They were all so nice I 
                        didn’t wanna do anything to make 
                        them think I was using them. 

                                 THEA
                        Good thinking.  

                                 LUCY
                        Any luck locating The Viper? 

                                 THEA
                        There is literally no way to 
                        distinguish between one woman in a 
                        burqa and the next. So maybe I 
                        have? Maybe I haven’t. Only time 
                        will tell. 

           POP! POP! POP! 

           The faint sounds of gunfire can be heard in the distance. 

           ALARM WHISTLES SOUND. 

           Al-Farid bursts through the door. 

                                 LUCY
                        Hello, husband. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                        The compound is under attack! 

                                 LUCY
                        Again? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        This morning, it was the Yazidis. 
                        Now, it’s the Salafists Jihadis.  

                                 THEA 
                        Dude, ISIS has more enemies than 
                        Martin Shkreli.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Just about.  

           Al-Farid throws the coffee table aside, flips the rug back, 
           revealing a cache of GUNS. He grabs a KALASHNIKOV, racks the 
           handle, switches it into automatic mode. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        All you have to do is pull the 
                        trigger. Got it? 

           He hands them each a KALASHNIKOV and a MAG OF AMMO. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        When you’re out of ammo --

           He demos.

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        -- grab a new mag, knock the old 
                        one out with it, snap it into 
                        place. 

                                                          THEA
                           LUCY
           Totally got it. 
                                              Easy peasy. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Show me you understand.  

           The girls FAIL. Lucy can’t even knock her mag out. Thea does 
           but it hits the ground, releasing all the bullets.

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Pay attention. Your life depends on 
                        it. 

           Al-Farid LOCKS and LOADS his weapon again. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Got it? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        We’ll figure it out.  

                                 THEA
                        I’m more of an ‘in the moment’ gal.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Good luck. 

           Al-Farid heads out, following the steady stream of ISIS guys 
           out into --

           EXT. THE WOODS SURROUNDING THE COMPOUND

           Muzzle flashes illuminate SALAFIST JIHADIS cresting the 
           ridge. 

           POP! POP! POP!

           More flashes, more Salafists. 

           POP! POP! POP!

           A bullet whizzes past Al-Farid’s head, lodges into a tree 
           behind him. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Fuck this place.  

           He scales a nearby tree -- he sets up sniper-style -- and 
           starts picking off Salafists one by one. 

           BACK IN LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE

           GUN SHOTS draw near. Cries of terrified women ring out.

                                 LUCY
                        We could just hide, right? 

                                 THEA
                        For shizz. 

           As the girls attempt to stuff themselves into an ARMOIRE, 
           Shajeeah storms in. 

                                 SHAJEEAH 
                        My sister, are you ready to prove 
                        yourself in the eyes of Allah?  

                                 THEA
                        Of course! I was just grabbing-
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 SHAJEEAH 
                        MOVE NOW. 

           Thea grabs her Kalashnikov, follows Shajeeah out. 

                                 LUCY
                             (to herself)
                        I’ll be here if you need me. 

           Thea returns, drags Lucy out with her. 

           EXT. COMPOUND

           Shajeeah TUCKS HER GUN into the folds of her burqa. 

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Keep your weapons concealed, your 
                        eyes down. They’re not here for us.

           A pack of Salafists rush passed them -- Shajeeah submissively 
           cowers to the side -- then GUNS DOWN the Salafists from 
           behind. 

                                 THEA
                        Whoa. 

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        You underestimate women, you pay 
                        with your life. 

           Shajeeah kicks the bodies aside, heads deeper into the fray. 

           BACK UP ON THE HILL

           In the impossible darkness, Salafists flood into the camp.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           A Salafist leaps out, SHOOTS WILDLY at Al-Farid. Al-Farid 
           fires back -- the body drops -- and Al-Farid pumps a safety 
           round into the body. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Lunatic. 

           Zaheed runs up alongside Al-Farid.

                                 ZAHEED
                        Brother, cover me. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Flanked by Al-Farid, Zaheed sprints towards a fallen TREE 
           just shy of the ridge -- they crouch behind it -- RELOAD 
           THEIR WEAPONS. A wave of Salafists charge up over the ridge -- 
           Al-Farid and Zaheed fire till their mags are empty.    

           They RELOAD. When the next wave arrives, they hit them again  
           -- and again -- and again -- til the bodies pile so high, it 
           blocks their view. 

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        Our work here is done. 

           They hustle back towards the compound. 

           EXT. COMPOUND

           Lucy and Thea follow Shajeeah as she moves swiftly, firing to 
           clear her path. 

           Lucy and Thea attempt to do the same -- FLINCHING every time 
           they fire -- shooting bullets in EVERY DIRECTION. 

           Twenty yards ahead --

           TWO HOUSES 

           Salafists hide behind one, ISIS, the other, as they engage in 
           a saloon-style SHOOT-OUT -- 

           Lucy, Thea, and Shajeeah run to aid the ISIS Fighters. An AL-
           KHANSAA FIGHTER joins them behind the house -- POPS OPEN A 
           WINDOW -- CLIMBS INSIDE --  MOTIONS for Thea and Lucy to 
           follow. 

           The girls climb inside --

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 AL-KHANSAA FIGHTER
                        When I give the signal, shoot til 
                        no men are left standing. 

           The girls nod in agreement. 

           The Al-Khansaa Fighter grabs a WHITE TOWEL from the kitchen -- 
           opens the front door and waves it in surrender. 

           The shoot-out ceases. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-KHANSAA FIGHTER (CONT’D)
                             (in Arabic)
                        Please, please. I implore you. Let 
                        my daughters and I live. 

           The Al-Khansaa Fighter slowly steps outside, hands raised. 

                                 AL-KHANSAA FIGHTER (CONT’D)
                             (in Arabic)
                        Brothers, we offer ourselves to 
                        you. Take us, enslave us. Just let 
                        us live. 

           The Salafists lower their weapons, emerge from behind the 
           house.

                                 AL-KHANSAA FIGHTER (CONT’D)
                             (in Arabic)
                        Come see what beauties my daughters 
                        behold. 

           A dozen Salafists timidly approach. 

           The Al-Khansaa Fighter turns back to the girls, her FINGER ON 
           THE TRIGGER. As Thea and Lucy take their cue --

           -- the sun GLINTS AND GLIMMERS OFF THE VIPER EMBLAZONED ON 
           THE FIGHTER’S GOLD PLATED AK-47. 

           Thea and Lucy eyes grow wide. JACKPOT. SHE’S THE VIPER.

                                 THE VIPER
                        My daughters, come meet your 
                        destiny in three- 

           Lucy and Thea prepare to fire. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        Two-

           A few of the Salafists straighten their jackets, hoping to 
           impress the girls.  

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        One-

           The Viper, Lucy and Thea kick through the door --

           POP! POP! POP! 

           Salafists hit the ground FIVE AT A TIME. 

           POP! POP! POP! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           ISIS Fighters rush from all sides, cleaning up what’s left.  

           Just then -- Ssssssssst! -- a bullet grazes Lucy’s shoulder. 

                                 LUCY
                        OHMIGOD I’M DEAD! I’m bleeding out 
                        and I’m dead. 

           Thea rushes to her, tries to locate the bullet wound. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I thought we’d have at least sixty 
                        more years of unparalleled 
                        adventures-

           Sssssssst! -- another bullet nearly hits Thea in the neck. 

                                 THEA
                        I’m not gonna let you die. Not 
                        tonight!  

           Thea throws Lucy’s arm over her shoulder, rushing towards 
           safety --

           Ssssssst! --  bullets chase after them.   

           They step over dead bodies, dash around a corner, dodge the 
           bullets hunting them down. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Who is shooting at us? Literally 
                        everyone is dead. 

           Ssssssst! -- another bullet nearly takes them out. They hit 
           the ground.  

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit. 

           Just then, Thea makes eye contact with a Salafist propped up 
           against a wall, PRETENDING TO BE DEAD. 

           Suddenly, he shoots at her.  

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        FUCK! 

           She shoots, hits him, IN THE BALLS -- he hits the ground, 
           screaming. 

                                 LUCY
                        You just murdered that dude’s 
                        balls. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Total accident. I was aiming for 
                        his torso. 

           The girls scan the sea of corpses, discover several “dead” 
           Salafists who also aren’t dead after all -- 

           The wounded Salafists struggle to quickly RELOAD their 
           weapons --

           Thea envelops Lucy in the folds of her burqa -- rolls them 
           under a WHEELBARROW -- yanks a GRENADE from her sleeve. 

           She pulls the pin, tosses it --

           KA-BOOM! 

           Shrapnel can be heard raining down on all sides. 

           Then, SILENCE. 

                                 AL-FARID (O.S.)
                        Lucy! Thea! 

           The girls emerge from under the wheelbarrow. 

                                 LUCY
                        Over here! 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Did you throw that grenade? 

                                 THEA
                        Yes indeed-y. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        That’s some gangster shit right 
                        there. 

                                 LUCY
                        You mess with the best, you go down  
                        like the rest. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Apparently.   

           The rest of the ISIS Fighters approach. 

                                 FIGHTER #1
                        We in the clear? 

                                 FIGHTER #2
                        If any of their men are still here, 
                        they’re dead. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 FIGHTER #3
                        Anyone who came here looking for a 
                        fight, found it. 

           The Viper approaches, grabs a WOUNDED MAN by his HAIR --

                                 THE VIPER 
                        "Fight against them so that Allah 
                        will punish them by your hands and 
                        disgrace them and give you victory 
                        over them.”

           -- and SLITS HIS THROAT. 

           The ISIS guys cheer. Al-Farid nudges the girls to join in. 

                                 THEA
                        Dude, we straight up killaz. 

                                 LUCY
                        I know. I have so many feelings 
                        about it. 

           The Viper grabs a nearby CAN OF GASOLINE, dumps it over a 
           pile of bodies, pulls out a match.  

                                 THE VIPER 
                        I want nothing but the ashes of 
                        these monsters left by the time the 
                        sun rises tomorrow. 

           She lights a match, throws it on the pile -- the men drag 
           dead bodies, throw them on the NOW RAGING PYRE. 

           Shajeeah lets out a WOLF-LIKE CALL -- The Al-Khansaa echo her 
           as they follow The Viper, leaving the men to clean up.     

           Al-Farid prods Thea, she follows the Al-Khansaa towards --

           INT. SITUATION ROOM

           MAPS OF ALEPPO, BLUEPRINTS OF A CITADEL, and A LIST OF NAMES 
           cover the walls. 

           The Viper sits at the head of the table, surrounded by The Al-
           Khansaa. This is the first time their faces are exposed --  
           it’s a hardened, tough, yet stunning bunch. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        I applaud your brutality this 
                        evening. You’ve made me very proud.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Al-Khansaa cheers as Thea secures a spot in the back of 
           the crowded room. Shajeeah hustles her right back out.  

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        You’ll never be one of us. Not even 
                        in the afterlife.  

                                 THEA
                        Remember like, eight minutes ago 
                        when my BFF and I Zero Dark 
                        Thirty’d that firefight? 

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Not really. Run along, now. 

           Shajeeah slams the door in her face. 

                                 THEA
                        So much for sisterhood. 

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE

           Lucy and Al-Farid get ready for bed. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You know you don’t have to “reward 
                        me” in the eyes of Allah or 
                        anything? 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh! Of course.   
                             (then)
                        But, we’re married so technically 
                        you wouldn’t be committing a sin.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Be that as it may, I’m saving 
                        myself for true love.

                                 LUCY
                        Wow. Really? Impressive.
                             (then)
                        Should I sleep on the couch? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Nah. There are no rules against 
                        sleeping beside your fake wife.    

           They climb into bed, lay facing each other.  

                                 LUCY
                        So, are you really American? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                        I am. 

                                 LUCY
                        And you’re Muslim?  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Yes. The good kind. Not the ISIS 
                        kind. 

                                 LUCY
                        Is Al-Farid your real name? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I could tell you, but then I’d have 
                        to kill you. 

           He gently brushes her hair away from her face as they fall 
           asleep gazing into each others’ eyes. 

           TIME LAPSE - ON TO NEXT AM

                                 THEA (O.S)
                        Yo dudes! You up? 

           Lucy and Al-Farid rouse from sleep, their faces even closer 
           than the night before.

                                 AL-FARID
                        Hey. 

                                 LUCY
                        Hi. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You sleep OK? 

                                 LUCY
                        Except for the crushing anxiety 
                        dreams about never seeing my 
                        parents again, sure. 

                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        If you’re busy gettin’ busy I can 
                        come back! 

                                 LUCY
                        Hang on -- 

                                 AL-FARID
                        -- we’re coming! 

           Lucy and Al-Farid get up and join Thea in the -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           MAIN ROOM

                                 THEA
                             (to Al-Farid)
                        I got into the Situation Room last 
                        night! 

                                 AL-FARID
                        How could you tell? 

                                 THEA
                        I was only inside for 18 seconds 
                        but I saw a map and blueprints of 
                        either a building or a submarine. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        A building or a submarine?  

                                 THEA
                        Yeah. It was long and thick in the 
                        middle and then rounded at the top. 
                        Like a dick.  

           Al-Farid washes his face, throws on a shirt. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I guess I’ll spend the day trying 
                        to find out what I can about a 
                        building or a submarine shaped like 
                        a dick. 

                                 THEA
                        Cool. I’ll be trying to impress The 
                        Viper with my GI JANE-like moves.  

                                 LUCY
                        And I’ll try to start an organic 
                        convo with the wives about 
                        Claudia’s whereabouts. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        If shit goes down while I’m gone, 
                        you know where our stash is, and 
                        there’s extra ammo under the sink.  

           Thea and Al-Farid pack up, head out. 

                                 LUCY
                        Be safe, guys! Don’t die and leave 
                        me stranded in this godforsaken 
                        country alone! 

                                 THEA
                        Cross my heart. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 AL-FARID
                        Hope to die. 

           Thea shoots him a look. 

                                 THEA
                        That’s my line. 

           INT. CAVE

           Thirty legless MALE MANNEQUINS propped up across the room. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        SISTERS! 

           In perfect unison, the Al-Khansaa girls step towards the 
           mannequins -- 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        We’ve stood in the shadows long 
                        enough.   

           -- pull MACHETES from their burqas --

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        We must join together and fight.  

           -- raise them up over their heads --

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        And show the world what we’re made 
                        of. 

           -- and with a single,  synchronized swipe --

           THWACK!

           The mannequin heads HIT THE GROUND. 

                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        Dammit! 

           The camera pans to reveal Thea at the end of the line,  
           hacking away at her mannequin. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Use your core.  

           The Al-Khansaa girls shake their heads in disgust as Thea 
           continues to fail.  

                                 THEA
                        This is way harder than it looks. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Viper approaches Thea, wraps her arms around her from 
           behind, coaches her.  

                                 THE VIPER
                        Inhale, draw your sword high above 
                        your head, never breaking eye 
                        contact with your enemy. 

                                 THEA
                        This is some next level shit, man. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Exactly. Your face should be the 
                        last image of reckoning they take 
                        into the next life.

                                 THEA
                        There’s no way I can do this.  

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Whatever you believe is true. 

           Flinching, Thea draws her sword. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        Eye contact! 

           Thea locks eyes with the dummy, freezes. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        DO IT. 

           Thea exhales, summoning all the strength inside her. 

           THWACK! 

           The knife sticks 1/2 way through. 

                                 THEA
                        I told you! I can’t do it! 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Finish what you start.    

                                 THEA
                        I can’t! It’s my biggest personal 
                        challenge. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Whatever you believe is true! 

           Thea exhales and drags the knife the rest of the way through 
           the MANNEQUIN’S NECK. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        Now that’s what I’m talking about. 

                                 THEA
                        I can’t believe I did it. I totally 
                        fucking did it! 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        This is just the beginning. 

                                 THEA
                        What’s up next? 

           MUSIC CUE: “Run the World (GIRLS)” - Beyoncé

           BOSS BITCH TRAINING MONTAGE

           The Viper demonstrates her highly perfected skills -- every 
           move sexy, slick and quick. 

           -SHOOTING .45’S, UZIS & KALASHNIKOV’S 
           -ASSEMBLING BOMBS + SUICIDE VESTS
           -HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

           The first round, Thea attempts to keep up with The Viper 
           while still getting caught, tripping on her burqa. 

           The second, Thea moves deftly but remains a few beats behind 
           The Viper. 

           The third, Thea keeps pace with The Viper, their movements 
           perfectly in sync. It becomes a dance, both girls lost in the 
           moment.  

           Eventually out of breath, the girls take a break, WRITE CUE 
           CARDS FOR HOSTAGES TO READ IN RANSOM VIDEOS.   

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        What’s your long game, Vipe? 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        You’re looking at it. 

                                 THEA
                        Come on! You must have bigger plans 
                        than fighting off low-rent jihadis 
                        the rest of your life. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Soon, while the whole world is 
                        watching, I will obliterate the 
                        glass ceiling that extends beyond 
                        all races, religions and classes, 
                        once and for all. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Sounds awesome! 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Once you prove your worth, I might 
                        have a place for you in my army. 

                                 THEA
                        I’d be honored.  

                                 THE VIPER
                        In the meantime, there’s something 
                        else I want from you...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COMPOUND

           Al-Farid and the other fighters absently troll the internet. 

           Thea struts towards the computers, The Viper and Al-Khansaa 
           in her wake.   

                                 THEA
                        Scram, ya weasels. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Under no circumstances! Get that 
                        overly-confident woman away from 
                        those machines. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        That ‘overly-confident woman’ 
                        possesses an extremely valuable 
                        skill that could prove wildly 
                        beneficial to our organization.

           Al-Farid offers her his chair. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Let’s see it. 

           Thea sits, pulls up TWITTER, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, KIK, 
           WHATSAPP, and PAYPAL. 

                                 THEA
                        Ghosting 101. Watch and learn. 

           Everyone leans in, hanging on her every word -- she logs into 
           her @JHOTTIE Twitter account. She scrolls through her feed, 
           clicks on a MESSAGE on @SYRIANSAMURAI’s page. 

           As Thea gets everyone’s attention, Al-Farid slips out.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        First step, establish contact. 

           CLOSE ON SCREEN, Thea types: Just read the Qu’ran, supes 
           inspired. Also, ur hawt.

           Seconds later, @SYRIANSAMURAI responds: Allah’s blessings are 
           endless for his followers. Please send pic. 

           Thea image searches ‘Tiffani Amber-Thiessen’. She screen 
           grabs, sends. 

                                 MEEK FIGHTER 
                        That’s dishonest! And misleading! 

                                 THEA
                        Like your recruitment tactics? 

           @SYRIANSAMURAI responds: Your beauty holds much wonder and 
           majesty.  

           Thea: (bashful emoji) Would love a prayer rug and add’l 
           religious texts but have no $$ (crying emoji)  

           @SYRIANSAMURAI: What’s your email?  

           Thea: jihottie4life@gmail.com

           Just then, her PAYPAL account DINGS with a notification: 

           CLOSE ON PAYPAL SCREEN: Payment from Nasir Salih - $200  

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        He just gave you money?!?! What a 
                        sucker! 

           Thea: Thank you!!! 

           @SYRIANSAMURAI: Wanna Skype? 

           Thea: YES! I’m v. lonely and looking for connection. 

                                 MEEK FIGHTER
                        If you’re lonely, I can help you. 

                                 THEA
                        Oh, you silly boy. 

           @SYRIANSAMURAI responds: What’s your Skype handle? 

           Thea sits back, puts her feet up on the desk. 

           @SYRIANSAMURAI: 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                        your health and safety. 

                                 THEA

                        But you had a connection!

                        Your blood runs cold like a snake. 

                                 THEA
                        And it’s only getting colder by the 
                        hour.   

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE

           Lucy, Raahima, the ISIS wives eat lunch. 

                                 LUCY
                        What did you ladies do before you 
                        joined ISIS? 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        I was at university. The first in 
                        my family to attend. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        I owned a tea shop with my sister. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 RAAHIMA
                        I took care of my brother’s 
                        children. I’m unable to have my own 
                        so it was a great joy.  

                                 LUCY
                        How did you end up here? Were you 
                        recruited? 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Manipulated is maybe a better way 
                        to describe. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                             (correcting her)
                        Or, tricked? 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        I was straight up kidnapped. 

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know what to say. I’m so 
                        sorry.  

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        Allah presents us challenges so 
                        that we might grow.  

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        That’s one way to look at it.  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Enough about us. You’re American, 
                        from a city, right? 

                                 LUCY
                        How could you tell? 

           They giggle. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Tell us everything about the land 
                        of the free! Home of the brave! 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        What’s it like to have a job? And 
                        pay taxes?  

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        To not live in a one bedroom 
                        apartment with your parents? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 RAAHIMA
                        And to take part in free elections 
                        and vote on matters of importance?

                                 LUCY
                        Thea and I live in NYC and we’re 
                        just, like, making it happen. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        Making what happen? 

                                 LUCY
                        You know, like our dreams and 
                        stuff. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        I’m confused.  

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        What is dreams?  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Like breaking tradition and 
                        building a better future for our 
                        daughters, no?  

                                 LUCY
                             (timidly)
                        Not specifically. I’m more focused 
                        on finding a husband at the present 
                        time. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        WHY!? Husbands are the worst. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        Seriously, take mine. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Or mine! 

                                 ISIS WIFE #2
                        I’m not kidding. You can have him. 
                        I hate him so much.   

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                        What is it with you Americans? All 
                        you care about is getting married 
                        and making tiny videos about it. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry, what? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 ISIS WIFE #1 
                        Yeah, like, “I was a Drunken 
                        Clown’s Bride” or “I was a Taco 
                        Bell Bride”. Who cares?  

                                 LUCY
                        You know Claudia!  

           Raahima throws ISIS Wife #1 a look as she stands and clears 
           their plates.  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Come, come sisters. It’s almost 
                        time for salat. 

                                 LUCY
                        Please don’t go!  

           The women gather their belongings, begin to head out. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        We can talk about something else. 
                        Please just stay! 

           Raahima ushers the women out, nods to Lucy. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Tusbih äalaa khayr.  

                                 LUCY
                        Tusbih äalaa khayr. 

           ISIS Wife #1 lags behind the others. 

                                 ISIS WIFE #1
                             (whispering)
                        Be careful. Women who make tiny 
                        videos end up in tiny jail cells. 

                                 LUCY
                        They do? Where? 

           ISIS Wife #1 guides Lucy’s gaze toward the MAIN COMPOUND.

           EXT. COMPOUND 

           Al-Farid stealthily makes his way towards --

           THE SITUATION ROOM

           He cases the joint. He peers through an OPAQUE WINDOW cracked 
           open -- IT’S EMPTY. He pulls out his cellphone to take pics --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 ZAHEED (O.S.)
                        Brother, do you not find value in 
                        the arrogant American girl’s 
                        computer lesson?  

           Al-Farid palms his cell as Zaheed approaches.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        The scheming of women is of little 
                        importance to me.   

                                 ZAHEED
                        Only fools underestimate a woman’s 
                        power. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        How so? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Their beauty grants them their 
                        cruelty. Were they less beguiling 
                        we’d have more control.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Is it not a man’s world?  

                                 ZAHEED
                        Only because of the great lengths 
                        we’ve gone to oppress them, 
                        convince them of their weaknesses, 
                        deprive them of opportunities.      

                                 AL-FARID
                        It’s pretty impressive when you 
                        think about it. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        It’s only a matter of time until 
                        they take what’s theirs. 

           Zaheed leads Al-Farid away. 

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Thea and Al-Farid undress for bed, trying to respect the 
           other’s privacy. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I don’t mind sleeping on the couch 
                        if you need some alone time to 
                        decompress.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LUCY
                        I’d feel safer if we were in the 
                        same room. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Of course. 

           They climb into bed together, lay nose-to-nose, their 
           attraction heavy in the night air.  

                                 LUCY
                        So. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        So. 

           Suddenly, a WOMAN, completely covered in a burqa, appears 
           beside the bed, Paranormal Activity-style. 

           Al-Farid FREAKS. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        HoMiGod! 

                                 LUCY
                        What?! 

           She turns over, sees the woman.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Sweet Jesus! 

           The Woman removes the top layer of her garment -- it’s Thea.

                                 THEA
                        What up, homies? 

                                 LUCY
                        What’re you doing here? 

                                 THEA 
                        Reporting on The Viper’s imminent 
                        mission. She wants me to be a part 
                        of it...not to brag. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Nice work! What, when, where? 

                                 THEA
                        Working on it. You get the DL on 
                        Claudia?  

                                 LUCY
                        She’s somewhere in that direction. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Lucy gestures to the north. 

                                 THEA
                        Cool. Now can I get a little one-on-
                        one with my #1 or what? 

           As Al-Farid climbs out of bed, Thea climbs in.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Just a heads up. If the Al-Khansaa 
                        catches you two in bed together, 
                        you’ll be stoned to death in the 
                        town square. 

                                 THEA
                        Gimme a solid twenty and you can go 
                        back to being big spoon.  

           As Al-Farid leaves, Thea snuggles up to Lucy. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Now THIS is what I’m talking about. 

                                 LUCY
                        He’s cute, right? 

                                 THEA
                        Super cute. 

                                 LUCY
                        Are spies allowed to date regular 
                        people? 

                                 THEA
                        I think so.    

                                 LUCY
                        Cool. 

                                 THEA
                        OK, so this may sound crazy, but 
                        The Viper is the mentor I’ve always 
                        dreamt of. She’s forcing me to 
                        learn all the life lessons I’ve 
                        avoided. My sense-of-self is legit 
                        off the hook right now.  

                                 LUCY
                        This trip is totally our Eat, Pray, 
                        Love. 

                                 THEA
                        Yeah but, like, meets Apocalypse 
                        Now.

                                 THEA (CONT'D)
                             (a beat)
                        I should go. Don’t wanna get stoned 
                        in the town square tomorrow. 

                                 LUCY
                        I never thought I’d hear you say 
                        that. 

                                 THEA
                        Love you, bro. 

                                 LUCY
                        Love you, too. 

                                 THEA
                             (to Al-Farid)
                        Get back in here, Fake Husband-of-
                        the-Year. 

           Al-Farid and Thea pass in the doorway. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Hurt her and I’ll murder you with 
                        my bare hands --
                             (smiles)
                        -- a crime I’m now capable of, 
                        thanks to you. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Copy that. 

           Al-Farid crawls back into bed with Lucy. 

                                 THEA
                        Good night, you crazy kids. 

                                 LUCY/AL-FARID
                        ‘Night! 

           Thea heads out, blows out the candle illuminating the house. 

           A QUICK SERIES OF SCENES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 

           - Thea continues her WEAPONS TRAINING alongside The Viper. 

           - Lucy performs CHORES alongside the wives. 

           - Al-Farid sneaks around, tries various doors, stairways, and 
           passages, trying to locate CLAUDIA’S CELL.   

           - The Al-Khansaa practice GHOSTING on the unsuspecting 
           fighters. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           - At MEALS, PRAYER TIME, and IN PASSING, Lucy, Thea and Al-
           Farid all exchange subtle nods regarding no new information. 

           - Suspicious, Zaheed has his eyes on our crew at all times. 

           EXT. MARKETPLACE, RAQQA 

           Toyotas filled with ISIS Fighters tear through the streets. 
           Men, women and children DIVE FOR COVER. 

           IN THE LEAD TRUCK, Thea drives, and The Viper sits shotgun. 

           Zaheed pulls alongside them. 

                                 ZAHEED 
                        You’re sure they’ve got the 
                        prisoner?  

                                 THE VIPER 
                        The last man who questioned me 
                        lived just long enough for his 
                        childhood to pass before his eyes. 

           Zaheed pulls ahead, shouting orders. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The trucks screech to a halt, and DUST CLOUDS fill the air-- 
           like phantoms, the ISIS fighters, Thea and The Viper emerge 
           from the CLOUDS, weapons drawn. 

           They enter --

           AN ABANDONED COURTYARD

           The group gets SILENT, SUPER-INTENSE, as they cross the 
           courtyard.  

           They DEAD-END at a LARGE DOOR. The Viper throws her weight 
           against it -- no dice. Zaheed steps up, shakes it violently -- 
           nothing. Thea pushes through, fixes a BLASTER on the door --   

                                 THEA
                        Stand back. 

           Everyone obeys. 

           BOOM! -- the blaster flashes, the door falls off its hinges. 
           The Viper & Co. flood the building, searching. 

           INSIDE
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           SCREAMS call out in every direction. 

           They rush into a BEDROOM -- WOMEN cower in a corner, freaking 
           out -- Zaheed PISTOL WHIPS the loudest, out cold. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Was that completely necessary? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Yes. 

           The ISIS Fighters tear through each room, searching.  

                                 FIGHTER #1 
                        Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.  

                                 ZAHEED
                        Come out, come out wherever you 
                        are. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Your final destiny awaits. 

           The group rounds the corner to a DARKENED ROOM -- a figure 
           crouches in a corner. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Pile of gold. 

                                 THEA
                        You mean “jackpot”? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        I mean whatever the fuck I just 
                        said. 

           Zaheed pulls a HOOD from his pocket, moves toward the figure. 

                                 THEA
                             (to The Viper)
                        What did that person do? 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Nothing yet. Their purpose awaits. 

           As Zaheed is about to place the HOOD on the figure -- 

           CREAK! 

           Thea blinks. Suddenly disoriented, her eyes pop open --

           Zaheed’s in her room! SHE’S THE FIGURE! Her NIGHTMARE becomes 
           a REALITY as a HOOD is thrown over her head.  
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           IN THE DARKNESS, sounds fill the void -- boots crunching over 
           leaves and twigs -- 

                                 THEA
                        Dude, careful. Sticks and stones 
                        WILL break my bones.  

           -- boots on pavement -- a door swings open -- VELCRO -- a gun 
           gets LOCKED & LOADED --  

           BEEP, BEEP -- a timer starts.  

                                 ZAHEED
                        Good luck. 

           The door SLAMS behind her. Thea removes her hood -- she’s 
           inside --

           AN ARTILLERY CAVE 

           She looks down at the SMITH & WESSON .45 in her hand, a 
           SUICIDE BOMB-VEST strapped to her body, its timer counting 
           down --

           ...01:59, 01:58, 01:57...

                                 THEA
                        Fuck me --

           MUSIC CUE: “Let the Bodies Hit the Floor” - Drowning Pool

           Two AL-KHANSAAS sprint towards her, SHOOTING-TO-KILL. 

           Thea bends to one knee, aims -- 

           POP! POP! 

           She takes out each with a single bullet to the chest. Before 
           the bodies hit the ground, two more come at her from either 
           side. 

           POP! POP! 

           Two more down, tons to go. 

           THREE AL-KHANSAA drop from the rafters. 

           POP! POP! POP! 

           Murdered in mid-air.  

           Suddenly, an AL-KHANSAA grabs her from behind. Thea flips her 
           over -- BANG! -- and shoots her in the chest, point-blank. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           She looks down at her vest -- 01:29, 01:28, 01:27 -- she 
           cocks her gun again -- it’s empty.  

           Another AL-KHANSAA rushes towards her. 

                                 AL-KHANSAA 
                        AHHHHHHHHH! 

           Thea swoops down, kicks out her legs from underneath her. 

           BAM! -- they hit the ground, grapple -- Thea can’t get a grip 
           on the Al-Khansaa -- FUCK! With a sharp exhale, Thea forces 
           herself behind the Al-Khansaa -- SNAP! -- her head falls 
           limp. 

           Thea grabs the Al-Khansaa’s UZI. 

           ...00:45, 00:44, 00:43...

           The lights overhead start to flicker -- 

           POP! POP! POP! -- bullets rain down on all sides. 

           Thea fires back until she’s out of ammo. 

           CHAOS, dust everywhere. 

           Thea hits the floor, drags the dead AL-KHANSAA’S into a pile 
           and buries herself underneath them for protection. 

           She wrestles away their weapons, double-fisting the  
           KALASHNIKOVS, shooting til each weapon is out of bullets. 

           ...00:18, 00:17, 00:16...

           Silence. She looks down at the timer. 

           ...00:11, 00:11, 00:10...

           She yanks the BOMB from the vest, inspects it. She takes a 
           deep breath, cuts the RED CORD with her teeth -- the timer 
           doesn’t stop. 

           She braces for the blast. 

           ...00:02, 00:01, 00:00...

           BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

           Nothing -- Thea looks around -- Is she dead? WTF? 

                                 THEA
                        No, seriously. What the fuck? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           A SLOW CLAP starts behind her. Thea turns to find The Viper 
           applauding her. 

           The Al-Khansaa littering the floor begin to stir. Struggling 
           to breathe, they UNSTRAP the BULLETPROOF VESTS from under 
           their burqas.  

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Explain to me again why we don’t 
                        force the men to take our place in 
                        this exercise? 

                                 THE VIPER
                        They’re not as skilled as you. 
                        They’d end up dead.

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        I think we should at least explore 
                        the option. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Perhaps. 
                             (to Thea)
                        You’re ready for your next 
                        challenge. Come.

           Thea follows The Viper and the rest of the Al-Khansaa out.  

                                 SHAJEEAH
                        Although it pains me to say it, you 
                        killed it in there. 

                                 THEA
                        Thanks, Shaj. I consider that a 
                        huge compliment considering your 
                        contempt for me. 

           Shajeeah pats her on the back. Thea BEAMS. She’s officially 
           one of the pack. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           On the conference table sits a MINI REPLICA OF ALEPPO. TINY 
           WOODEN FEMALE FIGURES WEARING SUICIDE VESTS are lined up on 
           the steps of the Citadel. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        We still on schedule?  

                                 AL-KHANSAA 
                        My source within the Citadel 
                        confirmed The Council of Ministers 
                        meeting at 7AM tomorrow.   
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THE VIPER
                        Allah will watch from the heavens 
                        as our righteous army ushers in a 
                        new era of equality and respect.   

                                 THEA
                        I have to say, I’m super honored to 
                        be making ‘herstory’ with you. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Good. 

           The Viper holds up a SUICIDE BOMB-VEST. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause you’re going to ignite the 
                        revolution.

           The Al-Khansaa break out CHEERING. Thea does not. 

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPOUND

           The CHEERS from the Situation Room catch Al-Farid’s 
           attention. He sprints toward it. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM

           The Al-Khansaa buzzes with last minute preparations. Thea 
           pulls The Viper into a corner.     

                                 THEA
                        I gotta be honest...martyrdom 
                        doesn’t feel like a great fit for 
                        me.  

                                 THE VIPER
                        Thea, I take great pride in the 
                        woman you’ve become since you 
                        arrived. But you’ve maxed out your 
                        potential in a very short time. 
                        This is an opportunity to stop 
                        while you’re ahead to serve the 
                        greater good. 

                                 THEA
                        But-

                                 THE VIPER
                             (cutting her off)
                        No more. THIS is how your debt gets 
                        paid. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Viper dramatically turns to rejoin the pack, her burqa 
           smacking Thea in the face.  

           EXT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CLICK! -- Al-Farid feverishly snaps pics of the Al-Khansaa 
           and the blueprints covering the walls. 

                                 ZAHEED (O.S.)
                        That for your Instgram?  

                                 AL-FARID
                        No, man. Facebook. 

           Al-Farid turns, swings at Zaheed -- Zaheed ducks, pops back 
           up -- WHACK! -- smashes Al-Farid’s throat with the HEEL OF 
           HIS HAND -- Al-Farid’s phone flies from his hand. 

           Gasping, Al-Farid charges Zaheed -- for a moment, both are 
           suspended midair -- THUD! -- Al-Farid struggles to get the 
           upper hand -- POW! POW! POW! -- Al-Farid pummels Zaheed’s 
           gnarly face.  

           Zaheed grasps wildly at Al-Farid. Gripping his throat, he 
           CHOKES HIM OUT. As Al-Farid squirms, Zaheed muscles himself 
           on top of Al-Farid. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        You are CIA, no? Just like your 
                        friend? 

           Al-Farid jerks forward, HEAD BUTTS Zaheed. Zaheed slumps to 
           the side. Al-Farid swiftly locks him in a SLEEPER HOLD, pulls 
           a gun from an ANKLE HOLSTER, points it at Zaheed’s head.   

                                 AL-FARID
                        Yeah. And this is for what you did 
                        to him. 

           Before Al-Farid can pull the trigger, the gun is KICKED from 
           his hand. He turns to find the entire Al-Khansaa training 
           their AKs on him.  

           The Viper steps forward. Thea, close behind her, makes eye 
           contact with Al-Farid -- he directs Thea’s attention to his 
           cellphone just to the left of her foot.   

                                 THE VIPER 
                        What do we have here, gentlemen? 

                                 ZAHEED
                        He’s CIA, like his dead friend. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Al-Khansaa SHOUT, KICK DIRT in Al-Farid’s face. 

           Amid the chaos, in the deftest of moves, Thea SWAPS OUT HER 
           CELL for Al-Farid’s. 

                                 THE VIPER

           Zaheed grabs the cell as Al-Khansaa whisks Al-Farid away. 

                                 THEA
                        Where’re you sending him? 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        To his death. 

           INT. CAVE JAIL

           A Game of Thrones-esque series of small, dark jail cells 
           built into a giant cave. Lots of MICE, SCREAMS, DARKNESS.  

           Zaheed shoves Al-Farid into a cell. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        I’ll keep an eye on your wife for 
                        you while you’re gone.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        Leave her out of this. 

                                 ZAHEED
                        Not a chance. 

           Zaheed lets out a throaty, villainous LAUGH as he locks the 
           cell and exits. 

           From deep within the cell --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’re married? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Kinda. You?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not at the moment. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Divorced? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Divorced, split, dissolved, 
                        annulled, separated...been there, 
                        done that too many times to count. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Sorry to hear that. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Eh, don’t be. It’s part of my job. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Your job? 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        At Vice. 

           The woman emerges from the shadows. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Claudia! You’re alive! 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not for very much longer. 

           A SCREAM rings out, as does the sound of someone BARFING. 

           Al-Farid snaps into full-on CIA mode.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        What information did you hand off 
                        to Hemsworth? 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Details on The Viper’s plot to 
                        overthrow the Syrian government and  
                        become the first female dictator in 
                        history.

                                 AL-FARID
                        How, exactly? 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        With a few, well-placed explosive 
                        devices.

                                 AL-FARID
                        You know this for a fact? 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Absolutely. I helped her plan it. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           EXT. COMPOUND

           Zaheed takes Al-Farid’s cell from his pocket, snaps it open, 
           starts flipping through the photos.  

                                 ZAHEED
                        What in Allah’s name-?!?!

           CLOSE ON PHONE, dozens of BLURRY SCROTUM PICS.

           Embarrassed, infuriated, and confused, he snaps it closed.  

           INT. LUCY AND AL-FARID’S HOUSE

           Lucy and the wives sit in a circle. Lucy reads to the women 
           from an O Magazine. 

                                 LUCY
                             (reading)
                        “Whatever’s going on in your life, 
                        it’s your duty to listen to your 
                        spiritual GPS. Embrace it. Hear it. 
                        Know it. Honor it.”

           Thea bursts through the door. 

                                 THEA
                        Great issue. There’s a home remedy 
                        for yeast infections on page 74 
                        that’s a total gamechanger. 
                             (to Lucy)
                        Can I talk to you for a sec? 

           Lucy excuses herself, follows Thea into --

           THE BEDROOM

                                 THEA
                        Zaheed busted Al-Farid. They know 
                        he’s CIA. He’s either been executed 
                        or is about to be. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do they know about us? 

                                 THEA
                        If they did, I think we’d be right 
                        there with him. 

                                 LUCY
                        What do we do? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Do the wives trust you?

                                 LUCY
                        I hope so.    

           Thea and Lucy rush back into --

           THE LIVING ROOM

           -- and huddle-up with the wives. 

                                 THEA
                        Ladies, I hate to interrupt your

                        Viper specifically keeps her VIP 
                        prisoners, you have to tell us.

                        She’s got Al-Farid locked up and 
                        he’s our only chance of escaping 
                        this nightmare alive. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Of you escaping this nightmare 
                        alive. What about us? Why should we 
                        risk our lives, the lives of our 
                        children, to help girls who steal 
                        on internet?

                        Best case scenario, you escape, go 
                        back to America, make tiny video 
                        about the horrors of ISIS while we 
                        remain prisoners of these men, of

                        They’re right. Why should they risk 
                        their lives to help us? They have 
                        families and careers and educations 
                        to get back to. We should be trying

                        of here, we’ll help get these women

                        In all fairness, my English isn’t

                        It’s not happening. Everyone out. 
                             (to Thea)
                        Except you. Take a seat. 

           The room clears. The Viper sits at the head of the conference 
           table, puts her feet up, pulls a VIRGINIA SLIM from her 
           burqa, lights it, takes a long drag.

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        You think you’re so smart. 

                                 THEA
                        Ish.  

                                 THE VIPER
                        Clever, maybe. But not smart. I’m 
                        smart. I had dreams of going to 
                        school, becoming a veterinarian 
                        until Taliban fighters kidnapped me 
                        from my family when I was 12. 

           FLASHBACK: The Young Viper taken from her family during 
           dinner by a group of Taliban fighters. 

                                 THE VIPER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        For seven years, I was shuffled 
                        from fighter to fighter. Always 
                        keeping my mouth shut, my eyes 
                        open. Learning the inner workings 
                        of their organization. 

           FLASHBACK: The Young Viper sits stoic among Taliban fighters 
           as they talk. BASHIR enters, sizes her up and takes her away. 

                                 THE VIPER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        At 19, I was sold to a man named 
                        Abu Bashir for two goats and a 
                        round of ammo. Bashir was no 
                        ordinary man, he was smart as a 
                        dolphin, vicious as a jellyfish. 

           FLASHBACK: Bashir sits rapt as the Young Viper talks at him. 

                                 THE VIPER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He quickly discovered I was no 
                        ordinary girl. I knew the hearts of 
                        men better than he. Their 
                        blindspots, their weakness. A week 
                        later we were married and moved 
                        onto the compound. 

                                 THEA
                        THIS compound?

                                 THE VIPER 
                        Yep. I was officially married to 
                        the head of ISIS. 

                                 THEA
                        That’s bananas. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        One night, Abu left for battle and 
                        never returned. I was faced with a 
                        choice: get in line for another 
                        husband, or fight for what I’d 
                        earned. So, that night I snuck into 
                        the chambers of all the top 
                        officials --  

           FLASHBACK: The Young Viper sneaking into bedrooms of sleeping 
           ISIS leaders.

                                 THE VIPER (V.O.) 
                        -- and slit their throats to the 
                        bone. 

           FLASHBACK: The Young Viper slitting throats. 

                                 THEA
                        That’s baller-as-hell.  

           The Viper unlocks her ARTILLERY CACHE filled with ASSORTED 
           GUNS EMBLAZONED WITH A VIPER. She packs them into a HUGE 
           DUFFLE BAG. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        I claimed my place at the head of 
                        our cell and have since dedicated 
                        my energies towards equality in our

                        Women will remain second-class 
                        citizens until we seize our power 
                        and refuse to give it back. 

                                 THEA
                        Amen, girl.

           Lucy tries to escape but Zaheed scoops her up over his 
           shoulder, unlocks the cell, throws her inside.

                             (to Al-Farid)
                        Do something! 

                                 AL-FARID
                        My hands are literally tied! 

                                 LUCY
                             (to Thea)
                        Thea, look at me. Tell me what’s 
                        happening! 

           Thea steels herself, LOCKS and LOADS her weapon.  

                                 THEA
                        The Viper presented me with a very 
                        solid business opportunity I’d be 
                        foolish not to take. So -- 

           Thea places the BARREL OF THE GUN on her best friend’s 
           temple. 

                                 LUCY
                        Ohmigod this is happening. I can’t 
                        believe this is happening. 

                                 THEA
                        Reasons why you’ll always be my 
                        Ride or Die. 

                                 LUCY
                        I always include you in my takeout 
                        orders.  

                                 THEA
                        You know the exact amount of 
                        Chardonnay I can handle. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m the only person who can take a 
                        decent photo of you. 

                                 THEA
                        And, our Crimson Tides were synced 
                        BEFORE we even met. Which means...

                                 LUCY
                        It’s that time of the month. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Exactly.
                             (to Lucy)
                        May I? 

           Lucy puts her hip forward, signaling, “In my pocket.” 

                                 ZAHEED 
                        Oh, COME ON! 

           Thea digs under the burqa, pulls the TAMP-BOMB from Lucy’s 
           pocket, unwraps it. 

                                 ZAHEED (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna use it now? 

                                 THEA
                        Hell YEAH. 

           BAM! -- she detonates the TAMP-BOMB in his face, blowing it 
           off completely. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                             (to Al-Farid)
                        Do you think the CIA would let me 
                        sell a version of these on my 
                        TamPots website? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I’ll look into it.  

           Thea grabs the KEYS from Zaheed’s belt, her cellphone from 
           his pocket, unshackles her friends. 

                                 LUCY
                        What now? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        We go to Aleppo, cut the head off 
                        that snake. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS: the gang rounds up the remaining AK-47’s, 
           UZI’s, PISTOLS, WALKIE-TALKIES, and throws them into a truck, 
           then speeds towards --

           EXT. ALEPPO, SYRIA 

           The gang drives through the once-magnificent ancient city now 
           devastated by constant civil war.   
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        Is this all ISIS’ doing? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Mostly. Of the 1,000 opposition 
                        groups fighting for control of the 
                        region, ISIS has done the most 
                        damage.   

                                 LUCY
                        Unbelievable.   

           A LARGE FORTIFIED PALACE rises high above the city. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        That’s the Citadel. If you want to 
                        knock out everyone in power, that’s 
                        where you’d do it. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Exactly. Once The Viper eliminates 
                        the Council of Ministers, no one 
                        can stop her from becoming 
                        dictator.  

           Al-Farid drives across the ENTRANCE BLOCK --

           INT. CITADEL 

           -- and into a breathtaking assemblage of ancient 
           architecture. The townspeople milling about give it an almost 
           fairy tale-like feel.  

           INSIDE THE TRUCK

           The gang scans the area -- nothing out of the ordinary -- The 
           Viper and the Al-Khansaa are nowhere to be seen. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Anything suspicious? 

                                 THEA
                        Nothing. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nothing. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not a thing. 

           Just then, Lucy recognizes one of the ISIS Wives. Then 
           another. Then Raahima walking towards the AYYUBID PALACE. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Lucy jumps out of the truck, rushes towards Raahima. 

                                 LUCY
                        What’re you doing here? 

           Raahima presses forward. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        You must leave at once. 

                                 LUCY
                        Raahima, please tell me what’s 
                        going on!  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Not even you can help us now, my 
                        sweet friend. Herstory has been set 
                        in motion. 

                                 LUCY
                        But I might be able to stop it if I 
                        know what’s happening. 

           Raahima hugs Lucy. Lucy’s hands detect something on Raahima, 
           moves her hands down Raahima’s back. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Ohmigod. 

           Tears fall from Raahima’s eyes as she shakes Lucy off, 
           hurries away. 

           Lucy runs to ISIS Wife #1 hugs her, moving her hands along 
           her back. She does the same with ISIS Wife #2. 

           Lucy sprints back to the gang.  

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        They’re strapped with suicide 
                        bombs. All of them. 

                                 THEA
                        What in life are we supposed to do?  

                                 LUCY
                        We have to get those girls out of 
                        those vest!  

                                 AL-FARID
                        If anyone can talk them out of 
                        those vests, it’s you. Once they’re 
                        off, you get them to me, I’ll get 
                        them out of here. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        What about me? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        You’re gonna take out The Viper --

                                 THEA
                        All by myself? 

                                 AL-FARID
                        -- before she detonates the bombs. 
                        Claudia, you-

           Before he can finish his sentence, Claudia is out the door, 
           BOOKING IT towards a TOWER overlooking the PALACE. 

                                 THEA/LUCY/AL-FARID
                        What the-?

           Thea jumps out of the car --

                                 AL-FARID
                        Wait! 

           Al-Farid throws Thea an UZI and a WALKIE-TALKIE. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        Thea, look at me.  

           They lock eyes. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got this. 

                                 THEA
                        I do? 
                             (then)
                        Yeah! Of course I do! 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Gimme your cell. 

           She throws it to him. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                        GO! 

                                 THEA
                        See you on the flipside, bitches! 

           Thea chases after Claudia. Lucy and Al-Farid take off in the 
           direction of the wives. 

           UP AHEAD
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Claudia beelines for the TOWER. 

           Thea, in full badass mode, LEAPS over small children, 
           SIDESTEPS animals, SLIDES down railings, trying to catch up 
           to her. 

           Claudia ducks into --

           THE TOWER

           -- sprints hard up the spiral staircase.  

           Seconds later, Thea, close behind, takes stairs three at a 
           time -- huffing and puffing. She stops at a window for air -- 
           in the distance, she spots the ISIS WIVES lining the balcony 
           of the PALACE. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

           HIGH UP INSIDE THE TOWER

           The Viper trains her BINOCULARS on the ISIS Wives. The Al-
           Khansaa check and recheck their weapons one last time. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        After the bomb detonates, we’ll 
                        have to verify The Council is 
                        completely decimated.  

           Claudia awkwardly tumbles in through the door.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (breathing hard)
                        I’m here. To help. Let me be your 
                        co-pilot. Your #2. Your anything! 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        You’re supposed to be dead. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I get it now. You’re right. You 
                        were always right. The only way to 
                        achieve any sort of equality in 
                        this life is to literally blow 
                        everything up and start over. 

                                 THE VIPER 
                        You crossed me once. 

           With that, The Viper SHOOTS HER POINT-BLANK. 

           RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Thea hears EVERYTHING. Cautiously she peers out the window, 
           sees GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS walking up the PALACE STEPS. 

           ON THE BALCONY

           The ISIS Wives stand trembling, preparing for the inevitable. 
           Suddenly, TINY FLECKS OF LIGHT dance across their faces. They 
           look around, searching for the source of the irritation --    

           It’s Lucy! -- she uses the MIRRORED COMPACT TO flash sunlight 
           into their eyes. 

                                 LUCY
                        Let us help you!  

                                 RAAHIMA 
                             (under her breath)
                        The Viper is watching. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Which is why we’re gonna keep it 
                        real chill so she doesn’t suspect 
                        anything. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        If we don’t go through with it, 
                        she’ll execute us either way. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        We’re not gonna let that happen. 

                                 LUCY
                        You guys, Al-Farid is in the CIA. 

           A mix of SHOCK, AWE, RELIEF, EXCITEMENT, fill the wives’ 
           faces. 

                                 ISIS WIVES
                        WHAT?! / Really? / Praise Allah! 

                                 LUCY
                        He’s gonna get you out of here and 
                        reunite you with your families, so 
                        do exactly what he says. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Ladies, keep your eyes forward and 
                        very, very carefully reach under 
                        your burqas, and very, very 
                        carefully remove those vests. 

           Ninja-like, the Wives reach under their burqas -- the sounds 
           of VELCRO RIPPING fills the balcony. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           HIGH ABOVE IN THE TOWER

           Through binoculars, The Viper surveys the ISIS Wives -- they 
           appear FROZEN, TERRIFIED. She moves her focus to the 
           GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ascending the steps.  

                                 THE VIPER 
                             (giddy)
                        It’s almost time. 

           ON THE BALCONY 

           TENSIONS ARE HIGH AS FUCK. 

           The Wives barely breathe -- sweat beads at their temples --
           terrified they’ll detonate. They delicately shimmy out of the 
           vests -- 

                                 LUCY
                        You guys are doing great. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Just breathe.

           -- and gingerly they step from the vests --  

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Ahhh! 

           Raahima stumbles, starts to fall backwards -- Al-Farid hits 
           the ground, army crawls to her, steadies her.  

                                 AL-FARID
                        I got you. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Nothing in my life is ever as I 
                        expect. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        I know but we’re gonna get you out 
                        of here. Just a few more seconds, 
                        okay? 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Okay. 

           With that, Al-Farid swipes up her vest -- disconnects TWO RED 
           WIRES. 

           Quicker than a coked-up Jack Bauer, he moves down the line, 
           disconnecting the same two wires on every vest.  

           IN THE TOWER
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Through binoculars, The Viper watches as the final officials 
           enter the Palace. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        Bring me the detonator. 

           RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR

           Her eyes trained on the balcony, Thea sends good vibes -- 

                                 THEA
                             (under her breath)
                        Come on, come on, come on! --

           IN THE TOWER

           Shajeeah hands The Viper the DETONATOR. The entire Al-Khansaa 
           joins her at the window to witness the explosion. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        So long, patriarchy. See you in 
                        hell. 

           The Viper presses down HARD on the detonator.  

           RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR

           Hearing the detonator click, Thea flinches. 

           IN THE TOWER

           No explosion. Nothing. Nada. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck? 

           ON THE BALCONY 

           The wives slowly begin to exit. 

           STAIRWELL OF PALACE

           Al-Farid tears down the steps, the vests piled high around 
           his neck, in his arms. 

           He radios Thea on the WALKIE-TALKIE. 

                                 AL-FARID
                             (into walkie)
                        Get The Viper into the palace STAT. 

           IN THE TOWER 

           Thea KICKS IN THE DOOR -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA
                        What up, queens? 

           -- to find The Viper banging the detonator against the table. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        This piece of shit just ruined my 
                        whole fucking mission. 

                                 THEA
                        Not even. I say we have some fun 
                        and take ‘em out the old fashioned 
                        way.

           Thea COCKS HER UZI. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        That’s my girl. 
                             (to Al-Khansaa)
                        Let’s do this. 

           The Al-Khansaa grab their weapons, follow Thea and The Viper 
           out. 

           INT. STAIRWELL

           Fast and furiously, Al-Farid RECONNECTS THE RED WIRES on the 
           SUICIDE VESTS. Then, he whips out THEA’S PHONE and opens the 
           CAMERA APP. 

           INT. GREAT HALL, AYYUBID PALACE

           A gorgeous, two-story room reminiscent of the US House of 
           Representatives. The COUNCIL OF MINISTERS sits rapt by the 
           HEAD MINISTER’s words.  

                                 HEAD MINISTER
                        Our region is experiencing the most 
                        severe threat of destruction since 
                        the Middle Ages. Now, more than 
                        ever-

           Lucy and the ISIS WIVES flood into the hall, FREAKING OUT. 

                                 HEAD MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        Council is in session, sisters. 

                                 ISIS WIVES
                        Help us! / You’re our only hope! / 
                        Please! / We don’t want to die! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 HEAD MINISTER 
                        Whatever concerns you have- 

           Lucy sprints to the Head Minister’s side. 

                                 LUCY
                        ISIS is legit on their way to 
                        attack you as we speak. 

           His microphone picks up her every word, throwing the place 
           into COMPLETE CHAOS. 

                                 HEAD MINISTER
                        WHAT? 

                                 LUCY
                        The Viper is here -- 

                                 HEAD MINISTER
                             (suddenly terrified)
                        The Viper? 

                                 LUCY
                        -- she just tried to level this 
                        place with a truckload of suicide 
                        bombs. She’s on her way now to 
                        finish the job.  

           EXT. AYYUBID PALACE

           Like a hungry lioness, The Viper stalks through the Citadel 
           with Thea and Al-Khansaa in her wake. Cloaked in their 
           burqas, AK-47’s slung over their shoulders, they’re TERROR 
           INCARNATE.    

           INSIDE THE GREAT HALL

           It’s full-on MAYHEM. The council is on their feet, trying to 
           figure out what to do with the wives. 

           OUTSIDE

           The Viper and Co. scale the steps of the palace. They file 
           into --

           A LONG CORRIDOR 

           -- leading toward --

           THE GREAT HALL

           The Viper KICKS through the doors --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THE VIPER
                        Prepare to-

           Stunned, The Viper takes in the COMPLETELY EMPTY HALL. 

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        FIND THEM! 

           The Al-Khansaa spreads out, searching everywhere -- UNDER 
           TABLES, INSIDE CABINETS, BEHIND CURTAINS. The Viper furiously 
           joins -- THROWING CHAIRS, FLIPPING TABLES. 

                                 AL-FARID 
                        It’s over. 

           Everyone stops dead in their tracks, turns to Al-Farid. 

                                 AL-FARID (CONT’D)
                             (to The Viper)
                        For what’s it worth, your ability 
                        to lead a terrorist organization is 
                        the most impressive I’ve ever 
                        encounter. 

                                 THEA
                        You’re one boss bitch, Vipe.  

           The Viper POINTS and SCREAMS at Thea and Al-Farid. 

                                 THE VIPER
                        GET THEM! 

           The Al-Khansaa RUSHES FULL SPEED in their direction. 

           Al-Farid and Thea take two steps back through the doors -- 
           SLAM them SHUT, RUN FLAGPOLES through the HANDLES, securing 
           them closed. 

           Then, Al-Farid and Thea RUN FOR THEIR GODDAMN LIVES.

           INSIDE THE GREAT HALL 

           Just then --

           A “Who run the world? Girls!” ringtone sounds from above.  

           Everyone freezes. 

           Again -- “Who run the world? Girls!” 

           The Viper looks towards the sound, high overhead at --

           THE MEZZANINE 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Viper flies up the staircase lining the wall, the Al-
           Khansaa inches behind her. At the top SHE TRIPS, looks down -- 
           IT’S A SUICIDE VEST. 

           “Who run the world? Girls!” rings out again -- 

           All eyes fall upon THEA’S PHONE, atop the GIANT PILE OF 
           SUICIDE VESTS -- A SCROTUM PIC lights up the screen.  

                                 THE VIPER (CONT’D)
                        What the-?

           KA-MOTHERFUCKING-BOOM. 

           The palace explodes to HIGH HEAVEN. The fiery blast sends 
           Thea and Al-Farid flying forward through the air like a 
           couple of GODDAMN SUPERHEROES. 

           CHUNKS OF PALACE, FIREBALLS, DEBRIS and SMOKE fill the 
           streets -- pandemonium erupts, people lose their shit -- 

           And as the dust settles -- 

                                 LUCY (O.C.)
                        We did it! We defeated ISIS! 

           Thea and Al-Farid blink their eyes open to find Lucy kneeling 
           over them. 

                                 AL-FARID
                        Technically, we only defeated some 
                        of ISIS-

                                 THEA
                        Dude, don’t kill the vibe. We’re 
                        straight-up heros. 

                                 LUCY
                        Seriously.

           The ISIS Wives and the Council of Ministers rush to Thea and 
           Al-Farid’s side with FIRST-AID. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        You are injured!  

           It’s true -- they’re pretty banged up.  

                                 THEA
                        We ‘aight. What about the wives? 
                        Are they safe?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 RAAHIMA
                        Every last one of them, thanks to 
                        all of you.  

           MILITARY GRADE CHOPPERS swoop in overhead. 

                                 THEA
                        That was quick.

                                 AL-FARID
                        I was able to radio in some of our 
                        forces from neighboring provinces. 
                        We’re lucky they were close - we 
                        gotta get you to a doctor. 

           The choppers land. HOT SPECIAL-OPS DUDES hustle over, place 
           Thea on a stretcher. 

                                 SPECIAL-OPS DUDE
                        Whoever’s coming with, we gotta 
                        leave NOW. 

           The gang boards the chopper. Lucy buckles her seatbelt -- 
           then unbuckles it, jumps off -- and runs over to the Head 
           Minister. 

                                 LUCY
                        Promise me these women will be 
                        reunited with their families and 
                        given extra protection in case ISIS 
                        comes looking for them. 

                                 HEAD MINISTER
                        You have my word. 

           Lucy crosses to Raahima, hugs her tight. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m so glad I met you. I’ll totally 
                        look you up on Facebook when I get 
                        home. 

                                 RAAHIMA
                        You are a good girl, Lucy. You will 
                        make a very fine wife one day. 

           Raahima winks in Al-Farid’s direction. 

           INT. CHOPPER

           Once Thea, Lucy and Al-Farid are all packed in among the hot 
           Special-Ops Dudes -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THEA 
                             (to pilot)
                        I don’t wanna tell you how to do 
                        your job but get us the fuck out of 
                        here STAT!

           Totally spent, the girls sit back and finally EXHALE. 

           Lucy takes Thea’s hand in hers. 

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Ride or die, dude. 

                                 LUCY
                        Ride or die. 

           Al-Farid takes Lucy’s other hand in his, looks at her LIKE HE 
           LOVES HER. Lucy beams.  

           The chopper ascends into the clouds -- Syria already becoming 
           a distant nightmare.

           INT. DIVE BAR

           It’s a warm and cozy night before Thanksgiving. The place is 
           packed with 20-somethings home for the holiday.

           Thea enters, her tailored dress a reflection of her Girl Boss-
           ness. COVETTE walks in behind her, holding her purse.

           Hand-in-hand, Lucy and Al-Farid enter right behind them. A 
           GIANT DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING sparkles on Lucy’s finger.

           Thea hands Covette a $100 bill.

                                 THEA 
                             (to Covette)
                        Get mama a scotch, neat. And 
                        whatever everyone else is having.

                                 COVETTE
                        Yes, ma’am. 

           Covette and Al-Farid fetch drinks as their ladies cross to a 
           banquette full of their friends.

           HUGS, KISSES AND GREETINGS are exchanged.

                                 FRIEND
                        What’ve you two been up to
                        since last year?
                                 THEA
                        I’m the CEO of Boss Bitch 
                        Enterprises, Etsy’s most profitable 
                        shop.

                                 LUCY
                        And, I’m in the middle of planning 
                        an intimate yet spectacular wedding 
                        to the man of my dreams.  

                                 FRIEND
                        Wow. 

                                 LUCY/THEA
                        Thank you. 

           The boys slide into the booth beside them with their drinks, 
           joining in the merriment.

           Amidst the revelry, Lucy and Thea look to each, smile.

                                 LUCY
                        Wanna get fucked up? 

                                 THEA
                        Have we met? 

           The girls CLINK glasses, throw back their drinks HARD -- Thea 
           holds up her empty glass --

                                 THEA (CONT’D)
                        Waiter! 

           BLACKOUT. 

           THE END.
