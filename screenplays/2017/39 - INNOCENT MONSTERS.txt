           FOREWORD. 

           “Scarcely anything in literature is worth a damn except what 
           is written between the lines.” - raymond chandler

                        But as you are stuck with me, I 
                        will do my best to put together the 
                        pieces of her story. 

           FADE IN:

           INT. JAX’S PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           It’s a flash-forward, and it’s cold, beautiful in the way 
           that statues are - untouchable. Dreamlike.

           JAXON HELLER, 35, awakens next to a BLONDE (face unseen but 
           helluva body). He pulls aside the white comforter, rises. 

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        You think you know what happened, 
                        that’s why you’re reading this. You 
                        saw some glamorized article about 
                        my wife, you wanted to read the 
                        novel behind the tragedy. But you 
                        have no idea. How could you, 
                        reader? I was there, and even I 
                        could not see what was happening. 

           He crosses to a closet, pulls out a SHOEBOX, and looks 
           inside. Something dark here. He puts it back. 

           Goes to the floor-to-ceiling windows, looks down at the city. 

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        This is just another piece of 
                        fiction, yes. But it took hold of a 
                        real person, and to me, their 
                        stories will always be intertwined. 

           He looks down at the book on his coffee table. With shaky 
           hands, he lifts it, runs his fingers over the cover. 

           FOCUS ON THE TITLE: “INNOCENT MONSTERS.” 
           EXT. LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

           A plane takes off into the night. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           WINNIFRED CRANE HELLER, 27, smart-girl pretty, lives in her 
           head, watches New York’s lights fade away through her window. 

           She’s numb, distant. Hoodie up, turtle in her shell. 

           Next to her, Jax (age 34), eyes her like a concerned doctor. 
           Her long fingers clutching so tight to the seat they are 
           white. Chipped grey nail polish. Chewed off tips. 

           He puts his hand over hers, squeezes. 

           She doesn’t look at him, but her hand squeezes back.

           INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM, PALM SPRINGS AIRPORT - DAY

           Exhausted (and currently solo) Winnie looks for a place to 
           sit. The siding on the baggage carousel says “DO NOT SIT.”

           She sits on it anyway. 

           Checks to make sure Jax isn’t in eye-sight, then pops a few 
           pills from a prescription bottle. 

           She scribbles in her NOTEBOOK. Flips to her favorite section - 
           “QUOTES 2 cum back 2.” There it is, at the top: 

           ‘Life swarms with innocent monsters.’ Underlines ‘monsters.’

           The BLARE of the sound announcing bags falling, and the 
           blinking RED lights. It almost seems a warning for something 
           more. But... no, just bags falling.

           Jax returns with a CART. He gives her an encouraging smile. 
           She tries weakly to give one back.

                                 JAX
                        You don’t have to fake a smile for 
                        me. 

           It drops off her face quickly, but his remains. An OPTIMIST. 
           Or at least, in front of her, he is. 
           EXT. PALM SPRINGS AIRPORT - DAY

           Winnie pulls from her vape (THC not tobacco), slow, somber, 
           as Jax arranges their baggage on the cart. 

           Jax looks at her, has a thought, whispers something in her 
           ear. She grins genuinely.

                                 WINNIE
                        Really?

           ZOOM! Winnie rides the baggage cart as Jax PUSHES IT, fast, 
           both of them giggling their asses off and annoying everyone. 

           He’d do anything to see her smile.

           Then, they are waiting for a while, her still on top of the 
           cart. 

                                 JAX
                        There he is. 

           Jax waves to a car pulling up. Kid driving it is TOBY, early 
           20’s. He helps Jax load the baggage into the back. 

           EST. PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           Classic locations. Usually packed, currently abandoned as 
           it’s the off-season. Eerily quiet. Achingly hot. 

           Zero in on the desert, where Toby’s car is driving... 

           INT. TOBY’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Winnie and Jax in the back, Toby drives. The car’s 
           thermometer reads: 108 degrees. 

           Winnie looks out the window at the desert (hood up, 
           sunglasses on.) Jax tries to make conversation with Toby.  

                                 JAX
                        So you work for Wes?

                                 TOBY
                        Wesley and Monica, yes. They 
                        instructed me very carefully about 
                        how to get y'all set up. I was 
                        going to stay in the house, 
                        actually, before you guys swooped 
                        in last minute.

           Winnie and Jax exchange a look - Toby's bitter.
                                 JAX
                        Sorry about that, man. Hey, if it 
                        makes you feel better, we're not 
                        just vacationing. 

                                 TOBY
                        No?

                                 JAX
                        My wife here - I know this may 
                        surprise you because she's so 
                        beautiful--

                                 WINNIE
                        Stop it.

                                 JAX
                        But she's a genius writer, and she 
                        and Wes share the same agent, who 
                        is very pushy, if you've met her..? 
                        Anyway, she thought it would be 
                        good for Winnie's book. 

                                 TOBY
                             (still bitter)
                        Very nice. So it’s set in Palm 
                        Springs?

                                 JAX
                        No, actually--

                                 WINNIE
                        Can you turn up the A/C? 

           Toby does. Jax realizes Winnie’s getting anxious from the 
           subject of conversation. Looks at her, gives her the 
           attention she needs. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I hate it here in the summer, look 
                        at this. 

           She points out the sound her legs make when she 
           sticks/unsticks them from the seats. 

                                 JAX
                        Maybe you should take off that 
                        hoodie then. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I like the hoodie. 
           EXT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY

           Toby pulls up to the HOUSE. Everything is old but because of 
           how well maintained it is, feels stuck in time. Authentic 
           vintage - old things only rich people have. 

           Speaking of which, there is car beneath the open garage, a 
           ‘54 Mustang. Toby indicates it as they head inside.

                                 TOBY
                        You’ll get full use of their car 
                        while you’re here. It gets stuck 
                        sometimes, there’s starter fluid in 
                        the back seat. 

           Jax lingers by the Mustang, admiring it.

                                 JAX
                        She’s gorgeous.

           Winnie is hot, annoyed and doesn't give a shit about the car.

                                 WINNIE
                        Can we go in?

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Toby unlocks the door, lets them in. He greets the large 
           puppy, as well as the shy black cats (two of them) who wander 
           the halls with expensive collars. 

                                 TOBY
                        Hey buddy! This is Hemingway. The 
                        cats are Coco and Chanel.

           Winnie mimes vomiting and without a word, disappears into a 
           bedroom. Jax puts his arm kindly on Toby’s shoulder, leads 
           him further away from Winnie.

                                 JAX
                        Don’t mind Winnifred, she has 
                        difficulty traveling. Why don’t you 
                        show me the ropes?  

           Toby nods. The two walk through the house. 

           It’s decorated lavishly, half vintage, half crystal-grunge. 
           Low, velvet green chaise. Massive windows with pale lace 
           curtains billowing. A pricey-looking chandelier.

           The wife is a jewelry designer, so we probably see her shit 
           (it’s like, dream catchers, tarot cards, ‘health crystals’ 
           hanging from a large fake moose head). 
           IN THE BEDROOM -

           Winnie watches through the curtains, just peeking through...

           Watching as Toby shows Jax the outdoor patio, the pool, the 
           cleaning supplies, etc. 

           We don't hear words, just indistinguishable sounds as they 
           speak. Toby points around, at the neighbors, various 
           directions. Jax asks a few questions, points, nods. 

           Winnie seems curious that he exists apart from her. And part 
           frustrated he hasn't come in to check on her yet.

           As they turn to come back towards inside, Winnie quickly 
           closes the curtain. Lays down. 

           Jax opens the door.

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Hon? I know you're resting, but 
                        there's one room I think you're 
                        going to want to see first. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Is the boy gone? 

                                 JAX
                        Listen.

                                 WINNIE
                        Jax, is that--

                                 JAX
                        Listen. You never learn patience, 
                        Winnie Crane, that's your issue, 
                        you know that?

           And there it is: the sound he meant her to listen for... 
           Toby's car pulling away.

           He kisses her, takes her hand. 

           INT. WRITER OFFICE - DAY

           Darkness. Jax’s hands rise up to reveal Winnie’s POV of:

           A perfect writer's room.

           She glows. It's not hers, but it has everything a writer 
           could need. 
                                 JAX
                        And I'll bring up your books.

                                 WINNIE
                        I didn't pack my books, they're too 
                        heavy.

                                 JAX
                        I know. 

           He winks and goes to grab one of his suitcases.

                                 WINNIE
                        Baby, you didn’t...

           He did; his biggest suitcase is full of all her writing 
           things. Pads, pens, books. She’s moved by the gesture.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        How did you even fit your own 
                        stuff?

                                 JAX
                        I read that article about men being 
                        more productive when they wear the 
                        same thing every day, so expect a 
                        whole lot of this...

           He indicates his current outfit. 

                                 WINNIE
                        That's men that have a closet full 
                        of the same things. They don't not 
                        wash the things.

                                 JAX
                        You sure? Steve Jobs was reportedly 
                        a very smelly guy.

                                 WINNIE
                        Now we're off topic.

           He sniffs himself.

                                 JAX
                        Not exactly...

           She laughs, holds his face, is PRESENT for this moment. And 
           wants to show him, I’m here.

                                 WINNIE
                        The topic being, that you are the 
                        best husband in the world. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for everything. I love 
                        you. I’m sorry I’ve been... you 
                        know. 

                                 JAX
                        Don't worry about me, worry about 
                        your work. When it's done, you'll 
                        feel like yourself again. You 
                        always do.

           He wraps his arms around her from behind, kisses her ear. 

           She sighs, relaxes. It emphasizes just how TENSE she's been 
           this whole time. Night and day.

           Jax smiles to himself, satisfied, hopeful. We think “aw” 
           quickly followed by, “that poor bastard.” (The MUSIC speaks 
           to a darker outcome.) 

           INT./EXT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Jax feeds the animals, plays with them. Surveys the pool. He 
           gets a call from “TRACEY.” (Winnie’s agent).

                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        How’s she settling in? 

                                 JAX
                        We just got here.

                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        You know how much time we have. 
                        Unless you’re willing to pay back 
                        her advance yourself--

                                 JAX
                        Stop talking like that, Trace, we 
                        just got here. 

                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        You said that. You really believe 
                        in her, don’t you? 

                                 JAX
                        Yeah, I do.

                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        Either that, or you’re not liquid. 

                                 JAX
                        What?
                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        Just a rumor I heard, that the last 
                        of your fortune’s tied up in 
                        holding, probably nothing. 

                                 JAX
                        If you want me to help you, you 
                        should try being nice. 

                                 TRACEY (V.O.)
                        So not just a rumor then, huh?

           IN THE OFFICE -

           Winnie sets up the room. 

           She pulls out all her medication bottles - and there are 
           five, maybe catch a glimpse of the ZOLOFT, ADDERALL, 
           KLONOPIN. Puts them in a drawer, shuts drawer. 

           She opens her laptop. 

           PROLOGUE. 

           “What's so hard about that first sentence is that you're 
           stuck with it... And by the time you've laid down the first 
           two sentences, your options are all gone.” - joan didion 

           She has all these notes to herself. Voices that begin to 
           overwhelm. (Hear them OVER each other). 

           She shuts the computer, voices stop. She needs something 
           simpler... The TYPEWRITER. 

           She sets it up. Knows her way around the thing. 

           Takes a deep breath, feeling for the fictional world. 

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        The story started when she began to 
                        disappear again. 

           FLASHES OF: a YOUNG GIRL in a WHITE DRESS. Flashes of knives, 
           blood, flowers. 

           This is Winnie trying to get into the “zone.” It’s a bit 
           messy, feeling for whatever raw creative energy is there, 
           letting her mind wander. (As the story solidifies, the 
           “flashes” will diminish). 

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        Bleeder, wake up!
           INT. BEDROOM --

           Two people in shadows on a bed. Call them SHADOW WINNIE and 
           SHADOW JAX. Feels like a memory/fiction hybrid. 

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        He reaches for her / she recoils 
                        curls begins to unfurl / feels the 
                        cold crawl finger first into her 
                        bones / 

           He reaches for her, she pulls away.

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        Bursting bruises at every bureau 
                        corner, every subtle submerge in 
                        purging affection like a bulimic 
                        bored of being thirteen thirsty and 
                        hurting/

           FLASH OF: A razor blade. A claw-foot BATHTUB. 

                                 SHADOW WINNIE
                        Can you save me?

                                 SHADOW JAX
                        Save what?

                                 SHADOW WINNIE
                        Can you take this and see it and 
                        not leave it?

           He looks at her with scared love-eyes. 

                                 SHADOW JAX
                        There is no need to save/ that 
                        which is not making out with death. 

           FLASH OF: Thin fingers with red nails grabbing a bottle of 
           pills. Lips and tongue as the pills are swallowed. 

                                 SHADOW WINNIE
                        I am but your breath/ is better.

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        ...Whispers the her before she 
                        buries head in his sweater/

           Shadow Winnie does, but we go right back to the:

           SUICIDE SCENE --
           Girl shedding white dress, stepping out of it, slowly walking 
           towards the bath. Flowers float in the water. Girl sinks into 
           the bath. Her head lolls back. 

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        ‘I’m like King Midas’/ she says/ 
                        ‘I’m the wishes that have not been 
                        thought through’/ 

           The bath water slowly turns redder and redder. Everything 
           blurs. Then a PHONE begins to ring--

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           And the ringing jerks Winnie back into reality. 

           She sees there is a retro LANDLINE hidden behind some papers. 
           She lifts it.

                                 WINNIE
                        Hello?

           A piercing SCREAM causes Winnie to immediately hang it up. 

           Looks around, paranoid of everything. Freaked. 

           A DARK FIGURE passes by her window. She turns, catching just 
           the end of it. 

           INT. BEDROOM, PALM SPRINGS - EVENING

           Winnie twitches in her sleep, having a vivid nightmare. She 
           awakes VIOLENTLY. 

           She catches her breath, calms down, squints at the clock.

           IN THE KITCHEN -

           Winnie goes around the corner to see Jax is cooking.

                                 JAX
                        Sleeping beauty! I hope you’re 
                        hungry.

           They eat dinner. Braised tenderloin, garden salad, red wine. 

           Winnie watches him drink. 

                                 WINNIE
                        How many glasses is that?
                                 JAX
                        Are you serious?

                                 WINNIE
                        How many?

                                 JAX
                        It's my third.

                                 WINNIE
                        Okay. 

                                 JAX
                             (half-kidding)
                        Is that okay?

                                 WINNIE
                        I thought it was your fourth.

           (She’s still rattled from trying to write earlier, and takes 
           it out on him. He knows this, takes it well.)

                                 JAX
                        Baby, chill. Nothing is wrong. Stop 
                        trying to make something wrong. How 
                        about I roll you a Jaxon special, 
                        like old times, huh? 

           EXT. PATIO - EVENING

           They smoke a beautifully rolled blunt, lay out in the 
           hammock, look out at the mountains. (Note here, how close 
           their neighbor’s house is to theirs.)

                                 WINNIE
                        Do you still want to have a baby 
                        with me?

                                 JAX
                        Of course I do. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Even though I'm crazy?

                                 JAX
                        You’re not crazy.

           She laughs mid-toke, and coughs a bunch. Gives him a look. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Okay, maybe you’re not winning  
                        Sanity Awards. But we all have our 
                        shit. 
                                 WINNIE
                        I know...

           She looks at the window that leads to the writer office.  

                                 JAX
                        You okay?

                                 WINNIE
                        Yeah. 
                             (shakes it off)
                        Yeah, I’m just stoned. 

                                 JAX
                        Good. Because I’m putting a baby 
                        inside you. Tonight. 

           He kisses her, brings his A game. 

           INT. BEDROOM, PALM SPRINGS - NIGHT

           They have sex. At first, it’s great. But she’s doing it to 
           show him she’s okay, and they quickly fall out of sync. 

           It becomes impersonal, loses all passion. Boring. Done a 
           thousand times. It's neither one's fault - they are just in 
           different worlds. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Headlights of a car as it pulls up to the neighbor’s house. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jax is asleep. Winnie is wide awake, laying in an awkward 
           position to increase fertility - while also smoking her vape. 

           When she hears the CAR next door, she is curious, and climbs 
           out of bed to the window to see... 

           A light goes on in the neighbor's house. 

           Winnie watches as a shadowy figure becomes a blurry BRUNETTE, 
           who begins undressing. Body of a Victoria's Secret Angel. 

           The girl stands in the window opposite. 

           For a moment, we wonder if she is looking out - but in fact, 
           she is looking at her own reflection in the dark window - 
           admiring herself. 
           The confidence in this is mesmerizing to Winnie, who regards 
           the girl with fascination, as if she's an alien creature.

           EXT./INT. MARA’S CHILDHOOD HOME, CONNECTICUT - EVENING

           Painted on a wooded home:

           CHAPTER 1. “A man's face is his autobiography. A woman's face 
           is her work of fiction.” - Oscar Wilde

           Pan across to the WINDOW, where there is a girl looking out. 

           The exact same angles and expression as the BRUNETTE NEIGHBOR 
           (clearly inspired by her, will be played by the same actress) 
           - except for minor differences, including that this girl is 
           BLONDE. This is Winnie’s protagonist, MARA CALLOWAY, 16. 

           (Note: this hyper-real world is shot like a music video or 
           fashion editorial. It’s vibrant, playful, twisty. In contrast 
           to the Palm Springs Reality, with its bleached out pastels 
           and sweaty, orange-yellow emptiness; this fictional world is 
           POLYCHROMATIC PUNK, Candy Warhol, avant-garde. It comes alive 
           in ways reality never could.)

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        When do you become a woman? 

           A FLASH OF IMAGES too fast to comprehend. Clubs, coke, cash. 
           Lipstick and lollipops, overdoses and bloody noses. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        Is it the first time you bleed? 
                        First catcall, first fuck? The 
                        first time you look in the mirror 
                        and hear the voice that says, ‘not 
                        enough.’

           MORE FLASHES. Bodies fucking violently. Some kids passed out 
           in a bathtub with LIQUOR BOTTLES everywhere. Someone dressed 
           as DEATH doing a line. Smoke seeping from sexy lips. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        First drink, the first love, the 
                        first loss? First time you blow 
                        smoke in a boy's eyes.

           INT. BEDROOM, PALM SPRINGS

           Winnie looks over at Jax, sleeping. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        First faking it. 
           Winnie exits the bedroom.

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS - NIGHT

           Winnie sits down at the typewriter, types away. It’s what we 
           just heard. ‘When do you become a woman’ etc.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        Is there even a moment at all? 
                        Maybe for some women, it's just a 
                        gradual feeling of settling into 
                        the person you're going to be. 
                        Maybe for most women, even. 

           Winnie pauses. A flash of MARA. She’s begging to be written. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        But not for me. 

           INT. MARA’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

           Mara turns away from the window. Puts her hair back, brushes 
           her teeth. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        For me, it was a very specific 
                        moment, at a very specific time... 

           She walks to her mother’s bedroom. Pushes the door open. 

           FREEZES. On her face as her jaw slowly drops. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        ...and I could describe each detail 
                        as if it happened this morning 
                        because I could never forget even 
                        if I wanted to.

           Mara’s SCREAM pierces the night, cutting through.

           LATER THAT SAME EVENING -

           Mara is sobbing. She has blood all over her face, her body. 
           She wipes her mouth - blood is getting in it.

           We realize she is at a CRIME SCENE, and there are detectives 
           and COPS there, and yellow tape blocking the room behind her - 
           her mother’s bedroom. 

                                 COP
                        Anything else about the man that 
                        you can tell us?
                                 MARA
                             (still crying)
                        I barely saw him. He, um, he had a 
                        mask. He was like, normal height. I 
                        don’t know, please, I just want my--

           MR. CALLOWAY, 45, a professor, enters urgently. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Daddy.

           She runs to her father, hugs him. He is in shock, doesn't 
           know how to react. The cops address him. 

                                 COP
                        Mr. Calloway?

           He drops to his knees, sees the HORRIFIC SCENE (as we see it 
           too for the first time).

           A woman (presumably Mrs. Calloway) lies in bed, her stomach 
           slashed open violently, and blood sprayed all over the room. 

           Friendly reminder: this is pop-art version of death, so it’s 
           not necessarily as stomach-turning as it sounds. In fact, the 
           blood is not red, but a dark, thick GOLD. 

           Mr. Calloway stumbles to find words, all of them gone.

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        We were pregnant. 

           INT. DINING ROOM, PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           A FORK stabs into an egg yolk, and it leaks yellow over the 
           beautiful Eggs Benedict. 

           We're at breakfast with Jax and Winnie. Fresh fruit in a 
           mason jar. Steaming French press. (Knowing them as we do now, 
           it's clearly the work of Jax.) 

                                 WINNIE
                        So these guys you’re seeing, are 
                        they... like, band friends?

                                 JAX
                        We might jam a little, yeah. As 
                        much as I hated the whole scene, I 
                        do miss some parts of it, you know? 
                        It'll be good, I think. 
           Done with his breakfast, he goes to get ready. In the mood to 
           DO things. Winnie still picks at her food. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Oh hey, baby?

           He comes back.

                                 JAX
                        Yeah?

                                 WINNIE
                        The neighbors on that side, did the 
                        assistant guy tell you anything 
                        about them?

                                 JAX
                        Yeah, actually, he mentioned it was 
                        a producer. But the guy’s out of 
                        town. Why?

                                 WINNIE
                        I saw a girl over there.

                                 JAX
                        I dunno, maybe his daughter? You 
                        want to go make friends or 
                        something?

                                 WINNIE
                        Nevermind, forget it.

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           She sits at the desk, edits her earlier pages, makes notes in 
           the margins. Blows smoke rings with her vape.

           Jax knocks on the door. Peeks his head in, freshly showered, 
           looking dashing. 

                                 JAX
                        Sloan.

           She regards him quizzically over her reading glasses. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        The neighbor girl you're so curious 
                        about. Toby says her name's Sloan. 

           Oh, right. She smiles. He kisses her. Waits a moment.
                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        You look beautiful, by the way. You 
                        getting to work?

                                 WINNIE
                        Hope so.

           He heads to the door, blows her a kiss. She catches it with 
           her mouth (crunch!) and blows one back.

           He catches it even more dramatically, like a pet getting a 
           treat. He still doesn’t leave. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Go!

                                 JAX
                        Okay, sorry. You’re hard to leave.

           She shakes her head, can’t help smiling. 

                                 WINNIE
                        So not true. 

                                 JAX
                        So very true. 

           He makes her do the blowing kisses one more time.  

           She leans in the crack of the office door, watching him 
           nuzzle the dog before leaving.

           She shuts the door and hears the mustang pull away. She goes 
           back to her desk to find:

           One of the BLACK CATS blocking the typewriter, looking 
           straight at her.

                                 WINNIE
                        Please move. 

           When it doesn't, she pushes it off, and it falls with a hiss 
           but of course lands on it's feet. 

           It's a bit more brutal than she needed to be, and she knows 
           it, and feels guilty for a moment before settling into her 
           new desk and putting her fingers on the keys.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Glorious flashes of a surrealist version of Manhattan at 
           night. Entire buildings PINK, NEON, etc. The skyline is never 
           exactly set, moves, lives -- ink that isn’t yet dry.
           A BILLBOARD READS:

           illusion of being eternal.” - sartre 

           Settle on a HOTEL...

           INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           Mara stands with Mr. Calloway, taking everything in, starry-
           eyed. But, cutting through:

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        ...The cheapest room available. 

                                 MARA
                        Pardonez-moi? 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        We have to be smart right now.

                                 MARA
                        Gross.

           She addresses the CONCIERGE with total confidence.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        We’ll take the most expensive room 
                        you have, please. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        I apologize for Mara. A simple room 
                        will be fine, thank you.

           An evil spark in Mara’s eye. 

                                 MARA
                        You sure about that? 

           Their relationship is clearly off - though to what degree is 
           not yet clear. Mr. Calloway is not a smooth man, he is a bit 
           stilted, wears his personality much like his ill-fitting 
           suit. Mara is more formed, and has a power over him. 

           Having lost their silent battle, a defeated Mr. Calloway 
           turns to the concierge.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Penthouse suite okay?

           Mara grins as she watches the key slide across the counter.
           INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, HOTEL - NIGHT 

           Mara immediately goes to the minibar. Mr. Calloway lays down. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        I’m doing the best I can here. 

           She leans down over him. It’s weird Lolita vibes.  

                                 MARA
                        My poor daddy, you've been through 
                        so much. You rest, okay? 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        You won't be mad?

           She kisses him on the forehead. He reaches for her wrist. 
           Pulls. Brings her down on top of him, so that he is hugging 
           her chest. He seems to NEED her in some desperate way.

           She waits for him to be done, then she wriggles out. 

           There is a KNOCK. Mara turns around from her mini-bottle of 
           vodka. The knock came from… the bathroom?!

           Another knock. Mara swallows, very carefully goes to open the 
           bathroom door, only to find: 

           THE SAME CLAW-FOOT BATHTUB, filled to the brim, overflowing 
           with blood - but this blood is the color of REAL blood, it’s 
           a vivid RED. It doesn’t belong here, and yet here it is.

           A woman's body inside. Wrists slit open, dripping. 

           It's Mara's pregnant mother. 

           Then, suddenly, it becomes MARA HERSELF. Mara’s eyes widen as 
           she stares at her own corpse.

           But then, even STRANGER - it's WINNIE. 

           We are jerked back, as in reality--

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS 

           --Winnie is pressing the backspace key. A low groan - pain 
           and frustration.

           But for the first time, we see up close: THERE ARE SCARS ON 
           HER WRISTS. Very faded, but clearly were deep. 

           The image of the red bathtub starts to make sense…
           A THIRD KNOCK sounds, and we realize it’s coming from 
           Winnie’s front door. Winnie sighs, rises. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR -

           Winnie opens it.

                                 WINNIE
                        Look, now is really not a...

           She stops as she realizes who is standing before her. 

           The GIRL NEXT DOOR - SLOAN, late teens, maybe 20, and a total 
           fucking knockout. Her honey-brown hair glows in the sun.

           (We should also note that, seeing Sloan next to Winnie should 
           highlight their physical similarities; should feel like Sloan 
           is the actress who would play Winnie in a movie. They have 
           similar styles, but Sloan is taller, slimmer, younger, and 
           overall more AIRBRUSHED, animated, larger than life as well 
           as unscathed by it.)

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, you're the neighbor, right? 
                        Sloan?

                                 SLOAN
                        I got you at a bad time?

                                 WINNIE
                        Ah, it's alright, I was just 
                        failing to write--

                                 SLOAN
                        Oh good, then we can hang.

           Before Winnie can say another word, Sloan is already on her 
           way in. Manners don't factor in. Everything she sees, somehow 
           belongs to her. 

           Winnie is too curious to really be upset, follows Sloan.

           INTO THE KITCHEN -

                                 WINNIE
                        My husband's out at the moment, so 
                        it's just me. I'm Winnifred, you 
                        can call me Winnie. I...

           Sloan rifles through things, eats a strawberry. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Is there something I can help you 
                        with, Sloan? 
           Sloan turns, a bit of the strawberry juice running down her 
           designer lipstick lips. She just looks at Winnie for a long 
           moment, then grins, and walks past her. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Here we go. 

           Sloan’s found the liquor, pours herself from vodka. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        Want some? 

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re not 21. Are you? 

                                 SLOAN
                        Weird how greasy those numbers get 
                        once you come of age, huh.

           She hands Winnie a glass.

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        Chill. You don’t have to try to be 
                        a grown up in front of me. 

           Sloan snoops around, pretty invasive about it too.

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        This is a nice place. The 
                        Robertsons never let me over, 
                        they've private people I guess.

           Sloan finds a photo album. It’s the Robertsons. Intimate 
           photos, which Sloan finds entertaining. 

           Winnie just regards her with increasing curiosity, drawn. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        So you’re a writer? What do you 
                        write about?

                                 WINNIE
                        I don't know, the truth in a 
                        prettier dress, basically.

                                 SLOAN
                        Soundbite goes crunch!

                                 WINNIE
                        What?

                                 SLOAN
                             (like, duh)
                        You sound like a soundbite. 
                                 WINNIE
                        That was from something. An 
                        interview I did once. I guess it 
                        sounds stupid, huh. 

                                 SLOAN
                        You should do something else for a 
                        living. No one wants the truth 
                        these days.

                                 WINNIE
                        No? Why not?

                                 SLOAN
                        The truth is too scary. 

                                 WINNIE
                        That's why there's the dress.

                                 SLOAN
                        That just makes it a scary thing in 
                        a pretty dress. 

           Beat.

                                 WINNIE
                        You remind me of my protagonist, a 
                        lot actually.

           Hemingway starts BARKING LOUDLY. Winnie tries to calm him.

                                 SLOAN
                        Yeah? What’s she like? 

                                 WINNIE
                             (to the dog)
                        Will you shut up?
                             (to Sloan)
                        Sorry. One sec.

           She puts Hemingway in the bathroom, then exits to find Sloan 
           spotting the leftover joint from the night before. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Yes! I knew you were a pothead. 

                                 WINNIE
                        We shouldn't--

                                 SLOAN
                        Sis, breathe. You’re not corrupting 
                        me, okay? It’s fucking California, 
                        this is like our state flag. 
           EXT. PATIO - DAY

           They smoke outside.

           Winnie takes in the desert heat. How it dries out all the 
           colors, everything seems somehow less alive. In the process 
           of slow decay. 

                                 WINNIE
                        It's disgusting out here.

                                 SLOAN
                        Don't you love it? It's like a free 
                        sauna. 
                             (beat)
                        You're really pretty, you know. I 
                        mean, you should probably do 
                        something with your hair and use a 
                        little more makeup, and lose just 
                        like three pounds, but that's 
                        pretty good, you know. Solid eight. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Oh great.

                                 SLOAN
                        No, that's good. I've done it with 
                        eights before. You're not really my 
                        type, though, no offense. 

                                 WINNIE
                        None taken.

                                 SLOAN
                        You're just a little young for me. 

                                 WINNIE
                             (laughs)
                        I'm young for you? 

                                 SLOAN
                        You know, for all the pot you 
                        smoke, you have no idea how to 
                        relax.

                                 WINNIE
                        I know how to relax.

                                 SLOAN
                        You moved next to the right girl, 
                        I’m gonna help you out. And you 
                        need it bad, trust. 
                                 WINNIE
                        You training to become a therapist 
                        or something?

                                 SLOAN
                        With this body, don't be stupid. 
                             (stands, stretches)
                        I'm gonna be famous, and party, and 
                        do whatever I want, and fuck 
                        whoever I want, and bathe naked in 
                        champagne and eat nothing but 
                        caviar and foreign chocolate. And 
                        then I'm going to die dramatically, 
                        tragically, and young. I'd love to 
                        join the 27 Club, but I don't want 
                        to seem like I'm trying, you know?

           Sloan walks around the pool, poking at the blow-up pink 
           flamingo, blow-up shark, other random pool toys. 

                                 WINNIE
                        So you want to be famous and die 
                        young?

                                 SLOAN
                        Duh.

                                 WINNIE
                        Why? 

                                 SLOAN
                        Why do I want to die young?

                                 WINNIE
                        No, why do you want to be famous?

           Beat. Sloan answers carefully.

                                 SLOAN
                        When you are famous, you exist even 
                        when you don't. Because no matter 
                        what, somewhere, someone is always 
                        thinking about you. 

           Winnie watches Sloan, INSPIRED, drinking up her words.

           Wherever Sloan walks, Winnie even sees a COLOR shift, left in 
           Sloan’s wake. Certain objects take on new, surreal color.

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie lets Hemingway out of the bathroom. 
                                 WINNIE
                        You ready to be normal again, 
                        Ernest? 

           He licks her hand. Guess so. 

           Winnie grabs a bottle of wine. Smokes another joint. 

           She puts on makeup and does her hair - channeling Mara, in 
           some ways imitating Sloan, her real-life inspiration. Winnie 
           tries on different facial expressions. 

           In the mirror, she repeats Sloan’s words.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        When you are famous, you exist even 
                        when you don't. 

           She smiles, sees something. We pan to her vision, TRAVEL 
           THROUGH THE MIRROR...

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 

           And we are now looking from the mirror behind the bar, where 
           Mara sits. There aren't many people still up. Two older men 
           vie for the privilege of buying her drink. 

           The BARTENDER, 20’s, leans in.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You’re not from here, are you.

                                 MARA
                        What makes you say that?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Because you're at this hotel at 
                        this time of night. 

                                 MARA
                        Where should I be?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Forget it.

                                 MARA
                        I’m Mara.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Opie.

                                 MARA
                        Opie. Cute.
                                 OPIE
                        You don't have to pretend I have a 
                        chance with you.

                                 MARA
                        Don't you?

                                 OPIE
                        Nah, gorgeous. And even if I did, I 
                        couldn't take it. Can't afford to 
                        take chances like that anymore. I 
                        know girls like you. 

                                 MARA
                        Trust me, you do not know any girls 
                        like me. 

                                 OPIE
                        Guess that remains to be seen.

                                 MARA
                        Guess it does. 

           He draws something on a napkin. Shows it to her. It’s:

           CHAPTER 3. “Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you 
           can't see from the center.” - vonnegut

           EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Opie leads Mara through the street. He pops a couple pastel 
           pills from an Altoids container, offers them. She takes one. 

           They enter a dilapidated door in a random building, and take 
           the graffiti’d stairs down. Everything becomes increasingly 
           jumpy, surreal. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

           A door leads to a door leads to long tunnel (like an out-of-
           use subway tunnel). You can hear music pounding somewhere. 
           The lights flicker. 

           There are homeless people in the hall, but look homeless-
           chic, like it’s on purpose for an editorial. They are all 
           dressed from pure fantasy, Tim Burton meets Lady Gaga.

           A model-looking chick in a glorious victorian-era gown holds 
           a sign that says ‘need $ for champagne.’
           An androgenous albino girl in star-sunglasses lays against a 
           beautiful boy in a white fur coat but bare chest, wearing a 
           golden crown. 

           Opie stops, offers them pills in exchange for the crown. They 
           accept. He hands Mara the crown.

                                 OPIE
                        You’ll want this. 

           She puts it on. 

           As they grow closer to the end of the tunnel, there are more 
           and more NEON SIGNS and badass graffiti. 

                                 OPIE (CONT’D)
                        Most people have to get through the 
                        front, the line goes around the 
                        block. But I know people. 

                                 MARA
                        Like, what people?

           Glowing sign overhead reads: “we are all mad here.”

                                 OPIE
                        All of them. 

           The giant bouncers check Opie’s KEY - vintage, old, and look 
           Mara up and down, and then they are IN. 

           INT. WONDERLAND CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The enter through a series of doorway curtains. White, then 
           beaded gold, then just hanging FLOWERS. Winnie pushes the 
           final wall of flowers aside to reveal...

           Well, fucking Wonderland. Imagine Studio 54 on steroids, with 
           a mix of 90s CLUB KIDS and modern RAVER culture, and a 
           sprinkling of 80s punk. 

                                 OPIE
                        Welcome to Wonderland. 

           The club is impossibly huge for being underground, but it 
           doesn’t matter. Mara takes it in...
                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        Mara was a child of the bad 
                        revolution, the one that made 
                        stupid people famous - survival of 
                        the hottest and the richest - and 
                        this was the epicenter of 
                        everything. 

           There’s an INDOOR FERRIS WHEEL. There is a “TV GARDEN” filled 
           with old, fat TV’s playing flickering black and white films. 
           A million disco balls. Cages hanging from the ceiling. 

           Though many partiers are young, this is not a place that 
           discriminates based on age - it’s about being INTERESTING. 
           You get in if your look is on point.

           Slutty ‘playing card’ waitresses serving drinks. 

                                 OPIE
                        Everyone who says ‘nothing happens 
                        overnight’ has never lived in new 
                        york. This is where you need to be. 

           Mara knows he’s right. She spins around. Sparkles fall from 
           the ceiling. She feels free, and alive. 

           Then she hears the sound of a sweet guitar solo - and it's 
           the DJ, who has plugged into the amps. He reminds us of a 
           young Jaxon, or some version of him. (Opie is another version 
           of Jaxon as well, but this may be less obvious).

                                 OPIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right back.

           He disappears into the VIP room. 

           Mara watches the DJ, makes eyes with him. She’s not the only 
           one with a crush. The GREEN-HAIRED BOY next to her swoons.

                                 GREEN-HAIRED BOY
                        He is to die for. 

                                 MARA
                        Totally. 

           When Opie returns, he brings to the DJ BOOTH, introduces Mara 
           to the DJ. (We’ll call him DJ SIN here.)

                                 OPIE
                        Mara, this is a friend of mine, 
                        Cynical Sinner. Sin, Mara. 
                                 DJ SIN
                        It's spelled the other way, like 
                        Sinical Cynner.

                                 MARA
                        I like that.

                                 DJ SIN
                        Opie, where'd you find this girl? 
                        She's way out of your league.

                                 OPIE
                        I've already informed her as much.

           Opie and the DJ exchange drugs/money in their handshake.

           Mara understands what this means; Opie isn’t IN, he’s just 
           the In Peoples’ dealer. 

                                 DJ SIN
                             (to Mara)
                        You party?

                                 MARA
                        Was that a question?

           DJ slaps Opie on the shoulder.

                                 DJ SIN
                        I’m already in love. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie comes out of writing and the guitar is still going, 
           and we follow her through the house to Jaxon, who is playing. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re back. 

                                 JAX
                        Didn’t want to disturb you. How’s 
                        it going?

                                 WINNIE
                        I met our neighbor. 

                                 JAX
                        Yeah?

                                 WINNIE
                        She’s the worst and I’m obsessed 
                        with her.

                                 WINNIE (CONT'D)
                        I swear, she’s like, not even a 
                        real girl. You have to meet her, 
                        you’ll know what I mean. 

                                 JAX
                        I don’t think I’ve seen you this 
                        happy in a very long time. 

           She pours herself a glass of wine, joins him. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You know what? I am happy. How 
                        weird. I hope it lasts. 

                                 JAX
                        You’re always thinking about 
                        endings before it’s even relevant. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re the idiot who married a 
                        writer.

                                 JAX
                        I knew what I was getting into. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Did you?

                                 JAX
                        What does that mean? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Keep playing and you’ll find out... 

           She gives him the guitar back. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Something I can dance to. 

           He’s surprised, but thrilled. Plays guitar while she dances. 

           INT. DJ SIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s not as nice as you expect; he may be big on a local 
           stage, but he’s still on his way up. 

           But for Mara, it’s a place to start. 

                                 MARA
                        I’m going to freshen up.

           He points down the hall, and she disappears.
           He rifles through her things, stumbles upon her LICENSE. Her 
           age. Not 18 for two more years. FUCK. He weighs the risks, we 
           can tell because he tilts his head slightly and frowns. 
           (Thinker, this one.)

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Back in reality. The dance Winnie does is sultry, 
           seductive... and turns into a STRIPTEASE. 

                                 JAX
                        Are you still ovulating?

                                 WINNIE
                        This isn’t about that, don’t even 
                        think about that. This is about you 
                        and me.

           It gets more heated. She gets on top of him, grinding.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to fuck me. And not 
                        because you should, and not even 
                        because you want to, but because 
                        you need to, because you need me, 
                        because the very idea of you not 
                        getting to fuck my brains out, 
                        drives you MAD. 

           She bites his ear, and as she leans in to whisper, we’re-- 

           INT. DJ SIN’S APARTMENT

           And Mara is whispering into the DJ’s ear... 

                                 MARA
                        You are dying in the desert and I’m 
                        a cold glass of water. Drink me.

           So he forgets her age and goes for it. As he rips her clothes 
           off, tosses them...

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie’s clothes land on the floor. Jax’s follow.

           Caught up in a feverish passion, they are lost in each other. 

                                 JAX
                        I’m not minding this new character 
                        one bit. 
           INTERCUT

           -Winnie and Jax having great sex. Like, really great sex.

           -Mara and the DJ also fucking (the two scenes informing each 
           other stylistically.)

           -As Winnie comes, gloriously, so does Mara. When Winnie looks 
           in the mirror, there is a FLASH of Mara looking back at her, 
           as if it is the character and not her that is coming. 

           END INTERCUT

           Winnie looks back at the mirror. It’s only her again. She 
           shuts her eyes, lets herself drift off. 

           A neon sign in the dark reads: 

           CHAPTER 4. “It is far harder to kill a phantom than a 
           reality.” - virginia woolf

           A clock TICKS as flickers of eerie light begin to illuminate:

           INT. MIRROR MAZE - NIGHT

           A MAZE OF MIRRORS and CLEAR GLASS. Creepy fun-house that is 
           the opposite of fun. This is a RECURRING NIGHTMARE. 

           Winnie, looking very young in a white dress and Mary Janes, 
           wanders through the maze, feeling her way forward, unsure 
           what is mirror and what is space. 

           She is invisible then visible again, as the reflections 
           fracture her image. 

           As she continues forward, we notice that her reflections 
           remain with different poses and expressions than Winnie; they 
           are taking on lives of their own.  

           Linger on one - a figure in shadow, MADE of shadows - a 
           silhouette coming to life. 

           Winnie - unaware of the creature - discovers a WARM LIGHT 
           ahead. She tries to go towards it, but hits a dead end. 

           She turns back - and heart stops as she sees the SHADOW 
           CREATURE (as we will now call it/them).

           Where eyes should be - just CAVERNOUS BLACK HOLES.

           Regular lips, but when it smiles - it’s full of FANGS.
           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Winnie awakens with a gasp, struggling for air. She tries to 
           wake Jax, but he’s out cold.

           What’s more - the Shadow Creatures AREN’T GONE. 

           IMPOSSIBLY LONG ARMS reach from every direction, towards 
           Winnie, fingers outstretched.

           She RUNS, freaking the fuck out. 

           IN THE KITCHEN -

           She grasps the bottle of vodka, drinks heavily from it. 

           She goes to sit down. Rolls herself a joint. Tries to read, 
           tries to watch TV, can’t do anything. 

           OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM -

           She debates waking her husband up. Decides against it.

           IN THE OFFICE -

           Instead, she retreats here. Drinks. Writes in her JOURNAL. 

                                 SLOAN
                        No one said to take Hemingway 
                        literally, you know. He DIED. 

           Winnie would normally jump out of her skin, but she’s now 
           hammered, and Drunk Winnie thinks in slow-mo, just like...

                                 WINNIE
                        What? The dog? 

                                 SLOAN
                        Yes, the dog. The dog said, ‘Write 
                        drunk, edit sober.’ Smart dog. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re joking.

                                 SLOAN
                        I am impressed though. 

           Sloan crouches to make eye contact with one of the BLACK 
           CATS. It stares right at her, tense. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Impressed by what?
                                 SLOAN
                        How much you’ve imbibed. Respect.

           She reaches to pet the cat, and it SCREECHES and scurries 
           away. She laughs.

                                 WINNIE
                        It's the middle of the night, 
                        shouldn't you be home?

                                 SLOAN
                        “Where should I be?”

           Winnie frowns, then realizes Sloan is READING from her pages, 
           quoting Mara. (How she got the pages isn’t clear. Maybe just 
           snatched them when we weren’t looking. The girl is FAST 
           though. It’s suspect - we should be wary of Sloan even when 
           Winnie isn’t).  

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        “Wonderland?”

                                 WINNIE
                        It's not done.

                                 SLOAN
                        Oh believe me, it's been done.

                                 WINNIE
                        That's not what I meant. Give it--

           But Sloan dances just out of reach, continuing to read.

                                 SLOAN
                        “Mara was a child of the bad 
                        revolution.” Deep. Oo, underage 
                        sex, this is fun--

           Then Winnie physically fights her for the pages, it gets out 
           of hand, and Sloan accidentally knocks over a shelf. Books 
           fall down, fall open. And it’s LOUD. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry.

                                 WINNIE
                        I'm sorry, this was stupid--

           And then they see:

           One of the books is one of those hide-a-key things, and 
           inside is the writer dude's DRUG STASH. 

           Sloan is pretty thrilled. It’s a solid collection. 
                                 SLOAN
                        Damn girl.

                                 WINNIE
                        It must be Wesley’s...

           As Winnie is still cleaning up, Sloan has already opened the 
           bag of coke and done a bump.

                                 SLOAN
                        This shit’s optimus PRIME. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Don’t.

                                 SLOAN
                        You want some? 

                                 WINNIE
                        It’s not a matter of want.

                                 SLOAN
                        Everything is a matter of want.

                                 WINNIE
                        Look, I'm too drunk to explain why 
                        I can't do cocaine to the teenager 
                        that broke into the house I'm 
                        supposed to be taking care of. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Good, because there's a much easier 
                        option, and you're not too drunk 
                        for it. 

           They both look to the coke. Off Winnie’s hesitation...

           Fast cuts of them doing a shitton of lines. Mara likes to 
           party, so Winnie likes to party. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wanna wake up your hubby, see 
                        if he wants a threesome?

           Winnie cracks up.

                                 WINNIE
                        Omigod, no. I mean, it's very 
                        generous of you to offer--

                                 SLOAN
                        Yes, it is.
                                 WINNIE
                        But even if we weren't -
                             (another line)
                        - trying to have a baby -
                             (another line)
                        He’d... he’d know we were on drugs, 
                        and he’d kill me.

                                 SLOAN
                        What's he got against drugs?

                                 WINNIE
                        They almost killed him. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Oh, well that's fair. 

                                 WINNIE
                        He can't even drink very much. It's 
                        not that he's an addict or 
                        anything, he just kind of has a... 
                        a ‘thing’... I’m high, I shouldn’t 
                        be telling you this. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Don’t worry, it happens all the 
                        time. I wear my darkness on the 
                        outside, and dark people are drawn 
                        to that, and they want to tell you 
                        all their secrets. 

           Winnie nods, then stops, processes this. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Why do you think I'm dark?

                                 SLOAN
                        I always look at peoples' wrists 
                        when I meet them. 

           Winnie immediately hides her wrists, uncomfortable, exposed. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        No judgement here. The world’s a 
                        dump, anyone who hasn’t considered 
                        bailing is just an idiot. Can I 
                        smoke in here?

           Sloan lights up her cigarette without waiting for an answer. 
           They party. And laugh. And there’s lights and it’s blurry. 

           Secrets and music and smoke rings and girly things. Through 
           the chaos, catch only one scene sharply.
           CU: Sloan whispers in Winnie’s ear. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck the world, Freddie. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - MORNING

           Winnie wakes up on the chaise with the worst hangover ever. 
           She goes to the kitchen, washes her face, CHUGS some water. 
           Takes four aspirin. Puffs heavily on her vape. 

           Looks at her phone, nearly chokes. MISSED CALL & VOICEMAIL 
           from “RJ.” She plays it, in a hungover daze.

                                 RJ (V.O.)
                        Just returning your call. I miss 
                        you too. Did your mother tell you 
                        I'll be in town? They’re showing a 
                        film of mine out there. Crazy 
                        timing, huh? It’s been too long. 
                        Hit me back when you get this.

           Winnie angrily deletes the message.  

           IN THE BEDROOM - 

           Jax wakes up, finds Winnie asleep in his arms. Has no idea 
           how recently she crawled into bed. He kisses her forehead and 
           gently lays her back down. 

           He doesn’t seem to notice that there are Shadow Creatures 
           once again emerging from the corners, reaching for Winnie. 

           They grab her arms and legs, they cover her eyes and mouth.

           She wakes up, immediately struggles, gasping, trying to 
           SCREAM, and it all goes dark. 

           Suddenly, it’s all calm. Same light. No shadows. Quiet.

                                 WINNIE
                        Just a dream. 

           But... wait... she doesn’t look so good. 

           Pale, she clutches at her stomach. Rushes to the bathroom.

           This time, she throws up violently. Only, it’s not vomit. 
           It’s DARK INK with MIST emerging from it like dry ice. 

           She backs away, horrified, paranoid, still holding her 
           stomach. She doesn’t know what is real anymore.
           She looks up at herself in the mirror. 

           Her jaw drops.

           In the reflection: a flicker of that SAME shadow-creature 
           from her nightmare, with the black-hole eyes and fangs. 

           It REACHES THROUGH THE MIRROR - its spindly fingers grasping.

           She stumbles back, away. Turns, runs. 

           IN THE KITCHEN --

           She runs straight into Jax. 

                                 JAX
                        Hun?

                                 WINNIE
                        Where did you go? I needed you, 
                        there’s something here, can’t you 
                        feel it? There’s something bad...

           She’s still looking around, paranoid. 

                                 JAX
                        Nothing’s here. You’re okay. Hey. 

           He holds her closely, calms her. She catches her breath in 
           the harsh light of day. Her frantic energy slowly fades. 

           A little later, on the couch...

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        This is my fault, everything that 
                        happened in LA... I’m sorry, I 
                        didn’t think. 

                                 WINNIE
                        It’s not that. 

                                 JAX
                        Maybe - I know it’s hard - but 
                        maybe if you told me more about 
                        ‘him’--

                                 WINNIE
                        It's not him. 

                                 JAX
                        You sure? Do you want to talk to 
                        Dr. K about it? 

           She shakes her head.
                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Not talking about them doesn’t make 
                        them go away.

           She wants to cry, be vulnerable. But something is stopping 
           her. Just as she’s pushing past that wall--

           Her phone rings, it's RJ. She declines. He leaves another 
           voicemail, and she deletes without playing.

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Is that your new friend? 

           She hesitates. Then she lies. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Yeah. It’s Sloan. 

           EXT. MUSTANG - LOOKOUT POINT - SUNSET

           Sloan holds a BLACK LOLLIPOP over the sun. Mini-eclipse. Then 
           pops it back in her mouth. 

           They are lying on hood of the car, drinking, watching the sun 
           set. Both are hot, half their clothes shed. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Come on, you’re torturing me.

                                 SLOAN
                        Sorry, I get distracted easily.

           Sloan goes back to the PAGES Winnie has brought with her. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I still can’t believe I told you 
                        about RJ. No one knows that stuff.

                                 SLOAN
                        Even Jax?

                                 WINNIE
                        Keep reading. 

                                 SLOAN
                        I need a cigarette. 

           She tosses the lollipop into the sand, lights a cig.

                                 WINNIE
                        Jax knows what happened, but I 
                        blurred the details, we just refer 
                        to my “ex” or “him.” 
           Sloan nods, offers Winnie a cigarette. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I quit. A long time ago.

                                 SLOAN
                        Okay.

           She begins to read the pages out loud. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        Learn value of cash, learn what it 
                        can and cannot buy. Learn value of 
                        body, learn what it can and cannot 
                        do. Mold it until perfect. Fold 
                        imperfections into flaps in skin, 
                        STAPLE, then forget they ever 
                        existed.

           Winnie is at first uncomfortable, but soon becomes mesmerized 
           by Sloan’s voice.

           Closer and closer on Sloan as she reads. 

                                 SLOAN (CONT'D)
                        Find strengths. Enhance. Find 
                        weakness in others. Expose. Begin 
                        to realize hating everyone is 
                        making me strong. 17 and I've 
                        broken as many hearts in as many 
                        months. 

           Sloan pauses, notices Winnie staring at her lips.

                                 SLOAN (CONT’D)
                        You sure you don’t want one?

           She offers her American Spirits. Winnie takes one. 

           Use the flame to transition to:

           EXT. WONDERLAND CLUB - NIGHT

           Someone lights a SOCIALITE’s cigarette. She continues without 
           even looking at the guy who lit it. Meet the reigning queen 
           of the underground scene: ZARA, a SADCORE PRINCESS, with the 
           kind of gown you see at the Met. (Zara’s family runs the 
           town, the Kardashian/Jenners of this world.)

           Massive lines around the block as everyone tries to get in, 
           or get a glimpse of the famous faces entering. 
           Zara is certainly a main attraction, but so are the members 
           of her girl squad. As we meet each of them, their names are 
           stamped across the screen in FLASHY BUBBLE LETTERS. 

           VYXN, boyish figure in suspenders, sex on a stick, is 
           ignoring a hot girl drooling over her.

           NIGHTSHADE, quiet, quirky foreign heiress, goes up to a 
           photographer and - without a word - puts her lipstick on him. 

           REESE, grunge, daughter of a dead rockstar, is on her phone, 
           chewing gum. 

                                 ZARA
                        Babies!

           They immediately listen to her, all enter. 

           INT. WONDERLAND CLUB

           The party tonight is a DEATH THEME. Everyone has sparklers 
           and colored smoke bombs. On the stage, behind an elaborate 
           dance number, we find:

           CHAPTER 5. “In the U.S. you have to be a deviant or die of 
           boredom.” - burroughs

           From above, find Opie and Mara in the crowd - she’s walking 
           away, he’s following her. Mara doesn’t take her eye off: the 
           VIP room and the socialites within. Zara, etc. 

                                 OPIE
                        I should have never intro’d you to 
                        those girls.

                                 MARA
                        Don’t be bitters, darling. You know 
                        I have to play this right. 

           Mara kisses his cheek, and continues on alone. He watches 
           with apprehension as she disappears into the VIP room.

           INT. VIP ROOM, WONDERLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Mara spots Zara, Vyxn, Nightshade, and Reese. They 
           welcome her in; she’s clearly on some sort of “trial run” as 
           one of their squad.

           (Note: there is Queen Bee tension between Zara and Mara, but 
           the other girls all love Mara so Zara puts up with her.)
           Reese runs her fingers through Mara’s long, white-blonde 
           hair. They all drink champagne, party.

           The nights BLEED INTO EACH OTHER. Flashes of several parties, 
           different outfits.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        It Girls are back, betches. I’m the 
                        only one who wasn’t born with 
                        everything handed to them, but 
                        whatevs, right? I learned the 
                        rules, so I get to play.

           All their legs up on the table, along with drinks, drugs, 
           ashtrays shaped like body parts, shimmery purses. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        This is the currency now, throwing 
                        a decent decadent party, because 
                        the world is crumbling and everyone 
                        just wants to get fucked up and 
                        pretend the American Dream wasn't 
                        up in smoke ages ago. 

           In some parties, DJ Sin is with them. In some, the others 
           have various girlfriends and boyfriends and famous friends. 

           Everyone in the whole club is trying to just get a glimpse of 
           these girls and who they’re with. And they know it.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        They still want to dance around the 
                        ashes marching bolivian marching 
                        powder up noses, powdering the 
                        power hungry with sycophantic 
                        placation and pedantic evasion. No 
                        one wants to stop the music.

           There’s a smug smirk on Mara’s face that should scare anyone. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        When the music stops, that's when 
                        it's all gonna really go mad. 

           EXT. POOL - MORNING

           The BLAZING SUN is blinding as it rises. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        I look forward to it.

           Maybe a few days have passed, maybe a few weeks. 
           Winnie wakes up on a lawn chair with a big surprise: her hair 
           is now a white BLONDE, the shade of Mara’s. She clearly does 
           not remember dying it. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY

           Jaxon makes coffee. Winnie comes down from taking a shower. 

                                 JAX
                             (re: her hair)
                        I’m never going to get used to 
                        that. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You don’t like it.

                                 JAX
                        I do. I love it, it’s just 
                        different, that’s all. Really, you 
                        look gorgeous. 

           She smiles. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Oh, before I forget, your mother’s 
                        been asking why you haven’t called. 

           Winnie heaves a sigh. She’s clearly dreading this.

                                 CATHERINE (PRE-LAP)
                        So what are you going to do?

           EXT. PATIO - DAY

           Winnie paces in the shade while she talks to her mother, 
           CATHERINE, on the phone.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Five years is a big deal. 

                                 WINNIE
                        We’ve only been married for three. 

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        But you are doing something?

                                 WINNIE
                        I’m sure Jax has something planned, 
                        he’s such a romantic. 
                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Hold onto that one. And you better 
                        bring him to visit before you head 
                        back east. Your father and I--

                                 WINNIE
                        Please don’t call him that.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Why not, he practically raised you.

                                 WINNIE
                        I have a father, somewhere--

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        I’m not going into this again.

                                 WINNIE
                        Well, I’m not calling him my 
                        father, he’s not even my stepfather 
                        - he never married you. 

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Now you’re trying to hurt me. 
                        That’s cruel. You’re cruel to me. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Mom, stop it.

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        I did the best I could, you know 
                        how young I was when I had you... 

           Winnie pulls the phone away from her ear as Catherine 
           continues. 

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        ...Who knows why he isn’t into 
                        marriage, but maybe you can talk 
                        some sense into him. He always did 
                        listen to you...

           Catherine just KEEPS going. Winnie shakes her head. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Jaxon drinks his coffee, eyeing Winnie talking to her mother. 
           He watches her come inside. 

                                 JAX
                        So how’s Catherine?
                                 WINNIE
                        You need to ask?

                                 JAX
                        There’s coffee.

           Winnie goes to get some.

                                 WINNIE
                        Hey baby, we have plans for Friday, 
                        right? You’ve made reservations or 
                        something? 

                                 JAX
                        I can. You’ve been so wrapped up in 
                        research and writing, I didn’t 
                        think you wanted anything. 

                                 WINNIE
                             (disappointed)
                        Yeah. 

                                 JAX
                        I’m sorry.

                                 WINNIE
                        No, that makes total sense. 

           Jax feels bad. Winnie could make it better by giving him some 
           affection, but she doesn’t. 

           INT. MR. CALLOWAY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Follow Mr. Calloway as he enters. It’s a cramped place, he’s 
           been there a few months maybe. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Hello?

           He inspects the place. 

           He touches Mara’s toothbrush. Dry.

           Checks his phone. Oh shit, he's TRACKING her. 

           But as he watches her dot moving in Brooklyn, he gets an 
           incoming call from Connecticut. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Calloway. Hello, detective, any 
                        news? 
                             (listening)
                        I’m not sure about that one. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. CALLOWAY (CONT’D)
                             (getting nervous)
                        I’m not sure on that either. I’m 
                        sorry, but it’s all a bit foggy 
                        that night.
                             (getting even worse)
                        That’s not what I meant. I-- yes. 

           Mr. Calloway gulps, hears something. CHATTER from somewhere.

                                 MR. CALLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, is it alright if I call you 
                        back? Thank you.

           He glances around anxiously, increasingly suspicious. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY

           But Winnie has to stop writing, because the CHATTER from the 
           book has grown distracting - and is in REALITY.  

           She peeks around the corner to see:

           Jax having a conversation with R.J. ALEXANDER, 50’s. 

                                 JAX
                        I'm sorry I'm so unprepared, she 
                        didn't tell me anything about 
                        inviting you. 

           Winnie retreats. Processes. 

           IN THE OFFICE - 

           Winnie’s LANDLINE rings. She answers. It’s Sloan; they can 
           see each other through the opposing windows. 

                                 SLOAN
                        You’re not letting RJ see you like 
                        that, are you? 

           BATHROOM - 

           Winnie puts makeup on, smokes. Jax enters. 

                                 JAX
                        Is that a cigarette?

                                 WINNIE
                        Mara smokes.

           He shakes it off. Bigger fish. 
                                 JAX
                        Okay, well, you have a visitor. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I heard you talking. I don’t want 
                        to see him.

                                 JAX
                        Come on. I know you guys didn’t 
                        leave things on the best of terms, 
                        but some part of your subconscious 
                        must have wanted to make things 
                        right. Right?

                                 WINNIE
                        Not really.

                                 JAX
                        Win. Honey. We're going to have a 
                        baby, and he's family, and he’s in 
                        our home. Well, our temporary home. 
                        You have to give him a chance. 

           She sighs, he knows he’s won.  

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        This is gonna be great, you’ll see. 
                        It’ll be good for everyone. 

           IN THE OFFICE -

           The three of them. It’s awkward as hell. Definitely NOT good 
           for everyone. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Well, I’ll let you two catch up. 

           Jax exits (avoiding Winnie’s gaze). Win and RJ left alone.

                                 WINNIE
                        You shouldn’t be here.

                                 RJ
                        You invited me. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I don’t know what I said in my 
                        message, but I was blackout drunk 
                        so any invitations delivered 
                        therein were, according to the 
                        basic standard of human decency, 
                        null and void. 
                                 RJ
                        Is that right? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Yes. 

                                 RJ
                        Well, I didn’t realize my presence 
                        would cause so much pain.

           Winnie hesitates, doesn’t know what to say to this. 

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        Did you get my voicemail? I have a 
                        screening out here next week. New 
                        movie. You’re invited.

                                 WINNIE
                        Thanks, we’ll think about it. 

           It’s obvious by her tone she’s not planning to go. RJ sighs.

                                 RJ
                        Your husband...

           He leans on the word, ‘husband.’ Causes so much distaste that 
           it cuts off the sentence, and he has to try again. 

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        Your husband tells me you're 
                        struggling with the new book. 

                                 WINNIE
                        It’s coming along. 

                                 RJ
                        You look thin. You’re not still 
                        starving yourself, are you? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Course not. I’m fine. I’m great. 

           Beat. She can't help opening up to him. He has a power over 
           her; she wants his approval, his opinion, his sympathy.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Or I was for a while, anyway. I 
                        don't know. After I stopped 
                        cutting, the food shit got worse. 
                        Now it comes and goes. What're you 
                        gonna do. 

           And he knows, from this moment, that his power over her isn’t 
           gone. It’s a quiet victory born in the slightest sneer. 
                                 RJ
                        Listen, I get it, you and me - 
                        we’re cut from the same cloth. Our 
                        pain is the only thing we know how 
                        to turn into art. 

           She appreciates this sentiment, chews on it. He appreciates 
           that she appreciates it.

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        You take everything so seriously. 
                        You always have. 
                             (beat)
                        In high school, you always had to 
                        be the best, but not just the best, 
                        but the best and the first and the 
                        youngest-- you had to be better 
                        than everyone else and even then 
                        you weren't satisfied. I wonder, 
                        are you satisfied now?

                                 WINNIE
                             (wary)
                        What do you mean?

                                 RJ
                        I mean with the book.

                                 WINNIE
                        The book.

                                 RJ
                        Yes.

                                 WINNIE
                        What kind of question is that, am I 
                        satisfied with my book? Jesus.

                                 RJ
                        I’m sure it’s a masterpiece.

           Winnie says nothing, just takes a deep breath, manages a 
           smile-grimace.

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        I'm here for you, always, no matter 
                        what. For anything, Freddie. You 
                        know that, right?

           She nods. 
                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        You proud of me for keeping my 
                        distance? I've done so well, 
                        everything you asked. 

                                 WINNIE
                             (quietly)
                        Thank you.

           He watches her for a moment. Gently lifts her chin, touches 
           her cheek. A sense of ownership about how he touches her. 

           He strokes his fingers through her newly blonde hair.

                                 RJ
                        I like this. Blondie. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Yeah.

           She tenses, pulls away. He feels it.  

                                 RJ
                        I know when I'm not wanted.

                                 WINNIE
                        That's not it--

                                 RJ
                        It's okay, I'm not some kid. You 
                        don’t have to pretend with me.

                                 WINNIE
                        I know.

                                 RJ
                        But you are. You're playing games, 
                        and it's an insult to my 
                        intelligence, honestly. I deserve 
                        more respect from you. Don't you 
                        think? 

                                 WINNIE
                        I think you should go. 

                                 RJ
                        All I want for you is to see you 
                        reach your greatest potential. 
                        That’s all I’ve ever wanted for 
                        you, Freddie. So don’t go thinking 
                        this is about me trying to ‘take’ 
                        something from you somehow. 
                        Alright?
           She nods. 

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        I hope to see you at the screening. 
                             (afterthought)
                        EPs are throwing an afterparty as 
                        well, if you're up for it. Bring 
                        Jax if you want. Bring whoever. 

           He leaves. 

           She raises her hand in front of her; it’s shaking. Then she 
           runs to the bathroom and dry heaves. Stomach acid.

           Then, still shaking, she sits down at her typewriter.

                                 WINNIE (V.O.)
                        I know that endless was your goal/
                        but ends are less than and unless 
                        you undo the tangle towards entry 
                        into eternal/
                        (the lies tying tongues and lungs 
                        in knots but not the way you want)/
                        then there's nothing I can do but 
                        play the part you wrote/ be your 
                        scapegoat/

           Shaking hands begin to RATTLE, as if there’s an earthquake, 
           but really, they are Mara’s hands and we’re:

           INT. SUBWAY, NEW YORK - MORNING

           On the train as it rumbles along its morning commute. 

           Mara stands, clutching the metal bar with distaste. She’s so 
           obviously doing a walk of shame, and everyone else is on 
           their way to work. She glares daggers at humans. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        I disappear, describing my disease 
                        as I leave/ promising that the ease 
                        with which I scrape my initials 
                        into your skin is the most I've 
                        ever given anyone so just know/ it 
                        was never not too late.

           EXT. NEW YORK

           Mara walks down the street towards Calloway’s apartment, 
           dragging her feet, dreading what’s to come. 
                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        We act like we don’t act and we do 
                        it well / but it was never going to 
                        last/ it was a disaster plastered 
                        by a master/ 

           INT. STAIRS, MR. CALLOWAY’S APARTMENT 

           She climbs the stairs.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        What kind of father does what you 
                        did to your daughter?/ Well, here I 
                        am daddy, lamb for the slaughter/

           On the door, “chapter” has been written before the apartment 
           number 6 - “CHAPTER 6.” She enters.

           INT. MR. CALLOWAY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A poster on the wall reads:

           “The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that 
           reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.” -
           nietzsche

           Focus on Mara as she enters. Calloway is furious. (It’s the 
           same day the cops called, a few hours later.) 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Where have you been? 

                                 MARA
                        Out. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Out? That’s it? 

           She goes to the BEDROOM THEY SHARE (note the one bed), and 
           packs a few of her dresses.

                                 MR. CALLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t walk away while I’m talking 
                        to you. You’ll treat me with the 
                        respect I deserve.

                                 MARA
                        I do. 

           She waits for this to sink in. 
                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        What happened to you? You were such 
                        a sweet little girl. 

                                 MARA
                        And then what happened?

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        No, no-- don’t put this on me, you 
                        came onto me. 

                                 MARA
                        I was twelve years old! I was 
                        fucking around, I was testing you. 
                        And guess what? You failed. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        But I broke it off. I did the right 
                        thing. I broke it off, didn’t I? 

                                 MARA
                        Oh, nobel prize to you. 

           Suddenly, there is an odd SPARK in Calloway’s eyes. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        I worried it was possible, when I 
                        saw the body.

                                 MARA
                        Worried about what? 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        That it was you. You that killed 
                        her. You that carved up her baby. 

                                 MARA
                        “Baby?” The thing was all placenta. 
                             (off his reaction)
                        Oh, come on, I’m kidding. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Just tell me the truth. I can 
                        protect you. 

                                 MARA
                        You can’t do shit. You’re pathetic.  

           He grabs her by the shoulders and SHAKES, hard. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        That’s ENOUGH! You will respect me!
                                 MARA
                        Let go--

           She shoves her way out of his grip. She looks long-ways at 
           him, reading him carefully.  

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Do you miss the way I feel? It’s 
                        been a while, hasn’t it.

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Don’t--

           She touches him. 

                                 MARA
                        Yep. A long while. 

           He tries to kiss her, and she DODGES it.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Ew, don’t. 

           She washes her hand with soap, makes a big show of it. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        You used to love me. Once, I know 
                        you did. Maybe even too much.

                                 MARA
                        Back to that, come on, daddy-o. 

           She plays with a HUGE CARVING KNIFE. Somehow makes it sexual. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t really think I murdered 
                        my own mother? I loved that woman. 
                        She made a totes decent low cal 
                        turkey meatball. 

           She turns on him, wielding the knife. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        How do I know YOU didn’t kill her? 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Why don’t you give me the knife?

                                 MARA
                        Don’t patronize me. We both know 
                        how much higher my IQ is than 
                        yours. 
                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        You are a very intelligent girl--

                                 MARA
                        I said, don’t fucking patronize me! 
                        I’m sick of you, I’m sick of this 
                        sickness, whatever disease has kept 
                        us connected-- I’m sick of the 
                        leash you keep around my neck! I’m 
                        done. 

           She starts gathering the things she packed.

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        The hell you are--

           He tries to stop her from leaving. She holds out the knife. 

                                 MARA
                        Get away from me. It’s over. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Is that how you see it?

           He keeps coming toward her, so she attacks with her knife, 
           but he overpowers her, forces her to drop it. 

           They scuffle. He holds her down. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        I know you still want me. 

                                 MARA
                        I never wanted you, don’t you get 
                        that? It was just a game. A stupid 
                        little game. And now, you need to 
                        deal with the fact that it is OVER. 

           She spits in his face. He slaps her with full strength. She 
           licks the blood from her split lip, and snarls, almost feral. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        If that’s how you want it, fine. 
                        That’s how it’ll be. Princess Mara.

           He turns her over. Holds her wrists, his body keeping hers 
           down. 

                                 MARA
                        No, stop, wait. Stop. Stop! 

           He rips her pants down, and is so focused that Mara has the 
           opportunity to reach up and grab something--
                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Ah-ah!

           He slides the knife out of reach, and she cries out, lost...

           And it’s bad. She’s screaming, he’s pounding away. Except 
           that she DID get what she was reaching for:

           Her phone. And 911 is on speaker. 

                                 MARA
                        Please, stop. It hurts. Please--

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Shut up. 

           She sobs, cries loudly. 

           ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE -

           The 911 operator can hear a clear rape in progress. She 
           RECORDS it. 

                                 MARA
                        Whatever you think I did, I’m 
                        sorry, daddy. Please. I just want 
                        to be your little girl again. 

                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        Yeah, you know what, I like that. 
                        Tell me more about how much you 
                        love me. Tell me you belong to me.

                                 MARA
                             (in a broken voice)
                        I... I belong to you. 

           He loosens his grip on her as he comes.

           It’s all she needs; she LUNGES for the knife.

           Before he can even react, it’s buried in his stomach.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                             (shocked, horrified)
                        I’m so sorry. 

           But then she drops the mortification like a MASK.

           She holds up the phone, shows that it’s on 911 speakerhone, 
           and hangs up.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Oops. Silly speakerphone. 
                                 MR. CALLOWAY
                        You planned... all of this...

                                 MARA
                        That’s a pretty elaborate theory. 

           She smirks, goes in to finish him off.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        I wonder what your heart tastes 
                        like, I bet I can still taste your 
                        love for me, bittersweet--

           But she underestimates him, and he LUNGES at her.

           Manages to grab her ankle, PULLS HER TO THE GROUND. 

           She wriggles free and makes a break for the door. Her clothes 
           ripped, her hair wild, she is a mess. 

           He comes after her, stumbling, leaving a bloody trail smeared 
           down the stairs... 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        When do you become a woman? 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie breaks down by herself, alone, in the safest place she 
           can find - underneath the desk. Holds her knees to her chest 
           and just falls apart. The scene has taken A LOT out of her. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        The first time your world is 
                        shattered? The first time you 
                        shatter someone else?

           Winnie looks at a picture of Catherine, RJ, and their son 
           (her half-brother), 7. Tortures herself with it. 

           EXT. PATIO - DAY

           The two cats fight over a dying bird. It’s bloody and brutal, 
           and Winnie just watches. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        The moment you realize you can flip 
                        a switch and feel nothing at all. 
           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           She writes in her notebook: “I am the b in numb, the letter 
           even the word doesn’t feel.” She is barely present. Dazed.

           In this state, Winnie is able to REVISE her earlier “when do 
           you become a woman” opening to include the horrendous taboo 
           of the father/daughter incest...

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        For me, it was a very specific 
                        moment...

           EXT. MARA’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Mara shares a cigarette with Mr. Calloway. There is unstated 
           INTIMACY. We are seeing how they used to be. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        ...At a very specific time...

           Mara goes to kiss Mr. Calloway, but he STOPS her. Focus on 
           his hand, where there is an ULTRASOUND. This is him breaking 
           things off due to Mrs. Calloway’s pregnancy. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        And I could describe each detail as 
                        if it happened this morning, 
                        because I could never forget even 
                        if I wanted to...

           As soon as Mr. Calloway finishes speaking and turns, Mara’s 
           face resolves from sadness to pure MENACE. 

           INT. MARA’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Mara watches Mr. Calloway get in his car and pull away.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        ...And I didn't want to. 

           She sharpens a KNIFE.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        It was the first time I tasted 
                        blood. 

           We follow her into her mother’s bedroom. She kills her 
           mother, drinks her blood. Lays her head in it.
                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        Everyone bleeds differently, I 
                        learned. My mother’s was so-so, 
                        there was too much regret watering 
                        it down. But my unborn brother, in 
                        the womb... 

           She digs her head into the warm flesh, ferocious.

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        I tasted innocence again, and I 
                        felt, in that moment, whole in a 
                        way I’d never been. 

           Show her now bloody, staring at herself in the mirror. A new 
           light to her. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        I looked like a 16-year-old girl, 
                        but I was a woman, and I knew 
                        hunger, I knew power, and I knew 
                        nothing would ever be the same.

           She starts sobbing, acting in the mirror, increasingly 
           horrified. We know it’s fake but damn, she’s good. We almost 
           believe her anyway. 

           The police come, she collapses on the stairs in tears. 

           INT. POLICE STATION, MANHATTAN - PRESENT DAY

           Mara performs the same thing for the cops, only this time for 
           her father’s stabbing (about two years later.)

           She sobs. A kind female cop comforts her. 

           Close on some paperwork, where is written:

           CHAPTER 7. “Selves will accumulate when one isn’t looking, 
           and they don’t always act wisely or well.” - Diane Ackerman

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           A few pastel BALLOONS. Candles. Light music. A homecooked 
           meal on the table. 

           It’s Friday. Their anniversary. Jax has done as much as he 
           can to give Winnie a good time, but she’s already 
           unimpressed. He pours her a glass of bubbly.

                                 JAX
                        Champagne, my queen?
                                 WINNIE
                        That’s prosecco.

                                 JAX
                        Can you really tell the difference?

                                 WINNIE
                        Yes. 

                                 JAX
                        I didn’t think it would matter.
                             (corny on purpose)
                        We have each other, isn’t that 
                        enough? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Yeah, no. Totally. 

           He sighs heavily, feeling the weight that she’s putting 
           there. He feels like HE is not enough. 

                                 JAX
                        You want to know the truth? The 
                        truth is, Win, that we’re not 
                        liquid right now. As soon as the 
                        sale goes through, and I’m working 
                        as hard as I can on it with Harry, 
                        as soon as that happens, we can go 
                        back to normal. Till then, just 
                        bear with me, okay? Nothing’s gonna 
                        change - nothing major. Just bear 
                        with me. 
                             (off her anxiety)
                        We’re okay. 

                                 WINNIE
                        But are we? 

                                 JAX
                        This is why I didn’t tell you. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Thanks for that, by the way.

                                 JAX
                        Well, look what it’s doing. I know 
                        how you get. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Fuck you.

           She grabs the BOTTLE of prosecco and drinks from it. Fire of 
           her rage just gaining momentum. 
                                 JAX
                        Winnie--

                                 WINNIE
                        No, you’re supposed to tell me big 
                        things like this. How do you expect 
                        us to have a family? What if I 
                        can’t finish this book, what will 
                        we do? This makes so much sense, 
                        this is why we’re housesitting, why 
                        you’re pushing me to finish-- have 
                        you been talking to Tracey? 

                                 JAX
                        You need to calm down--

                                 WINNIE
                        Stop telling me what to do. 

                                 JAX
                        Honey, you have to--

                                 WINNIE
                        I said, STOP IT!

           She throws the wine bottle ACROSS THE ROOM. Some of the 
           shards come sliding across the floor near Jax. He gives her a 
           moment, then approaches. All her anger and energy seem to 
           have smashed with the bottle. 

           Now she is quiet, small, frail. 

           (The effect of this is shocking; how quickly she transitions 
           from larger than life - a formidable powerhouse - to this 
           mousey girl-child.)

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JAX
                        It's okay. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I wasn't aiming for you.

                                 JAX
                        I know. I'll clean it up.

                                 WINNIE
                        Please don't. 
                             (draws him closer)
                        I love you.
                                 JAX
                        I love you too. 

           EXT. PALM SPRINGS NEIGHBORHOOD - EARLY MORNING

           She walks Hemingway around the neighborhood. It’s a ghost-
           town. She keeps blinking, seeing things out of the corners of 
           her eyes.

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           Winnie takes pills. Debates, then takes more. 

           Tries writing. Her eyes sunken, looking thin, tired, worn. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        I’ve been playing it safe. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Black and white. A pretty girl is MURDERED. Pull back to show 
           we’re in--

           INT. DJ SIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Where Mara is watching the warehouse SNUFF FILM on a laptop. 

           She licks a cherry lollipop, a poor substitute for blood. She 
           slams the laptop closed, frustrated. American psycho version 
           of blue-balls. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        After what happened, I wanted to be 
                        careful, I know, major yawn. But 
                        I’m over that now. I’m bored and 
                        I’m hungry. 

           The DJ enters, and Mara eyes him. She kisses his neck, bites.

                                 DJ SIN
                        Ow! Crazy girl.

                                 MARA
                        You know you love it. 

           But now isn’t the time. Mara can’t do it because Winnie can’t 
           do it, because Winnie is--
           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           Ripping the pages out of the typewriter. 

           Sinking down into the corner. 

           Darkness surrounds her. Voices HISS at her. She shuts her 
           eyes tightly. More pills. She dials her mother. 

                                 CATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Hello? Winnie?

           Winnie hangs up. She tries to stay awake, but--

           INT. MIRROR MAZE

           Back in the dreamscape, Winnie knows what it is this time. 

           She starts running, trying to find the light - the way out. 
           The shadow creatures are stronger than they’ve ever been.

           The mirror maze leads her to a room with the claw-foot 
           bathtub, filled with blood. 

           RISING FROM THE TUB - the Shadow Creature we saw before, 
           becoming stronger each time. 

           Winnie almost gives up, but one of the mirrors reflects the 
           LIGHT. So she runs again, the creature right behind her. 

           She makes a break for the room with the light - it’s the PALM 
           SPRINGS BATHROOM. She smashes it, just in time--

           INT. BATHROOM, PALM SPRINGS

           Winnie - back in reality - stands, dazed, looking into the 
           CRACKED MIRROR. 

           She leans closer, seeing more behind the million pieces of 
           Winnie. She touches the mirror at the center, where it 
           splits, and as she does, she sees the fanged creature and 
           tries to scream--

           But instead, she CHOKES. 

           She starts pulling long CLUMPS of hair from her throat. 

           A muffled scream as she feels something PULSATING INSIDE HER.  

           Something - some energy - some force - is trying to carve 
           itself from the inside of her stomach. 
           IN THE MIRROR: fingernail knives stab from within her belly, 
           OUT, and slices up to her ribs. DARK BLOOD sprays everywhere.

           The shape of a GIRL - fully grown - begins to emerge. 

           Bloody hand reaches out of the slit in her stomach like some 
           twisted, mutated Cesarian section. For a moment, it’s almost 
           as if she’s GROWING A THIRD ARM.

           Physical impossibility, and yet we watch it happen. 

           The hand slides down the OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR.

           She tries to open the bathroom door to escape - but it’s 
           locked. She bangs on it, unable to scream, throwing up more 
           and more. Hair, organs, blood, an eyeball.  

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Jax pauses playing guitar, hearing something. He goes to 
           investigate. 

           IN THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jax comes in and finds her looking mental - fingers bent at 
           odd angles, head down. Huddling in the corner, muttering, 
           shaking. There is no longer blood or anything coming out of 
           her - all appears normal. The mirror isn’t even broken.

                                 JAX
                        You need sleep, Win. You need to 
                        eat, and you need to sleep, these 
                        are human things. 

                                 WINNIE
                        No! I did, I can’t. Please. I can’t 
                        go back there.

                                 JAX
                        You need help, baby, let me get you 
                        some help. 

           Winnie looks up, suddenly much more quiet, certain.

                                 WINNIE
                        You can’t help me. No one can. 

           Jax is lost, unsure. She struggles to her feet.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        She’s hungry.
                                 JAX
                        Does that mean you’ll eat some 
                        food? 

           She looks sadly back at him, shakes her head, NO. 

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           Winnie pulls out her Adderall, a sugar-free red bull, and a 
           martini glass. She pours straight vodka into the glass. 

           INT. WONDERLAND CLUB

           The martini glass becomes a GIANT SET PIECE in Wonderland, 
           where girls are swimming. 

           The party is themed so that everything is WAY over-sized, and 
           you feel like a miniature person in another world. 

           Performers in skin-tight pill-costumes dance inside huge 
           prescription bottles. DJ SIN does a set. Winks at:

           Mara, in the crowd. She blows him a kiss, and he catches it 
           just the way Jaxon does in real life, with a crunch. 

           INT. WONDERLAND, BACK OFFICE

           Mara takes DJ Sin into the back office, using a KEY she’s 
           clearly stolen from Opie (the one he uses to get in the back 
           door). They are going at it wildly. They fuck. 

           Then she slices his neck open. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        The music finally stops, and this 
                        lovely, vicious world is mine. 

           Everything goes QUIET as she drinks deeply, and it’s so 
           satisfying. Life restored to each pore. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        He tastes exactly as I imagine.

           Mara catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror, her mouth 
           dripping with SILVER SHIMMERY BLOOD. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        Like applause and cherry pie. 

           BACK IN THE CLUB - 
           As she walks out, everyone ADORES her. The green-haired gay 
           guy approaches.

                                 GREEN-HAIRED BOY
                        I don’t even like pussy and I’d 
                        fuck you. Just felt like you should 
                        know that. 

           She smirks, kisses him, and keeps walking. The IT GIRL SQUAD 
           greets her (except Zara, of course, who is cold as usual.) 

                                 REESE
                        There you are. It’s been ages! 

                                 MARA
                        I know, I’ve been looking rough so 
                        I didn’t want to show. 

                                 NIGHTSHADE
                        What are you talking about, your 
                        skin looks amaze.

                                 VXYN
                        Yeah, you’re like, glowing. 

                                 ZARA
                        I can give you my doctor’s number 
                        if you need some help. He’s 
                        expensive, though, so...

           And watching this whole thing is the owner of Wonderland: 
           HENRY, 50’s, brooding brand of handsome, something ominous 
           behind perfectly tailored everything. 

           He watches Mara and then goes into the back office...

           INT. WONDERLAND, BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Where he finds the DJ’s dead body, silver blood everywhere. 

           And he smiles and locks the door. Hand slides down his pants.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           Jax talks to Dr. K (Winnie’s shrink) over the phone. 

                                 JAX
                        ...Besides that? She won’t eat, 
                        she’s barely sleeping. Like an hour 
                        a night, on average. I agree, and 
                        I’ve been trying to get her on the 
                        phone with you, but...
           He hears Winnie coming, wraps it up. 

                                 JAX (CONT'D)
                        I’ll try that. Thank you, doctor.

           He hangs up as Winnie gets herself some water. He approaches. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        You’re looking better. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I feel it. Sorry about before. It 
                        was just-- you know how characters 
                        make me.

                                 JAX
                        Yeah, but it’s never been this--

                                 WINNIE
                        This what? 

                                 JAX
                        Nothing. I just think you deserve a 
                        little break. Yeah? Let me take you 
                        out tomorrow, celebrate how hard 
                        you’ve been working. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Can we afford to?

                                 JAX
                        I told you not to worry about that 
                        stuff. 

           She shrugs, agrees. He kisses her. 

           EXT. PALM SPRINGS AERIAL TRAMWAY - DAY

           They go up the tramway, with its GORGEOUS views. Jax is 
           overly positive. Calm before the storm. 

           INT. RESTAURANT AT THE TOP - DAY

           It overlooks the valley, stunning. 

           When the food arrives, Winnie tries to cut it up and take a 
           bite but can’t.

           Then, when she finally does, she’s chewing it and sees 
           MAGGOTS crawling all over it - and spits it out.
                                 WINNIE
                        Please don’t make me, please. 

           He doesn’t want to make a scene, nods. Waves for the check. 

           Jax goes to Winnie’s side of the table, calms her. She leans 
           into him, grateful.

                                 JAX
                        Baby, will you please call your 
                        doctor about this? For me? 

           The WAITER returns.

                                 WAITER
                        I’m sorry, sir, your card has been 
                        declined. 

           INT. BEDROOM, PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - EVENING

           They’re back, and Winnie is urgently preparing to go out, 
           sucking on her vape every other breath. 

           Jax is trying to stop Winnie as she is undressing. 

                                 JAX
                        You need to rest. You’ve had a long 
                        day, you shouldn’t be going 
                        anywhere right now. 

           She sighs dramatically, pulls on a dress. Mara within her is 
           telling her there’s somewhere she needs to be right now. 

                                 WINNIE
                        She feels better, so it’s fine. She 
                        wants to party.

                                 JAX
                        I’m really starting to hate this 
                        Sloan girl. I don’t think she’s 
                        good for you.

                                 WINNIE
                        I wasn’t talking about-- 
                             (breaks off)
                        What are you doing?

           He’s blocking her, standing in front of the door. 

                                 JAX
                        You need to stay in, Winnie, you’re 
                        not thinking clearly. 
                                 WINNIE
                        And you’re gonna stop me, huh? 

           Something in this is dangerous. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you’ve been drinking more. 
                        Are you drunk right now? 

                                 JAX
                        No.

                                 WINNIE
                        Because that’s what you said that 
                        one time. Oh that’s right, you 
                        can’t remember. Want me to remind 
                        you what happened? 

           Jax tries to speak, but he swallows whatever brutal pain this 
           has brought up. Instead, he steps aside. She wins. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought. 

           She exits. He watches her get in the mustang, then turns 
           away. He’s biting back a BREAKDOWN.

           He goes to the bottle. Hesitates. Fuck it, fuck her. The pain 
           is too sharp. He needs this. 

           Takes a few sips. Exhales a shaky breath, slowly steadying. 

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS

           Half hour later or so. Jax pokes his head into the office. 

           Starts to look through her NOTEBOOK. He reads.

                                 JAX
                        “I am not me anymore. I look in the 
                        mirror and I don't know which 
                        version of myself will stare back.”

           Struck by this, he flips to another page. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        “I grew up starving and now I don’t 
                        know how to be full. Jaxon is 
                        getting sick of me, I know he is. I 
                        saw the way he looked at me today, 
                        not with love but the way I see 
                        myself, and sadly--”
                             (breaks off, then:)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        “And sadly, the only real surprise 
                        is that it’s taken him this long to 
                        see how broken I am, that he 
                        deserves better, because he--”

           He breaks off again, unable to continue. We just see it on 
           the page:

           “...because he does. RJ called me a dangerous girl. I drive 
           people to insanity, that is the kind of person I am. A 
           dangerous girl.” 

           Jax stops there, closes the journal.

           Hesitates. His phone rings. It’s Winnie. She speaks first.

           He listens to her for a while, clearly hearing a heartfelt 
           apology because he softens considerably. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. No, you’ve been cooped 
                        up, you have fun. You deserve it. 

           Beat. He listens.

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        It’s really okay. I... I should be 
                        cutting down on drinking anyway, 
                        you’re right. I can’t afford to 
                        blackout and lose control, I’d 
                        never forgive myself. Love you too. 

           INT. MANSION - EVENING

           Sloan - dressed goth chic - climbs off the sink in the 
           bathroom of the mansion and hands Winnie’s phone back to her. 

                                 WINNIE
                        How did you do that? Your voice 
                        sounded exactly... that’s crazy. 

           They exit the bathroom and enter THE PARTY. It’s not that 
           wild, since it’s summer and everyone is hot and lethargic. 
           But it’s not nothing. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        How did you know what to say?

                                 SLOAN
                        Boys like Jax, they always want to 
                        be the good guy. 
                                 WINNIE
                        You say that like it's a bad thing. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Good is bad, bad is good, down is 
                        high, boy is bye, and you, winning 
                        Winnie, are a dark-eyed party 
                        paradise. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Whatever you're on, I need some.

           Sloan points to an elegant actress in a thin gold bodysuit.

           Winnie heads over to ask about pills. Sloan, meanwhile, 
           crosses to the kitchen and lights her cig on the gas burner. 
           Sloan then watches as: RJ CROSSES THE ROOM. 

           Closer, with Winnie and the actress:

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re so lovely, thank you.

           RJ interrupts them.

                                 RJ
                        I didn’t think you’d make it. 

           Winnie greets him, waits for him to exchange cheek kisses 
           with the actress.

                                 WINNIE
                        Sorry I missed the screening.
                             (he waves this off)
                        I brought a friend too, Sloan--

           Winnie suddenly realizes she doesn’t know where Sloan is.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. She’s here somewhere.

                                 RJ
                        I look forward to meeting her. 

           He too takes a pill. Raises his glass to her. You can tell he 
           thinks the fact that she’s here really ‘means something.’

           But Win’s focus is elsewhere...

                                 WINNIE
                        Is that champagne? Real champagne?
                                 RJ
                        Only the best. Six G’s a bottle. 
                        Can I get you a glass? 

           EXT. MANSION - EVENING

           Sloan and Winnie lay outside on the edge of a MASSIVE pool, 
           sharing a bottle of that expensive champagne, watching the 
           pink-purple haze behind the jagged blue mountains.

                                 SLOAN
                        I don’t get it, what are you upset 
                        about? He offered.

                                 WINNIE
                        Obviously I’m not taking it. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Why not?

                                 WINNIE
                        Alright, genius, what do you think 
                        I should do?

                                 SLOAN
                        Take RJ’s money, use his 
                        connections to build an empire, 
                        fuck the world with your words. Oh, 
                        and dump Jax.

                                 WINNIE
                        Very funny. 

                                 SLOAN
                        You think I’m joking? A man who 
                        can’t pick up the check is not a 
                        man, he’s a boy. It’s totally fair 
                        to get upset if your guy goes 
                        broke. It’s like if you gained 
                        fifty pounds. 

                                 WINNIE
                        How? How is it like that?  

                                 SLOAN
                        Seriously, Freddie, if you gained 
                        fifty pounds, like--
                             (blows up her cheeks)
                        You’re telling me honestly Jax 
                        wouldn’t be thinking about someone 
                        else? And if he did, that you 
                        wouldn’t blame him? 
                                 WINNIE
                        Jax isn’t like that. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Have you even been in the world 
                        recently? Have you forgotten how it 
                        works?

                                 WINNIE
                        You know, for someone so 
                        intelligent, you’re incredibly 
                        shallow.

                                 SLOAN
                        Thank you. 
                             (off her look)
                        I try not to overthink things, it 
                        limits the botox I’ll need in the 
                        future. Keep to the lite versions 
                        of heavy subjects. The diet 
                        philosophy. Think of death in terms 
                        of life. Think of life in terms of 
                        things. Think of things in terms of 
                        how much envy they'll beget in the 
                        eyes of your frenemies.

                                 WINNIE
                        Got any cancer? I’m out.

           Sloan holds out a cigarette for her. The smoke drifts over 
           the pool, transitions us into the fictional world...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Smokey but fancy hotel room. Lacey white underwear on long 
           legs. Curve around a perfect ass to find, tucked into the 
           front, a sharp silver knife. 

                                 MARA (V.O.)
                        Welcome to the dark side; welcome 
                        to reality. 

           Flawless red nails slide down to the knife, and lift it out. 

           As Mara walks away, see, in the mirror, written in lipstick:

           Chapter 8. “Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.” - kissinger

           Focus back to the knife, held out next to that ass. 

           Mara carefully approaches the luxurious bed where HENRY is 
           waiting for her. 
           He looks her up and down. He registers the knife, then offers 
           a mirror stacked with cocaine. She uses the knife to deftly 
           take a small line. 

           But then, she takes the knife TO HIS NECK. Clear silver blade 
           against throbbing Adam’s apple.

                                 MARA
                        Why shouldn’t I?

                                 HENRY
                        Is this a test?

                                 MARA
                        Maybe.

                                 HENRY
                        If you want to, go ahead. But I 
                        think, between my death and this 
                        moment, there are much more 
                        appetizing options. 

                                 MARA
                        What if I’ve got a taste for blood?

                                 HENRY
                        There are better bodies than mine 
                        to slake that lust, darling. 

                                 MARA
                        That’s funny.

                                 HENRY
                        Hardly.

                                 MARA
                        You’re not serious?

                                 HENRY
                        Quite. 

           Mara draws back, evaluating him.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        If you’ll let me, I’ll show you how 
                        serious I am. I’ll call up a call 
                        girl for you right now. 

           He reaches for the phone, but she stops him, holding the 
           knife to him. 
                                 MARA
                        It’s not about what’s on the 
                        outside. It’s the thing the soul 
                        lives for.

                                 HENRY
                        Fascinating. So what was it with 
                        the DJ, his fans? His influence? 

           She is scared for a moment. Draws back. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I cleaned it up. No 
                        one else knows. 

                                 MARA
                        What do you want? 

                                 HENRY
                        Your companionship for the days 
                        I’ve got left - a few years, 
                        according to my doctor. Terminal. 
                        In exchange, I will open the world 
                        to you, doors you never imagined 
                        existed. You’re special, and I can 
                        help you, teach you, protect you. 
                        Let me spoil you rotten. 

           She contemplates his offer. Paces. Goes through his wallet. 

                                 MARA
                        At first, I thought you reminded me 
                        of someone. But now I see you’re 
                        nothing like him.

                                 HENRY
                        I hope that’s a good thing. 

           Mara approaches, runs the knife from neck to balls - ever so 
           lightly, a TEASE. Then she licks the knife, and puts it back 
           in her thigh-highs. 

                                 MARA
                        You die on your own time, daddy. 
                        We’re gonna make out alright, you 
                        and me. 

           Mara grabs a massive handful of cash from the wallet and 
           sticks it in her bra. Wraps a fur around her body, lights a 
           cig, blows Henry a kiss, and leaves.
           INT. MANSION - NIGHT

           As the party continues, Winnie seeks out RJ. He’s in a room 
           with some fans and D-list actors. He shoos them out when 
           Winnie enters. 

                                 RJ
                        So. You’re back. 

           She tries to be confident, strong. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Love does not conquer all. Love 
                        must sometimes be conquered. 

                                 RJ
                        Who wrote that? 

                                 WINNIE
                        I did. 

                                 RJ
                        You did. About me?

                                 WINNIE
                        Maybe.

                                 RJ
                        You think about me a lot, don’t 
                        you.

                                 WINNIE
                        Do you think about me?

                                 RJ
                        Haven’t you seen my movies?

                                 WINNIE
                        My shrink says they would be 
                        triggers.

                                 RJ
                        You told her about us?

                                 WINNIE
                        I told her the same thing I told 
                        Jax. That you were famous and had a 
                        family, and I couldn’t use your 
                        real name. 

                                 RJ
                        Very considerate of you.
                                 WINNIE
                        I didn’t do it for you. 
                             (beat)
                        My mother... she really never 
                        suspected anything? 

                                 RJ
                        At this point, it’s hardly 
                        relevant. Even if you told her, 
                        nothing would change.  

           Winnie tries to grasp what he’s saying. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You don’t think she’d believe me?

                                 RJ
                        Was that a threat?

                                 WINNIE
                        No, what--

                                 RJ
                        I was kidding. I know you’d never 
                        hurt me.

           Beat. Tense.

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        Your mother believes what is 
                        convenient for her to believe. I am 
                        her boyfriend, her baby daddy, her 
                        provider, the golden ticket for her 
                        precious boy. The father figure to 
                        her daughter. Her troubled, 
                        difficult daughter, who struggles 
                        with depression and delusions and… 
                        well, you get the point. 

           These words - the implication of them - is not lost on her.

                                 WINNIE
                        Yeah. I get it. 

                                 RJ
                        What was that?

                                 WINNIE
                        Nothing. 

                                 RJ
                        I should take you over my knee for 
                        that. 
           She doesn't move. He’s testing her... 

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        You'd let me, wouldn't you. Even 
                        now.

                                 WINNIE
                        That’s not fair.

                                 RJ
                        But you would.

           He takes her onto his lap like a little girl. She sits on one 
           knee, lets him hold her, says nothing. 

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        Haven't you missed me, Freddie? 
                        Haven't you missed me at all?

                                 WINNIE
                        Of course I have. 

                                 RJ
                        Show me. Kiss me.

                                 WINNIE
                        I can’t, you know I can’t.

           She turns her head away. 

                                 RJ
                        And you talk about unfair. Do you 
                        know what torture this is for me? 

                                 WINNIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 RJ
                        You’re depriving yourself of a full 
                        life experience. Monogamy is a 
                        myth, Freddie. No one wants to tell 
                        you that part. 

           Looking for an excuse to not be on his lap, she gets up to 
           get her purse. Checks something in it.

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        You know what Faulkner said about 
                        all this? He was being interviewed 
                        for The Paris Review, and-- well, 
                        I’ll read it to you because you’ll 
                        appreciate it. 

           He finds the quote easily, reads to her.
                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        “The writer’s only responsibility 
                        is to his art.” Only 
                        responsibility, you hear that? 
                        Only. “He will be completely 
                        ruthless if he is a good one. He 
                        has a dream. It anguishes him so 
                        much he must get rid of it. He has 
                        no peace until then. Everything 
                        goes by the board: honor, pride, 
                        decency, security, happiness, all, 
                        to get the book written. If a 
                        writer has to rob his mother, he 
                        will not hesitate; the “Ode on a 
                        Grecian Urn” is worth any number of 
                        old ladies.” I love that bit, any 
                        number of old ladies. 

           Winnie processes what he is saying. What it means. What it 
           means to RJ, specifically. Don’t worry about your marriage, 
           do whatever you want. And I know you want me, so... 

           As she is leaving--

                                 RJ (CONT’D)
                        Hey. 

           He nods to an envelope on the dresser. She takes it. 

           INT. OFFICE, PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie takes the CASH out of the envelope, puts most of it 
           with the drugs in the fake book. Keeps a little on hand. Sits 
           down to write. 

           In her notebook, she writes. “Everything is material.” And 
           directly after: “Everything is material.”

           Looks at the money. Ben Franklin carries us through to:

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT

           A bed covered in hundred dollar bills. Mara makes a money-
           angel in it. Music blasts. She’s in heaven. 

           This is her new apartment, and it’s MAD COOL. It’s covered in 
           MIRRORS - much like the maze that Winnie is trapped in when 
           she sleeps. There are doors that don’t look like doors and 
           secret compartments and glamour-punk decor.

           (Note: while the mirrors are a terrifying trap for Winnie; 
           for Mara, they re-enforce her own power.)
           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           PHOTOSHOOT - Mara lays on the hood of a familiar ‘54 Mustang 
           as the cameras flash. Balloons hold up parts of her dress. 

           The camera’s flashes take us in and out of various memories.

           FLASH OF: Mara and Henry, their strange bond.

                        I learn from Henry, magic shadow 
                        man of my dreams, man with all the 
                        keys. He gets me.

                        look like you are 12 and really be 
                        somewhere like 16.

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           A GROAN comes from the other room. It’s the green-haired boy, 
           bleeding from the head, tied up. 

           Mara approaches him with sadistic thrill. 

                                 MARA
                        Oh good, you’re awake. What do you 
                        think of my new digs? 

                                 GREEN-HAIRED BOY
                        Whatever you’re planning, you won’t 
                        get away with it. 
                                 MARA
                        Oh, sweetie, that’s the thing. I, 
                        like, totally will. 

           She lays her hands across his neck. He pulls away, scared out 
           of his mind. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        You see, my new daddy takes care of 
                        me. He’ll take care of you too. 
                             (off his hope)
                        When I’m done with you, that is.

           She laughs at his terror, a true villain now. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        I wonder what you taste like. I try 
                        to always guess first. 

           Her fingers have fake metal nails that act as individual 
           knives (and double as a badass fashion statement).

           She slices his neck open and we hear his screams slowly fade 
           as Mara just watches, salivating.

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        What do you know. The insides match 
                        the drapes. 

           His blood is indeed, the exact green shade as his hair. 

           LATER THAT NIGHT --

           A small glass bottle of green is tied with bow, and labeled: 
           “OBSESSION” and then brought to--

           A secret compartment behind several layers of mirrors.

           Within, there are already a few bottles. Gold, labeled 
           “INNOCENCE.” Pale yellow, labeled “FUTILITY.” Silver, labeled 
           “APPLAUSE.” 

           There’s a knock at the door. Excited, Mara goes to greet her 
           date: Opie. 

                                 OPIE
                        This place is brill. You have to 
                        have a party. 

                                 MARA
                        Oh, I’m having a party. But it’s 
                        going to be girls only. 
                                 OPIE
                        No fair.

                                 MARA
                        I’ll take pix for you. 

                                 OPIE
                        F’real?

                                 MARA
                        Duh. I love you, dirty boy. 

                                 OPIE
                        God you’re amazing. 

                                 MARA
                        Not love like THAT. 

                                 OPIE
                        I know. 

           He extends the Altoid container. In the background, a 
           familiar CACTUS. The cactus takes us back to:

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           Same plant, poolside. Winne and Sloan are on floaties 
           (flamingo, shark). Sunglasses, sunhats, bikinis, drinks.

                        Without perspective, we are

                        listening.  

           Winnie plays a few of her VOICEMAIL MESSAGES.

                        Now that I’ve seen you, I’ve got to 
                        see you again. Come out to LA. Make 
                        some excuse. Please, I need to see 
                        you. I’ll drive back out. I don’t 
                        care. 
                             (beep, next message)
                        Call me back, will you? You can’t 
                        just ignore me. At least text or 
                        email or something.  
                             (beep)
                        You know, you’ve got some fucking 
                        nerve. After all the shit I did for 
                        you? I don’t care about the money, 
                        it doesn’t matter. But Freddie, 
                        your whole life is because of me.

                        You think you’d have anything at 
                        all? An education? An agent? 
                        Anything? No. You’d be in the 
                        streets. You’re ungrateful and 
                        lost, and you chose someone that 
                        you could control. 

                                 WINNIE
                        And then there’s, like, a million 
                        emails, texts, all this shit. How’s 
                        that for perspective?

                                 SLOAN
                        Being a man is hard. Being a girl 
                        is easy as long as you know what to 
                        say. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I don’t know what to say. Or do. 

           They lay there for a while in silence.

           Winnie’s eyes are glazed over, watching something that glints 
           in the light on the pool’s surface, unsure what it is. 

                                 SLOAN
                        One night, like, a bajillion years 
                        ago, this guy - Zhuangzi - has this 
                        exceptionally dope dream where he’s 
                        this baller butterfly with no 
                        worries, just flying around, chill 
                        as fuck. And then, Zhuangzi wakes 
                        up, right, and he goes, I have no 
                        way to know if I’m a man who 
                        dreampt he was a butterfly, or if 
                        I’m a butterfly dreaming - right 
                        now - that I am Zhuangzi. 

           Sloan finishes her drink, slurps through the straw. Winnie 
           squints at the object, which now looks like a plastic bag 
           full of goldfish.  

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Goldfish in a plastic bag, held in Reese’s arms - it’s her 
           housewarming gift. She hands it to Mara, who is welcoming all 
           the girls to her party. 

                                 REESE
                             (admiring the apt)
                        Straight fire, betch, damn. 

           She’s not the only one. They’re all impressed. 
           Magnets on the fridge read:

           CHAPTER 9. “Revenge is sweet and not fattening.” - hitchcock.

                                 ZARA
                        How do you afford this place? No 
                        offense.

                                 MARA
                        I make it work. 
                             (leans in)
                        I got some ode pure white girl, but 
                        I don’t have much, you wanna... 
                        maybe ghost the squad for a sec?

           She nods toward the bedroom. Zara is all about it. As Zara 
           slips away to the room, Mara sets up the others to party.

           Turns the volume on her pricey music system to MAX. 

           INT. BEDROOM, MARA’S APARTMENT

           Zara looks over Mara’s things. Mara enters, startles her. 

                                 MARA
                        I feel like there’s been this 
                        rivalry between us, and maybe it’s 
                        not just because our names are, you 
                        know, but...

           Mara pulls out a silver tray, a baggy of pure coke, and dumps 
           it out, starts cutting it up with a razor blade. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Touch it. Straight from the coca 
                        plant to your expensive nose. 

           Zara tests it out. Does a small bump. Is impressed. 

                                 ZARA
                        Gucci.

           Mara rolls a couple hundred dollar bills, hands one to Zara.

                                 MARA
                        It’s our peace pipe.

                                 ZARA
                        Is that like, offensive?

                                 MARA
                        Probably. Or maybe thinking it’s 
                        offensive is the offensive part. 
           They do lines, both old pros. They bond over their 
           similarities. Mara is slowly winning Zara over. 

           MEANWHILE --

           Show the other girls, high, drunk, spacey, jumping on an 
           indoor trampoline that has opened up beneath the carpet. 

           They’re on some version of ecstasy so clothes are coming off. 

           Music blasts while a slasher film is projected on the wall - 
           occasionally catching the girls bodies as well, as they jump.

           BACK IN THE BEDROOM --

           Mara has Zara exactly where she wants her, and now the games 
           begin. She puts her cigarette out on her own tongue, and Zara 
           draws back, like, wtf? 

           Then Mara pulls out a GUN. Toys with it, rubs it over her 
           cheek, her neck. Cold metal, painted pastel pink. 

           She puts it to Zara’s face. 

                                 ZARA
                        That’s not real, is it?

           Mara makes a face, drops the gun, giggles. She pushes Zara 
           back on the bed, going into seductive mode. 

                                 ZARA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, but this doesn’t mean I’m 
                        going down on you-- ooo!

           She moans as Mara teases her. 

                                 MARA
                        I’ve been wanting to do this for a 
                        long time. 

           She plays with Zara, then starts fucking her with the gun - 
           jams it up, making Zara gasp in pain. 

                                 ZARA
                        That’s too hard!

           Mara holds Zara's hair, pulling it tight at the base of her 
           neck. Firm, gentle; trust me. Like an idiot, Zara does. 

           Mara kisses down her body… and joins the gun down below.

           Zara enjoys herself - eyes closed - until she hears a CLICK. 
           Her eyes fly open with pure TERROR mere SECONDS before Mara 
           pulls the trigger.

           Mara keeps eating Zara out as she’s dying, drinking the 
           gushes of deep BLUE BLOOD pouring from between the girl’s 
           perfect legs.

                                 MARA
                        ‘Privilege.’ I knew it would be 
                        good, but WOW. 

           BACK IN THE MAIN ROOM - 

           Mara re-enters the party with extra glow.  

                                 VXYN
                        What happened to Zara?

                                 MARA
                        I banged her. She dead. 

           Reese hears this, laughs. Vxyn is distracted by the unwieldy 
           object in Mara’s hand. 

                                 VXYN
                        What’s that?

                                 MARA
                        Oh this? It’s a Coco Chanel 
                        chainsaw. They’re all the rage. 

           It is, indeed (somehow) a designer chainsaw. 

                                 REESE
                        So is that, like, a display piece? 

                                 MARA
                        Nope.

           She starts it up. The door is locked, they can't get out.

           Nightshade runs for the bedroom, where she finds Zara, dead, 
           in the same sitting position but with a plastic bag over her 
           head with a smiley face on it that says “have a NICE DAY!”

           Music blasts, and while the black and white slasher film is 
           projected, Mara terrorizes and massacres everyone. 

           Girls bleed in lingerie, beg her to stop, plead. 

                                 REESE
                        Why?
                                 MARA
                        It’s my party and you’ll die if I 
                        want you to. 

           Feathers and varying shades of blue blood everywhere. (Except 
           Nightshade’s, whose is more purple - “Royalty.”)

           Pearls clutched in a hand. Trace up the arm to find: it’s 
           SEVERED. And not the only detached limb. 

           Random body parts around, like pieces of life-size Barbie 
           dolls destroyed by someone’s little brother. 

           Mara lies back, naked, covered in the blue-purple blood, 
           absorbing it, in some other enviable dimension. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        I never thought I could be this 
                        happy. 

           The genuine smile on her face is - despite everything - hard 
           not to find sweet. It’s so... peaceful. 

           On the wall, written in blood: “VENI VIDI VICI, BETCHES”

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - EVENING

           Winnie stares at the mirror, where the same thing is written. 
           She scrubs at it.

           Jax knocks, enters, just in time to see Winnie grasp onto the 
           wall for support. She can barely stand. Jax catches her. 

                                 JAX
                        Have you been eating?

           Silence. He looks around for a scale, pulls it out. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Get on. 
                             (she doesn’t)
                        GET ON.

           She does. Weighs 86lbs. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Why do you do this to yourself?

           She shrugs. He kneels at her feet, holds her thin legs, his 
           head in her thigh gap. 
                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Baby, I’m losing it a little here, 
                        please, just tell me what’s going 
                        on, tell me what I can do. 

           Her hand goes to his hair, fingers running through brown 
           strands. A far-off look in her eye. Cheekbones too 
           pronounced. Skin stretched across bone. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I just need to sleep a little. I’m 
                        okay. I’m... 

           He helps her to bed. She drifts off. 

           INT. MIRROR MAZE

           This time, she dreams she is trapped inside a bottle, inside 
           of the maze. The bottle begins to fill with water that rises 
           from some unknown source. 

           The shadows crawl off the walls, reach across the floor for 
           her - and manifest into the Shadow Creature, who circles the 
           bottle in a fog of black mist.

           It should become clear that the creature is a MONSTER VERSION 
           OF MARA, and it is taking more and more of Mara’s features. 

                                 MARA MONSTER
                        Are you ready to give in yet? 

                                 WINNIE
                        What more can you take? 

                                 MARA MONSTER
                        Faulkner told you. Knew him well. 
                        You want to be immortal like that? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Yes, but I want to be a good 
                        person. I’m trying to be a good 
                        person. 

                                 MARA MONSTER
                        Obscurity it is, then.

           The water rises up to Winnie’s neck now. 

                                 WINNIE
                        What do you want?
                                 MARA MONSTER
                        Bleeder, wake up! Everything goes 
                        by the wayside. I want your honor, 
                        your pride, your decency, your 
                        happiness. I want your heart, your 
                        hair, your brains, your guts. I 
                        want to scoop out your soul with a 
                        silver spoon and suck at the hole 
                        inside you until there is nothing 
                        left but the dust of your bones, 
                        which I will cut into lines and 
                        serve at parties. I want all of 
                        you. 

           Winnie tries to keep her head above the water, struggles.

           The monster’s fingers slither into Winnie’s bottle like so 
           many snakes. Winnie doesn’t know if she should drown or let 
           the shadows get her. 

                                 MARA MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why you’re scared?

           Winnie is fully submerged in the water now, unable to 
           breathe. The terrifying monster is right up to the glass, a 
           mere INCH AWAY.  

                                 MARA MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        Because you want to give it to me. 

           The monster’s fingers/vine/snake things finally GRAB Winnie 
           and SQUEEZE, wrapping around her until she dissolves in the 
           same black mist and--

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY

           Winnie wakes up, gasping for air. She coughs up some water. 
           Almost shouts for Jax, but then... her eyes catch on 
           something and she cannot look away.

           A BUTTERFLY. Hovering in the light. As she goes to get a 
           closer look, it flies away. She follows it. 

           EXT. PATIO - CONTINUOUS

           Winnie follows the butterfly outside. We begin to hear VOICES 
           muttering, over each other, calling her. 

           The butterfly lands in the pool. 

           In a daze, she leans over the edge.
           The Mara-Monster in the reflection of the water. Fiction 
           drips into dreams drips into reality. 

           Winnie reaches to touch the water. 

                                 MARA MONSTER
                        Let go, Winnie. It’s so easy. Just 
                        let go. 

           Winnie FAINTS out cold, and falls into the pool. Blood 
           spreads throughout the water, surrounding her like a cloud.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Winnie squints her eyes. Blurrily makes out Jax and a DOCTOR. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        ....It’s very common in the first 
                        trimester. I don’t usually have any 
                        advice besides, try again, but in 
                        her case, you need to make sure 
                        she’s healthy first, and looking at 
                        these numbers, she’s got a ways to 
                        go. Even if she carried to term, in 
                        her malnourished state...

                                 JAX
                        I understand.

           Winnie shows that she is awake, moving, opening her eyes 
           fully. Jax looks at her - doesn’t say a single word, just 
           KILLS her with this heartwrenching look, and EXITS.

           INT. BATHROOM, HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Jax swigs from a flask, bottling a panic attack. Furious, he 
           kicks the bathroom door. A mangled sob escapes him. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Winnie finds out the hospital bill. It’s a lot. She discusses 
           it with a NURSE - we don’t need to hear the details. Just 
           close on the document as she checks that they’ll pay “CASH.” 

           EXT. POOL, PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY

           Pool cleaners drag the pool. It looks odd, empty. 
           INT. MUSTANG - MOVING

           Jax drives Winnie home. Tense between them. 

                                 JAX
                        How could you not tell me that you 
                        accepted that kind of cash? 

                                 WINNIE
                        That’s what you’re upset about? I 
                        just miscarried.

                                 JAX
                        You don’t get to tell me what to be 
                        upset about. 

           She sits in silence, sulking. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        You do this thing where you get all 
                        quiet so you can’t be caught saying 
                        the wrong thing. It’s bullshit. 
                             (beat)
                        You have to start fucking eating. 

           Winnie is shaken by this, tries to speak, can’t. Then:

                                 WINNIE
                             (softly)
                        Okay.

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Inside, Jax stands over her and a plate of food, makes sure 
           she eats every last bite. She cries, shaking. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I’m sorry, I love you, I’m sorry, I 
                        love you, I’m sorry...

           She repeats it over and over, like a mantra. He holds her. 
           They mourn the loss together. 

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM

           Big beautiful tub. Winnie scared a little. What it means. 

           But this bath is not red. It is full of lavender bubbles. 
           There are candles. Lighting is soft, delicate, flickering. 
           Jax gently helps Winnie out of her clothes and into the bath. 
           He takes each limb and cleans it carefully and tenderly. A 
           beautiful, intimate moment between them. 

           INT. BEDROOM, PALM SPRINGS - NIGHT

           Late at night, Jax opens his eyes to find: 

           WINNIE is wandering around, naked, with a knife. 

                                 JAX
                        Winnie? 

           Winnie slowly shakes her head. A creepy grin spreads across 
           her face. It’s not Winnie. WTF?! 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - MORNING

           Jax removes all the knives in the house. He steps it up a 
           notch on everything. He even UNPLUGS the landline. 

           He makes a call, whispers, makes sure he can’t be heard.

                                 JAX
                        RJ, hey, it’s Jaxon Heller. Listen, 
                        I know you’re a busy guy, but 
                        something’s happening with Winnie, 
                        and I’m afraid it might be as bad 
                        as last time. You were there, I 
                        wasn’t, I didn’t know who else to 
                        call... 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS - EVENING

           Winnie falls asleep. Jax makes sure of it before he leaves. 

           But as soon as he leaves, Winnie goes to the office. 

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           Jax goes to meet RJ at a hotel bar. 

                                 JAX
                        Thanks for coming all the way out 
                        here. 

                                 RJ
                        ‘Course. You drinking? My treat.
                                 JAX
                        I’m okay.

                                 RJ
                             (to waiter)
                        Two scotches.
                             (to Jax)
                        You’ll thank me when you try it.

           This is the first time they have extended one-on-one time, 
           and there’s tension as they size each other up. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - EVENING

           Winnie is sitting down to look at her writing, when the 
           LANDLINE rings. It’s Sloan.

                                 SLOAN
                        Jax doesn't trust you, he's keeping 
                        secrets from you...

           Follow the phone line down to see: it’s still unplugged. 

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           They sip their drinks. RJ makes a show of paying.

                                 JAX
                        We appreciate your help. I want to 
                        assure you, we’ll pay you back

                                 RJ
                        Don’t worry about it. Anything for 
                        Freddie. 

           Jax’s ear catches on this. Things start to click for Jax, you 
           can see the math happening behind his eyes. 

                                 JAX
                        Freddie. Her ex called her that. 

                                 RJ
                        Really? He probably got it from me. 
                             (sips his drink)
                        Does she talk about him often?

                                 JAX
                        Almost never. You knew him? 

                                 RJ
                        Quite well, actually. 
           Jax squares his jaw. Sips his drink. He knows. 

                                 JAX
                        Don’t tell me his name, I’m afraid 
                        I’ll murder the bastard. 

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           Big magazine cover photoshoot.  

           Graffiti on the fake wall behind her reads:

           CHAPTER 10. “Love is what grown folk do to each other because 
           the law frowns on killing.” - mary oliver

           Opie brings Mara a cherry cola with a straw. She sips, hands 
           it back. A bunch of FLASHES and miscellaneous praise. 

           The photoshoot ends. Opie helps her change. He’s like half 
           her assistant, half her bestie. 

                                 MARA
                        Can I borrow some cash?

           Opie rifles through his wallet, pulls out a 20. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        More.

           He finds a hundred. She grins, then lights it on fire and 
           uses it to light her cigarette.

                                 OPIE
                        You’re demented. And you’re paying 
                        me back. 
                             (seeing that she’s frozen)
                        What?

           He looks to see what she’s looking at: Henry. He’s waiting 
           for her. 

                                 OPIE (CONT’D)
                        I hate that guy.

                                 MARA
                        Someone’s jelly.   

                                 OPIE
                        I really think you can do better. 

                                 MARA
                        I didn’t ask you. 
           Mara hates that she cares, and struts off to Henry.

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mara and Henry smoke post-coital cigarettes. 

                                 HENRY
                        Knock knock.

                                 MARA
                        Who’s there.

                                 HENRY
                        A bad joke. 

                                 MARA
                             (right at him)
                        Pretty bad. 

           She’s not happy, something listless about her. He can tell.  

                                 HENRY
                        That boy you hang around with.

                                 MARA
                        Opie. 

                                 HENRY
                        Opie. He’s making you unhappy. 

                                 MARA
                        He loves me. And he’s loyal. 

                                 HENRY
                        What am I?

                                 MARA
                        Married. 

                                 HENRY
                        He thinks you can do better than 
                        me, right?

                                 MARA
                        Course not.

                                 HENRY
                        You want him to accept you as you 
                        are, to show him. But he will never 
                        understand the sideways ways your 
                        twisted mind works. 
                                 MARA
                        And you do?

                                 HENRY
                        Was that a legitimate question? I’m 
                        offended. You’ll never find anyone 
                        that’ll take better care of you 
                        than me. But hey--

           He starts to go. 

                                 MARA
                        Stop. 

                                 HENRY
                        There she is.

           She traces her finger down his chest, sticks out her pouty 
           bottom lip. 

                                 MARA
                        What’s wrong with me? 

                                 HENRY
                        Wherever we owe people bits of who 
                        we are, they control us. Wherever 
                        we give trust and love, we are 
                        controlled. You’ve experienced the 
                        release that comes with destroying 
                        the ones that have built you, you 
                        are freed - not just of them - but 
                        of your past. Every king to claim a 
                        throne in the history of our shitty 
                        little planet, has known this 
                        feeling. In my own way, so too have 
                        I, though I prefer a box seat to 
                        the trigger. 

                                 MARA
                        And me? What am I?

                                 HENRY
                        You, doll, you’re the best seat in 
                        the whole damn house. 

           She grins, feeling herself again. But there’s more. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        But. I would hate to see you go 
                        down the wrong path. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying what you should or 
                        should not do with the boy, but if 
                        I have learned anything in my life, 
                        Mara, it is this: you cannot trust 
                        anyone but yourself. And sometimes, 
                        not even that. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Winnie is interrupted from writing by the entrance of her 
           intoxicated husband. He TEARS through the office. 

                                 WINNIE
                        What are you doing? Jax?

                                 JAX
                        The book he gave you. I know I 
                        packed it--

           He finds what he is looking for, pulls it out triumphantly - 
           a copy of “Letters to a young poet” and opens it. 

           Reads the inscription. “Freddie.” “I love you in all the 
           ways.” Signed, “R.”  

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        This whole time. It was RJ this 
                        whole time. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Jax, calm down, I can explain.

                                 JAX
                        You made me look like an idiot. For 
                        FIVE YEARS. Does that mean nothing 
                        to you? 

           He exits to the kitchen and pours himself a drink. She 
           follows. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I’m not the only one keeping 
                        secrets, you’ve been sneaking 
                        around--

                                 JAX
                        I was trying to HELP you. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Please. You just like playing 
                        savior so you feel like less of a 
                        fuckup. 
                                 JAX
                        Are you fucking him? 

                                 WINNIE
                        Will you let me explain? 

                                 JAX
                        Why would I do that, Freddie? 

                                 WINNIE
                        You're drunk. 

                                 JAX
                        Well, you kept telling me I was, so 
                        I figured, if I’m doing the time, 
                        might as well...

           He raises his glass to her, takes a nice, long sip. Stumbles, 
           can’t keep his balance as he speaks. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        I saw the best in you, but you 
                        could only see the worst in me, and 
                        now here we are, and I still love 
                        you more than anything in the world 
                        and I wish to God I didn’t. All I 
                        need from you, is to look me in the 
                        eye, and for once, tell me the 
                        truth. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I’ll talk when you’re sober.

                                 JAX
                        You’ll talk NOW!

           He slams his hand on the wall next to her head, scares her. 
           He breaks a bunch of shit, violently trashes the place. He 
           takes the guitar, smashes it to PIECES. 

           Winnie collapses into herself, the madness coming back again. 
           There are voices, whispers, everywhere.

                                 WINNIE
                        No, no, no.

           THE SHADOWS CREEP towards her, extending tentacles. She 
           starts running. Somewhere in the far distance, someone calls 
           her name. Maybe Jax, maybe someone else. 

           She keeps running, shadows at her heels...
           INT. RJ’S HOTEL - EVENING

           She is scared, goes to RJ for comfort. She is so unstable 
           that she needs something stable, and like a fool, she feels 
           RJ is the closest thing she has to that right now. 

                                 RJ
                        I’m glad you came. 

           When he moves, Winnie sees he already has a guest: Sloan.

                                 WINNIE
                        What are you doing here? 

           RJ thinks she’s talking to him. 

                                 RJ
                        Sorry?

                                 WINNIE
                        Not you. 

           Winnie makes eye contact with Sloan, who hugs her, whispers 
           sweet nothings in her ear. 

                                 SLOAN
                        Relax, gorgeous. This is what you 
                        need right now. 

           Sloan sets her martini glass down on the marble with a clink.

           Next things we know, she’s kissing Winnie, and it’s hot, and 
           Winnie’s into it.

           Then Sloan pulls away, puts a finger to Winnie’s lips.

           Sloan then approaches RJ, so beautiful, so confident. She 
           kisses him, all the while, making eyes at Winnie.

           Winnie can either leave now or become a part of this.

           She walks over, suddenly not shy at all, almost as if she 
           wants to prove something to Sloan. 

           They both start touching RJ. 

                                 RJ
                        Who are you?

                                 WINNIE
                        Which one of us?

           He laughs. Then it gets intense.
           Sloan kisses RJ again, then Winnie, then slowly brings RJ and 
           Winnie together. 

                                 SLOAN
                             (whispers in W’s ear)
                        This is as far as I go.

           RJ and Winnie are making out, and it’s hot and heavy.

                                 RJ
                        You're sure this is what you want?

                                 WINNIE
                        This isn't about what I want. This 
                        is about what she wants. 

           RJ stops for a moment, admiring Winnie.

                                 RJ
                        You are a true artist.

           He lowers her onto the bed and...

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT

           Mara is the one we see being lowered. By OPIE. They are being 
           romantic for the first time. 

                                 MARA
                        You love me, you honestly love 
                        every part of who I am. You see me 
                        in a way no one else does. 

                                 OPIE
                        Yes.

                                 MARA
                        I want to feel it. 

                                 OPIE
                        Don't you?

                                 MARA
                        I want to feel it… inside me. 

           She fucks him tenderly. 

           As he cums, she whispers into his ear:

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.
           Then she slices his neck open and drinks the geysers of 
           blood. She holds his body closely.  

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        I will treasure your blood forever.

           Close on: her adding a new bottle of blood to her now very 
           large collection. This one is labeled “TRUE LOVE.”

           Opie bleeds out on the ground. Mara revels in the high his 
           love-filled blood gives her. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           RJ finishes inside Winnie, just as she feels something 
           happening with Mara -- it has a physical effect on her. 

           Winnie quickly gets off of RJ and just starts running. 

           INT. HALL, HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Clutching her stomach, half-dressed, looking out of her damn 
           mind, she wobbles. Grasps the wall.

                                 RJ
                        Freddie! 

           RJ exits the hotel room in a bathrobe, concerned. 

           Winnie’s EYES ROLL BACK and she brandishes a knife (the same 
           one from home, taken from her purse). 

                                 WINNIE
                        Stay away from me!

           He backs off, and she shoves her way down the hall, vision 
           blurring, seeing double. 

           EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           She tries to call a car, but she can’t see straight. 

           Her stomach is PULSATING worse than ever. Whatever this thing 
           is, it’s coming. It wants to get OUT OF WINNIE. 

           She THROWS up, the same dark mist, but more of it. Wipes her 
           mouth, and desperate, she goes back inside the hotel.
           INT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           And BANGS on the first door she can find. A pale pretty boy 
           opens it, an older man on the bed behind. 

           Winnie holds out the knife.

                                 WINNIE
                        Get out. Both of you. Get out. 

           They are scared, and they do.

           She locks the door and closes the curtains and finds the most 
           comforting corner she can. 

           Winnie looks on with horror as the thing CARVES its way from 
           the inside, out of her, the muse/demon C-section complete.

           Winnie lies on the ground, bleeding, sobbing from the pain. 
           Sweating, exhausted, dehydrated. 

           MARA has been born into the world. She wipes her face with a 
           towel. Adjusts to her surroundings. Fangs shrink into regular 
           teeth. Pops in a few dislocated bones. 

           Turns to looks at Winnie, shivering, hurt, freaked. 

                                 MARA
                        Don't worry, I'll take care of 
                        everything now. 

           Mara goes past her to the bathroom to wash up, her perfect 
           curves illuminated as she walks through the door frame. 

           Winnie wipes her eyes, tries to rise, but is too weak. 

           But she doesn’t have time to rest. The shower is going. It’s 
           now or never. 

           She pushes through the pain, grabs the drink on the bedside 
           table - a screwdriver - and uses the strength from it to take 
           her knife and start running. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

           Jax wakes up in the house he’s trashed. Looks around. The 
           night hits him like a ton of bricks.

                                 JAX
                        Fuck. Winnie? Win? 

           He realizes she isn’t in the house.
           FLASH OF: Winnie running out the door, last night.

           EXT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Jax tries to start the car, it won’t start. He can’t find the 
           starter fluid. He panics. 

           EXT. PALM SPRINGS - DAYBREAK

           Winnie is running. The sun is rising. She keeps looking 
           behind her at the long shadows. She trips every other step, 
           but keeps picking herself back up. 

           All she knows is she has to get as far from Mara as possible. 

           She sees a car coming. 

           She steps in front of it, preparing to die.

           It stops. We realize what car it is - the Mustang. 

           Winnie doesn’t move. Jax gets out of the car. 

                                 JAX
                        You can’t just run away.

           He tries to get her to get in the car, but she fights him.

                                 WINNIE
                        Leave me here.

                                 JAX
                        I’m not going to leave you out 
                        here, you’ll die.

                                 WINNIE
                        So let me die! I want to die, I 
                        can’t do this anymore. I can’t...

           Mara leans out of the back seat, comfortable AF, smoking a 
           cigarette. We know she's not real but she sure seems it.

                                 MARA
                        You’re pathetic.

           Winnie stares at the girl in the backseat. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You already won. 
                                 JAX
                        Who wins? Who are you talking to? 
                        Goddammit, Winnie, LOOK AT ME. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I fucked up, Jax. I really fucked 
                        up. 

           She sees another car coming the other way, and she runs for 
           it but Jax stops her, brings her - kicking and screaming - 
           back to the side of the road.

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Beyond gone, I’m a non-person now. 
                        Just a fiction factory closing, let 
                        it close, let me go. 

                                 JAX
                        What does that mean? What are you 
                        saying?

                                 MARA
                        Do it. Tell him. Maybe he’ll let 
                        you kill yourself. 

           She shakes her head, tears in her eyes. But:

                                 WINNIE
                        I made a mistake. 

                                 JAX
                        You did sleep with him. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Only after last night, after we 
                        fought, I went there and--

                                 JAX
                        STOP. Just stop talking. 

           He needs a moment. Rocked to the core by her admission. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You don’t understand, things were 
                        dark, it got bad and I needed you, 
                        you weren’t there--

                                 JAX
                        What about the million times I was, 
                        they count for nothing?
                                 WINNIE
                        I didn’t mean to, I didn’t do it to 
                        hurt you. She was there, and she 
                        said I needed to--

                                 JAX
                        She? The invisible friend you keep 
                        talking to, this is her fault? 

           Jax is so full of fury that he doesn’t know where to put it. 
           KICKS the car, YELLS, guttural and heartbreaking. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I’m so, so sorry, Jax. 

           Jax paces angrily, trying to bottle his intense rage. 

                                 JAX
                        You tried to warn me so many times, 
                        you told me you fuck everything up, 
                        and you’ll hurt me, and I was so 
                        sure you wouldn’t that I-- I 
                        reassured YOU. Do you realize how 
                        fucked that is? 

           He laughs, a broken, tragic laugh. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        You still can’t even look at me. 

           She meets his gaze. And it kills her, how little love is 
           there. How much fury. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        You need help. 

                                 WINNIE
                        I know. 
                             (beat; this takes a lot)
                        Help me.

                                 JAX
                        It’s too late. There’s nothing I 
                        can do for you. You knew my past, 
                        you knew exactly what it would do 
                        to me, and you did it anyway. 
                        You’re not my problem anymore. 

                                 MARA
                        That’s my cue. 

           Mara leans over Winnie. 
                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Eat me. 

           Mara’s evil grin fills the screen. 

           She KISSES Winnie on the lips and it basically feels like she 
           sucking Winnie’s soul. 

           We are lost in the suction of a tornado of SAND. 

           Winnie tries to scream, but it comes out like dust. She is 
           blown away, a mirage, and slams her eyes shut like this is 
           just another nightmare.

           Wake up and it’ll all be normal.

           INT. WONDERLAND CLUB, BACK OFFICE

           But when she opens her eyes, she’s SOMEWHERE ELSE - she’s in 
           Wonderland. She looks around, recognizing it from her novel. 

           In a small mirror on the wall, something ODD. 

           Instead of her own reflection, it’s MARA - in the Palm 
           Springs bathroom somehow.

                                 MARA
                        Don’t interfere. The writer was 
                        never God.

           Winnie touches the mirror, tries to get through. Can’t.

                                 WINNIE
                        Interfere with what? What did you 
                        do?

                                 MARA
                        The ending. You want a good one, 
                        right? So just relax and enjoy. 

           Mara spots something we can’t see. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        Your hubby is actually a mad 
                        morsel. You don’t mind, do you? 
                             (shouting to Jax)
                        Baby, let’s have a drink or five 
                        and talk this out. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Don’t you fucking touch him.
                                 MARA
                        What do you think he tastes like? 
                        Say hi to me from me.

           Mara kisses the mirror, leaving a lipstick mark, then 
           disappears. Winnie screams, bangs at the mirror. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Mara!! 

           Nothing. But - wait - there is an ARROW. This is her world, 
           her baby, and it is loyal to her. It points to the door. 

           The door opens. Henry enters with a business associate, 
           speaking in hushed tones. 

                                 HENRY
                        You’re sure there’s no other way?

           Winnie freezes, but soon realizes they cannot see her. She 
           slips past them.

           INT. WONDERLAND CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Winnie can’t help but stop for a brief moment and enjoy the 
           fever dream she’s built. 

           A PARTIER bumps into her, freaks out about it to his friend. 

                                 PARTIER
                        Mad cool energy right here, bro, 
                        you feel that? 

           He is wearing a shirt that says “This is not real.” And an 
           arrow tattoo on his arm points her...

           To another neon sign arrow, then one on the ground, etc. The 
           arrows point her urgently toward the VIP room. 

           INT. VIP ROOM, WONDERLAND

           Mara drinks, smokes, leans back in the empty room. Enjoys the 
           silence. But, when she gets to the bottom of the glass, she 
           nearly chokes. After the final sip, a message has appeared: 

           “You have just been poisoned.”

           Winnie enters the room.

                                 WINNIE
                        I didn’t think that would work. 
                                 MARA
                        Congratulations, you’ve fucked your 
                        own ending.

           Mara FLICKERS like a bad TV.

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re dying. 

                                 MARA
                        You really think it matters if I 
                        die in your story? I have your 
                        REALITY. The one you were so 
                        ungrateful for. You had everything.

                                 WINNIE
                        And you destroyed all of it.

                                 MARA
                             (like, obvi)
                        You let me in.  

                                 WINNIE
                        Like I had a choice.

           Mara gets worse, voice breaking and slurring as the poison 
           hits her.

                                 MARA
                        There’s always a choice. You wanted 
                        me, this, Sloan. You wanted RJ. You 
                        wanted to make great art and fuck 
                        the world, and you knew the 
                        consequences. You chose this. And 
                        you chose well. 

           The word “well” plays over and over, like a skipped record. 
           Then stops. Mara takes Winnie's hand, aims it into a gun. 
           Puts it to her chin. 

                                 MARA (CONT’D)
                        You'll have to be Mara now. Good 
                        thing we died your hair, huh. You 
                        make a killer suicide blonde. 

           Winnie “pulls the trigger” and to her surprise, BRIGHT GOLD 
           SPARKLES fly out of the back of Mara's head and she keels 
           over, dead. 

           The sparkles turn to a thick liquid, spreading over the VIP 
           room’s leather seats and onto the floor. Winnie licks her 
           lips, suddenly so, so thirsty. 
           She hesitates, holds her fingers dripping gold up, slowly 
           brings then to her tongue. And swallows. 

           A RUSH of EUPHORIA and CLARITY. Strength she’s long needed. 

                                 HENRY
                        Mara! There you are!  

           Winnie turns. Henry is coming towards her. He SEES her now. 
           Fuck, she is Mara. (At least, that’s what people see.)

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You need to get out of here, the 
                        cops found some of the bodies, 
                        they’ve been onto us. You gotta get 
                        back to the apartment, get rid of 
                        evidence. I’ll cover for you as 
                        long as I can. Hurry, go!

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Winnie finds herself in Mara’s apartment. 

           The elaborate mirrors in there allow her FULL ACCESS to 
           various rooms in Palm Springs. 

           She runs to the large panel where Mara is drinking with Jax, 
           and Winnie sees up close that Mara is playing with a KNIFE in 
           her hand. Winnie’s knife. 

           Jax won’t see it coming. 

                                 WINNIE
                        Mara!  

           Winnie bangs on the mirror. Stops. Thinks, then goes to the 
           COMPARTMENT with the bottles of blood. She drinks the bottle 
           labeled “True Love.” Opie’s. Tries the mirror again. 

                                 WINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Let me back in, I have to get back!

           It doesn’t work. She starts drinking all the blood flavors, 
           trying over and over, still nothing. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           A very hammered Jax looks up at “Winnie.” It’s the same blank 
           look he saw when she was holding the knife. Drunk as he is, 
           he nevertheless recognizes that it isn’t her. 
                                 JAX
                        Win?

           Reaches out to touch her face. We close in on her EYES, where 
           we can see tiny pale hands banging, trying to get out. 

           Closer and closer and we’re back --

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT

           And Winnie’s fists fall down the mirror as she gives up.

           In a final rush of FRUSTRATION and ANGER, she screams and 
           starts smashing everything. She shatters the remaining 
           bottles of blood, and they color the floor like a Pollock. 

           Winnie looks to see she’s cut herself on the broken bottles. 
           And she hears MARA react - in the real world, Winnie’s own 
           pain can still hurt Mara.

           Just as she realizes this--

           COPS BANG ON THE DOOR.

                                 COPS (O.S.)
                        Open up, Mara Calloway, you are 
                        under arrest!

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE

           Mara examines the cut Winnie accidentally made from the 
           bottle. Jax suspicion increases - something isn’t right. 

                                 JAX
                        You’re not... I mean, what are--

                                 MARA
                        Less thinking, more drinking. 

                                 JAX
                        I can’t, this isn’t-- I’ve got to 
                        make a call, I--

           He tries to get up, stumbling. Mara sighs heavily. Looks in 
           the KNIFE, reflecting Winnie. 

                                 MARA
                        You might want to look away for 
                        this. 

           Jax is drunk, so is slow, but not so much that we don’t catch 
           the FEAR in his eyes. 
           As Mara RAISES the knife, TIME SLOWS. Close in on the knife, 
           travel through to:

           INT. MARA’S APARTMENT

           Winnie watches the molasses reality -- as adrenaline rushes 
           through her, everything happens at a fraction the speed. 

           The cops banging on the door comes slow and thundering like 
           the heartbeat of a dying man.

           It all slows to a near-stop as the knife reaches it’s peak... 

           Then, as the blade comes down, we SMASH INTO ACTION:

           Winnie makes a decision, reaches for a broken shard of 
           mirror, and she STABS herself through the stomach. 

           The cops break the door down to find her keeled over, her own 
           RED BLOOD mixing with the Pollock painting on the floor. 

           They turn her over, take her pulse. She’s still alive, but 
           barely. Eyelids flutter. 

           BLACK.

           Then flickers of RED AND BLUE LIGHTS. Cop car? No... 

           INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING

           Jax is above her in the back of an ambulance. She’s barely 
           holding on, bleeding out. Everything is muted, pale, dull.

           No words. Just blood and a SMILE on her lips. 

           INT. JAX’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jax slams shut the copy of INNOCENT MONSTERS. 

                                 BLONDE
                        Babe?

           We’re back to the scene in the beginning. The sleeping blonde 
           is waking up, turning -- maybe Winnie SURVIVED...? 

           But her face reveals: it’s another Blonde, a vague lookalike. 

           She tries to come over and be affectionate, but Jax shrugs 
           her off. This is a different man than the one we knew. A 
           ghost of himself. 
                                 JAX
                        Get out. 

                                 BLONDE
                        What?

                                 JAX
                        Get. Out. Now. 

                                 BLONDE
                        Fucking fuckboys. 

           She leaves furiously, and as the door closes, Jax exhales. 
           This stuff is too personal for some stranger to see. 

           INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING (FLASHBACK)

           Back in the ambulance, Jax holds Winnie’s hand and WATCHES 
           HER DIE. Her death haunts him. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           As Jax packs Winnie’s things in a daze of depression, he 
           stops at her NOTEBOOK. The one he’d peeked at. Her most 
           private thoughts. 

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        Reading her notebook was like 
                        finding all the pieces of Winnie 
                        she’d been keeping hidden away. 

           He reads through them. His fingers over the words, feeling 
           them like Winnie is inside them.

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        The voices she heard. The monsters 
                        that haunted her. The darkness she 
                        could not escape. 

           INT. JAX’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Present day. Jax drinks, does drugs. 

           He checks on the same SHOEBOX from the beginning. Whatever is 
           inside keeps drawing him back. Again, puts it back. 

           Plays around with one of his MANY expensive guitars. None of 
           them bring him any joy. Nothing does. 
           INT. VENUE, TRIBECA - EVENING

           Dimly lit, wide space, dark hardwood, elaborate open bar. 
           It’s a classy (if slightly snooty) party for “Innocent 
           Monsters” - now a BEST-SELLER. 

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        I don't believe they excuse what 
                        she did, but it gave me something 
                        that I needed, for myself. I 
                        understood her in a way I never did 
                        when she was alive.

           Jax floats through the crowd, vacant. He takes two drinks off 
           a passing tray, drinks one, and then sips the other. 

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        If someone can find beauty in that, 
                        good for you, and with all due 
                        respect, go fuck yourself. 

           Tracey, Winnie’s agent, spots him. They chat absently. We 
           don’t hear it because it doesn’t matter. 

           This is his story now but he doesn’t know how to live it 
           without Winnie. 

           ON STAGE -

           Jax reads the INTRODUCTION for the gathered crowd (where the 
           V.O came from), and is just at the end.

                                 JAX
                        My wife is the writer. Not was, is. 
                             (beat)
                        She got what she always wanted. 
                        You’re all talking about her now. 
                        And so she lives.

           He takes a breath, pained. People feel for him. 

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        “She lives.” Right, well, you all 
                        know that’s not true, but it’s 
                        written here, and we’re all here, 
                        so let’s pretend. That’s what being 
                        a human is, isn’t it, pretending? 

           Tracey gives him a look.

                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. Okay. Last bit here is a 
                        quote - Winnie always loved quotes. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAX (CONT’D)
                        As she had not yet chosen a title, 
                        it fell to me, and so I turned to 
                        her notes, and in there, I found 
                        one she had a particular fondness 
                        for, by Charles Baudelaire. I hope 
                        you will find it as apt as I do. 

           EXT. NEW YORK - LATER THAT EVENING

           Jax walks down the streets, looking at peoples’ faces, not 
           angry nor pleasant, but with an unmistakable intensity.

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        “What strange phenomena we find in 
                        a great city, all we need do is 
                        stroll about with our eyes open... 

           INT. JAX’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Jax enters. Pulls out that SHOEBOX he keeps checking on. This 
           time, he pulls out what is inside: 

           A GUN.

                                 JAX (V.O.)
                        Life swarms with innocent 
                        monsters.”

           Jax sits in his expensive chair with his expensive view, and, 
           with “Innocent Monsters” on his lap, he blows his brains out. 

           All over the lovely Manhattan skyline. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
