           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAWN

           A large aluminum building with the words "U-STORE-IT"
           painted on the front sits on a desolate city street.

           The adjoining lot is empty save a single BLUE DATSUN F-10,
           parked with the trunk open.

                                    July 1978

                                                                    CUT TO:

           CLOSER on the storage facility. Rows of aluminum doors are
           closed and padlocked... except for one, which is propped
           open with a brick.

           CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE PROPPED OPEN DOOR.

           INT. STORAGE LOCKER

           A man in his mid-30s sits cross-legged in the 6’ X 8’ locker
           surrounded by cardboard boxes and clear plastic crates. He
           is classically handsome, with a chiseled body, long brown
           hair and dark eyes. He’s dressed in a blue tank top, flared
           pants, sandals, and a beaded necklace.

           This is RODNEY ALCALA and he is-- as we will soon discover--
           a very dangerous man.

           One of the boxes lays open beside him, with it’s contents
           scattered on the floor: There are women’s earrings,
           necklaces, locks of hair, and most disturbingly, a woman’s
           nipple, which hangs shriveled on piece of twine like a
           pendant.

           And, of course, there are PHOTOGRAPHS. THOUSANDS OF THEM.

           Rodney flips through the photographs of his victims: A young
           woman... another young woman... a young GIRL... a young
           BOY... another young woman... and so on.

           Some of subjects are smiling, others are stoned and languid.
           A few are terrified.

           As he looks at the photos, Rodney unzips his fly...
           EXT. SCHULTZ HOUSE - DAWN

           A small ranch in a poor residential neighborhood. The paint
           is chipped, the lawn sun-baked, and the picket-fence
           battered and broken.

           All the other houses on the block look more-or-less the
           same.

                                      Same Day

           INT. AMY’S BEDROOM - SAME

           AMY SCHULTZ, 18, stands at her dresser stuffing clothes and
           books (an SAT STUDY GUIDE among them) into a backpack. Her
           dog, GINGER, a scraggly looking mutt, lays on the bed behind
           her.

           When the bag is full, she looks up. Sees a family photo
           hanging framed on the wall:

           It shows her, as a child, standing with her parents, MARTY
           and ELAINE. Behind them is the Santa Monica pier. Everyone
           is happy and smiling.

           She takes the picture out of the frame and RIPS IT IN HALF,
           removing her father from the picture. She packs the
           remaining half of the picture, and starts to zip the bag...
           but the ZIPPER is stuck. Broken.

           Frustrated, she safety pins it shut, then throws the
           backpack over her shoulder.

                                 AMY
                        Here Ginger.

           Ginger hops off the bed and follows Amy into the living
           room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Amy moves through the living room where her mom, ELAINE
           (40s), lays passed out on the couch. Elaine’s ring finger is
           conspicuously naked, with a little tan line signaling where
           a wedding ring used to live.

           Beer bottles litter the floor around her and the television
           plays an early morning news broadcast:

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Two young paper boys discovered
                        what appears to be the latest
                        victim of a killer who the Los
                        Angeles police are calling The
                        Hillside Strangler. The body had
                        been dumped 15 feet down an
                        embankment in a residential
                        neighborhood. The victim was a 20
                        year old woman and the body was
                        nude--

           Amy SNAPS OFF the television. Finds her mom’s purse and
           removes the cash from it. She pockets the money, then heads
           to front door...

           But stops before heading out.

           Amy looks back at her mother, floundering.

           She crosses back to the couch and covers her mother with an
           afghan. Kisses her on the head and looks at her sadly for a
           moment. Then heads back to the front door...

           EXT. SCHULTZ HOUSE

           Amy closes the door quietly behind her and crosses to the
           street with Ginger leashed and walking beside her.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD

           Amy and Ginger walk down the sidewalk as the sun rises up
           over the mountains behind her.

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NOON

           A long stretch of desert highway. Mountains in the distance.
           A road sign reads:

           Bakersfield 3
           Los Angeles 109

           Suddenly, a BIG RIG barrels into frame, thundering down the
           highway.
           EXT. REST STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           The Big Rig pulls up to a GAS STATION / DINER. The passenger
           door opens and Amy and Ginger hop out.

                                 AMY
                        Thanks!

           Amy gives the driver a wave and heads into the diner as the
           Big Rig takes off down the road.

           INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy sits at the counter, drowning a plate of pancakes in
           maple syrup. She begins scarfing them down.

                                 AMY
                              (To the waitress)
                        Could I also get a plate of corned
                        beef hash and a bowl of water?

           EXT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy sits on curb, reading her SAT Study Guide while feeding
           the corned beef hash to Ginger. The bowl of water sits on
           the ground beside them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Moments later, Amy strips off her jacket and STUFFS it in
           her backpack.

           She re-affixes the safety pin. It holds... but just barely.

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Amy continues down the highway with Ginger, thumb out, as
           cars speed past her.

           A pickup truck slows down as it passes. The DRIVER blasts
           the horn and yells out the window:

                                 DRIVER
                        Off the road, whore!

                                 AMY
                        Fuck you, asshole!

           Amy throws the driver the bird, and suddenly the safety pin
           on her backpack SNAPS and all of her belongings pop out and
           spill across the side of the road.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMY
                        God damn it!

           Amy drops to her knees and begins collecting her things,
           stuffing them back in the bag.

           As she’s doing this, the blue Datsun F-10 speeds past...
           then slows to a stop further up the road.

           INT. DATSUN

           Rodney sits in the driver’s seat. He adjusts the rear view
           mirror to get a better look at Amy. Stares at her as she
           gathers her things, considering his options.

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

           Suddenly, aware of it’s presence, Amy glances up at the car,
           suspicious.

           After a moment, the Datsun begins to BACK UP.

           Amy stands as it pulls up next to her. Rodney leans over and
           cranks down the passenger’s side window.

                                 RODNEY
                        Looks like you’re in a bit of
                        trouble.

           Amy nods.

                                 RODNEY
                        Where you heading?

                                 AMY
                        L.A..

           Rodney checks the clock on the dashboard. Pretends to
           deliberate.

                                 RODNEY
                        Sure. Why not. Hop in.

           Amy puts Ginger in the backseat, then hops in the front, and
           the car rolls on down the road.
                                                                 TO BLACK.

           INT. SHERYL’S APARTMENT - MORNING, 1978

           SHERYL LEE-ELLIS (mid-20s) stands in her living room, pacing
           anxiously, clearly upset. When she turns to the person off
           screen, she speaks with a desperation that betrays a
           lifetime of dismissal and neglect.

                                 SHERYL
                        "You wanna go? Go! Fine, get out of
                        here. I don’t give a crap. Pack
                        your bags and walk off the end of
                        the Earth for all I care. Jesus,
                        would you look at this place? It’s
                        a mess. I don’t know what it is, I
                        can never seem to keep things
                        together. You spend three hours
                        cleaning a house, then it takes ten
                        minutes to undo it all. Sometimes I
                        think "What’s the point?" Y’know? I
                        get the urge to just give up. But,
                        I couldn’t live in a sty. My mother
                        used to just throw her cigarette
                        butts out the kitchen window. You
                        believe that? Had an ashtray shaped
                        like a cat and when it got full
                        she’d toss them right out. It’s
                        amazing how many people can just
                        Live Like That! Sheets unwashed,
                        dishes a mess. And what’s even more
                        amazing is that I didn’t turn out
                        like that too. Because I think it
                        can go either way. Like, you see
                        your folks do something and even
                        though you think “That’s not right,
                        I don’t want to be like that,” you
                        do it anyway. You just do it.
                        Because you’ve lived with it for so
                        long. But not me. I did the exact
                        opposite. I fought like hell to be
                        different from them. I knew even
                        back then that I wanted to be
                        something different. I wanted to do
                        something with my life. And I’m
                        doing it! I am! I’ve got you,
                        Lenny. I’ve got a husband; a man in
                        my life who’s good to me. Because
                        if you got that, you don’t need
                        anything else.
                              (Pause)
                        You wanna go? You’re not going.
                        Because I’m gonna fight for you.
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        you’re worth it, but because I am."

           CAMERA PANS OVER to the PERSON OFF SCREEN and we see that
           Sheryl has been talking to her reflection in a mirror.

           Sheryl stops talking, instantly breaking character.
           Suddenly, she is a different person. Calm, confident,
           methodical. An actress who is serious about her craft.

           She crosses to her dresser and picks up some pages of a
           SCRIPT. Repeats her last line, changing the emphasis.

                                 SHERYL
                              (Reading quietly)
                        "Not because you’re worth it, but
                        because I am--"
                        "Because I am."
                        "Because I am."

           Sheryl looks up at the clock on the wall, checks it against
           her watch: Time to go.

           EXT. SHERYL’S APARTMENT, HOLLYWOOD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl steps out of her apartment-- a small, stucco
           building-- and crosses the street to her shitty little
           Chevrolet Chevette, red paint chipping away.

           On the curb out front is a discarded couch with a homeless
           man sleeping on it. In the distance, the HOLLYWOOD HILLS
           loom large, seeming to look down on the people below.

                                    September 1978

           She hops in, turns on the ignition, and the car sputters to
           life.

           INT. CASTING OFFICE - MORNING

           Sheryl sits in the waiting room beside several other
           ACTRESSES who all look more-or-less the same as she does.

           Posters of "recent" films hang framed on the wall. Mostly
           low-budget horror films: The Touch Of Satan, The Incredible
           Melting Man, Orca. Nothing you would want on your resume.

           A CASTING ASSOCIATE steps out:

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 CASTING ASSOCIATE
                        Amber?

           One of the other actresses stands and crosses the room.

           Sheryl watches her go, then listens as Amber performs the
           same monologue through the wall.

           INT. CASTING OFFICE - SHORT WHILE LATER

           Sheryl is now the last person in the room.

           After a moment, the door to the audition room opens and THE
           FILM DIRECTOR and another ACTRESS step out, CHATTING
           QUIETLY. The Director is clearly flirting with the Actress.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        I’m parked right around the corner.

           Without so much as peeking at Sheryl, they cross the room
           and slip out the exit.

           Sheryl watches them go, confused. Then:

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT (OS)
                        Sheryl?

           Sheryl turns, sees the Casting Assistant standing in the
           doorway to the audition room.

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        We’re ready for you.

                                 SHERYL
                        That was the director.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        Hm?

                                 SHERYL
                        I mean, he’s not staying?

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        He had an appointment to get to.
                        But we can still tape you.

           Sheryl nods, clearly disappointed. But then heads into the
           audition room anyway.
           EXT. HIGH RISE - AFTERNOON

           Sheryl pulls into a parking garage below a 20 story high
           rise in downtown L.A..

           Outside, a small group of protesters hold up signs reading
           "STOP the BRIGGS initiative!" A man with a bullhorn leads a
           chant: "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Homophobia’s got to go!" Nearby,
           some television cameras film the demonstration.

           INT. STAIR WELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl takes the stairwell up, her bag slung over her
           shoulder, and goes through a door to...

           INT. FIRST FLOOR - CON’T

           ...an entry area with an unmanned information desk and TWO
           DOORS on opposing walls. Above the info desk is a sign that
           reads AMERICAN THREADS, INC..

           Sheryl checks a hand-written note to make sure she’s in
           right place.

                                 SHERYL
                        Hello?

           No response.

           Sheryl crosses to one of the doors and peaks inside.

           Behind the door is a vast, open FACTORY FLOOR with DOZENS of
           black and brown women sitting behind tiny desks assembling
           lingerie.

                                 KOKO(OS)
                        Excuse me?

           Sheryl looks back, sees a blond 20-something standing behind
           her. Let’s call her KOKO.

                                 KOKO
                        Can I help you with something?

                                 SHERYL
                        I’m here for the audition.

                                 KOKO
                        Come with me.
           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl stands beside Koko as the elevator makes it’s way up
           through the building. After a moment, there’s a DING and the
           doors open.

           EXT. LOFT - CON’T

           Sheryl steps out of the elevator into a large futurist loft
           and waiting area. All of the furniture is made of sleek
           plastics and high-tech materials. Prints of women in
           lingerie adorn the walls.

           At the far end of the room, several other YOUNG WOMEN sit,
           waiting to be seen.

                                 KOKO
                        Can I get you a water?

                                 SHERYL
                        No, thank you.

                                 KOKO
                        Cappuccino?

                                 SHERYL
                        I’m all set.

           Sheryl takes a seat and Koko leaves.

           After a moment, Sheryl looks over and sees a YOUNG MODEL
           sitting beside her, her body trembling. All the women in the
           room look young, but she looks particularly young.

                                 SHERYL
                        Doing okay?

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Hunh?

           Sheryl gestures to her legs.

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Oh, yeah, no. I’m just...

                                 SHERYL
                        New to town?

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                              (Nods)
                        My mom and I moved here a few weeks
                        ago.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SHERYL
                        Your mom?

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Yeah. I’m sixteen... turning
                        sixteen. So, y’know. She’s waiting
                        in the car right now.

           Sheryl smiles, sadly.

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Do I actually... I mean... when I
                        get in there, do I just undress,
                        or--?

                                 SHERYL
                        I mean, it’s a lingerie add, so--

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Yeah, no. Sorry. That was a stupid
                        question.

           Little pause.

                                 SHERYL
                        You don’t have to do anything you
                        don’t want to.

           The Young Model studies Sheryl, trying to decide if she
           believes her. A look crosses her face like she thinks Sheryl
           is deliberately giving her bad advice to get the job for
           herself.

                                 YOUNG MODEL
                        Yeah.

           Suddenly, Koko reappears.

                                 KOKO
                        Tiffany?

           The Young Model looks up hopefully.

                                 KOKO
                        We’re ready for you.

           Tiffany stands and follows Koko into the other room. The
           door shuts behind her with a soft click.
           INT. THEATER STAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           In a small black box theater, Sheryl rehearses a scene from
           Jean Genet’s The Maids with another actress.

           The THEATER DIRECTOR (male, 30s; let’s call him DAVID) and
           STAGE MANAGER (female, 20s) sit, taking notes.

                                 ACTRESS
                        "Speak more softly, please, please.
                        Speak-- speak of Madame’s
                        kindness."

                                 SHERYL
                        "Her kindness, is it? It’s easy to
                        be kind and smiling and sweet-- ah!
                        That sweetness of hers-- when
                        you’re beautiful and rich. But what
                        if you’re only a maid? The best you
                        can do is give yourself airs while
                        you’re doing the cleaning or
                        washing up. You twirl a feather
                        duster like a fan. You make fancy
                        gestures with the dishcloth. Or,
                        like you, you treat yourself to
                        historical parades in Madame’s
                        apartment--!!"

           Suddenly, mid-speech, the lights in the building go out.

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck!

                                 SHERYL
                        Um, David--?

                                 DAVID
                        Hang tight everyone. Mitch check
                        the circuit breaker. Shelly could
                        you get the building manager on the
                        line?

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        On it.

                                 DAVID
                        Actors, take five.
           EXT. THEATER - SHORT WHILE LATER

           Outside, the actors stand around chatting and smoking.
           Sheryl stands a short distance away from the others,
           studying her lines.

           Suddenly, David steps out, says something to the other
           actors. They nod and take off down the street.

           David turns and approaches Sheryl.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re gonna go to the Holler for a
                        drink.

                                 SHERYL
                        So we’re done for the night?

                                 DAVID
                        Power’s still out.

                                 SHERYL
                        What happened?

                                 DAVID
                        I dunno. Some bullshit with DWP.
                        We’ll take care of it Monday.

                                 SHERYL
                              (Under her breath)
                        Unbelievable.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey. Rehearsal isn’t over. We’ve
                        just moved locations. C’mon.

           Sheryl looks like she doesn’t buy it, but either can’t think
           of an excuse to bail or doesn’t have the energy to fight
           him. She nods, acquiescing.

           EXT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A hole-in-the-wall bar in Hollywood. A group of New Age-y
           artists loiter out front, smoking and talking about
           Halloween (1978): "I heard they shot it in Pasadena for like
           $300,000." "That’s crazy."
           INT. BAR - SAME

           Inside, Sheryl sits at the counter nursing a beer and
           looking bored while David waxes poetic about the theatre.
           The other actors and crew are across the bar.

                                 DAVID
                        I wanna make art that wakes people
                        up from their dead-end lives,
                        y’know? ’Art that just grabs them
                        by the collars and shakes the shit
                        out of them and says "Live! Live!"

           Sheryl’s almost hasn’t noticed it, but David is HOLDING HER
           HAND now, his thumb drawing little circles on her skin.

                                 DAVID
                        Live theater is about connecting
                        with people. It’s about contact.
                        It’s about touch.

           Sheryl looks up at him, brow furrowed.

                                 DAVID
                              (Grinning)
                        Know what I mean?

           EXT. STRIP MALL - FOLLOWING MORNING

           Sheryl crosses the parking lot toward a MASSAGE PARLOR
           that’s wedged between a liquor store and a donut shop.

           As she approaches, she sees a WELL DRESSED MAN talking into
           a pay phone.

                                 WELL DRESSED MAN
                        Yeah, no, I think you’ve really got
                        something here. I mean, with the
                        right team supporting you-- because
                        you’re only as good as the people
                        around you, y’know what I’m saying?
                        I think--

           The Well Dressed Man looks up, sees something coming his
           way.

                                 WELL DRESSED MAN
                        Hey man, I’m getting another call.
                        I gotta take this. Talk later?
                        Ciao.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Calmly, the well-dressed man hangs up the phone and lays
           face down on the sidewalk. Suddenly, a POLICE CRUISER skids
           into the parking lot. TWO COPS jump out, cuff the man, throw
           him in the back of cruiser, and peel off.

           Sheryl looks at this like she can’t believe what she just
           saw. Goes inside the massage parlor.

           INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - SHORT WHILE LATER

           In a private room, Sheryl gives a deep tissue massage to
           a MAN (40s) laying naked, face down on the table, his ass
           covered by a thin sheet.

           The room is dark and soft music plays out of wall-mounted
           speakers.

                                 SHERYL
                        How’s that?

                                 NAKED MAN
                        Good. Could you do the tops of my
                        legs?

                                 SHERYL
                        Um. Okay.

                                 NAKED MAN
                        I have really bad shin splints.

                                 SHERYL
                        Of course.

           The Naked Man roles over. The sheet begins to slip from his
           lap.

                                 SHERYL
                        Oops. Don’t lose this.

           She corrects the sheet.

                                 NAKED MAN
                        Thanks.

           Sheryl begins rubbing the man’s lower legs. He moans.

                                 SHERYL
                        How’s that?

                                 NAKED MAN
                        Could you go a little higher?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Sheryl nods. Goes a little higher. Working the area around
           his knees. Trying to keep her eyes away from his midsection.

                                 NAKED MAN
                        A little higher.

           Sheryl slowly moves up to his thighs, her face a mask of
           professionalism, trying not to show how uncomfortable she
           is.

                                 NAKED MAN
                        Higher.

           Sheryl stops what she’s doing. She can’t go higher without
           basically giving the guy a...

           Understanding suddenly, she looks up towards the Naked Man.

                                 NAKED MAN
                        I’ll give you ten dollars to jerk
                        me off. Twenty if you put it in
                        your mouth.

           Sheryl freezes, like a deer caught in headlights. She looks
           frightened and embarrassed and totally unsure of how to
           handle this. Finally:

                                 SHERYL
                        Excuse me.

           She steps out of the room.

           INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl sits alone in the break room, still upset from her
           encounter with the naked man.

           After a moment, her BOSS (an older Vietnamese man) peaks in:

                                 BOSS
                        Sheryl, someone’s on the phone for
                        you.

           The boss slips out and Sheryl crosses to a wall-mounted
           telephone. Answers it.

                                 SHERYL
                        Hello?
           EXT. CAFE - FOLLOWING DAY

           Sheryl sits at table outside of a bohemian cafe, sipping a
           cup of coffee. The cafe is empty save one other guest-- a
           beleaguered screenwriter scribbling feverishly into a
           tattered notebook and mouthing his dialogue to himself.

           Sheryl looks across the street towards a fancy bistro,
           swarming with well dressed guests. A Porsche 911 pulls up
           out front, and a WOMAN (20s) who looks like a model or an
           actress steps out. The woman hands her keys to the valet,
           then crosses to a group of friends who greet her with hugs
           and kisses.

           Sheryl stares at the woman like she’d give just about
           anything to trade places with her.

           Suddenly, a middle-aged woman in a pantsuit approaches. This
           is HELEN (50s), her agent.

                                 HELEN
                        Hey, sorry I’m late. Got stuck on a
                        conference call with some people at
                        Fox. How you doing?

           A waitress steps up.

                                 HELEN
                        Black coffee.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you some menus?

                                 SHERYL
                        Yes, please.

                                 HELEN
                              (Deadpan)
                        And while you’re at it, we’ll take
                        a bucket of lard and straw. Thanks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Um...?

           The waitress stands there, confused.

                                 SHERYL
                        I’m fine. Thank you.

           The waitress steps away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HELEN
                        So what’s up? You look like your
                        dog died.

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s been a long week.

                                 HELEN
                        How’s that?

                                 HELEN
                        C’mon, spit it out: Guy troubles?

                                 SHERYL
                        Kinda?

                                 HELEN
                        No shit. When isn’t it? Here, let
                        me set you up on a date. I just met
                        this young actor and I swear to
                        God, he’s Adonis made flesh. Just
                        signed a three picture deal with
                        Paramount--

                                 SHERYL
                        I just want to work.

                                 HELEN
                        I said he’s handsome. I didn’t say
                        it would be fun.

                                 SHERYL
                        Helen, I--

                                 HELEN
                        Oh, how’s the play going? Let me
                        know when it opens. I have a new
                        casting director I want you to
                        meet--

                                 SHERYL
                        I need to talk to you about
                        something.

                                 HELEN
                        What?

                                 SHERYL
                        I can’t do this anymore.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 HELEN
                        Do what?

                                 SHERYL
                        Any of it. I’m working too hard to
                        be accomplishing so little, and
                        there are zero signs that things
                        will get better. I think I want to
                        move back to Pennsylv--

                                 HELEN
                        Stop. Hold that thought.

           Helen reaches down into her bag and removes a sheet of
           paper. Slides it across the table.

           Sheryl unfolds it. There’s an address written down.

                                 SHERYL
                        What’s this?

                                 HELEN
                        ABC Studios at Vine Street Theater
                        in Hollywood.

                                 SHERYL
                        Why are you giving it to me?

                                 HELEN
                        Why do you think?

                                 SHERYL
                        A television show?

                                 HELEN
                        Don’t say I never did anything for
                        you.

                                 SHERYL
                        But I didn’t audition.

                                 HELEN
                        You don’t have to. They’ve seen
                        you. They want you.

                                 SHERYL
                        What’s the show?

                                 HELEN
                        You’re the Guest Star. It’s gonna
                        be great.

                                 SHERYL
                        Fine, but what’s the--?

                                 HELEN
                        You’re due on set next Friday at
                        8:00.

                                 SHERYL
                        Helen. What show is it?

           INT. SHERYL’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           THE DATING GAME plays on Sheryl’s tiny television set at
           home.

           Sheryl watches despondently as the BACHELORETTE asks the
           BACHELORS a series of mind-numbingly insipid, innuendo-y
           questions. It’s heart-breaking.

           After a moment, the PHONE RINGS.

           EXT. CAFE - EARLIER THAT DAY

           Back to Sheryl and Helen:

                                 SHERYL
                        Helen.

                                 HELEN
                        It happens all the time.

                                 SHERYL
                        I can’t--

                                 HELEN
                        You can.

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s not acting--

                                 HELEN
                        It’s a way to get you seen.

                        Hello?

           CONTINUED:

           The voice of an OLDER WOMAN responds on the other end of the
           line. This is Sheryl’s MOM (60s).

                                 MOM (OS)
                        You answered this time. Have the
                        stars aligned or do you need money
                        again?

                                 SHERYL

                                 HELEN
                        It’s not a sit com.

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah. Sitcoms have scripts.

                                 HELEN
                        So will this.

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s a game show. It’s
                        embarrassing.

           Helen reaches across the table and takes Sheryl’s hand.
           Squeezes it gently.

                                 HELEN
                        It’s work.

                        Your father’s birthday was this
                        week. Did you send a card?

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah, it’s in the mail.

                        What?
           INT. MOM’S HOUSE - SAME

           CAMERA PANS TO TAKE IN THE HOUSE THAT SHERYL GREW UP IN: A
           wooden farmhouse with cheap antiques and kitschy
           decorations. One look at it should make you want to run away
           to L.A..

           WE PAN THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM where Sheryl’s DAD (60s)
           sleeps in a recliner. He looks very old and very weak. The
           TV flickers in front of him.

           EVENTUALLY, WE LAND ON Sheryl’s MOM (60s), standing in the
           Kitchen.

                                 SHERYL (OS)
                        I put it in the mail on Monday. I
                        got him a card and a book on
                        Gettysburg.

                                 MOM
                        For an actress you’re a shitty
                        liar.

                                 SHERYL (OS)
                        I’m not lying--

                        Mike and Betty chipped in on a
                        riding lawnmower. Bonnie got him a
                        new tackle box. There’s nothing
                        practical about a card.

                                 SHERYL
                        I told you. I got him a book.

                                 MOM
                        It’s a gesture that the man is in
                        your thoughts. And if you can’t
                        even manage that, then what’s the
                        point?

                                 SHERYL (OS)
                        Is this really what you want to
                        talk about?

                                 MOM

                              (Disbelieving)
                        What?

                        If you don’t want to do the show,
                        don’t. I can’t force you,
                        particularly if your heart isn’t in
                        it anymore.

                                 SHERYL
                        I didn’t say that.

                        Look: Is it Shakespeare? No. But
                        it’s a way in. And that’s what you
                        need.

           Sheryl starts to say something-- Stops, looks away.
           Frustrated.

                                 HELEN
                        Who knows. You might even have fun.

                        I’ve been having pains in my chest.

           Sheryl looks like she’s heard this before; relaxes.

                                 SHERYL
                        So see a doctor.

                                 MOM (OS)
                        "A doctor." He doesn’t know what
                        he’s talking about. It’s my body. I
                        know.

           Mom waits for a response. When none comes, she softens.

                                 MOM
                        Y’know, your room’s ready. If you
                        ever wanted to come back for a
                        visit.

           INT. SHERYL’S APARTMENT

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah. Thing’s are kind of busy
                        right now.

           A pause.

                                 MOM (OS)
                        A boy?

           Sheryl looks back at the TV. Watches as the end credits roll
           on The Dating Game.

                                 SHERYL
                              (Equivocating)
                        A job.

           Sheryl reaches for the nob on the television and changes the
           channel--

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. SCHULTZ HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING, 1968

           CU: A television screen switches channels. A COMMERCIAL
           APPEARS wherein a man dressed as THE DEVILS laughs
           maniacally while holding a bag of Lays Potato Chips.

                                 THE DEVIL
                        Lays Potato Chips. Bet you can’t
                        eat just one.

           WE CUT WIDE TO REVEAL the television sitting on a kitchen
           counter, while the SCHULTZ FAMILY moves around, getting
           ready for their day. The family consists of:

           AMY, ten years younger than when we last saw her. Now a
           precocious 8 year old. She drowns her pancakes in maple
           syrup, just like she did in the scene at the diner.

           Meanwhile, Amy’s mom, Elaine, (30s now, dressed in a
           STEWARDESS’ UNIFORM) tidies the kitchen.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Amy’s dad, Marty (30s, in business attire) searches for his
           keys.

           GINGER, their yellow lab pads around the kitchen.

           Elaine snatches up the syrup.

                                 ELAINE
                        Okay, that’s enough.

                                 AMY
                        Did you fix the zipper on my
                        backpack?

                                 ELAINE
                        I didn’t.

                                 AMY
                        Maaawwwwm...

                                 ELAINE
                        I’ll fix it when I get back. Just
                        don’t load it so full.

                                 MARTY
                        Have you seen the car keys?

                                 ELAINE
                        They’re on the television.

           Marty goes into the LIVING ROOM.

           Amy feeds Ginger some of her pancake under the table.

                                 MARTY (OS)
                        They’re not here.

                                 ELAINE
                        Then I don’t know.

                                 MARTY (OS)
                        God damn it.

           Amy feeds Ginger some more pancake.

           Through the doorway, we see Marty find his keys in his coat
           pocket. Looking embarrassed, he comes back into the kitchen:

                                 ELAINE
                              (Re: Keys)
                        Where were they?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARTY
                              (Lying)
                        They fell between the couch
                        cushions.

           Elaine turns to Amy, crouching down to eye level.

                                 ELAINE
                        Where am I gonna be tonight?

                                 AMY
                        Chicago?

                                 ELAINE
                        And when am I coming home?

                                 AMY
                        Tomorrow?

                                 ELAINE
                        And who do I love the most?

                                 AMY
                        Ginger?

           Elaine smiles and pinches Amy’s nose.

                                 MARTY
                        We gotta go.

                                 ELAINE
                        See ya Spaghetti.

                                 AMY
                        Bye Meatball.

           Elaine kisses her daughter on the cheek.

                                 MARTY
                        Don’t be late for school.

           And with that, Marty and Elaine are out the door.

           Amy sits there, alone, still picking away at her pancakes.

           EXT. SCHULTZ HOUSE (OLD) - MORNING

           A simple ranch home in West Hollywood, complete with a white
           picket fence and a sprinkler watering the minuscule front
           yard.

           SUPER:

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA
                                     September 1968

           Amy steps out front-- her backpack hanging precariously
           open, books threatening to spill out-- and closes the door
           behind her.

           EXT. SCHULTZ NEIGHBORHOOD - SHORT WHILE LATER

           WE FOLLOW Amy walks down the sidewalk.

           Up close we can see that her name is embroidered on the
           backpack.

           As she walks, a SCHOOL BUS passes her by. Some kids wave out
           the window towards her and Amy waves back. The school bus
           rounds a corner and disappears down another street.

           EXT. ADJACENT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           As Amy walks TOWARDS THE CAMERA a BEIGE PLYMOUTH rolls up
           behind her, following slowly.

           Amy shifts her backpack from one shoulder to the other and
           suddenly the broken zipper SPLITS OPEN and all of her books
           TUMBLE OUT on the side walk.

           Amy groans and kneels to pick them up.

                                 RODNEY (OS)
                        Looks like you’re in a bit of
                        trouble.

           Amy looks back and sees RODNEY (in his 20s) standing on the
           sidewalk behind her, his beige Plymouth idling beside him. A
           CAMERA is slung around his neck.

           It’s clear from Amy’s expression that she doesn’t recognize
           him.

           Rodney crosses to her and squats down, examining the
           backpack.

                                 RODNEY
                        The zipper broke?

           Amy nods.

                                 RODNEY
                        You’re Amy, right?

           Amy looks surprised.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMY
                        How did you know?

                                 RODNEY
                        You don’t remember me?

           Amy shakes her head no.

                                 RODNEY
                        Really? I’m a friend of your
                        parents. We met at the Christmas
                        party.

                                 AMY
                              (Confused)
                        We’re Jewish.

                                 RODNEY
                        No, not at your house. Your dad, he
                        works at the...

           Rodney Snaps his fingers as though trying to remember the
           name of a company.

                                 RODNEY
                        ...whatsitcalled?

                                 AMY
                        Anderson Windows.

                                 RODNEY
                        Yes. That. I work with their
                        advertising department.
                        Photographing the, um, windows.
                              (Gestures to the camera)
                        See?

           Amy looks at the camera, clearly dubious.

           INT. NEIGHBORING HOUSE - SAME

           A NEIGHBOR peeks through the blinds at Rodney and Amy,
           talking out on the sidewalk.

                                 RODNEY
                        Yeah, he told me all about you.
                        Said you’re one tough cookie.

           Rodney gives Amy a playful shoulder punch.
           EXT. ADJACENT STREET - SAME

                                 RODNEY
                        In fact he called me just a little
                        bit ago and asked if I’d give you a
                        ride to school. Said you were late.
                        Are you late?

           Amy stares at Rodney, evidently not trusting him.

           Suddenly, a NEIGHBOR (female, 40s) steps out onto the
           sidewalk:

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Amy? Everything okay?

           Rodney looks up-- clearly caught.

                                 RODNEY
                        Catch ya later.

           Rodney smiles, winks at her, then strides back to his car.
           SPEEDS OFF.

           Amy watches him go.

                                                          FLASH-FORWARD TO:

           EXT. ABC STUDIOS, PARKING LOT - BACK TO PRESENT, DAY

           Sheryl hurries across the parking lot dragging a SUITCASE
           behind her. Outside the wind blows in heavy gusts.

           Sheryl enters...

           INT. ABC STUDIOS - CON’T

           ...the studio where she’s greeted by the show’s contestant

                        Yeah, hi. I’m so sorry I’m late.
                        There was an accident on the 101
                        and the traffic was just--

                        No no no, you’re fine. You’re

           Lisa helps Sheryl with her suitcase and leads her down a

                                 SHERYL
                        I was told there would be a script.

                                 LISA
                        You mean the cue cards?

                                 SHERYL
                              (Clearly lying)
                        Yeah.

                                 LISA
                        They’re in the dressing room.

           They continue walking. Sheryl looks disappointed.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl LAYS DOWN HER SUITCASE. Unzips and opens it. Removes
           several house dresses-- pretty, but nothing fancy.

           Beside her stands the head of wardrobe, BRUCE (30s), looking
           unimpressed.

                                 BRUCE
                        This is it?

                                 SHERYL
                        They said to bring three options.

                                 BRUCE
                        Come with me.

           INT. WARDROBE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bruce opens a set of double doors leading to a massive
           closet. Expensive outfits hang in long rows. Any one of
           these is worth more than Sheryl’s entire wardrobe.

           Sheryl stands there, eyes wide, stunned by the glut and
           glamor of it all.
           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lisa leads Sheryl back into the dressing room, now dressed
           in a hip cocktail dress-- leggy with a high neckline. Sexy,
           but tasteful.

           At the far end stands the hair and make-up team: MARILYN and
           GRETCHEN (40s, both).

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Sheryl sits, half-studying her CUE CARDS, while Marilyn and
           Gretchen work on her, passing a joint back and forth between
           them. Sheryl looks nervous.

           Music pours out of a radio-- something funky and low-key and
           relaxing, like "Here, My Dear" by Marvin Gaye.

                                 MARILYN
                        They’re idiots. All of them.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I don’t know where they get them
                        from.

                                 MARILYN
                        Had this one guy on the show. The
                        "filmmaker--"

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Jesus Christ--

                                 MARILYN
                        And he’s beautiful. But seriously:
                        The IQ of a lug nut.
                              (offers Sheryl the joint)
                        Want some?

                                 SHERYL
                        I’m okay.

                                 MARILYN
                              (Without skipping a beat)
                        Shows up with his brother-- his
                        identical twin brother. And he sits
                        in the chair and we’re working on
                        him, asking questions. Trying to
                        put him at ease, whatever. And he
                        says he’s making a movie.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        "An independent film," he called
                        it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARILYN
                        And he starts describing the
                        story--

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Something about time travel?

                                 MARILYN
                        I don’t remember. And he says,
                        gesturing back at his brother:
                        "Yeah, we’re both acting in it. I’m
                        the star, he’s playing my best
                        friend."
                              (Looks dumbfounded)
                        Your identical twin brother is
                        playing your best friend?
                        Brilliant. Love it. When can I see
                        it?

           Gretchen bursts out laughing. Sheryl laughs with her,
           loosening up.

                                 MARILYN
                        I mean, is it too much to ask for a
                        great looking guy who’s not a moron
                        or a serial killer? Is that too
                        much?

           Suddenly, the door at the back of room swings open and Lisa
           enters with ED BURKE (50s), the host of the show. He’s
           dressed in a hip 70s suit and rose colored glasses, both of
           which look wildly incongruous on a man that’s oh-so-clearly
           a square.

           Gretchen hides the joint behind her back.

                                 ED
                        Oh my God, look at all the
                        beautiful women. How’s everyone in
                        here doing today?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Oh, knock it off.

                                 ED
                              (Quietly, to Gretchen)
                        Put that skunk-weed away, it reeks.

           Turning to Marilyn:

                                 ED
                        My darling.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARILYN
                              (Unimpressed)
                        Hey Ed.

                                 ED
                        So this is Sheryl Lee-Ellis?

                                 SHERYL
                        This is.

                                 ED
                        They tell me you went to Julliard.

                                 SHERYL
                        Columbia, actually.

                                 ED
                              (Ignoring the clarification)
                        That’s terrific. So you must be a
                        real music freak, hunh?

                                 SHERYL
                        I--?

                                 ED
                        What do you think of this?

           Gestures to the music playing on the radio.

                                 ED
                        You like it?

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s cool.

                                 ED
                        Yeah, women love that black sound.
                        I don’t know what it is. I’m more
                        of classics-guy myself. Bing
                        Crosby, Tony Bennett, Perry Como. I
                        mean, you wanna talk "soul," listen
                        to Perry Como sing Moonglow.
                              (Puts a hand to his chest)
                        That’s soul.
                              (Little pause)
                        I want you to do me a favor
                        tonight. Would you?

                                 SHERYL
                        What is it?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ED
                        So you’re an intelligent girl,
                        anyone can see that. But when you
                        get out on the stage, don’t act too
                        smart, okay? The guys’ll feel
                        intimidated. What we need from you
                        is just to smile and laugh. Got it?

                                 SHERYL
                        Um, okay?

                                 ED
                        Is this the dress you’re wearing?

                                 SHERYL
                        I think so.

                                 ED
                        Hey Bruce, can we get her into
                        something a little skimpier? This
                        outfit you got her in, it’s no
                        good.

           Ed turns back to Sheryl, puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 ED
                        Never trust a fag to do a real
                        man’s job. You’ve got a great body,
                        don’t be afraid to show it off.

           Ed draws little circles on Sheryl’s skin with his thumb. He
           smiles creepily.

                                 SHERYL
                        I...

           Suddenly, ED’s ASSISTANT peaks into the room:

                                 ED’S ASSISTANT
                        Mr. Burke, your wife’s on the
                        phone.

           Ed nods to the assistant then turns back to Sheryl,
           unphased.

                                 ED
                              (With a wink)
                        I’ll see you on stage.

           And with that, Ed leaves. Sheryl sits, looking like maybe
           this wasn’t a good idea.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

           A station wagon pulls into the lot, parks. The doors open
           and the people inside spill out. There’s a YOUNGER COUPLE in
           the front seats, and an OLDER COUPLE in the back.

           The sky has darkened and begun to drizzle.

           The younger woman (the driver) is terse and irritated,
           clearly overwhelmed by her boyfriend’s parents. Her name is
           LAURA (25); she’s the one in this group that we’ll be
           following.

           As for the others, let’s call her boyfriend KENNY (26), and
           his parents MR. and MRS. SNOW (50s). Mr. Snow has a camera
           hanging around his neck and his wife clutches a brochure.
           Clearly tourists.

                                 R. SNOW
                        This is it?

                                 MRS. SNOW
                        It doesn’t look like a television
                        studio.

                                 KENNY
                        How would you know, Mom? You’ve
                        never been to one.

                                 MRS. SNOW
                        It just looks so drab. What you see
                        on TV, there’s always these big
                        lights and stages--

                                 KENNY
                        What are you talking about? There
                        will be lights inside.

                                 MRS. SNOW
                        Yeah, but still--

                                 KENNY
                        This is just the parking lot.

                                 MRS. SNOW
                              (To her husband)
                        Doesn’t it look drab to you?

                                 RM. SNOW
                        Do we need the umbrellas? It looks
                        overcast.

           Laura lights a cigarette.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KENNY
                        Seriously? You gotta light that
                        now?

                                 LAURA
                        What?

           Kenny takes it out of her mouth, throws it on the ground and
           stamps it out.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey!

                                 KENNY
                        C’mon, we’re gonna be late. This
                        way.

           CAMERA LEADS the group as they CROSS to the main building,
           Laura and Kenny in the front, and Mr. and Mrs. Snow behind
           them.

                                 LAURA
                        Seriously, don’t grab things out of
                        my fucking mouth.

                                 KENNY
                        My mom’s allergic.

                                 LAURA
                        Just because she disapproves of
                        something doesn’t make her allergic
                        to it--

                                 KENNY
                        Which door do we go in?

                                 MRS. SNOW
                        I can’t find my ticket.

                                 RM. SNOW
                        I have your ticket... Wait...
                        Where’d they go--?

                                 KENNY
                        Calm down. I have the tickets.
                              (To self)
                        Jesus fucking Christ.

           Suddenly, RODNEY WALKS BY IN A BROWN SPORTS JACKET. Laura
           sees him and looks immediately frightened.

           No one else notices.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Kenny.

                                 KENNY
                        Alright, fine, I’m sorry I took
                        your damn cigarette, okay? Now can
                        we just get through today? You can
                        yell at me later tonight, but for
                        right now can we just try to have a
                        good time? If not for us, then for
                        my parents? Please, can we just do
                        that?

                                 LAURA
                              (Still stunned)
                        ...okay.

                                 KENNY
                        Thank you.

           They head inside the main building.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER

           Sheryl looks at herself in the mirror.

           Her hair and make-up are done, and she’s now in yet another
           outfit: a slinky, shiny, liquid gold dress with spaghetti
           straps. Very revealing.

           Sheryl stares at herself, evidently, with mixed feelings.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        What do you think?

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s... nice.

           Suddenly, LISA pokes her head into the room.

                                 LISA
                        We’re ready for you.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lisa leads Sheryl backstage.

                                 LISA
                              (Whispering)
                        Ed’s introducing the Bachelors now.
                        When he’s done--

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SHERYL
                        Wait. He’s already started?

                                 LISA
                        Watch your step.

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh. Thank you.

                                 LISA
                        You’re in through here.

           Sheryl steps inside...

           INT. ISOLATION BOOTH - CON’T

           ...a small black room with doors on two walls and a red
           light bulb on the ceiling.

                                 LISA
                        When he’s done, the light will go
                        on and that door will open. Then
                        you just walk on and cross to Ed.

                                 SHERYL
                        The stage is through here?

                                 LISA
                        That’s right.

                                 SHERYL
                        Okay.

                                 LISA
                        You good?

           Sheryl nods, still nervous.

                                 LISA
                        Great. Have fun.

           Lisa closes the door and takes off.

           Sheryl stands there, clutching her cue cards. She closes her
           eyes and takes several deep breaths.

                                 SHERYL
                        It’s a job. It’s a job. It’s only a
                        job.

           After a moment the LIGHT BULB snaps on and the door opens.
           Sheryl steps out of the Isolation Booth...
           EXT. TELEVISION STUDIO / STAGE

           Sheryl steps out onto the stage, a Vanna White smile
           plastered across her face.

           The room fills with the sound of applause. Sheryl looks out
           towards the audience, who cheers her on from bleacher-style
           seating. In front of them are several television cameras
           manned by operators.

           A LARGE DIGITAL CLOCK hangs towards the rear of the room,
           above the audience, counting down the time on the show:
           00:12:45... 00:12:44... 00:12:43...

           Her plastered-on-smile masks a kind of dazed bewilderment--
           "Oh my God, this is really happening."

                                 ED
                        Sheryl is an aspiring actress from
                        Scranton, Pennsylvania. She used to
                        work massaging feet but quit when
                        her boss asked her to work her way
                        up.

           The audience ROARS with laughter.

           Sheryl WINCES at the sexist joke, but holds her smile.

                                 ED
                        Sheryl moved to L.A. after
                        graduating from college, and is
                        joining us tonight to find a Romeo
                        to complement her Juliet.
                              (Crosses to Sheryl)
                        Beautiful. What a knock out. How
                        you doing Sheryl?

                                 SHERYL
                        Doing well.

                                 ED
                        Good, glad to hear it. So the rules
                        of the game are simple: There are
                        three bachelors on the other side
                        of the partition. You can ask them
                        anything you want except for name,
                        age, and occupation. And when the
                        game is over, you just pick which
                        one you’d like to go out with.
                        Sound good?

           Sheryl looks over towards the partition dividing her from
           the bachelors. Something about it feels ominous. Like it’s
           hiding something dangerous.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ED
                        Alright, well enough of my gabbing,
                        let’s hear from the fellas.
                        Bachelor #1, would you please say
                        hello to Sheryl?

           BACHELOR #1 speaks from behind the partition.

                                 BACHELOR #1 (OS)
                               (Nervous; painfully polite)
                        Hi Sheryl. Pleased to make your
                        pleasure--

           The audience LAUGHS.

                                 ED
                        Whoa, slow down fella.

                                 BACHELOR #1 (OS)
                        Oh, no, I mean-- Pleasure to meet
                        your--

                                 ED
                        Save that talk for the date.

                        Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

                                 ED
                        There we go, third time’s a charm.
                        Bachelor #2?

                                 BACHELOR #2 (OS)
                              (Singing)

                        Does he always talk like that?

           The audience LAUGHS again.

                        Hey, how’s it going.

           Sheryl smiles, listens as though waiting for something else
           from him. When nothing else comes...

                                 ED
                        Alright Sheryl, so that gives you
                        an idea of what they sound like.
                              (Out)
                        We’ll be right back to play the
                        game right after this word from our
                        sponsors.

           Sheryl looks out towards the camera, forcing a smile.

           Slowly, her eyes drift past the cameras to LAURA, sitting in
           the audience amidst the happy faces, appearing terrified and
           shaking her head "no."

           Sheryl furrows her brow-- puzzled by the Laura’s expression.

           Suddenly, from off screen we hear the...

                                 FIRST AD
                        Alright, and we’re out!

           A PREACHER stands on a street corner with a microphone and

                                     June 1971

           Rodney moves down a busy city street, wearing an NYU shirt,
           his camera in hand. He passes by the preacher, ignoring him,
           and moves on.

           Rodney stops and SNAPS A PHOTO of a PRETTY GIRL crossing the
           street.

           As she approaches him:

                                 RODNEY
                        Hey, would you mind if I took your
                        picture?

           The PRETTY GIRL shakes her head and keeps walking.

                                 RODNEY
                        Please? It’ll just take a second...

           SHORT WHILE LATER: Rodney approaches TWO MORE GIRLS, both in

                        I love your outfit.

           SHORT WHILE LATER: Rodney is showing an open fashion catalog
           to a ANOTHER GIRL.

                                 RODNEY
                        See: John Burger. That’s me, right
                        there.

                                 GIRL 3
                        You took that?

                                 RODNEY
                        That’s my picture.

                                 GIRL 3
                        She’s pretty.

                                 RODNEY
                        No prettier than you.

                                 GIRL 3
                              (Chuckles, flattered)
                        Stop it.

                                 RODNEY
                        My studio’s just around the corner.
                        Come over, let me take your
                        picture.

                                 GIRL 3
                        I shouldn’t.

                                 RODNEY
                        C’mon. It’ll be fun. I promise.

                                 GIRL 3
                        My mom would kill me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        I can keep a secret if you can.

           Girl 3 looks around to see if anyone is watching, then looks
           back down at the catalog, as if trying to make a decision.

                                 GIRL 3
                        How far away is it?

           EXT. EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Rodney moves down a busy city street. Eventually, he reaches
           a NIGHT CLUB. ’Goes inside.

           INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Rodney grooves on the dance floor. He’s smooth on his feet
           and clearly charismatic, moving between a number of
           partners.

           Eventually, he finds himself dancing with a cute club girl
           we’ll come to know as CHARLIE (20s).

                                                                    CUT TO:

           CORNER BOOTH - SHORT WHILE LATER

                                 RODNEY
                        I just took a class with Roman
                        Polanski. Have you heard of him?

           Charlie shakes her head no.

                                 RODNEY
                        Made Knife In The Water, Repulsion,
                        Rosemary’s Baby.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nope.

                                 RODNEY
                        You haven’t seen Rosemary’s Baby?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t like scary movies.

                                 RODNEY
                        It’s not a scary movie. It’s a
                        documentary.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                              (Laughs)
                        No, it isn’t.

                                 RODNEY
                        He told us in class: It’s a
                        survival guide for life in the
                        city.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What can I say? I’m a wimp.

                                 RODNEY
                        But you’re a flight attendant. You
                        don’t find that scary? Spending all
                        your time 30,000 feet above the
                        earth?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think that’s a little different.

                                 RODNEY
                        How?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, for one, flying is actually
                        very safe. You’re more likely to
                        die on the freeway than in the sky.

                                 RODNEY
                        Fair enough.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Besides, I figure we’ve all gotta
                        go sometime. If we crash, we crash.
                        I just don’t want to spend my life
                        thinking about it. What’s important
                        is that I’ve lived. Y’know?

           Rodney leans back in his chair, smiles; studying Charlie.

                                 RODNEY
                        Would you let me take your picture?

           EXT. EAST VILLAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Rodney and Charlie move down a quiet city street. Rodney’s
           camera is slung around his neck.
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           Charlie leads Rodney up the steps to the brownstone where
           she lives. She digs out her keys and opens the door.

           Behind them, a POLICE CAR drives by. Rodney looks back,
           watches it disappear down the street, then turns and goes
           inside.

           INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Rodney stands shirtless over Charlie’s CORPSE, holding his
           camera in both hands.

           Charlie’s body is undressed. Her hands have been tied
           behind her back, and there’s a length of rope twisted
           tightly around her neck.

           Rodney studies the body like a painter examining a work in
           progress, moving slowly around the room and studying it from
           different angles.

           He goes to an OVERTURNED LAMP and sets it up right. Moves it
           closer to the body, adjusting the lighting. Rodney holds the
           camera up to his eyes and SNAPS A PICTURE.

           At some point, Rodney looks up from the corpse and sees his
           REFLECTION in the mirror. He studies himself coldly, as
           though, for an instant, understanding just how awful he
           really is.

                                                          FLASH-FORWARD TO:

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO / STAGE - BACK TO PRESENT

           PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF:

                                 FIRST AD (OS)
                        And we’re at commercial.

           The house lights go up, and the crew begin moving quickly
           around the stage.

           A young woman with a little make-up kit crosses to ED on the
           stage. Let’s call her PAM (20s)

                                 ED
                        Pam, I don’t know what this new
                        shit you’re putting on me is, but
                        it won’t stay on my face.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ED
                        These lights are a hundred degrees.
                        You need to find something that
                        won’t wash away when I sweat.

           THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO...

           Sheryl sitting, looking pensive. Gretchen and Marilyn run
           over and begin touching up her hair and make-up.

                                 MARILYN
                        What’d I tell you? Lug nuts.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        The last guy didn’t sound bad.

                        How am I doing?

                                 MARILYN
                        Great.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Fabulous.

                                 MARILYN
                        "Does he always talk like that?"

                                 SHERYL
                        I’m worried it was too
                        condescending.

                                 MARILYN
                        Did you hear the audience? You had
                        ’em in stitches.

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah, no, I know. I’m just trying
                        to-- You know: What Ed said about
                        not--

                                 MARILYN
                        Fuck Ed.

                                 SHERYL
                        What?

                                 MARILYN
                        I mean, no disrespect, but fuck
                        him. This isn’t a sitcom and you’re
                                 (MORE)

                        not coming back next week. What’s
                        he gonna do? Fire you? You’re
                        supposed to have fun. That’s the
                        whole point. So be yourself and say
                        whatever want.

           Sheryl nods, taking in the advice.

                                 SHERYL
                        Do either of you have a pen?

           Marilyn hands Sheryl a pen and she begins to write on her
           cue cards.

           A female PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (18) steps up with a tray of
           waters.

                                 P.A.
                        Water?

                                 SHERYL
                        No, thank you.

           WE FOLLOW THE P.A. AS SHE CROSSES THE STAGE, MOVING AROUND
           THE PARTITION TO THE THREE BACHELORS. This is the first time
           we get a good look at them.

           Bachelor’s #1 and #2 are new faces. But we’ve seen Bachelor
           #3 before: It’s RODNEY.

           Rodney sits there, quietly, looking serious and isolated,
           while Bachelor’s #1 and #2 chat affably between themselves.

                                 P.A.
                        Water?

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Yes, please, thank you.

                                 BACHELOR #2
                        Don’t mind if I do.

                                 P.A.
                        Water?

                                 RODNEY
                        No.

           He glares at her, and the P.A. hurries away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                              (Re: the P.A.)
                        Too small.

           Rodney looks over at him.

                                 BACHELOR #2
                        Seriously, nothing under a C-cup. I
                        don’t give a shit how smart she is,
                        how funny; her career, talents,
                        politics, whatever. Doesn’t matter.
                        Can’t do it.

                                 RODNEY
                        What a gentleman.

                                 BACHELOR #2
                        I’m a realist. I mean, if you know
                        it’s not gonna work, why go down
                        that road? Hunh?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Gestures across the
                              partition)
                        What about her?

                                 BACHELOR #2
                        What about her?

                                 RODNEY
                        You haven’t seen her yet.

                                 BACHELOR #2
                        No.

                                 RODNEY
                        What if she’s petite?

                                 BACHELOR #2
                              (Considers it)
                        I’d let her blow me. I mean, even
                        Mosquito Bites need some loving now
                        and then, right?

           Bachelor #2 cackles to himself. Bachelor #1, the boy scout
           of the group, looks uncomfortable.

           Rodney stares at Bachelor #2 and grins, like he knows
           something the other guys don’t.

                                 RODNEY
                        Your last name is Aslan?

                                 RODNEY
                        What’s that Armenian?

                                 ARNIE
                        Loud and proud.

                                 RODNEY
                        Made of strong stuff.

                                 ARNIE
                        How do you mean?

                                 RODNEY
                        Two genocides and you’re still not
                        dead. It’s impressive.

                                 ARNIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 RODNEY
                        Like cockroaches. Small and ugly
                        but you’ll live forever. Until you
                        don’t.

           Rodney grins.

           Arnie tenses, like he can’t decide whether to laugh or throw
           down.

           INT. DIRECTOR’S BOOTH - SAME

           On consecutive television monitors, we watch as:

           - Bachelor #1 peeks around for help in case a fight breaks
           out between Arnie and Rodney.

           - Sheryl scribbles notes on her cue cards.

           - A Hertz Car Rental commercial, starring O.J. Simpson,
           draws to a close.

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO / STAGE

           Suddenly, the house lights flash, signaling that the show is
           about to begin again.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        We’re on.

           FROM HERE ON OUT, WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BOTH SIDES
           OF THE PARTITION:

           As Ed takes his place before the cameras and Marilyn and
           Gretchen vacate the stage, the FIRST AD counts down:

                                 FIRST AD
                        In place everyone. And we’re back
                        in five... four... three... two...

           He points towards Ed.

                                 ED
                        Welcome back to The Dating Game.
                        Sheryl, you had a little time to
                        think about those, um, colorful
                        introductions. Are you ready to ask
                        your questions?

                                 SHERYL
                        I am.

                                 ED
                        Okay, well then why don’t you have
                        a seat right here. Make yourself
                        comfortable. Remember you can ask
                        them anything you like except for
                        name, age, occupation and income.
                        Good luck and here we go.

           Sheryl looks into the crowd, scanning for Laura. Finds her
           seat empty.

           Sheryl registers this. Then shakes it off and looks down at
           her cue cards, where the official questions have been
           scribbled out and replaced with her own handwritten ones.

                                 SHERYL
                        Bachelor #1: Einstein said that
                        sitting on a hot stove for a minute
                        feels like an hour, and sitting
                        next to a nice girl for an hour
                        feels like a minute. That was his
                        theory of special relativity.
                        What’s yours?

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Um... what?

           The audience chuckles. Sheryl smiles wryly.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I’ll come back to you on that.

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Wait, hold on: Was that the actual
                        question?

                                 SHERYL
                              (Moving on)
                        Bachelor #2: When you invite a girl
                        out for dinner what do you expect
                        in return?

                                 ARNIE
                              (Snickers)
                        I guess that depends on the meal. I
                        mean, are we talking Filet Mignon
                        or what?

                                 SHERYL
                        Good question. Are we?

                                 ARNIE
                        Yeah, sure. I’m a generous guy.

                                 SHERYL
                        That’s good to know.

                                 ARNIE
                        And if I’m spending an arm and a
                        leg on dinner, I’d like to think
                        she could at least buy the dessert.

           Sheryl looks grossed out but keeps going, giving Arnie
           enough rope to hang himself.

                                 SHERYL
                        And what would you order for
                        dessert?

                                 ARNIE
                        Oh, you know--

                                 SHERYL
                        No, I don’t. Tell me.

                                 ARNIE
                        Something hot...

                                 SHERYL
                        What, like banana flambe?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ARNIE
                        ...and wet and covered in cream.

                                 SHERYL
                        Why do I get the impression that
                        you don’t eat out much?

                                 ARNIE
                        Y’know, I’m happy to share.

                                 SHERYL
                              (Shutting him down)
                        Sorry, I’m on a diet.

           The audience laughs.

                                 SHERYL
                        Bachelor #1: How’s that theory of
                        relativity coming along?

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Hunh?

                                 SHERYL
                        Groovy. Keep at it.

           The audience laughs again.

           Rodney keeps his head down, listening, trying to gauge
           Sheryl’s personality and what he thinks she’ll respond to.

                                 SHERYL
                        Bachelor #3.

                                 RODNEY
                        Yes.

                                 SHERYL
                        What’s the difference between a boy
                        and a man?

                                 RODNEY
                        A boy thinks that buying a woman
                        dinner means she owes you
                        something.

           Sheryl smiles and nods approvingly.

           The audience hoots and hollers.

                                 SHERYL
                        And what does a man think?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        Well for starters he knows better
                        than to talk about dessert before
                        you’ve made it through dinner.

           Arnie gives Rodney a dirty look then tries to hide it with a
           smile.

                                 SHERYL
                        Bachelor #1, any luck?

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        I can’t...

                                 SHERYL
                        No? Bachelor #3, your buddy’s
                        drawing a blank. Wanna help him
                        out?

                                 RODNEY
                        With his theory of special
                        relativity?

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah.

           Rodney thinks about it for a second. Then:

                                 RODNEY
                        Whether it’s for a minute or for an
                        hour, I’d love to sit relatively
                        close to a special girl when I can.
                        How’s that?

           The audience ROARS; bursts out into applause.

           Sheryl smirks like she can’t help liking this guy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. ABC STUDIOS - SAME

           Laura hurries through the parking lot, looking for her car.
           Clearly lost and FRIGHTENED.

           Rain pours down, drenching everything in site.

           Eventually, Laura SPOTS HER CAR.

           A voice calls out to Laura in the distance behind her:

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Laura fumbles with her keys and unlocks the door.

           She collapses into the driver’s seat and SLAMS THE DOOR
           shut. She sits there, gasping and staring out the window as
           rain beats down on the windshield and hood.

           HOLD ON HER.

           The audience chuckles.

                                 SHERYL
                        By the way: Einstein was a
                        physicist not an astronomer.

                                 SHERYL
                        Is that it?

                        Why does this feel like a trap?

                                 SHERYL
                        I don’t know. Why does it?

                                 ARNIE
                        Because if I say girls are for
                        wining and dining, I sound like a
                        jerk. And if I say they’re for,
                        y’know, respecting or whatever,
                        then I just sound like some schmuck

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. FRANKLIN CANYON, CA - MORNING (DECEMBER 1977)

           The morning sun crests above distant hills. Birds are
           chirping. Everything is beautiful and the world is waking
           up.

           Somewhere, small in the frame, A DEAD GIRL (18) lays naked
           in the grass. Her body is bent and broken.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           We cut to another landscape. More California hills dotted
           with oak and sycamore trees. A pond, perhaps.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           In the distance, some GRIP TRUCKS roll up a dirt road,
           kicking up clouds of dust in their wake.

           The trucks pull to a stop and some CREW hop out.

           While the DIRECTOR and DP discuss the scene they’re about to
           shoot, some GRIPS begin unloading the truck.

           Meanwhile, one of the GRIPS (male, 20s) goes to the CRAFT
           SERVICES TABLE and pours himself a coffee. Sips it and
           wanders off into the brush to look at the hills.

           Suddenly, something catches his eye:

           It’s the DEAD GIRL (18).

           CLOSE ON: An ant crawls across her cheek onto her ear. Her
           lobe is pierced, but the earring is missing.

           The grip stands there, stunned.

           EXT. L.A. TIMES - MORNING, DAYS LATER

           A tall stucco structure in downtown. The words "L.A. TIMES"
           can be seen across the front of the building.

           SUPER:

                                 LOS ANGELES, CA
                                    December 1977

           INT. ATTACHED PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Employees cross from their cars to the entrance of the
           building.

           Rodney moves with the crowd, chatting with a co-worker.

           CAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT until it’s revealed that we’re in
           the backseat of A POLICE CRUISER, looking through the
           windshield.

           Two INSPECTORS sit in the front seat, looking at the crowd
           through a pair of binoculars. We can’t see their faces from
           here, but we will come to know them as WALKER and VANDERBILT
           (40s, 50s).

                                 WALKER
                        Tan slacks, blue shirt?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Yeah.

           Walker checks his watch, jots something down in a little
           spiral-bound notebook.

           Vanderbilt sips his coffee, watches as Rodney disappears
           inside the office building.

                                 WALKER
                        See where he parked?

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Upper level, I think.

                                 WALKER
                        What’s he drive?

                                 VANDERBILT
                              (Checks his notes)
                        Blue Datsun F-10.

                                 WALKER
                        Let’s take a look.

           They climb out of the car and begin working their way
           through the parking garage.

           INT. L.A. TIMES, TYPESETTING - MORNING

           In a vast office space, TYPESETTERS (mostly men) sit at
           small desks transcribing articles into a computerized
           system.

           Among them is Rodney, who transcribes an article with the
           headline "Carter Delays Foreign Trips".

           After a moment, a COPY BOY (17) comes up and taps Rodney on
           the shoulder; hands him a SHEET OF PAPER.

                                 COPY BOY
                        Murphy wants this prioritized.

           The Copy Boy takes off.

           Rodney looks at the typewritten article. It’s headline
           reads: "WOMAN’S BODY FOUND IN CANYON"

           Rodney studies the short article, focusing on a line towards
           the bottom:

           "Detectives said there may be a connection with the two
           similar slayings in the last two weeks..."
           Rodney reaches into his pocket and removes a GIRL’S EARRING.
           ’Turns it over between his fingers.

           INT. L.A. TIMES, LAYOUT - LATER

           Rodney moves through a room of men laying out the newspaper
           on upright drafting desks.

                                 COWORKER
                        Hey.

                                 RODNEY
                        Brian.

                                 COWORKER 2
                        Hey Rodney.

                                 RODNEY
                        Allen.

           Rodney passes through a door at the back of the room.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Rodney stands with THREE COWORKERS(40s - 50s), flipping
           through pages of a small PHOTO ALBUM.

                                 COWORKER 3
                        Ho God, look at that one.

                                 COWORKER 4
                        The tits on her. I swear to Christ,
                        I could eat ’em.

                                 COWORKER 3
                        Save some for me.

           The guys giggle like mischievous children.

           Rodney flips through some more pages.

                                 RODNEY
                        Hold on, I gotta show you another
                        one. I met her at a party at Warren
                        Beatty’s house.

                                 COWORKER 4
                        "Warren Beatty’s house." Listen to
                        this fucking guy.

           Rodney finds the page he’s looking for.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Something about the photo SURPRISES the men.

                                 COWORKER 4
                              (Grinning)
                        God damn.

                                 RODNEY
                        I know, right?

                                 COWORKER 4
                        God damn God damn God damn.

                                 RODNEY
                        What’d I tell you?

                                 COWORKER 3
                              (Slightly disturbed)
                        Wow. She’s, uh...

                                 RODNEY
                        What?

                                 COWORKER 4
                        She looks pretty young.

                                 RODNEY
                        Hey Man: The fresher the fruit, the
                        sweeter the juice.

           Coworker 3 and 4 LAUGH loudly.

                                 COWORKER 4
                        You got that right.

           Coworker 5, looking disgusted, slips quietly out of the
           room. Rodney is the only one who notices. The other guys are
           glued to the book.

           Coworker 4 flips to the next page.

                                 COWORKER 4
                        Oh shit, look at this one...

           EXT. ALCALA HOUSE - DAYS LATER

           A simple rancher home in Monterey Park. In the distance we
           can hear the sound of children playing. This is a family
           neighborhood.
           INT. RODNEY’S BEDROOM

           The curtains have been drawn, and a red light bulb is
           screwed into the ceiling. A long table has been built into
           the far wall, where various PHOTO DEVELOPING supplies sit.

           On the wall above Rodney’s bed is the DEEP PURPLE POSTER
           featuring the Hieronymus Bosch painting of Hell from "The
           Garden of Earthly Delights."

           Rodney puts a sheet of processing paper into the developer.
           Slowly an image comes into focus: It’s a VOYEURISTIC SHOT of
           a BLOND WOMAN IN THE STREET, oblivious that she’s being
           photographed. We’ll come to know her as SUE KELLY.

           Rodney stairs down at it admiringly.

           Suddenly, someone KNOCKS on his door.

                                 MOTHER(OS)
                        Rodney?

                                 RODNEY
                        What is it, Mom?

           The door opens a crack.

                                 MOTHER(OS)
                        There are some men out here who
                        want to speak to you.

                                 RODNEY
                        I’ll be right out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Rodney quickly collects his photos and stashes them in LOCK
           BOX. A PISTOL, a couple of KNIVES, and other photos and
           keepsakes are also in the box.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Rodney HIDES THE LOCKBOX above a ceiling panel in his
           closet.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney steps out of his bedroom to find the TWO INSPECTORS
           from earlier, WALKER and VANDERBILT, waiting in the living
           room.

           Rodney’s MOTHER stands by nervously.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 WALKER
                        Rodney Alcala?

                                 RODNEY
                        That’s right.

                                 WALKER
                        Hi, I’m Inspector James Walker.
                        This is Inspector Andrew
                        Vanderbilt. We’re investigating the
                        disappearance of Emma Allstone.

                                 RODNEY
                        You’re a long way from New York,
                        aren’t you?

                                 WALKER
                        So you’re familiar with the case.

                                 RODNEY
                        Only what I’ve read in the papers.
                        Should I have a lawyer present?

                                 WALKER
                        I don’t know. Should you?

           Rodney shuts his mouth.

                                 WALKER
                        Take a seat, please.

                                 RODNEY
                        Mom, would you get us some tea?

           Rodney’s Mother doesn’t move.

                                 RODNEY
                        Please.

           Finally, she steps out of the room.

           Rodney moves to the couch. Sits.

           The Inspectors pull up chairs opposite him.

                                 WALKER
                        As may you know, Emma Allstone was
                        last seen on July 15th, leaving her
                        apartment building on 3rd Avenue at
                        44th Street, accompanied by a thin,

                        white man with long brown hair. Her
                        calendar says that she was supposed
                        to meet up with a photographer
                        named John Burger at that time.

                                 RODNEY
                        What does that have to do with me?

                                 WALKER
                        An informant recently notified us
                        that you’ve worked under the name
                        John Burger in the past.
                              (No response)
                        Is this true?

                                 RODNEY
                        Who told you that?

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Answer the question, please.

                                 RODNEY
                        I haven’t used that name in years.

                                 WALKER
                        Why did you adopt a pseudonym?

                                 RODNEY
                        ’Felt like a change. I wanted to
                        forget the past.

                                 WALKER
                              (Consulting file)
                        Are you referring to the rape of
                        Alice McAndrews, for which you
                        served 34 months in prison?

           Rodney hears a sound. Sees his MOTHER’S SHADOW poking out
           from around the corner. ’Knows he’s being listened to.

           Rodney looks back at Walker.

                                 WALKER
                        Rodney?

                                 RODNEY
                        I’m referring to life.

                                 WALKER
                        Another informant tells us that you
                        knew Ms. Allstone.

           Rodney stares hard at Walker.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                              (Hesitates)
                        I met her.

                                 WALKER
                        Where?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Lying)
                        A club, I think. I can’t remember
                        which one.

                                 WALKER
                        Were you with Ms. Allstone on July
                        15th this year?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Lying)
                        We got lunch. Went to central park,
                        took some pictures. Then she went
                        home. I never heard from her again.

                                 WALKER
                        Do you still have those pictures?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Lying)
                        No.

                                 WALKER
                        Why not?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Kind of lying)
                        I only took them to get her into
                        bed.

                                 WALKER
                        Did it work?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Lying)
                        No.

                                 WALKER
                        Mind if we look around?

                                 RODNEY
                        Do you have a warrant?

           In the other room a TEA KETTLE begins to WHISTLE.

           Walker grins.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 RODNEY
                        Anything else?

                                 WALKER
                        Don’t go anywhere. We may need to
                        speak to you again.

           Rodney’s Mom steps back into the room carrying a tray with
           cups of tea on it.

                                 WALKER
                        Thank you, Ma’am. We’re all set.

           Walker and Vanderbilt see themselves out.

           Rodney stares after them.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           We follow Rodney down the boardwalk in Santa Monica, lit by
           shopfronts and streetlamps. In the distance behind him, we
           can make out the Ferris wheel at the end of the pier,
           glowing in the night.

           Beach bums and stoners mill about. There are guys on
           skateboards and girls on roller skates. A street musician
           plays a set of bongos to a few tourist who throw money into
           his bucket.

           Rodney ignores them all. They are not who he is looking for.

           INT. SANTA MONICA BAR - NIGHT

           Rodney sits quietly in a corner booth, a cigarette
           smoldering in one hand. He studies the throngs of happy,
           laughing women, while Etta James sings "Take It To The
           Limit" through the jukebox.

           Eventually, Rodney zeroes in on a single woman. It’s the
           BLOND WOMAN from his photograph, SUE KELLY. She’s dressed in
           a slinky cocktail dress, laughing with friends.

           Among the friends is LAURA (from the audience of The Dating
           Game). They order another round of drinks.

           CAMERA PUSHES IN ON RODNEY, who stares at Sue, unblinking,
           lost in thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           - IN SUE’S APARTMENT, LATER THAT NIGHT: Rodney PINS Sue to
           her mattress, hands gripped around her throat.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The image lasts for a fraction of a second-- a snapshop of
           what’s to come.

                                                                   BACK TO:

           CAMERA CONTINUES IN ON RODNEY, who now seems to be looking
           past Sue. He lifts the cigarette to his lips then lets it
           fall again without taking a drag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           - Sue flails at Rodney, but it’s useless. He tightens his
           grip.

                                                                   BACK TO:

           CAMERA CONTINUES IN ON RODNEY, who is lost in a 1000-yard
           stare.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           - Sue collapses, dead. Rodney lets out a long, low, animal
           growl.

                                                                   BACK TO:

           CAMERA CONTINUES IN ON RODNEY. A tear streaks down his
           cheek.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           - Rodney leans forward and takes a BITE out of Sue’s right
           breast. Blood pours down his chin.

                                                                   BACK TO:

           CAMERA CONTINUES IN ON RODNEY. Stops, close on his face. He
           blinks away the tears. Wipes his face.

           He stands and crosses to Sue.

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - BACK TO PRESENT, DAY

           Laura sits in her car, staring blankly out the window. Rain
           beats down on the windshield.

           HOLD ON HER.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. SANTA MONICA BAR - NIGHT (DECEMBER 1977)

           Rodney, Sue and Laura in the bar. The table is cluttered
           with empty glasses and beer bottles. They’ve been talking
           for a while; all a little drunk.

                                 RODNEY
                        What’s the most beautiful thing
                        you’ve ever seen?

                                 LAURA
                              (Chuckles)
                        ’Scuse me?

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Gestures to both women)
                        Present company excluded, of
                        course.

                                 SUE
                              (Laughs loudly)
                        Is that your line? Please tell me
                        you’ve used that before--

                                 LAURA
                        Did you really just call me a
                        thing?

                                 RODNEY
                              (Ignoring Laura)
                        I’ve never used it before--

                                 SUE
                        Is that what you do though? Just go
                        around telling women what you think
                        they want to hear?

                                 RODNEY
                        Getting warm.

                                 SUE
                        At least you’re honest about it.

                                 RODNEY
                        No, but really. I’m being serious.

                                 SUE
                        About--?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        I want to know--

                                 SUE
                        What’s the most beautiful--?

                                 RODNEY
                        What’s your idea of beauty?

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know. I’ve seen a lot of--

                                 RODNEY
                        Because I have this theory--

                                 SUE
                        Oh fer fucks sake--

                                 RODNEY
                        No, really, I do. I have this
                        theory that all the things that
                        people tend to think of as being,
                        y’know, important ingredients for a
                        successful relationship-- looks,
                        career, politics, whatever-- are
                        wrong. What really matters is
                        whether or not you have a similar
                        vision of beauty. For some people
                        that’s the Grand Canyon. For
                        others, it’s some bearded guy
                        nailed to a cross. It’s about what
                        feeds your soul.

           Sue looks at Rodney, clearly taken by him.

                                 SUE
                        Do you wanna get out of here?

           Rodney grins.

                                                          FLASH-FORWARD TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - BACK TO PRESENT

           Laura sits, still staring out the window.

           CAMERA PUSH IN ON HER...

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. SANTA MONICA BAR - NIGHT (DECEMBER, 1977)

           Moments later. Sue is putting on her jacket while Rodney
           pays the bill.

                                 SUE
                        I’ll call you tomorrow.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, Sue. Um: You sure I can’t take
                        you home?

                                 SUE
                              (Smiles)
                        I’m gonna be fine.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m just saying. You’re kinda
                        drunk.

           Suddenly, Rodney steps up to them.

                                 RODNEY
                        You ready?

                                 SUE
                        Let’s go.

           Sue gives Laura a little toodle-oo wave and heads for the
           exit.

                                 RODNEY
                              (To Laura)
                        Don’t worry. I’ll bring her back in
                        one piece.

           Rodney winks at her.

           Laura winces, visibly creeped out by this.

           Rodney turns and follows Sue out the door.

                                                          FLASH-FORWARD TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - BACK TO PRESENT

           CLOSE ON Laura, lost in thought.

           Suddenly, someone BANGS on the passenger’s window.

           Laura JUMPS in her seat. Startled. She looks out the window
           to see Kenny standing there.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Laura reaches over and unlocks his door. Kenny hops in with
           her.

                                 KENNY
                        What the fuck’s going on? You
                        scared the shit out of my parents.
                        You know that, right?

                                 LAURA
                        It was him.

                                 KENNY
                        Who?

                                 LAURA
                        The guy on the show. Number three.

                                 KENNY
                        What are you talking about? Are you
                        ovulating or something?

                                 LAURA
                        What?

           Laura starts to say something else. Stops. Collects herself.

           Kenny shakes his head, frustrated, as if he thinks this is
           all a ruse.

                                 KENNY
                        It’s like whenever my folks come to
                        town you need to find some new way
                        to humiliate me.

                                 LAURA
                        I--

                                 KENNY
                        Well I’m sick of it. I know you
                        don’t like all the tourist-y shit,
                        but would it kill you to just
                        pretend? For once, make it about
                        someone other than yourself?

                                 LAURA
                        Kenny, look, would you please
                        just--

                                 KENNY
                        Y’know what: Fuck it. Do whatever
                        you want. We’ll get a cab back. See
                        you later.

           CONTINUED:

           Kenny throws open the passenger’s side door and steps out
           into the rain. Walks off.

           Laura sits there, looking crushed.

           She puts her head in her hands, trying to decide what to do.
           After a moment, she looks up towards the television studio.

           She CLIMBS out of the car, SLAMMING THE DOOR behind her.
           Walks off towards the studio.

           AGAIN, PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF:

                                 SHERYL
                        Bachelor #3?

                                 RODNEY
                        What are girls for?

                                 SHERYL
                        That’s right.

                                 RODNEY
                        I guess I’d have to say that that’s
                        up to the girl.

           The audience CHEERS.

                                 SHERYL
                        Good answer.

           Sheryl looks at a LARGE DIGITAL CLOCK towards the rear of
           the room, counting down the time to the next commercial
           break. 00:01:10... 00:01:09... 00:01:08...

           Sheryl realizes that she only has time for one last question
           and shuffles through the notes written on her cue cards.

                                 SHERYL
                        Okay, Bachelor #3, I have a follow
                        up question.

                                 RODNEY
                        Shoot.

                                 SHERYL
                        You’ve been with the other
                        Bachelors for a few hours now,
                        right?

           CONTINUED:

           Bachelor #1 and Arnie shift in their seats, obviously
           uncomfortable with where this question is going.

                                 RODNEY
                        We talked a bit.

                                 SHERYL
                        Okay: Tell me the most disgusting
                        thing that Bachelor’s #1 and #2
                        said or did backstage.

           The audience HOWLS WITH DELIGHT.

                                 SHERYL
                        Besides coming on this show, of
                        course.

           Ed laughs, trying to be a good sport, but it’s clear that
           he’s pissed off.

                                 RODNEY
                        Oh Gosh. Wow, that’s a tough one.

           Sheryl leans forward in her seat, listening intently.

                                 RODNEY
                        Well, y’know, if I’m being honest,
                        Bachelor #1 really didn’t say
                        anything disgusting.

                                 SHERYL
                        No?

           Bachelor #1 slumps down in his seat, relieved beyond words.

                                 RODNEY
                        Yeah, he’s basically a boy scout.

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        It’s true! I didn’t say anything--

                                 RODNEY
                        With the operative word being
                        "boy."

           The audience CHUCKLES.

                                 SHERYL
                        What about Bachelor #2?

           Bachelor #2 stares daggers at Rodney.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        I can’t repeat it word for word,
                        seeing as how we’re on television
                        and all. But he had some thoughts
                        about bra-size being a prerequisite
                        for a meaningful relationship.

                                 SHERYL
                        Is that right?

                                 RODNEY
                        Thought that was pretty, um,
                        tasteless.

           The audience BOOS at Bachelor #2, who smiles bitterly and
           shakes his head. Trying to hide his anger behind a twisted
           smile.

           Suddenly, a BUZZER sounds and Ed steps back out onto the
           stage.

                                 ED
                        And that buzzer signals that it’s
                        the end of the game.

                                 BACHELOR # 2
                        Wait, hold on. What about me?

                                 ED
                        It’s decision time, Sheryl--

                                 BACHELOR # 2
                        I don’t get to answer the question?

           But before Bachelor #2 can finish his sentence, his mic cuts
           out. Suddenly, his voice sounds small-- inaudible to Sheryl
           and the audience.

           Rodney continues to smile out at the cameras, unconcerned.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           CU on a TV MONITOR: Ed turns and speaks directly into the

                                 ED
                        And while Sheryl makes her decision
                        about her date, we’ll take a little
                        time off so you can make a decision
                        about the very fine products we’ve

           Suddenly, the monitor cuts to a SHAKE ’n’ BAKE COMMERCIAL
           showing a KNIFE CUTTING INTO A PORK CHOP.

           what she’s looking for: a SECURITY GUARD (40s), feet propped
           up on his desk, answering a call.

                        Last year, my friend Susan Kelly
                        went missing. We were dancing at a
                        club, and she met this guy. Okay?
                        The following morning she was found
                        dead in her apartment. Murdered.
                        And that guy was the last person
                        with her before she died.

                                 SECURITY
                        Uh huh. So what does this have to

           The Security Guard looks at her, still dubious, but
           softening.

           INT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION - SAME

           Suddenly, Arnie WHACKS Rodney across the arm. Rodney looks
           down at his arm, confused.

                                 ARNIE
                        What the fuck, man!

                                 RODNEY
                        Something wrong?

                                 ARNIE
                        Why’d you tell her all that?

                                 RODNEY
                        Because she asked.

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Whoa. Uh. Guys, c’mon--

                                 ARNIE
                        "Because she asked." Fuck you,
                        asshole.

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        Calm down, it’s just a game.

                                 ARNIE
                              (To Bachelor #1)
                        Zip it, twerp. You didn’t get
                        humiliated on national television.

                              (To Rodney)
                        Soon as this show’s over, you and
                        me are gonna have some words.

                                 RODNEY
                        Words? Is that right?

                                 ARNIE
                        You bet your ass.

                                 BACHELOR #1
                        I gotta pee. I’ll be right back.

           Bachelor #1 gets up and runs off stage.

           Rodney stares hard at Arnie, a little smile on his face.
           Trying to decide how far he wants to push this.

                                 RODNEY
                        What if I don’t show? What then?
                        You gonna hire someone to track me
                        down?

                                 ARNIE
                              (Impotently)
                        Fucking pussy.

                                 RODNEY
                        I have a better idea. Let’s
                        exchange contact information now so
                        that we know where to find each
                        other in case the other person
                        get’s cold feet.

           Arnie looks dubious.

                                 ARNIE
                        Okay.

                                 RODNEY
                        I’ll give you my I.D., and you give
                        me yours. Deal?

           Rodney reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet.
           Digs through it until he finds a small square piece of
           paper. He takes it out.

           Arnie takes out his I.D.. The men trade.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                              (Reading)
                        Stocker Street, Glendale. That’s at
                        the base of the hills, right? Yeah,
                        I know where that is.

           Arnie looks at the slip of paper in his hands-- it’s a small
           black and white photo of a MURDERED WOMAN; naked, strangled
           and posed in some bizarre position.

           For a second, Arnie appears confused, like he can’t quite
           tell what he’s looking at. Then it hits him, and he LEAPS
           BACK IN HIS SEAT, dropping the photograph.

           The photo flutters to the ground, landing face-side down.

                                 ARNIE
                        What the fuck is that?

           Rodney smiles at Arnie and hands his I.D. back to him.
           Rodney leans forward and picks the photo up off the floor--
           looks at it lovingly, then folds it up and puts it in his
           mouth. Chews it. Swallows. SMILES.

           Arnie stares at him, terrified.

           Suddenly, Bachelor #1 returns, takes his seat. He registers
           that the mood has shifted, but doesn’t question it.

                                 FIRST AD (OS)
                        Alright folks. Everyone in place!

           INT. ABC STUDIOS - DAY

           Laura watches pensively as the Security Guard tries to
           connect her to someone on The Dating Game.

           INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The Security Guard leads Laura down a long corridor.

                                 SECURITY
                        Don’t make me regret this.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY (SUMMER, 1978)

           A desert landscape. Low hills in the distance; dry, rocky
           terrain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           A COYOTE trots off towards the hills with a chipmunk crushed
           between it’s jaws.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Back on the highway. Rodney’s blue Datsun speeds past the
           camera, shrinking off into the distance.

           INT. DATSUN - SAME

           Rodney and Amy drive in silence. Amy glances over at him and
           furrows her brow. He looks familiar but she can’t place
           where she’s seen him before.

           Rodney looks at Amy, and she turns away again.

                                 RODNEY
                        So let me guess: An actress?

                                 AMY
                        Hm?

                                 RODNEY
                        Or are you gonna be a model?

           Amy chuckles and shakes her head.

                                 RODNEY
                        What? What’d I say?

                                 AMY
                        I’m not gonna fuck you.

                        ’Just saying. If that’s what you’ve
                        got in mind then you can pull over
                        and just let me off right here.

                                 RODNEY
                        Whoa, hey, time out. I wasn’t
                        trying to--

                                 AMY
                        I’m not gonna blow some dude for
                        the privilege of a ride in his
                        fucking Datsun. Got it?

                                 RODNEY
                        I was just making conversation.

                                 AMY
                        "Are you gonna be an actress or a
                        model?"

                                 RODNEY
                        What? I was being serious.

                                 AMY
                        Pfft.

                                 RODNEY
                        You’re young, you’re pretty, you’re
                        moving to Los Angeles. You don’t
                        think that’s a reasonable
                        assumption?

                                 AMY
                        It’s a perfectly reasonable
                        assumption. But it’s a creepy-ass
                        thing to say to someone who you’ve
                        just met.

                                 RODNEY
                        How?

                                 AMY
                        It’s flattery.

                                 RODNEY
                        You don’t think you’re good
                        looking?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I don’t think "good looking,"
                        describes most models. They’re
                        exceptionally beautiful.

                                 RODNEY
                              (Suggestively)
                        Well--

                                 AMY
                        And by telling me that I look like
                        they do-- whether you meant it or
                        not-- you’re signaling a level of
                        sexual attraction; which puts me in
                        a position where either I have to
                        accept your advances or shut it
                        down and risk all the things that
                        women risk when they reject a man.

                                 RODNEY
                        I--

                                 AMY
                        And considering that I’m a) in a
                        car with someone I don’t know,
                        b) traveling with my
                        old-as-the-hills dog, and c)
                        currently passing through the
                        middle of fucking nowhere, that’s a
                        scary God damn position to be in.

           Rodney starts to say something, then stops. He doesn’t look
           upset, and certainly not ashamed of himself. There’s a
           little smile on his face, like he’s pleasantly surprised by
           the brazenness of his new passenger.

                                 RODNEY
                        Alright. Alright, fair enough. Can
                        we try again?

                                 AMY
                        I don’t know. Can we?

           Rodney snaps on the radio to lighten the mood. Classic rocks
           pours of the speakers. Something a light and folksy with
           sinister undertones. "The Dark End Of The Street" by the
           Flying Burrito Brothers, maybe.

                                 RODNEY
                        Why are you going to L.A.?

                        Congratulations. Which one?

                        y’know.

                                 RODNEY
                        Cool. A whole family of protectors.

                                 RODNEY
                        I actually used to be in the army.
                        Trained to be a paratrooper, but
                        ended up working as a clerk, which
                        is fine by me. I’m not cut out for
                        combat.
                              (Little pause)
                        Sorry, I interrupted. You were
                        saying?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, no. That’s fine.

                                 RODNEY
                              (Gestures at Ginger)
                        What about her? She going to school
                        with you too?

                                 AMY
                        No, Ginger’s staying with my dad.

                                 RODNEY
                              (To Ginger)
                        Is that right? You gonna help hunt
                        down the bad guys, Ginger? You
                        gonna make the world safe for Good
                        People?

           Amy reaches back and pets Ginger on the head.

                                 AMY
                              (Chuckles)
                        I think her hunting days are just
                        about over. But I’ll see her on the
                        weekends, and with a Lieutenant to
                        look out after her, I think she’ll
                        be just fine.

                                 RODNEY
                        ’Thought you said your dad was a
                        Sergeant.

                                 AMY
                        What?
                              (realizes her mistake)
                        Yeah, no. Uh: He used to be a
                        Lieutenant before he was promoted.

                                 RODNEY
                        You mean he used to be a Sergeant
                        before he was promoted? Lieutenants
                        outranks Sergeants.

                                 RODNEY
                        Unless he used to work at a rural
                        precinct or something, and was
                        promoted to a lesser position in a
                        larger district?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I think that’s what happened.

                                 RODNEY
                        Gotcha.

                                 AMY
                        Because he used to work in-- Yeah.
                        That’s definitely it. Sorry, it’s
                        been a long day. I’m...

           Amy gestures that she’s mentally fried, forces a chuckle
           then turns and looks out the window. ’Knows that she has
           just blown her tough girl cover.

           Rodney allows a slight smile to creep across his lips. Keeps
           driving.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME

           The Datsun speeds on down the highway.

           INT. DATSUN - SHORT WHILE LATER

           Rodney takes out a joint, lights it. Takes a hit then offers
           it to Amy who shakes her head. Rodney shrugs.

           Amy peaks over at Rodney, again seeming to recognize him.

                                 RODNEY
                        Something wrong?

                                 AMY
                        Sorry, I feel like I’ve seen you
                        before.

                                 RODNEY
                        I’m not the kid on the milk carton,
                        if that’s what you’re wondering.

           Again, Amy shakes it off. Looks out the window at a road
           sign that says:

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Los Angeles 65

           Amy looks impatient. She turns and checks on Ginger in the
           back seat, sleeping.

           Rodney reaches down to scratch his ankle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Beneath the seat, Rodney reaches for a REVOLVER. He rotates
           it so that it’s easily accessible, then removes his hand.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

           Amy suddenly notices a CAMERA CASE in the back seat. She
           furrows her brow, like she’s just found another piece of the
           puzzle but doesn’t know how to put it together yet.

                                 AMY
                        You’re a photographer?

                                 RODNEY
                        Hm? Oh, yeah.

                                 AMY
                        What do you shoot?

                                 RODNEY
                        People. Women mostly.

                                 AMY
                        Like for magazines, or--?

                                 RODNEY
                        Sometimes. Does that make me creepy
                        too?

                                 AMY
                        Depends on the pictures.

                                 RODNEY
                        Well, I don’t have any on hand,
                        so--.

                                 AMY
                        I guess I’ll never know.

                                 RODNEY
                        Bummer. My Pampers ad would have
                        blown your mind.

           Amy chuckles.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You sure you don’t want some of
                        this?

           Rodney re-offers her the joint.

           Amy looks at it for a second, weighing the risks. Finally,
           she accepts it, TAKES A HIT and hands it back.

           Rodney finishes it off and flicks the rest out the window.

                                 RODNEY
                        God look at view. How beautiful is
                        that?
                              (little pause)
                        Mind if I pull over and snap a
                        couple pictures?

                                 AMY
                        Um...

                                 RODNEY
                        If you’re in a hurry, we don’t need
                        to.

                                 AMY
                        No, it’s fine.

                                 RODNEY
                        Cool. Thanks.

           Rodney pulls into a rest stop overlooking PYRAMID LAKE; a
           vast reservoir surrounded by mountains.

           EXT. PYRAMID LAKE REST STOP

           Rodney and Amy climb out of the car.

                                 RODNEY
                        Would you grab my camera case?

           Amy does.

           While she’s distracted, Rodney get the revolver from beneath
           his seat and slips it in the back of his pants.

           Amy steps around the car and hands him the case, oblivious
           to the gun.

                                 RODNEY
                              (Gesturing to Ginger)
                        Wanna take her?

                                 RODNEY
                        Cool.

           Rodney crosses to the edge of the look out, snaps some
           pictures of the lake.

           Amy loiters, not frightened but still on guard.

                                 RODNEY
                        I can’t get the shot I want from
                        here. I think I’m gonna climb down
                        the embankment. Join me?

                                 AMY
                        Is it safe?

                                 RODNEY
                        I think we’ll survive.

                                 AMY
                        Okay.

           Rodney climbs over the guard rail and begins to move down
           the hill towards the lake. Amy starts to follow him, then
           stops and looks back towards Ginger who is staring out the
           car window at her, whining pitifully.

           Amy turns and follows him down the hill.

           EXT. LAKE - AFTERNOON

           Rodney snaps some more pictures of the lake while Amy
           saunters around. She skips a stone.

                                 RODNEY
                        Mind if I snap one of you?

                                 AMY
                        Hm?

                        Nothing wild. I promise.

                        Just to give a sense of

                        Fair enough.

           Rodney sits beside the lake, reaches behind his back and
           removes the gun from his waistband. He tucks it discreetly
           beneath his leg.

           Amy walks over to him, sits down. ’Looks at Rodney, sitting
           there with his camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           AMY’S POV: 10 years younger, Rodney Alcala squats down to
           help Amy pick up her books. His camera dangles from the
           strap around his neck. He looks up at her and smiles.

                        That’s how I know you.

                                 RODNEY
                        Hm?

                                 AMY
                        You offered me a ride when I was a
                        kid. I was on my way to school and
                        my bag broke--

           Rodney gives her a look like he doesn’t remember this, but
           believes her nevertheless. There have been so many girls,
           after all.

                                 AMY
                        Heh. Not a lot has changed, I
                        guess.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Amy suddenly gets wistful, like this memory has triggered
           emotions that she’s been holding back.

                                 AMY
                        Actually everything has changed.
                        That may have been the last decent
                        day of my life.

           Rodney’s hand finds it’s way to the gun-- strokes it
           slightly.

                                 RODNEY
                        How’s that?

                                 AMY
                        Nevermind. Sorry, it’s stupid. I
                        sound like a--

                                 RODNEY
                        No, what were you gonna say?

           Amy starts to say something; stops herself. Looks
           embarrassed.

                                 AMY
                        Fuck it. You already know I’m full
                        of shit, so why not. My dad isn’t
                        in L.A. He, uh, took off when I was
                        a kid. It’s a total fucking cliche.
                        Met some woman on a business trip
                        and never came back. I think he
                        lives in San Antonio now.

           Rodney’s hand freezes on the gun. Something about this last
           line has seized him.

                                 AMY
                        Which, I mean: Big whoop, right?
                        People deal with worse every day.
                        But still: Everything seemed to
                        fall apart after that that. My mom
                        moved back to Reno so she could be
                        near her parents, but then they
                        died, and she started drinking
                        and-- heh. It’s all normal stuff.
                        Totally ordinary dumb choices and
                        shitty luck. But once you’re IN it,
                        it’s just so hard to get OUT of.

                                 RODNEY
                        Are you actually going to UCLA to
                        study Criminal Justice?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMY
                        Pfft. I haven’t even finished
                        studying for the SATs. I’ve got a
                        cousin in Hollywood who manages a
                        laundromat. She’s gonna let me stay
                        there until I can get on my feet.
                        Pretty pathetic, hunh?

           Rodney tries to say something, but the words won’t come out.

                                 AMY
                        And I know it doesn’t make sense,
                        but sometimes I look back at that
                        time and wonder how everything
                        would have been different if Dad
                        hadn’t gone on that business trip,
                        or hadn’t met that woman. I think
                        about the details of the day, and
                        what I could have done to change
                        the course of events. And--

           Amy stops herself; starts again, her mind changing
           direction.

           Rodney removes his hand from the gun.

                                 AMY
                        I remember in high school my math
                        teacher was explaining angles and
                        distances. And she told us to
                        imagine a massive comet, the size
                        of Texas, on a collision course
                        towards the moon. And as it
                        torpedoes through space, it hits
                        some tiny space rock which shifts
                        it’s course 1 degrees in the other
                        direction. And, y’know, 1 degrees
                        over the course of a mile won’t
                        make a big difference. But 1
                        degrees over the course of a
                        million miles makes it so that
                        instead of hitting the moon, it
                        hits California. Over time, a
                        little thing can make a big
                        difference.
                              (Little pause)
                        Y’know what I mean?

           Rodney looks at Amy with a pensive expression. Something
           about all of this has struck a chord with him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        Yeah, I do.

                                 AMY
                        Sorry, don’t listen to me. I’m
                        really high. I... never mind.

           Amy looks at Rodney, sensing something that isn’t there.
           Warming to him.

           In the distance, the sun begins to lower behind the
           mountains.

                                 AMY
                        If you still want to take a picture
                        of me... you can.

                                 RODNEY
                        We should get back to the car.

           Amy nods, disappointed.

                                 AMY
                        Okay.

           They stand and begin back up the hill.

           EXT. PYRAMID LAKE REST STOP - DUSK

           Rodney and Amy get back into the car.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT WHILE LATER

           The Datsun speeds down a long, moonlit stretch of highway.

           Amy stares out the window at the passing landscape while
           Rodney keeps his eyes glued to the road. Hands gripping the
           wheel.

           EXT. LAUNDROMAT, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           The Datsun pulls into a laundromat parking lot. Through the
           glass facade, we can see some customers folding clothes
           inside.

           Amy hops out, grabs Ginger and her bag. She leans in through
           the passenger’ side window.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMY
                        Well, thanks for the ride.

                                 RODNEY
                        Sure thing.

                                 AMY
                        If you ever want to talk, you know
                        where to find me.

           Rodney nods.

                                 AMY
                        See ya.

           Amy turns and heads into the laundromat where she’s greeted
           by a white woman-- presumably her COUSIN (30s).

           Rodney watches as they hug. Something about it seems to
           irritate him and he backs quietly out of the parking lot and
           drives away.

                                                          FLASH-FORWARD TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT

           The Security Guard and Laura continue down the corridor.
           They turn a corner and move through a door into...

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE

           The Security Guard gestures to a couch.

                                 SECURITY
                        Have a seat there and someone will
                        be with you in just a minute.

                                 LAURA
                        Who?

                                 SECURITY
                        George Bradshaw, the series
                        producer. He’ll be able to help
                        you.

           Laura nods, nervous but grateful.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you. Really.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        He’ll be here any minute.

           The Security Guard turns and leaves.

           Laura sits. She looks at the clock on the wall-- it reads
           3:50.

           She turns back and continues waiting patiently.

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO / STAGE

           Again, Ed takes his place before the cameras as Marilyn and
           Gretchen vacate the stage.

           Again, the First AD counts down:

                                 FIRST AD
                        Four... three... two...

           He points towards Ed.

                                 ED
                        Alright, welcome back to The Dating
                        Game. Sheryl, you played the game
                        beautifully, and now it’s time to
                        make a decision. The bachelors were
                        cool, candid and sharp, but only
                        one of them gets the date. So will
                        it be Bachelor #1, Bachelor #2 or
                        Bachelor #3? Who is the lucky
                        fellow?

           Sheryl looks out into the audience, her eyes drifting over
           to the Laura’s empty chair. Something about her absence
           feels ominous.

                                 SHERYL
                        Um...

                                 ED
                        Yes?

           On the other side of the partition, Rodney leans forward,
           listening expectantly.

           Sheryl looks off stage towards Marilyn and Gretchen.
           Gretchen is smiling and holding up three fingers.

           Sheryl looks back at Ed.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ED
                        Number three!

           The lights flash and spin and the audience cheers.

           Rodney leans back in his chair and laughs.

           Bachelor #1 and Arnie clap politely.

                                 ED
                        Do you mind if I ask what it was,
                        what about Bachelor #3 appealed to
                        you?

                                 SHERYL
                        He knows what girls are for.

           The audience laughs.

                                 ED
                        Very good. Alright, well before you
                        meet Bachelor #3, I want to
                        introduce you to the gentlemen who
                        you did not choose. Bachelor #1 is
                        from Sherman Oaks. He’s a medical
                        intern and plans on having a
                        private practice. His hobbies
                        include reading, golf and duplicate
                        bridge. Sheryl, meet Josh Young.

           Bachelor #1 (Josh) steps out from behind the partition and
           crosses to Sheryl. He smiles politely and shakes her hand.

                                 SHERYL
                        Hello. Nice to meet you.

                                 JOSH
                        Thank you. You too.

           Ed shakes Josh’s hand and gestures for him to stand on the
           other side of him.

                                 ED
                        Thanks Josh. Marvelous job.

           Josh takes his place.

                                 ED
                        Sheryl, you also did not pick
                        Bachelor #2. He is a furniture

                        Frisbee and dancing. Sheryl, please
                        meet Arnie Aslan.

           Arnie steps out from behind the partition and crosses to
           Sheryl. Sheryl forces a smile and goes to shake his hand.

                                 SHERYL
                        Hi. Nice to meet you--

           But Arnie isn’t smiling. As he takes her hand, Arnie leans
           in and whispers into Sheryl’s ear.

                                 ARNIE
                        Be careful. He’s dangerous.

           Arnie steps back and gives Sheryl a look that says he’s
           serious.

           Sheryl struggles to maintain her smile.

                                 ED
                        Very nice. Well done Arnie.

           Arnie steps over next to Josh.

                                 ED
                        Gentlemen, thank you both for
                        joining us. I hope you can come
                        back again. We’ve got some nice
                        gifts for you, just head out that
                        way.

           Ed shakes both of their hands one more time and Josh and
           Arnie exit the stage.

           Rodney sits on the other side of the partition, waiting
           eagerly. Turning the earring over in one hand.

           Sheryl looks towards the partition, smiling but clearly
           nervous.

                                 ED
                        And now Sheryl, it’s time for you
                        to come face-to-face with the man
                        that you’ve chosen. But first I
                        want to tell you a little bit about
                        him. Bachelor #3 is a skydiver,
                        he’s into motorcycling. He’s also a
                        fine photographer. Say hello to
                        Rodney Alcala!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Rodney slips the earring back into his pocket as he hops out
           of the chair.

           Sheryl sees Rodney as he rounds the partition. He’s good
           looking but also, somehow, threatening.

           Rodney crosses to her quickly as the audience applauds--
           goes in for a kiss before she can protest. He whispers in
           her ear.

                                 RODNEY
                        Smart choice.

           When he steps back, Rodney already has one hand around her
           waist, and the other one holding her hand.

                                 ED
                        Well, Rod, you did it. You offered
                        some great answers to some very
                        tricky questions and now you’ve got
                        the girl.

                                 RODNEY
                        Thanks Ed.

                                 ED
                        You know, some people spend their
                        entire life trying to find the
                        perfect spot to fall in love, but
                        we here on The Dating Game think
                        we’ve found it. Grab your bags and
                        get ready, because you will both be
                        flying away to Carmel, California!

           As Ed continues to babble on about the beaches and
           resturants of Carmel, Sheryl looks down and notices that
           Rodney is tracing little circles on the top of her hand with
           his thumb.

           Sheryl looks up at Rodney.

           He peers down at her and smiles. Something about his grin is
           unsettling.

           As Sheryl holds his stare the sound of Ed and the audience
           fades into a distant hum.
           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - SAME

           Laura continues to sit patiently, waiting for someone to
           enter.

           After a moment, the door opens and an elderly CUSTODIAN
           (60s) steps in, dragging a vacuum cleaner behind him.

           Laura looks over expectantly, then sighs when she realizes
           that this clearly isn’t a producer.

           She looks back at the clock on the wall: 4:00.

           Outside, someone passes by the doorway LAUGHING. Laura looks
           after them, but can’t see who it is.

           The custodian plugs in his vacuum and gets to work on the
           carpets.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Its moments after the show has ended. Members of the crew
           swarm around backstage.

           As Sheryl moves upstream through the flow of people:

                                 SHERYL
                        Which way to the dressing room?

                                 ED’S ASSISTANT
                        Right through there and around the
                        corner.

           Suddenly, Rodney steps up beside Sheryl.

                                 RODNEY
                        There you are. You disappeared on
                        me.
                              (To Lisa)
                        Could you give us a few minutes?

                                 ED’S ASSISTANT
                        The next show starts loading in
                        five. Be out by then.

                                 SHERYL
                        Oh, you don’t have to--

                                 RODNEY
                        Cool. Thanks.

           But it’s too late. Ed’s Assistant is gone.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        Hey. I’m Rodney.

           Sheryl forces a chuckle. Shakes his hand.

                                 RODNEY
                        Figured I should introduce myself
                        again now that the cameras are off.

                                 SHERYL
                        Sheryl.

                                 RODNEY
                        So, pretty exciting, hunh?

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah. Very.

                                 RODNEY
                        Did they tell you when the trip’s
                        scheduled for?

                                 SHERYL
                        I think we need to our submit
                        availabilities to Lisa.

                                 RODNEY
                        Ever been to Carmel?

                                 SHERYL
                        No. You?

                                 RODNEY
                        Yeah. They announce it like they’re
                        flying you Costa Rica, but it’s
                        like a six hour drive up the coast.
                        Fucking cheapskates.

                                 SHERYL
                        Heh. Yeah.

                                 RODNEY
                        Whatever. I’m sure we’ll find a way
                        to entertain ourselves.

           Rodney reaches out and takes Sheryl’s arm. Strokes it.

                                 SHERYL
                        I should probably get going. I’ve
                        got a, uh, rehearsal later tonight.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        I’ll see you soon, Sheryl.

                                 SHERYL
                        Yeah. I’ll see you.

           Sheryl turns and heads towards the dressing room.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl steps into the dressing room. Marilyn and Gretchen
           applaud as she enters.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Look who’s got a hot date Friday
                        night!

                                 MARILYN
                        Are you excited?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        She’s so excited! I told you she’d
                        got for number three.

           Sheryl forces a smile.

                                 MARILYN
                        C’mon, let’s get that make-up off
                        you.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - SAME

           The custodian finishes vaccuming the floors. When he’s done
           be begins to coil up the power cord.

           Laura looks at the clock on the wall. It’s now 4:10.

                                 LAURA
                        Excuse me?

           The custodian looks up.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but
                        I’m supposed to meet with someone
                        named George Bradshaw. He’s a
                        producer.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        What the hell are you talking
                        about?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LAURA
                        Do you have any idea where his
                        office is, or how I could--

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Who’d you say you were waiting for?

                                 LAURA
                        George Bradshaw. He’s an executive
                        producer on The Dating Game.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        No he aint.

                                 LAURA
                        Or a series producer. I don’t know
                        what his exact title is--

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        That aint it either.

                                 LAURA
                        Would you just listen to me! It’s
                        very important that I speak with
                        him.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        I doubt that very much.

                                 LAURA
                        Why? Why is that so fucking
                        impossible to believe?

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Because I’m George Bradshaw.

           Laura’s face drops. In an instant, she realizes that she’s
           been duped.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

           The Custodian lights a cigarette and takes a drag.

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        Lemme guess: The security guard out
                        front set this up? Yeah, he’s an
                        asshole alright.

           Laura starts to say something else, then stops. She looks
           torn between embarrassment and heartbreak.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CUSTODIAN
                        I mean, if there’s something you
                        want me to do, I’m happy to try--

           Then, finally:

                                 LAURA
                        Excuse me.

           Laura crosses to the door and leaves. George watches her go,
           then continues coiling up the power cord.

           INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheryl moves down the corridor, dressed in her own clothes
           again. Finally, Sheryl finds who she’s looking for...

                                 SHERYL
                        Lisa.

                                 LISA
                        Hey, congratulations!

                              (Forcing enthusiasm)
                        Yeah, no, it was, uh...
                              (Can’t do it)
                        Hey, I’m sorry, but could I ask you
                        something?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah, what is it?

                                 SHERYL
                        This is kind of a strange question,
                        but: What happens if I don’t
                        actually want to go on the date?

           Little pause.

           Sheryl looks nervous.

                                 LISA
                              (Shrugs)
                        Then you don’t go on the date.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        It’s just that simple?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah. What, you think we’re gonna
                        make you?

                                 SHERYL
                              (Chuckles)
                        I don’t know. I just--

                                 LISA
                        Did he say something?

                                 SHERYL
                        No, he didn’t... I just got kind of
                        a creepy vibe from him.
                              (little pause)
                        He makes me a little uncomfortable.

                                 LISA
                        I’ll call him tomorrow.

                        "Go Lady Lions."

           Sheryl smiles gratefully. Turns and heads out the exit.

           INT. RODNEY’S BEDROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

           Rodney stands in his bedroom with several dozen photographs
           spread out across the floor.

           After a moment, he crouches down and picks up a few of the
           pictures. Flips through them.

           Then stops. Drops the photos.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Rodney cuts up the photographs, one-by-one, with a pair of
           scissors and stuffs them inside a large black garbage bag.
           EXT. ALCALA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney carries the black trash bag out to a garbage bin at
           the end of the driveway. Stuffs the bag inside.

           In the distance we can hear the sound of children playing.
           Maybe a boy rides by on a bicycle.

           Rodney starts to turn to go back inside... then stops, as if
           remembering something.

           Rodney reaches into his pants pocket and removes the
           EARRING. He puts it in the garbage can, sets the lid on top
           and heads back inside.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney stands in the shower, washing himself off.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney steps into his bedroom with a towel wrapped around
           his waist. Drops it and slips into some pants.

           Suddenly, in the other room, the phone rings. Rodney’s
           mother answers it:

                                 MOTHER (OS)
                        Hello?
                              (Little pause)
                        Just a sec.
                              (Calls out)
                        Rodney, you’ve got a phone call!

           Rodney throws on a shirt.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney steps into the living room, looking nervous, like he
           expects it to be a call from the police.

           His mother hands him the phone and leaves.

                                 RODNEY
                        Hello?

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Mr. Alcala?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        Yeah.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Hi, this is Lisa Weissmeuller from
                        The Dating Game. How are you doing
                        today?

                                 RODNEY
                        Um, fine?

                                 LISA (OS)
                        That’s great. So look, I’m afraid
                        that I’m calling with some
                        unfortunate news. Our office just
                        received a call from Sheryl Lee,
                        your bachelorette.

                                 RODNEY
                        Oh?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah. It turns out that she won’t
                        be able to attend the date after
                        all.

                                 RODNEY
                        What?

                                 LISA (OS)
                        She’s very sorry to have to cancel
                        on such short notice, but a family
                        emergency has called her back east.

                                 RODNEY
                        Fine, so let’s reschedule it.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Unfortunately she won’t be able to
                        do that either. With that said,
                        your flight vouchers are still
                        active so if you have somebody else
                        that you’d like to go with--

                                 RODNEY
                        Wait, no, hold on. Just shut up for
                        a second. What are you--? What’s
                        going on?

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Mr. Alcala?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RODNEY
                        I won. I won the game. She asked
                        the questions and I answered, and
                        so we’re going on a date. Those are
                        the fucking rules.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        I’m very sorry if you’re upset
                        but--

                                 RODNEY
                        Give me her phone number, I want to
                        call her.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        I don’t have it.

                                 RODNEY
                        You’re lying.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Yep.

                                 RODNEY
                        You’re a cunt. If I ever see you on
                        the street, I’ll bash your fucking
                        head in.

           Lisa goes silent for a moment.

                                 LISA (OS)
                        Yeah. ‘Can’t imagine why she turned
                        you down. Fucking freak.

           Rodney looks like he’s about to say something, but then
           there’s a CLICK and the line goes dead.

           Rodney stands there, eyes filled with humiliation and hate.
           Slowly, he sets the phone back on the cradle.

                                 MOTHER (OS)
                        Rodney? Everything okay?

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rodney slips into a DRESS SHIRT...

                                                                    CUT TO:

           ...laces up his boots..

           ...cleans off a lock-blade KNIFE, then slips it in his back
           pocket.

           EXT. DATSUN - NIGHT

           The Datsun drives along the highway at night.

           We see distant hills, low and black and dotted with the
           houselights.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

           Amy is mopping up the floors as the last CUSTOMER packs up
           her things to leave.

           Ginger is laying on a dog bed behind the counter.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Buenas noches. Te veo mañana.

                                 AMY
                        Si. Que tengas una buena noche.

           Amy walks the woman to the door, closes it behind her and
           locks it. She shuts off the overhead lights.

           She crosses to the counter, loads the last of the folded
           laundry into a plastic bag and sets it aside.

           When she’s done, she grabs an IN-N-OUT bag off the counter
           and whistles for Ginger.

                                 AMY
                        C’mon girl.

           Ginger stands and follows Amy to a door at the back of the
           room. Amy opens it...

           INT. AMY’S ROOM

           Inside is a utility closet that has been turned into a very
           small living space. There’s a twin bed and a small dresser.
           Beside the bed is an overturned milk crate with a lamp and a
           little radio on it.

           Tacked to the wall beside the bed is the picture of Amy and
           her mom.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Amy snaps on the lamp and the radio, and plunks herself on
           the bed. She opens up her SAT GUIDE. Continues studying.

           As music plays, she digs out the burger and begins chowing
           down, stopping every so often to feed Ginger a French fry.

           Suddenly, there’s a KNOCK on the front door.

           Amy puts down her food and goes to her bedroom door. Looks
           out.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT

           She sees Rodney standing at the front door, his camera
           hanging around his neck. He gives her little wave.

           Amy grins and crosses to the door. Opens it a crack.

                                 RODNEY
                        Hi.

                                 AMY
                        Hi.

                                 RODNEY
                        Can I still take your picture?

           EXT. LAUNDROMAT - CON’T

           Amy chuckles and holds the door open for him.

           Rodney steps inside and Amy closes the door behind him.
           Locks it.

           Together, they cross back to Amy’s little bedroom in the
           utility closet.

                                                                 TO BLACK.

           Silence. The post-script appears on screen:

           Sheryl Lee-Ellis eventually moved back to Pennsylvania where
           she continues to perform in regional theater. She has never
           spoken publicly about her experiences with Rodney Alcala on
           The Dating Game.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           In 1979, Rodney Alcala murdered a 12 y.o. on her way to
           ballet class, as well as at least two other women. It was
           among his bloodiest killing sprees to date.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Police eventually raided his apartment and found a receipt
           for the storage locker in Seattle. The police were able to
           arrest him based on evidence found there.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           While Alcala has been in jail ever since, his list of murder
           victims continues to grow. Some authorities now estimate the
           actual number to be as high as 130.

           These words fade. Replaced by:

           In 2010, Alcala was tried for five murders based on new DNA
           evidence. He was convicted and sentenced to death. He is
           currently on Death Row in San Quentin Prison.

                                 THE END
