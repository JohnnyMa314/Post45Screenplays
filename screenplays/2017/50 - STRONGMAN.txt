              Based on the confusing, sometimes offensive, borderline-insane 
                memories of David Prowse, the irascible Englishman behind         
                                  Darth Vader's mask

           OVER BLACK--

           A hushed BRITISH VOICE, raspy with age:

                                 OLD MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Today I am a shadow of my former 
                        self...

           INT. 1970S HOUSE - DAY

           In breathtaking SLO-MO:

           A HULKING BEEFCAKE OF A MAN (30s, six-foot-seven) descends a 
           staircase, cradling the actor MALCOLM MCDOWELL (20s) in his 
           arms--

                                 OLD MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                        ...I can barely walk... and 
                        struggle to even remember what I 
                        did yesterday...

           Beefcake’s muscles BULGE under his skin-tight tank top and 
           TINY RED SHORTS--

           --his rock-hard BUTT CHEEKS rippling with each step-- 

           --his TREE-TRUNK LEGS gliding with surprising grace.

           At the bottom of the stairs, he gently sets Malcolm down in a 
           chair--

           --then stands to his full height, towering over the actor’s 
           crumpled form.

           A GREEK GOD, his body chiseled to perfection.

           This is DAVE PROWSE.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Cut!

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           STANLEY KUBRICK (40s) in his director’s chair. We’re on the 
           set of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971.

           Kubrick lumbers over, pats Dave on the back:

                                 KUBRICK
                        Dave. What can I say? You’re 
                        goddamn brilliant! That was some 
                        pure Laurence Olivier shit. 
           Dave BEAMS as the entire CAST AND CREW look on him with 
           admiration and respect.

                                 DAVE
                             (British accent)
                        It's all in the walk, Stanley. 

           CUTE EXTRA GIRLS hover nearby, hanging on Dave's every word. 

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Ask any great actor and they'll 
                        tell you: the window into a 
                        character's soul is through his 
                        walk.

           Kubrick's mind is blown:

                                 KUBRICK
                        Fuckin' genius. Ok my friend, next 
                        we’re gonna get you carrying Magee 
                        in the wheelchair, down the stairs, 
                        over to the table, then we’ll grab 
                        the whole dialogue scene. All one 
                        shot. 

           Dave thinks for a moment, then:

                                 DAVE
                             (matter of fact)
                        No.

                                 KUBRICK
                        What?

                                 DAVE
                        That’s not going to work for me.

                                 KUBRICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 DAVE
                        Well, it's not that I can't do it, 
                        it's more that I don't feel like 
                        doing it fifty times in a row. 

           Dave grins playfully, nudges Stanley in the ribs:

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, you’re not exactly known as 
                        “One Take Kubrick,” are you? 

           A hush falls over the set. 

           No one speaks to Stanley Kubrick that way. 
           A tense beat passes... as Kubrick narrows his eyes at Dave... 

           ...then bursts into a hearty CHORTLE, breaking the tension.

           Everyone laughs along with him, relieved.

                                 KUBRICK
                        Ok everyone, you heard Mr. Prowse, 
                        let’s try to get this in one! 

           The crew hustles to prep for the next shot, as Kubrick leans 
           in close to Dave and whispers:

                                 KUBRICK
                        Thanks for being here Dave, you're 
                        really elevating this shit-heap.

           Kubrick gives him a big bear-hug, then skips back to his 
           director's chair.

           Dave smiles victoriously as we PUSH IN on his face...

                                 KUBRICK (O.S.)
                        Hey, what’s big fucker’s name 
                        again?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Um... Dave. Dave Prowse.

                                 KUBRICK (O.S.)
                        Hey Dave!
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Prowse!

           STILL ON Dave’s face, brimming with confidence...

                                 KUBRICK (O.S.)
                        Is he a fucking idiot? 
                             (beat)
                        Dave, your director is talking to 
                        you, you gargantuan fuck!!!

           Dave SNAPS OUT OF HIS DAYDREAM, BACK TO REALITY. 

           He glances around the room: 

           The fawning extra girls have vanished. Cast and crew bustle 
           about, ignoring him. 

           The place feels drab and lifeless; Dave's crappy reality a 
           stark contrast to the fanciful dream we just witnessed.

           Kubrick suddenly stands before him, GLOWERING.
                                 DAVE
                        Uh, sorry sir... I--

                                 KUBRICK
                        Shut the fuck up for two seconds 
                        and listen to me. So we’ll get you 
                        carrying Magee in the wheelchair. 
                        Then sitting at the table.

                                 DAVE
                        Yes, of course.

                                 KUBRICK
                             (like he’s talking to a 
                              child)
                        Carry... then sit. Got it?

           Dave nods. Kubrick’s not convinced.

                                 KUBRICK
                        Carry... then sit. Say it back to 
                        me.

                                 DAVE
                        Carry. Then sit.

           Kubrick nods sharply. Dave scurries up the stairs.

                                 KUBRICK
                             (to himself)
                        Fuckin’ oaf.

                                 INTERVIEWER (PRE-LAP)
                        And what did Kubrick say to that?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MODEST ENGLISH HOME - LIVING ROOM - PRESENT DAY

           OLD DAVE PROWSE (80s) sits in a tattered upholstered chair, 
           staring off into space, lost in a distant memory...

           THICK GRAY HAIR frames his deeply-creased face: years of 
           resentment and regret have taken their toll. 

           His LEFT EYE stares straight ahead, while his RIGHT EYE 
           perpetually droops towards the floor, making it nearly 
           impossible to tell where he's looking. 

           The effect is a little unsettling.

           An INTERVIEWER (20s, bearded, corduroy blazer) sits across 
           from him, waiting for a response...
                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        Was he angry when you called him 
                        "One Take Kubrick"?

           Dave remains silent, lost in his own little world...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Mr. Prowse?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        What? Oh. Yes, well. Standing up to 
                        Stanley like that, in front of 
                        everyone... I think they all 
                        respected me more from then on, 
                        including Stanley himself. 
                             (beat)
                        In fact, I think that was the 
                        moment people started seeing me as 
                        more than just a strongman... 

           Dave gazes back off into space, receding into his memories...

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        ...and finally started taking me 
                        seriously as an actor--

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                  TITLE CARD: “STRONGMAN”

           OVER BLACK-- the faintest hint of SLOW RHYTHMIC BREATHING, 
           almost mechanical...

           INT. MODEST ENGLISH HOME - LIVING ROOM - PRESENT DAY

           An ORNATELY-FRAMED PHOTO hangs on the wall: 

           Dave, in his 40s, dressed as DARTH VADER, without the mask. A 
           scribbled AUTOGRAPH reads: "Dave Prowse IS Darth Vader."

           A FEW CREW MEMBERS mill about the room, adjusting lights, 
           setting up a VIDEO CAMERA.

           Old Dave slouches in his chair, eyeing the interviewer, who 
           shuffles through a sheaf of notes.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Thanks again for agreeing to sit 
                        down with us, Mr. Prowse.

           Dave nods, offers an amiable smile:
                                 OLD DAVE
                        And this'll be on TV?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        That's the plan, yep.

           The interviewer looks to the CAMERA MAN, who gives a thumbs 
           up: "rolling."

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        So. Mr. Prowse. You know what we’re 
                        here to discuss... shall we get 
                        right to it?

           Dave’s smile fades ever-so-slightly.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Right out of the gate, eh?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Why do you think you were banned?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I really don't understand people's 
                        fixation with--

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I’ve seen your other interviews, 
                        I’ve read your book... I just want 
                        to hear your side of the story. 
                        Straight from you. 
                             (beat)
                        Do you think it was the Daily Mail 
                        leak?

           Dave chuckles ruefully. 

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Well that’s just the million dollar 
                        question, isn’t it? Truthfully? 
                        I've no bloody idea. You’d have to 
                        ask George.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I’d just like to hear your side of 
                        things.

           Dave's expression suddenly hardens, a fury bubbling from deep 
           within:
                                 OLD DAVE
                        You know, I have an entire career, 
                        apart from all of that, an entire-- 
                        illustrious career, that, if you 
                        looked into it, I’m sure you would 
                        find some of the things I’ve done, 
                        some of my accomplishments are 
                        actually quite interesting. 

           Dave's clutching the armrests of his chair now. A little too 
           hard. His eyes dart around the room... searching for 
           something...

           The interviewer and crew stare silently... not sure what to 
           do... the air ripe with tension...

           Dave's eyes suddenly land on his CANE, propped against a wall 
           ACROSS THE ROOM... 

           ...he slowly reaches a trembling hand out... furrows his 
           brow... concentrating deeply...

           The interviewer and crew look on, perplexed...

           ...as the CANE gently rattles against the wall... then: 

           WHOOSH!

           It suddenly ROCKETS through the air, SLAPPING into Dave's 
           outstretched palm. 

           But the interviewer and crew don't seem to notice.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Excuse me for a moment.

           He staggers out of his chair, steadying himself with the 
           cane, then shuffles out of the room.

                                 SOUND GUY
                        Well this dude's obviously insane.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        He's just a little eccentric.

                                 SOUND GUY
                        You don't get the feeling we're 
                        maybe wasting our time here?

           The interviewer looks over his shoulder, making sure Dave is 
           still out of earshot.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        We just have to take it slow. He's 
                        a bit sensitive, clearly, but if we 
                        get him to confess to the leak, 
                        everyone's gonna be begging for 
                        this footage...

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dave shuffles into the bathroom, still trembling. He POPS 
           open the medicine cabinet, snatches a PILL BOTTLE. 

           He stares at his weathered face in the mirror for a long 
           moment...

           ...as we slowly become aware of a HEAVY BREATHING coming from 
           somewhere in the room... getting louder and louder...

           Dave suddenly hears it. His face goes pale...

           He slowly pivots around: It's coming from behind the SHOWER 
           CURTAIN.

           He reaches a tentative hand out...

           ...then RIPS the curtain back: 

           Nothing. Just a grimy bathtub.

           He shakes a pill into his hand. GULPS it down--

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave eases back into his chair, no longer trembling.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Everything ok?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Fine. Just fine.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Lovely. So, Dave, we were talking 
                        about--

           Dave's suddenly all business:

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Look. If we’re going to talk about 
                        that... you’re going to get it in 
                        full bloody context. 
           The interviewer nods cautiously.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Alright...

                                 OLD DAVE
                        We’ll start at the beginning...
                             (clears his throat)
                        I was a lad of four when my father 
                        died--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - 1939

           LITTLE DAVE PROWSE (4) sobs uncontrollably as a COFFIN is 
           lowered into the ground. He turns away, buries his face in 
           his MOTHER’S skirt--

                                 INTERVIEWER (PRE-LAP)
                        Mr. Prowse?

                                                                BACK TO:

           PRESENT DAY

           The interviewer looks puzzled.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Do we really need to start that far 
                        back--

                                 OLD DAVE
                        This is the deal. Whole story or no 
                        story.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I'm just not sure it's relevant--

           Dave shoots him a searing glare... 

           ...but it quickly loses its edge when his droopy eye starts 
           drifting towards the floor...

           The interviewer softens, offers a sympathetic nod.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Right, of course... in your own 
                        time.
                                 OLD DAVE
                        As I was saying, growing up without 
                        a dad in those days was hard. 
                        ‘cause kids were a lot meaner back 
                        then, loads meaner--

                                 BOY'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        Little Davie No-Dad!

           EXT. BRISTOL, ENGLAND - DAY - 1940S

           LITTLE DAVE PROWSE (now 12, gangly beanpole) sprints through 
           a back alley in BRISTOL, pursued by THREE OLDER BULLIES. 

           The LEADER wears a NEWSBOY CAP, CHANTING as he runs:

                                 NEWSBOY CAP (CONT’D)
                        Little Davie No-Dad! 
                        Little Davie No-Dad!

           Little Dave LEAPS over a fence, lands HARD on the other side.

           POP!!!

           His KNEE suddenly gives out and he COLLAPSES to the ground.

           The three bullies BOUND over the fence and find him clutching 
           his knee, wincing in pain.

                                 NEWSBOY CAP
                        Oi. What happened Little Davie?

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        My knee-- It really hurts--

           The bullies circle him as he grits his teeth, fighting back 
           tears...

                                 LEAD BULLY
                        Oh, I’m sorry Davie...

           BAM!!! In a flash, Newsboy Cap KICKS HIM RIGHT IN THE KNEE, 
           as hard as he can--

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           THWAP!!! A DOCTOR slams an X-ray of Little Dave’s knee 
           against an illuminated wall. 
                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        I suppose getting the shite kicked 
                        out me was actually quite a stroke 
                        of luck, as we soon discovered--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Little Davie here has 
                        Tuberculosis... of the knee!

           Little Dave and his MOM (40s) GASP.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        I was in hospital for a year after 
                        that, confined to bed, with my leg 
                        up...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Little Dave lies in bed, wearing a sort of MEDIEVAL LEG IRON. 
           It looks pretty painful.

           In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

           He gazes wistfully out the window... as life passes him by... 
           children play happily outside... but Little Dave has been 
           completely forgotten by the world... a ghost.

           He TAPS on the window, trying to get the attention of some 
           nearby KIDS. But they ignore him. 

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        A year later, I had grown six 
                        inches, just lying there in bed...

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           The DOCTOR measures LITTLE DAVE’S height against the wall, 
           startled by the result:

                                 DOCTOR
                        Dear God. You’re a bloody giant!

           Little (well, not so little anymore) Dave hobbles over to a 
           chair, wincing through pain.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You'll have to stay off it for a 
                        while, no heavy lifting, otherwise 
                        it'll come back to haunt you when 
                        you're older.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        In the meantime, I recommend taking 
                        up swimming--

           INT. PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Dave stands on the edge of a diving board, staring down at 
           the CRYSTAL BLUE WATER, working up his courage.

           Across the pool, he spots the THREE BULLIES bumbling through 
           the front doors.

           Bollocks.

           He closes his eyes, and leaps--

           SPLASH!!!!!! 

           He CRASHES into the water, SINKING like a brick, FLAILING 
           pathetically before THUDDING to the--

           BOTTOM

           Where he just sits. Sad and alone...

                                 NEWSBOY CAP (O.S.)
                             (garbled)
                        Drowny Davie No-Dad! 
                        Drowny Davie No-Dad!

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        I didn’t much care for swimming. So 
                        I chucked it in, found a sport that 
                        was far more to my liking.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Dave (now 14, taller, but still scrawny) hobbles down the 
           street, forlorn and lost... 

           ...when a magazine in a store window catches his eye:

           “Health and Strength: New Bodies for Skinny Men!”

           A GIANT BODYBUILDER graces the cover, his chiseled arms 
           flexed in a SUPERHERO POSE.

           Dave’s eyes LIGHT UP-- 
           INT. GYM - DAY

           Dave navigates through a thick crowd of CHEERING FANS, 
           catching glimpses of the HULKING OILY BODIES on stage.

           He pushes his way to the front, finally getting a full view:

           THREE BODYBUILDERS parade around, shifting between ridiculous 
           showy poses. 

           A giant banner reads: “Mr. Universe Regional Tryouts.”

           As they flex, the CROWD GOES WILD.

           ON DAVE-- taking in the crowd response. The adoration. The 
           attention... all eyes are riveted on these He-Men... 

           And something changes in his eyes: this could be the answer 
           he’s been looking for!

           The world is finally gonna notice Dave Prowse.

           And all it’s gonna take... is a montage:

           AN INSANE BARRAGE OF SHOTS--

           Dave pumps iron-- 

           --his BREATHING labored and erratic--

           --he loads more and more weight--

           --barbells. Squats. Anvils. Bunch of old-timey gym shit-- 

           --his BREATHING becomes more controlled as--

           --he admires his physique in the mirror... his muscles 
           growing... and growing--

           --transforming before our very eyes... now impossible to 
           ignore--

           --he SCARFS DOWN a bunch of hard-boiled eggs. Burps.

           We PUSH IN on his face as he lifts a MONSTROUS WEIGHT, pure 
           determination in his eyes... 

           His BREATHING now regular and rhythmic, OVERTAKING ALL 
           SOUND... 

           In fact, there’s something eerily familiar about it...

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           DAVE, now in his 20s and a muscly chunk of prime beefcake, 
           swaggers out of the gym.

           Up ahead, he notices some familiar faces: 

           The three bullies from his youth, all grown up. The leader 
           still wearing his trademark newsboy cap.

                                 NEWSBOY CAP
                        Oi, little Davie. Wow! Guess it’s 
                        big Davie now, lookin’ good mate--

           Dave suddenly UPPERCUTS the guy--

           --and his head goes flying off. 

           It sails through the air cartoonishly, bounces off a curb, 
           then lands in a garbage can with a loud DING!

           The other two bullies stare at Dave, wide-eyed, terrified.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Wait, what?

           PRESENT DAY

           The interviewer perks up, rubbing his bleary eyes, like he 
           was on the verge of falling asleep.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        You punched his head off?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Of course not, you twat. I saw you 
                        nodding off, I just wanted to make 
                        sure you were listening.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Oh, sorry, um, you were saying?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I didn’t punch his head off, but I 
                        did set him straight. He knew his 
                        days of bullying little Davie 
                        Prowse had come to an end--

           EXT. STREET - SAME AS BEFORE

           Dave notices the three bullies up ahead-- 
           --then DUCKS INTO AN ALLEY. The bullies stroll past, 
           oblivious.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        But then of course, I had to chuck 
                        in my dreams of being Mr. Universe 
                        after I found out my feet were too 
                        ugly.

                                 JUDGE (PRE-LAP)
                        Your feet are too ugly.

           INT. GYM - DAY

           A MR. UNIVERSE JUDGE stands before Dave (now 30s), who wears 
           a TINY SPEEDO, all tanned and oiled up.

           The judge points, and we WHIP DOWN to: 

           Dave’s gross-ass feet. Gnarled yellow toenails, throbbing red 
           blisters and waaaay too many toes.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PRESENT DAY

           ON THE INTERVIEWER-- disgusted. 

                                 OLD DAVE
                        If it wasn’t for my ghastly 
                        trotters, I would’ve very likely 
                        been Mr. Universe. 

           The interviewer notices a FRAMED PHOTO on the end table next 
           to Dave, an OLD BODYBUILDING SHOT. 

           He squints to get a better look--

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        But your feet look fine here.

           Without breaking eye contact, Dave slowly reaches for the 
           photo, then tips it face-down.

           An awkward beat lingers...

                                 OLD DAVE
                        But it was probably all for the 
                        best, as I soon found out that my 
                        real gift, my true calling in 
                        life... was acting.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Great, yeah, let’s talk about your 
                        films.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Well, some of your viewers may not 
                        know this, but I had quite an 
                        illustrious career well before I 
                        was cast as the ultimate screen 
                        villain of all time... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           DAVE’S “ACTING” CAREER MONTAGE

           --A series of STRONGMAN parts. Dave mostly just lifts things. 
           A boulder. A car. A person. Another boulder.

           --Followed by a series of MASKED parts: 

           --A MINOTAUR on an old episode of DR. WHO. He’s shirtless, 
           wearing a really fake-looking BULL HEAD. 

           --FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER, which looks nothing like the 
           classic movie version. Instead, his body is COVERED IN HAIR 
           and he wears a CREEPY LIFELESS MASK.

           --His face and voice are rarely seen or heard, until:

           THE GREEN CROSS CODE MAN. 

           Dave wears a silly green-and-white superhero costume in a 
           GRAINY TV COMMERCIAL. His FACE FULLY VISIBLE as he escorts 
           TWO CHILDREN across the street.

                                 GREEN CROSS CODE MAN
                        Remember! Stop, look, listen! 
                        Always use the green cross code, 
                        because I won’t be there when you 
                        cross the road!

           PRESENT DAY

           Dave smiles at the memory:

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I was the Green Cross Code Man for, 
                        oh, we did it for several years. 
                        Everybody knows me as the Green 
                        Cross Code Man--

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Old Dave shuffles down the sidewalk, carrying a grocery bag. 
           A GANG OF HOOLIGANS across the street spots him:

                                 HOOLIGAN
                        Oi, is it safe to cross now yeh 
                        feckin’ cunt?!

           Dave SPINS around, just as a SOCCER BALL SMACKS off his 
           forehead--

           --and the grocery bag SLIPS from his hands, SPILLING across 
           the sidewalk--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PRESENT DAY

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Then of course, there’s the big 
                        one, the reason you’re here. The 
                        reason I’m now considered the 
                        ultimate screen villain of all 
                        time.

           The interviewer perks up. Finally.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Great. So tell me about your first 
                        meeting with George... what was he 
                        like?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Well, he'd first seen me in A 
                        Clockwork Orange--

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 

           GEORGE (30s, poofy hair, manicured beard, big dorky glasses) 
           sits in the audience, LIGHT FLICKERING across his face.

           ONSCREEN-- Dave lumbers into frame, carrying Malcolm 
           McDowell. On the big screen, he looks like a COLOSSUS. 

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        At the audition, he seemed quite 
                        keen to impress me.

           George leans forward in his chair, awe-struck.
           PRESENT DAY

                                 OLD DAVE
                        He offered me two different parts, 
                        just like that. I opted for the 
                        villain, of course. People always 
                        remember the baddie...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FOX OFFICES, LONDON - DAY

           George sits behind a desk, flipping through HEADSHOTS.

                                 GEORGE
                        Next!

           Dave (now 40s) BURSTS through the door and George FLINCHES, 
           nearly falling out of his chair:

                                 GEORGE
                        Ahhhhhh!!!

           He quickly composes himself, then looks Dave up and down, 
           marveling at his TOWERING STATURE:

                                 GEORGE
                        You're perfect.

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER

           NORMA (30s, Dave’s plain-jane wife) and his kids, STEVEN, 
           JAMES and RACHEL (all under 10), eat dinner in silence. 

           Dave takes a bite of a HARD-BOILED EGG, chews it proudly.

                                 DAVE
                        You’re not going to ask me how it 
                        went?

                                 NORMA
                        How what went?

                                 DAVE
                        My audition. For “Space Wars.”

                                 NORMA
                             (flatly)
                        How’d it go?
                                 DAVE
                        You know, you could at least 
                        pretend like you’re interested once 
                        in--

                                 NORMA
                        Well I'm tired of pretending, Dave. 
                        You're a 40-year-old man with a 
                        family, and it's getting--

           Norma catches herself before she gets too riled up, takes a 
           deep calming breath.

                                 NORMA (CONT’D)
                        I just think it’s time you stopped 
                        chasing these silly parts and found 
                        something consistent.

           Dave looks hurt.

                                 DAVE
                        Like what?

                                 NORMA
                        I don't know... insurance, maybe? 
                        My uncle said he could--

                                 DAVE
                        Insurance? You've got to be joking.

                                 NORMA
                        What's so funny about having a 
                        steady job?

                                 DAVE
                        You know what Norma, you can tell 
                        your uncle to shove his insurance 
                        job up his arse--

                                 NORMA
                        David!

           Norma glances at the kids, but they continue to munch away, 
           oblivious.

                                 DAVE
                        --'cause I got the part... and it’s 
                        a big one this time. Loads of 
                        lines-- people are finally going to 
                        see my acting. 

           Little Rachel perks up at the word.
                                 NORMA
                        Didn't you have lines in Clockwork 
                        Orange?

                                 DAVE
                        Yes but-- That was-- I was just 
                        carrying people around, this is 
                        different. I'm the main villain in 
                        this.

           Norma smirks.

                                 NORMA
                        Congratulations. Will you be 
                        shirtless?

           Dave pokes at his food with his fork.

                                 DAVE
                        No...

                                 NORMA
                        Another monster then?

                                 DAVE
                        Not a monster, Norma. A man. The 
                        most powerful man in the galaxy.

           Norma relents, tired of having this same old argument.

                                 NORMA
                        We'll discuss this later.

                                 DAVE
                        Discuss what?

           Dave STABS another hard-boiled egg with his fork--

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        There's nothing to discuss.

           INT. THE KIDS' ROOM - NIGHT

           Dave tucks the boys into bed, then kneels down next to Rachel 
           (8), and pulls the covers up to her chin.

                                 RACHEL
                        Daddy, what's acting?

           Dave smiles at the question.
                                 DAVE
                        Acting is... a noble calling. And 
                        great actors are beloved by all. 
                        Without them, the world would be... 
                        boring and dull.
                             (whispers)
                        Like your brothers.

           Rachel giggles.

                                 DAVE
                        Why do you ask, darling?

                                 RACHEL
                        Acting is what you do?

                                 DAVE
                        It is. Your daddy is an actor.

           Rachel thinks long and hard for a moment, then announces:

                                 RACHEL
                        When I grow up, I want to be an 
                        actor like you.

           Dave suddenly TEARS UP, caught off-guard by this touching 
           sentiment.

                                 DAVE
                        And I'm sure you will be.

           He wipes a tear from his cheek--

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight my little munchkin.

           --then carefully brushes the hair off Rachel's forehead. 

           It feels like something he's done a thousand times before, a 
           special fatherly ritual...

           INT. DAVE AND NORMA'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Norma sits in bed, while Dave paces around, worked up.

                                 DAVE
                        Is that all you want out of life, 
                        Norma? Raise kids, work a regular 
                        job, grow old, retire?
                                 NORMA
                        You know, that actually sounds 
                        quite lovely to me, and most 
                        people--

                                 DAVE
                        I'm not most people, Norma. I've 
                        got a chance to do something big 
                        here, something that would be good 
                        for both of us, and you--

                                 NORMA
                        Every single role you've had, you 
                        said it would be "big", you said it 
                        would change everything, you said 
                        there'd be more money, more 
                        financial security--

                                 DAVE
                        Well this one's going to be 
                        different!

                                 NORMA
                        How exactly?

           A long silence. 

                                 DAVE
                        I don't know. It just is.

           Norma looks deep into his eyes: she can see how badly he 
           wants this. 

                                 NORMA
                        Fine. 

           Dave lights up--

                                 NORMA (CONT’D)
                        But if this doesn't work out, you 
                        need to promise me you'll look for 
                        a real job.

                                 DAVE
                        Well, it is going to work, so--

                                 NORMA
                        David. Just promise me... I'm not 
                        sure I can take much more of 
                        this...

           Dave narrows his eyes, reading the thinly veiled threat...
                                 DAVE
                        Ok. I promise.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON-- Dave's NAKED TORSO as a VISCOUS GRAY LIQUID pours 
           over him, tracing every contour of his WELL-SCULPTED PECS AND 
           ABS... oozing over every inch of his flesh... the first step 
           in creating a full cast of his body...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        At the start, George and I got on 
                        great. I was early to set every 
                        day, even when I wasn’t called. But 
                        it seemed as if some of the others 
                        had it in for me right out of the 
                        gate...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY - 1976

           The CRACK of a SLATE coming down in front of a bulky camera. 

           Dave leans against a PROP ROBOT, taking in all the sets, 
           props and cameras with childlike wonder. 

           He watches as a scene is filmed: 

           SIR ALEC (60s, poised) sits across from MARK (20s, handsome) 
           in an adobe hut interior.  

                                 MARK
                        You fought in the Clone Wars?

                                 SIR ALEC
                        Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the 
                        same as your father. 

           Mark looks off into the distance dramatically. Acting.

                                 MARK
                        I wish I’d known him...

           Dave watches, silently absorbing it all, his own memories 
           stirring...

                                 MARK
                        How did my father die?

                                 SIR ALEC
                        A young Jedi named Darth Vader 
                        betrayed and murdered your father. 
           We PUSH IN on Dave’s face, rapt...

                                 SIR ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Vader was seduced by the dark side 
                        of the Force...

           CRASH! 

           Suddenly all eyes are on Dave as we PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           The PROP ROBOT he was leaning against has toppled over, 
           ruining the take.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Gal-darnit.

           Mark GLARES over at Dave as the crew descends into chatter, 
           resetting for a new take.

                                 DAVE
                        Uh, terribly sorry!

           George looks up from the camera, identifying Dave as the 
           source of the chaos. 

           Then whispers something to GARY (30s, fast-talking producer) 
           who zips over to Dave.

                                 GARY
                        Dave. Buddy. What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 DAVE
                        Oh, I thought I’d pop in and see if 
                        I could make myself useful.

                                 GARY
                        Why don’t you go introduce yourself 
                        to the rest of the cast? Or better 
                        yet, why don't you wait to come to 
                        set until you're actually called? 

                                 DAVE
                        Right. Of course. Apologies.

           Gary speeds off, as Dave attempts to hide his humiliation 
           under a smile--

                                 OLD DAVE (PRE-LAP)
                        So off I went looking for Carrie.
           PRESENT DAY 

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        We were old friends from her 
                        mother's program, The Debbie 
                        Reynolds Show. After I did my 
                        strongman routine, I'd stay back in 
                        the wings and listen when Carrie 
                        sang her big number. Voice of an 
                        angel, that one...

           Dave smiles to himself at the memory...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - HAIR AND MAKEUP - DAY

           Dave watches from behind a CLUSTER OF MANNEQUINS as: 

           CARRIE (19, feisty) sits in front of a mirror, getting her 
           hair braided by a HAIRDRESSER. 

           Her eyes are bloodshot, and her head keeps lolling to the 
           side, as if she's nodding off--

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Ms. Fisher, if you could just hold 
                        still--

                                 CARRIE
                             (half-asleep)
                        Mmhpphhh... why don't you hold 
                        still...

           Dave takes a deep breath, gathering his courage, then steps 
           out from behind the mannequins and strides over.

                                 DAVE
                        Excuse me... Ms. Fisher?

           Carrie's startled to see Dave suddenly LOOMING over her:

                                 CARRIE
                        Ahhhhh!!

           Carrie's scream startles Dave--

                                 DAVE
                        Ahhhhhhhhh!!!

           --which startles the hairdresser--

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
           --who reflexively YANKS on Carrie's braid, tangling a BRUSH 
           in her hair--

                                 CARRIE
                        Owwwww!!!!

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Sorry sorry sorry!!!

           The hairdresser frantically TUGS at the brush, trying to 
           extract it, but just ends up twisting it deeper into Carrie's 
           hair--

           --before finally PULLING it free.

                                 CARRIE
                        Goddammit!!!

           Leaving one half of Carrie's hair coiled in a TIGHT BUN.

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Hm. That's actually not bad.

           Carrie takes deep breaths, regains her composure.

                                 CARRIE
                        Jesus Christ dude, don't sneak up 
                        on people like that! 

                                 DAVE
                        Sorry, I-- You.. you don't remember 
                        me?

           Carrie stares at him blankly.

                                 DAVE
                        We met backstage on your mother's 
                        show?

                                 CARRIE
                        Oh riiight, you're... uh...

           She obviously has no clue who he is.

                                 DAVE
                        Dave! David Prowse--

                                 CARRIE
                        David Prowse, of course! Daaaaave! 
                        Davie-boy!

           She emits a high-pitched nervous laugh.
                                 DAVE
                        Yes! I'm playing the villain! Looks 
                        like we'll have some scenes 
                        together.

           Carrie fake-smiles:

                                 CARRIE
                        That's great!

           Dave looks her up and down:

                                 DAVE
                        My, my... you've really blossomed 
                        into your-- I mean-- grown up, 
                        you've really grown up.

                                 CARRIE
                        Wow dude, that's not creepy at all. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What's up bitches?!

           HARRISON (30s, super-stud) suddenly BURSTS into the room 
           wielding his PROP BLASTER.

                                 HARRISON
                        Pew pew pew!!! You're all dead.

           ON DAVE-- Who the fuck is this wanker?

                                 CARRIE
                        Harrison, this is Dale.

                                 DAVE
                        Dave.

                                 CARRIE
                        Dave. That's what I said.

           Harrison smiles and offers his hand, his charisma cutting 
           through the air. 

           Dave shakes it a little TOO HARD.

                                 HARRISON
                        Woaaahh there chief. You a stunt 
                        guy?

           Dave scoffs, still shaking Harrison's hand.

                                 DAVE
                        I'm one of the main acting roles, 
                        actually, the main villain.
                                 HARRISON
                        Hey, that's great. Good for you!

           Harrison extracts his hand from Dave's vise-grip.

                                 HARRISON
                        Well excuse us for a sec, uh, 
                        Carrie, do you want to, uh... 
                             (winks)
                        ...help me go polish my blaster?

                                 CARRIE
                        Oh, yeah. Sure!

                                 DAVE
                        I'm actually heading over to the 
                        prop department myself, I could 
                        drop it off for you. Kill two 
                        birds, as they say.

                                 HARRISON
                        Not necessary, chief...

           Harrison leans in close to Dave, WHISPERS:

                                 HARRISON (CONT’D)
                        I was talking about my wiener.

           ON DAVE-- mortified.

           Carrie hops out of the chair.

                                 CARRIE
                             (to Dave)
                        Nice to meet you Dale, I mean, nice 
                        to see you again.

           Carrie and Harrison scurry off, giggling like schoolchildren. 

           Right before they turn a corner, Harrison pinches her ass. 
           She SQUEALS.

           ON DAVE-- watching them scamper off, furrowing his brow...

                                 INTERVIEWER (PRE-LAP)
                        And what about Alec Guiness, Sir 
                        Alec Guiness? 

           PRESENT DAY

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        You had quite a big scene 
                        with him.
                                 OLD DAVE
                        You’re damn right I did, bloody 
                        killed him with my lightsaber.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        And what was it like, working with 
                        him?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        He was... pretty reserved... not 
                        what I would call an overly 
                        friendly man. I think, it was years 
                        later, someone wrote a biography of 
                        him and I thought, I wonder if I 
                        got mentioned in it, so I went to 
                        the index, and the only mention I 
                        have in the book is, he says, “Had 
                        lunch today with Dave Prowse, the 
                        gentleman who is going to play 
                        Darth Vader... and I fear he is not 
                        an actor.”

           Dave masks his contempt behind a chuckle.

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        And I look at it now and I think, 
                        well who is it that everybody 
                        remembers from Star Wars? It’s 
                        Darth Vader, the ultimate screen 
                        villain. It’s not Alec Guinness. 

           CLOSE ON Dave’s face, bitterness creeping in...

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t remember Obi-Wan Kenobi 
                        at all.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - REHEARSAL AREA - DAY - 1976

           Dave and Sir Alec run through their lightsaber routine in a 
           gym-like rehearsal space, using PROP WOODEN SWORDS.  

           Dave DUCKS as Sir Alec’s blade nearly hits him in the head.

                                 DAVE
                        I’m not sure how much time you’ve 
                        spent with the rest of the cast... 
                        a lot of them aren’t very 
                        professional. Treating set like 
                        it’s their bloody bedroom. 

           BAM! The blades clash.
                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Have you noticed that? Sir Alec?

           Sir Alec says nothing. He’s focused on the routine.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        It is nice to be around another 
                        serious actor though. 

                                 SIR ALEC
                        Yes, where was it you trained 
                        again?

                                 DAVE
                        Oh, well I-- I didn’t...

           Dave stumbles for his response... then:

                                 DAVE
                        ...you know I was hand-selected by 
                        Stanley Kubrick to appear in A 
                        Clockwork--

                                 SIR ALEC
                        Did you have many lines?

           Sir Alec CHARGES, blade high above his head.

                                 DAVE
                        Plenty. Well... five... they were 
                        good ones though.

                                 SIR ALEC
                        Sounds like a role for a very 
                        serious actor. 

           Dave swings his blade a little too hard, SHATTERING Sir 
           Alec's prop sword.

                                 SIR ALEC
                        Alright, that’s enough for today.

                                 DAVE
                        You don’t want to run lines?

                                 SIR ALEC
                        I’m going to spend as little time 
                        on this rubbish as I possibly can.

           And with that, Sir Alec flings his broken blade and stalks 
           off, leaving Dave alone, watching after him...

           Dave eats by himself, devouring a massive plate of egg-fried 
           rice.

           He glances over at another table, where Mark, Harrison, 
           Carrie and SOME OTHERS sit, eating and laughing. 

           The cool kids at the cool table.

           Dave eyes them enviously...

           ...then takes another HUGE BITE--

           INT. WARDROBE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Dave admires himself in a mirror as a COSTUMER adjusts his 
           VADER SUIT, fiddling with the panel of blinking lights on the 
           chest.

                                 DAVE
                        Looking quite swish, if I do say 
                        so. That’s everything then?

                                 COSTUMER
                        We’ve got the cape too.

           The costumer drapes a BLACK CAPE across his back. Dave 
           flourishes it around, trying to look scary.

                                 COSTUMER
                        And finally... the mask.

           The costumer holds up the JET BLACK SAMURAI HELMET/FACE MASK. 
           Dave stares into its glassy, empty eyes...

           ...and his heart sinks.

                                 DAVE
                        Mask?

                                 COSTUMER
                        Shall we pop it on?

                                 DAVE
                        No one said anything about a bloody 
                        mask.

                                 COSTUMER
                        Really. Well... shall we pop it on?
           EXT. GEORGE’S PRODUCTION OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave paces by the door, wearing his FULL VADER COSTUME, 
           except for the mask. MUFFLED VOICES can be heard from inside 
           the office:

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                             (high-energy)
                        I just got off the phone with 
                        Laddie, and we’re fucked Georgie 
                        boy! Both of us. Same time. Like a 
                        sandwich. Gonna stack us up like a 
                        BLT and go to town. Fuck-town. 
                        Population: us.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        What!? Why are you talking about 
                        fucking a sandwich?

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        What!? I don’t wanna fuck a goddamn 
                        sandwich! The execs are coming next 
                        week Georgie, and if the budget 
                        isn't under control by then... 
                        they’re gonna shut us down.

           A long silence.

           Dave stops pacing, puts his ear to the door:

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                             (through ragged breaths)
                        I just-- I need a little time-- 

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Jesus Georgie, you don’t look so 
                        hot. Here, why don't you lie down 
                        for a minute, I’ll be back later--

           The door flings open and Gary rushes past. 

           Dave shuffles into the:

           OFFICE

           George lies on the couch, eyes closed, a COLD COMPRESS on his 
           forehead.

                                 DAVE
                        George?

           George FLINCHES, SPRINGING from the couch, SLAMMING against 
           the wall--
           --knocking over a MODEL DEATH STAR, which SHATTERS across the 
           floor. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh god.

                                 DAVE
                        Terribly sorry, George.

           Dave picks up the CRUSHED DEATH STAR, feebly attempts to bend 
           it back into shape.

                                 DAVE
                        This should be ok-- just needs a 
                        little-- Ahh, there we are.

           It still looks like a deflated basketball. George struggles 
           to catch his breath:

                                 GEORGE
                        What-- What can I do for you?

                                 DAVE
                        Well, George, sorry to be a bother, 
                        but I was just... I’ve just been 
                        told that I’m to wear a mask in all 
                        of my scenes, and well...

           Dave trails off, leaving an opening for George... but George 
           just stares back.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        The thing about it is, George... I 
                        was under the impression that my 
                        face would be seen in this film.

           George scratches his head, puzzled by the strange complaint.

                                 GEORGE
                        The mask is really kind of, uh--
                        essential to the character, it’s... 
                        it's what inspires terror, he’s--

                                 DAVE
                        I can be quite menacing without it. 
                        Quite menacing.

           Dave SPOTS a script on the desk, snatches it up.

                                 DAVE
                        Watch this.

           He jogs across the room, then whirls around and strides back 
           up to George, an EXAGGERATED SCOWL on his face.
           His voice comes out in a NASAL, HIGH-PITCHED whine:

                                 DAVE
                        Don’t act so surprised Your 
                        Highness!!!

           He’s trying his damndest to exude scariness, you can almost 
           see the steam coming out of his ears...

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Several transmissions were beamed 
                        to this ship by rebel spies! I want 
                        to know what happened to the plans 
                        they sent you!!!! 

           ON GEORGE-- flustered. Confused. A silent moment passes...

           Without breaking character, Dave offers him the script, 
           points at Leia’s line: 

                                 DAVE
                             (whispering)
                        Do the line.

           George starts reading, tentatively:

                                 GEORGE
                        Umm... I don't know what you're 
                        talking about... I am a member of 
                        the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic 
                        mission to Alderaan--

                                 DAVE
                        You are paaaaart of the Rebel 
                        Alliance and a traitooooor!!!!!! 
                        Take her aaaaaaaaaawayyyyyyyyyy!

           “Chewing the scenery” doesn’t begin to describe what we just 
           witnessed.

           George is speechless. 

                                 DAVE
                        See? Scary.

                                 GEORGE
                        Terrifying. I’ll... uh... I'll 
                        think about it. It does come off in 
                        the end though.

           Dave lights up.

                                 DAVE
                        It does?
                                 GEORGE
                        Mmm-hm.

                                 DAVE
                        Marvelous! Thank you George!

           Dave barrels out of the office without another word--

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Dave paces in circles, a phone pressed to his ear.

                                 DAVE 
                        Dave Prowse calling for Wade 
                        Cunningham...

           INT. SMALL CRAPPY TALENT AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           An old, dusty office. Piles of headshots on a desk. 

           WADE (60s, comb-over, plaid blazer) holds a phone to his ear:

                                 WADE
                             (faking a woman's voice)
                        One moment please.

           Wade stares at the wall for a moment, then:

                                 WADE
                             (regular voice)
                        David! How's my favorite client?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY.

                                 DAVE
                        Why didn't you tell me this was 
                        another masked role, you twat?!

                                 WADE
                        Is it? Well, bollocks. Apologies 
                        about that Dave, we didn't get--

                                 DAVE
                        You're lucky it comes off in the 
                        end, Wade, otherwise you'd be 
                        getting sacked, as we speak.

           Wade rolls his eyes, seeing through the obvious bluff.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        No more masks!
           Dave slams the phone down. 

           He stares at his face in the mirror for a long beat...

           ...then slowly slides the mask on, his face disappearing 
           behind VADER’S GLASSY STARE...

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ON A MIRROR-- the reflection of an empty living room. 

           Suddenly, a figure blurs past. Then quickly vanishes. 

           Silence.

           The figure blurs past again. 

           Then again. 

           Faster and faster.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           Dave in his PAJAMAS. Swaggering around the room with a 
           theatrical flair, scrutinizing his every move in the mirror.

           Norma shuffles down the hall, struggling with a heaping 
           laundry basket. She catches sight of him:

                                 NORMA
                        What are you doing?

                                 DAVE
                        It’s called “body acting.” 

                                 NORMA
                        It looks a bit like pointlessly 
                        walking in circles.

           Dave walks even faster:

                                 DAVE
                        Well it’s not. In fact, my 
                        character’s walk needs to be just 
                        right...

           He adopts a professorial tone:

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        As my primary means of non-verbal 
                        expression, it must convey menace 
                        and authority, you see.
           Norma sees right through his bullshit.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        All great actors emphasize the 
                        importance of a character’s walk. 
                        If you knew anything about the 
                        craft--

                                 NORMA
                        So they’ve put you in a mask again?

           Dave falters for a moment.

                                 DAVE
                        It comes off. George said so.

                                 NORMA
                        How wonderful.

                                 DAVE
                        But the scenes with the mask will 
                        require me to lean heavily on my 
                        “body acting” skills. It’s quite 
                        similar to bodybuilding actually.
                             (beat)
                        What’s scarier? This?

           Dave adjusts his gait imperceptibly.

                                 DAVE
                        Or this?

           Another slight adjustment. 

           Norma just SIGHS and pads out of the room.

           Dave deflates, a little shaken...

           But he closes his eyes, composes himself, then--

           --DIVES back into walking with renewed vigor, storming RIGHT 
           TOWARDS CAMERA--

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           --DARTH VADER rushing down a corridor. A cluster of 
           STORMTROOPERS struggling to keep up with him.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           George watching the scene from behind the CAMERA CREW, his 
           face taut with anxiety.

                                 GEORGE
                             (quietly)
                        Cut.

           No one heard him.

                                 GARY
                        Cut, goddammit!!!!!

           Production screeches to a halt. George whispers something 
           into Gary’s ear. Gary nods sharply.

                                 GARY
                        Dave. Buddy.

           Dave starts pawing at his mask, trying to take it off.

                                 GARY
                        Leave it on.

                                 DAVE
                             (garbled)
                        It’s really hot.

                                 GARY
                        Don’t care. You’re walking too 
                        fast, buddy. Way too fast. It looks 
                        like you gotta pee. You gotta pee?

           Dave shakes his head.

                                 GARY
                        Well then slow the fuck down. Say 
                        it back to me. Slow...

           Gary waits. Dave reluctantly repeats it:

                                 DAVE
                             (garbled)
                        Slow... 

                                 GARY
                        ...the fuck...

                                 DAVE
                        ...the fuck...

                                 GARY
                        ...down.
                                 DAVE
                        ...down.

           Gary smiles.

                                 GARY
                        Great.

           Everyone hustles back to first positions.

           ON DAVE-- his anxiety palpable, even through the mask. He 
           does not want to mess this up.

                                 GEORGE
                             (quietly)
                        Action.

           Dave strides down the corridor, his steps more measured. The 
           stormtroopers right on his heels. They reach the end of the 
           hall.

                                 GEORGE
                        Cut.

           Dave’s costumer hustles over, carefully removes his helmet 
           and mask. 

           Dave's hair is drenched, mashed down on his forehead, his 
           face ROSY.

           The costumer DUMPS THE SWEAT FROM THE HELMET into a bucket. 
           Gross.

           Dave’s attention immediately snaps to George:

           Did he like the walk?

           George glances over at him, gives a cursory THUMBS UP.

           Dave lights up, cracks a goofy smile.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        And so ended my first and last 
                        piece of critical direction from 
                        George. I slowed down my Vader walk 
                        with no loss of menace at all... 
                        and George never had me change my 
                        depiction of Vader again...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           Dave/Vader looms over Carrie/Leia:
                                 DAVE
                             (muffled)
                        You are paaaaart of the rebel 
                        alliance and a traitor. Take her 
                        awaaaaay!

           His voice is again NASAL and WHINY. On top of that, the mask 
           hardly conceals his overacting.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Cut.

           Dave glances over at George, who gives another thumbs up.

           A few CREW MEMBERS exchange worried glances.

           PRESENT DAY

           The interviewer looks down at his notes: 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I want to read to you a quote from 
                        Ben Burtt, the sound designer on 
                        the film:
                             (beat)
                        “It was hilarious. And terrifying 
                        at the same time, because we didn’t 
                        know what Darth Vader sounded like. 
                        When Dave Prowse was on set, that 
                        was the first time we heard him, 
                        and we all went, ‘Is that it? Is it 
                        going to be some Scottish guy, or 
                        what is this?’”

           The interviewer glances up at Dave.

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        Your response?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Well, first of all, I’m not 
                        Scottish, so he’s a bloody idiot. 
                        And second of all... 
                             (long beat)
                        It hurts my feelings.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           Carrie/Leia lies on a prison bed, shackled. Vader towers 
           above her.
           A CREW MEMBER crouches out of frame, holding up a BLACK, 
           SPHERICAL PROP DROID with a needle sticking out of it, trying 
           to make it look like it’s hovering.

           Harrison lounges on the sidelines, watching the scene, 
           smirking to himself.

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        And nooow your highness, we will 
                        discuss the location of your hidden 
                        rebel baaaaase!

           Dave’s voice somehow seems even more high-pitched. He sounds 
           like a petulant teenager complaining about being grounded.

           The BULKY CAMERA pushes in on Leia’s face.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        And you’re scared. Really scared. 
                        More scared. A little less scared. 
                        Great. Cut.

           George -- now with PURPLE BAGS under his eyes, looking like 
           he hasn't slept for a week -- offers his customary silent 
           thumbs-up.

           Dave’s chest swells with pride... until he notices a few crew 
           members SNICKERING. What’s that all about?

           Harrison saunters over.

                                 HARRISON
                        Good stuff, Darth Farmer. If I were 
                        a potato I’d be shaking in my 
                        boots.

                                 DAVE
                        What the hell's that supposed to 
                        mean?

                                 CARRIE
                        He means you were super scary Dave. 
                             (then whispers)
                        I almost pooped my pants.

           Dave furrows his brow, then slinks off. Carrie and Harrison 
           CHUCKLE as he hurries away...

           CORNER OF THE SET 

           The crotchety CINEMATOGRAPHER (60s) shoves a finger in 
           George's face--
                                 CINEMATOGRAPHER
                        I’ll light it how I damn well 
                        please!!!

           --then shuffles off, just as Dave barrels up:

                                 DAVE
                        George-- Sorry to be a bother, I 
                        just-- Are the mics picking 
                        everything up ok?

           George is barely listening, still staring off at the 
           cinematographer, turning something over in his mind.

                                 GEORGE
                        Huh?

                                 DAVE
                        My voice. I’m a little concerned 
                        that it’ll be no good, you see, 
                        coming through the mask and all.

                                 GEORGE
                             (distracted)
                        Yeah... sure...

                                 DAVE
                        George!

           Dave GRABS him by the shoulders.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        How’s my performance? Is it to your 
                        liking?

           George snaps out of his daze.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh. It’s perfect, just what I need.

           Dave lights up.

                                 DAVE
                        Splendid. And the voice?

                                 GEORGE
                        It's great. It's gonna be great, 
                        we’ll be processing it all in post. 
                        It’s fine... everything’s fine.

           George wanders off, muttering to himself like a crazy person:

                                 GEORGE
                        Everything’s juussst fiiiine....
           ON DAVE-- aglow from the “praise,” his confidence returning.

           EXT. DAVE’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           The garage is shrouded in darkness, the neighborhood 
           completely silent.

           A commotion suddenly EXPLODES from inside:

           CRACK! CRACK!! CRACK!!!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        When you left I was but a learner!

           INT. DAVE’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON a MANNEQUIN draped in a bathrobe with a MOP taped to 
           its hand. 

           Dave stands before it, clutching a WOODEN BROOMSTICK.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Now I am the master!!!

           He attacks like a maniac. CRACK! CRACK!!! CRACK!!!

           Dave leans in close, then does OBI-WAN’S VOICE, barely moving 
           his lips like a ventriloquist:

                                 DAVE
                             (whispering)
                        Only a master of evil, Darth.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!!!

           He’s having a blast. A little kid lost in a fantasy.

                                 NORMA (O.S.)
                        Dave!

           He whirls around: 

           Norma stands in the doorway, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

                                 NORMA (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s name are you doing?

                                 DAVE
                        Chasing my bloody dreams, Norma. 
                        What does it look like?!
                                 NORMA
                        Well keep it down, the kids are 
                        sleeping.

                                 DAVE
                        You can’t silence my dreams.

                                 NORMA
                        They have school in the morning, 
                        they need--

           CRACK! CRACK!! CRACK!!!!!!

           Dave SLAMS the mannequin a few more times.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ve gotta practice, I can’t let 
                        George down.

           CRACK!

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        He believes in me.

           CRACK! CRACK!

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Unlike some people.

           Norma shakes her head, shuffles back into the house.

                                 DAVE
                        ARRRRRRRGGGHHHH!

           CRACK!!!!! Dave SMASHES the mannequin’s head off. 

           It SAILS across the garage, then ROLLS to a stop. 

           He stares down at it:

           The mannequin’s face suddenly looks strangely like his own.

           He recoils in shock... then looks again:

           Just a generic mannequin face... that's odd...

           As we PUSH IN on its dead eyes--

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           CLOSE ON Dave’s eyes, as a HAND rubs BLACK MAKEUP all over 
           his face. In the background, the CREW readies another shot.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s this for again?

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST (O.S.)
                        They can see your eyes too well 
                        through the mask.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST (O.S.)
                        I guess they don’t like seeing your 
                        eyes?

           Dave suddenly looks worried as more and more of his face 
           disappears behind the makeup...

                                 DAVE
                        Did George say that?

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Action!

           Dave and the makeup artist go quiet as the crew starts 
           shooting a scene in the background--

           Suddenly, a GROUP OF FOX EXECS in slick BLACK SUITS bursts 
           onto set, trailed by a gaggle of BUMBLING YES-MEN. 

           A hush falls over the cast and crew.

           George perks up from behind the BULKY CAMERA, spots them, 
           then frantically SCAMPERS AWAY, unnoticed. 

           Gary follows suit, DUCKS OUT a side door.

                                 FIRST A.D. (O.S.)
                        Cut! What the hell?!

           The execs march up to the camera, REVEALING:

           The FIRST A.D., who wears a WHITE JACKET and LARGE BROWN 
           EARPHONES that almost look like swirls of hair. 

           He immediately recognizes the LEAD EXEC:

                                 FIRST A.D.
                        Garth Schrader, only you could be 
                        so bold.
                                 LEAD EXEC
                        Don’t act so surprised! This 
                        production’s been hemorrhaging 
                        cash. We’re shutting it down!

           ACROSS THE ROOM-- George peeks around a corner, eyes wide 
           with terror.

           ON DAVE-- spotting him. Registering his fear. George stares 
           back with pleading eyes: help me Dave... you’re my only hope.

                                 YES-MAN
                        Look sir, George!

           George’s head disappears, like a scared squirrel darting into 
           a hole...

           ...just as a COLOSSAL DARK SHADOW falls over the execs.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        That is not the George you’re 
                        looking for.

           They look up, suddenly terrified: 

           Dave's MONSTROUS FIGURE towers high above, dwarfing them, 
           seeming to consume all space. If this were a cartoon, we’d be 
           hearing half a dozen GULPS.

                                 LEAD EXEC
                        That’s-- not the George-- we’re 
                        looking for...

                                 DAVE
                        Mr. Lucas is resting. He shall not 
                        be disturbed.

                                 LEAD EXEC
                        Mr. Lucas is resting... he shall 
                        not be disturbed...

                                 DAVE
                        Move along.

           The execs silently nod. They slowly back away, then rush out 
           the door.

           ON THE CREW-- breathing a sigh of relief.

           INT. GEORGE’S PRODUCTION OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           George hides in a BLUE METAL TRASH CAN, peering out from 
           beneath the DOMED LID, trembling. 
           The office door creaks open. He ducks down.

           Dave creeps in, spots the DEATH STAR MODEL on a shelf, now 
           FULLY-REPAIRED.

           Then sees the swinging trash can lid, kneels down beside it:

                                 DAVE
                        Come here my little friend, don’t 
                        be afraid.

           George tentatively peers out.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Don't worry. Their days of bullying 
                        little Georgie have come to an end.

           George clumsily climbs out of the trash can. 

           Then dusts himself off and VIGOROUSLY SHAKES Dave’s hand. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you, Dave. You’ve saved us.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave struts out of George's office with a TRIUMPHANT GRIN. 
           Sir Alec, Carrie, and Harrison instantly MOB him.

                                 SIR ALEC
                        That was quite a performance, 
                        David! Perhaps you are a serious 
                        actor after all!

           Harrison SHOVES Sir Alec out of the way. He crashes into a 
           garbage can.

                                 HARRISON
                        Dave! Can you teach me to be strong 
                        and confident, just like you?

           Carrie ELBOWS Harrison out of the way. He FALLS OUT A WINDOW.

                                 CARRIE
                        I'm wetter than a Dagobah swamp 
                        right now, Dave... take me!!!

           She passionately KISSES HIM as we hear Harrison SPLAT on the 
           sidewalk outside.

           But Dave PUSHES her into the wall, turns the corner onto--
           THE SOUNDSTAGE

           --where the whole crew ERUPTS into cheers. They lift him onto 
           their shoulders, parading him around like a king.

                                 ALL
                        Three cheers for Dave! Three cheers 
                        for Dave! 

           PUSH IN on Dave, smiling proudly, relishing the attention--

                                 ALL (CONT’D)
                        Three cheers--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PRESENT DAY

                                 OLD DAVE
                        --for Dave!

           Dave's eyes are clenched shut, a grin plastered on his face.

           The interviewer stares at him in disbelief:

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        So... you... you saved the movie?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        That’s right. If I hadn’t told 
                        those execs to sod off, it would’ve 
                        been curtains for George.

           The interviewer’s not even close to convinced...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Dave, I'm having a little trouble 
                        believing that Carrie Fisher said, 
                        uh, "I'm wetter than a Dagobah 
                        swamp." I mean... Dagobah wasn't 
                        even until Empire.

           But Dave's not even listening... a painful memory suddenly 
           creeping in...  

                                 OLD DAVE
                        And you think I would’ve gotten 
                        some bloody credit for it. But 
                        instead...
           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAYS LATER

           CLOSE ON-- script pages, rapidly turning.

           SWISH, SWISH, SWISH, SWISH, SWISH--

           The flipping stops. 

           No more pages.

           Dave, wearing the VADER COSTUME sans-mask, his face smeared 
           with BLACK MAKE-UP, clutches the script. 

           He furrows his brow: That can’t be right.

           He flips through again... looking for something... 

           CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave STORMS around a corner, up to--

           GEORGE’S OFFICE DOOR

           --which is flanked by two vaguely pig-like SECURITY GUARDS.

           He flashes an ODD HAND GESTURE at each of them--

           --and they clutch their necks, TUMBLING out of frame.

           He reaches for the door handle, when YELLING suddenly 
           explodes from inside:

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        George, this is serious! You need 
                        more sleep, you need to eat! You 
                        keep this up much longer... you 
                        will die.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry Doc. I won’t let 
                        anything happen to Georgie boy. At 
                        least not until the movie wraps.

           The door FLINGS open and the DOCTOR scurries out. Dave STOMPS 
           past him into the-- 

           OFFICE

           --then SLAMS the door behind him. 

           George SHIVERS on the couch, BUNDLED in several layers of 
           GREEN HEATED BLANKETS, only his face exposed. 
           He looks a bit like a GIANT SLUG. His face pale and sickly. 
           His eyes seem to BULGE out, magnified by his glasses.

           Gary sits beside him:

                                 GARY
                        Dave, buddy, now’s really not a 
                        good time, George needs his rest--

           Dave silently clomps over to Gary, does that odd hand gesture 
           again, RIGHT IN HIS FACE.

           After a confused beat, Gary SLAPS his hand away:

                                 GARY
                        Get your fuckin' hand out of my 
                        face, it smells like eggs.

           Dave sniffs his fingers, then:

                                 DAVE
                        I need to talk to George.

                                 GARY
                        Well too bad for you, he's--

           Dave SHOVES Gary to the side, then PLOPS down next to George.

                                 DAVE
                        George. 

           Tears well up in his eyes.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        You said the mask comes off. You 
                        said they’d see my face...

           Tears flow freely now, two rivers streaming down Dave’s 
           blackened cheeks.

                                 GARY
                        Dave. Come on, buddy, this isn't--

                                 DAVE
                        They almost shut us down, Gary! 
                        Where were you?!? I saved the 
                        bloody day, what did you do?!?

           George suddenly makes a CROAKING NOISE, not unlike a dying 
           frog:

                                 GEORGE
                             (barely above a whisper)
                        Geeuuhhhhhhhhh...
           Gary and Dave both lean in, listening intently...

                                 DAVE
                        What is it, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        Geeaehhhhhttt...

           They lean in even closer...

                                 DAVE
                        What are you trying to say?

           ...they lean closer still, now inches from George’s face...

           ...when George takes a deep breath, summoning all of his 
           strength:

                                 GEORGE
                        Geehhhhttt... hiiimmmm... ooout of 
                        heere!!!

                                 DAVE
                        What?!

                                 GARY
                        Alright that’s it! Security!!!

           A HERD of PIG GUARDS waddles into the room, surrounding Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        Nooo! George! You lied to meeee!!!

                                 GARY
                        Take him away!

           The guards drag him out. Dave tries to fight back, but it's 
           futile. 

           His flailing fist SLAMS against the door frame--

           --and the REPAIRED DEATH STAR plummets from a shelf and 
           SHATTERS--

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           --a flash bulb EXPLODES, illuminating Mark, Carrie, and 
           Harrison as they walk the red carpet outside of:

           EXT. A FANCY THEATER - 1977 - NIGHT

           Dave trails them. Ignored by the photographers.
           INT. THEATER - LATER

           Dave sits next to Norma in the dark audience, but is 
           otherwise surrounded by strangers. He cranes his neck over 
           his shoulder, scanning the faces in the crowd--

           --finally spotting George on the other side of the theater.

           Dave waves, trying to get his attention.

           George glances over, briefly catches his eye.

           Dave lights up, waves even harder--

           --but George quickly averts his gaze, then slides down in his 
           chair, hiding behind Gary--

           --who SMIRKS and GIVES DAVE THE FINGER just as:

           BUUUM BUUUM, BUM-BUM-BUM BUUUMM BUMMM--

           --the OPENING STAR WARS THEME kicks in.

           LATER

           ONSCREEN-- the moment of truth has arrived. Vader’s entrance. 
           He MARCHES through a doorway, flanked by STORMTROOPERS...

           ON DAVE-- nodding to himself, pleased. His walk looks 
           awesome. Super awesome. He shares a SMILE with Norma.

           Then it happens:

                                 VADER (O.S.)
                        Where are those transmissions you 
                        intercepted? What have you done 
                        with those plans?

           Dave knits his brow. What the hell was that?

                                 VADER (O.S.)
                        If this is a consular ship then 
                        where is the ambassador?

           Darth's voice THUNDERS through the theater, a DEEP, RICH 
           BARITONE...

           Dave glances around, confused.

           It doesn’t sound anything like him.
           LATER

           Dave looks crushed, the reality of what happened finally 
           hitting him. 

           There’s not a trace of him in the movie. His voice has been 
           completely replaced.

           Norma steals nervous glances at him--

           --but Dave’s eyes are riveted on the screen... unwavering... 
           a fury growing in him--

           LATER

           A STANDING OVATION. CHEERS. WHISTLING.

           We PAN ACROSS the joyous audience, everyone on their feet, 
           clapping wildly, ecstatic--

           --until we land on Dave. And the room seems to darken and 
           warp around him... 

           He remains seated, stone-faced... an anxious Norma at his 
           side...

           INT. THEATER LOBBY - LATER

           The place is packed and noisy.

           Dave sulks on the sidelines, ignored by everyone.

           In the background, the LEAD EXEC who tried to shut down the 
           movie earlier holds court with a bunch of HOLLYWOOD TYPES:

                                 LEAD EXEC
                        ...and they told me to shut it 
                        down. But I told 'em to go fuck 
                        themselves! I knew we had a hit on 
                        our hands from day one!

           The Hollywood types CHORTLE, guzzle champagne--

           --as Dave spots Mark, Carrie, Harrison and Sir Alec across 
           the lobby, all signing autographs.

           Suddenly, a BOOMING VOICE punctures through the noise--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh, thank you! I really didn’t do 
                        too much though, a few hours in a 
                        studio.
           Dave wades through the crowd, looking for the voice's owner.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        But the people on set did the hard 
                        work. They deserve the real credit.

           The crowd finally spits Dave out, directly in front of:

           JAMES EARL JONES (40s), who's happily shaking hands and 
           signing ticket stubs.

           Dave BUMPS right into him.

                                 JONES
                        Oh, pardon me.

           Dave stares daggers at him. Jones looks puzzled.

                                 JONES
                        Can I help you with something?

           Still nothing.

                                 RANDOM FAN (O.S.)
                        He’s probably star-struck.

                                 JONES
                        Would you like an autograph?

           At that, Dave WHIRLS around, shoves his way across the lobby, 
           and KICKS OPEN the doors--

           OUT FRONT

           REPORTERS swarm George, firing question after question at 
           him. He can hardly keep up.

                                 REPORTER
                        You’re a genius George!

                                 ANOTHER REPORTER
                        We loved it! Where’d you get the 
                        idea?

           Dave glares over at George for a long beat...

           When SOMEONE taps Dave on the shoulder:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir?

           Dave lights up. He’s been recognized!
                                 DAVE
                        Yes?!

           He turns: it’s a GUY lugging a BULKY CAMERA.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Do you mind stepping aside? You’re 
                        in my shot.

           Dave deflates, then slinks away into the night...

           MOMENTS LATER

           Norma steps out of the theater, looking lost and confused. 

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LATER

           Dave pays a BABYSITTER (16), ushers her out the door.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Daddy?

           Rachel, his young daughter, stands at the bottom of the 
           stairs, bleary-eyed.

                                 RACHEL
                        How was the movie? Did they like 
                        your acting?

           A long pause, then:

                                 DAVE
                        Yes. Yes they did, very much.

           Rachel beams up at him:

                                 RACHEL
                        I knew they would. 

           INT. THE KIDS' ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           James and Steven are already fast asleep. Dave tucks Rachel 
           in.

                                 DAVE
                        Goodnight munchkin.

           He stands up to leave--

                                 RACHEL
                        You forgot something.
                                 DAVE
                        Oh, right...

           He kneels back down, then carefully BRUSHES HER HAIR TO THE 
           SIDE, the same way he did earlier.

           She smiles brightly, relishing the moment with her dad--

           INT. DAVE’S GARAGE - LATER

           HHHHHHHRHRRRRRGGHHGHH!!!

           Dave JERKS an ENORMOUS IRON BARBELL off the floor. Something 
           like 300 lbs. He raises it above his head. Then HURLS it to 
           the floor.

           BAAAAAAMMMMM!!!!!

           He grabs for the bar again, when Norma peeks through the 
           door:

                                 NORMA
                             (softly)
                        Dave?

                                 DAVE
                        Goddammit Norma, I’m not going to 
                        be a ghost in my own fucking house.

                                 NORMA
                        You left me at the theater.

                                 DAVE
                        Did I?

           Norma nods... silence...

                                 NORMA
                        Did you want to talk?

                                 DAVE
                        About what?

                                 NORMA
                        About... what happened.

                                 DAVE
                        What about it?

                                 NORMA
                        I know you really had your heart 
                        set on this one... I’m so sorry 
                        David... 
           Dave says nothing...

           ...a pregnant pause...

           ...then he YANKS the barbell again.

           HHHHHEEEERRRRGHGHGHHH!!!

           Norma watches him... a sadness in her eyes... she knows it’s 
           futile.

           She gently closes the door, disappearing into the house.

           Dave HEAVES the weight again, then WINCES in pain:

                                 DAVE
                        AAAHHH!

           His knee WOBBLES, his childhood injury suddenly coming back 
           with a vengeance-- 

           --the barbell slips from his hands--

           BAAAAAAMMMMMMM!!!

           --and he falls to the floor, clutching his throbbing knee.

           His CHEST HEAVING. Dripping sweat.

           He glances up, catches sight of the HEADLESS MANNEQUIN with 
           the MOP LIGHTSABER--

           --and he SNAPS. He lunges for the BROOMSTICK and proceeds to 
           PUMMEL the defenseless statue.

                                 DAVE
                        AAAHH!!! AHHHHHH!!!! AHHHHH!!!

           BAM! BAM! BAM!!! BAM!!!

           He EVISCERATES it-- 

           --plastic shards EXPLODE everywhere-- 

           --the wooden broom SPLINTERS into pieces--

           --then he slumps to ground--

           --and melts into tears--

           --his gargantuan chest RUMBLING with each sob...

           When a STRANGE COMMANDING VOICE suddenly fills the room:
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Despair not, David...

           Dave’s head snaps up-- Who said that?!

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        ...for even the darkest night 
                        yields to the light of dawn. 

           He looks around frantically, wiping tears from his eyes-- 

           Then he sees it:

           IN THE FAR SHADOWS, a DARK FIGURE lurks...

                                 DAVE
                        Who’s there?!
                             (beat)
                        Show yourself!!!

           The figure steps out into the light:

           It's FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER. The hairy, masked version we saw 
           earlier in Dave's "Acting Career" montage. The one Dave 
           played in some old B-movie.

           Except now it glows a GHOSTLY, TRANSLUCENT BLUE.

                                 DAVE
                        Leave me alone!!!

           Dave WHIPS the broken handle at it, but it PASSES THROUGH the 
           apparition, clattering against the wall.

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Heed our counsel, David. We’re here 
                        to help you.

                                 DAVE
                        We?

           Something CREAKS across the garage, Dave spins around:

           Another CREATURE steps from the shadows. This one has the 
           SCULPTED TORSO of a man, but the HEAD OF A BULL. Another role 
           from Dave’s past:

           THE MINOTAUR. Glowing phantasmal-blue just like The Monster.

           Both creatures slowly advance on him, their arms 
           outstretched... 

           ...perhaps to embrace him... or maybe to strangle him... it’s 
           impossible to tell....
                                 OLD DAVE (PRE-LAP)
                        People thought I was upset that my 
                        voice wasn't used...

           ON DAVE-- cowering, terrified.

           PRESENT DAY

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        But I really wasn’t. I did the 
                        voice all the way through the 
                        movie. I did all the lines. Every 
                        single one.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Well, why do you think they 
                        replaced your voice?

                                 OLD DAVE
                             (irritated)
                        Why does everyone always want to 
                        talk about-- It’s-- There’s some 
                        silly story circulating that there 
                        was something wrong with my voice, 
                        my West Country accent. It wasn’t 
                        that at all...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Then what was it?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        George simply wanted a black voice 
                        for a black character. I mean, to 
                        me it’s very obviously a negro 
                        voice.

           ON THE INTERVIEWER-- taken aback.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        That sounds a bit racist, Dave.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Why?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Well, firstly, you really shouldn’t 
                        be saying negro--

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I’m not colour-prejudiced!
                             (beat)
                        You’re a negro and I like you.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I’m Indian.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        You know what I mean.

           The interviewer shakes his head in amazement...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        So, because Vader’s costume is 
                        black, he wanted a black voice? 
                        That’s what you’re saying?

           Dave nods. 

           The interviewer sighs, tries another angle:

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        George and Gary have always 
                        contended that it was never their 
                        intention to use your voice, that 
                        they were planning on using James 
                        Earl Jones from the beginning--

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Well that’s rubbish! George said 
                        they were going to re-record me, 
                        they had to, as the production 
                        audio was no good coming through 
                        the mask and all. But they chased 
                        back to America in a rush, and when 
                        they got there, they realized they 
                        had forgotten to get me to do the 
                        dubbing. And it was too expensive 
                        to fly me out there, so they got 
                        James Earl Jones. Who did a 
                        wonderful job...
                             (beat)
                        ...but I still think I could have 
                        done equally as well.

           Dave takes a deep breath, then lowers his voice, imitating 
           James Earl Jones’ Vader voice:

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Impressive... very impressive.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Most impressive.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Thank you.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        No, the line from the movie, it’s 
                        actually “most impressive.”

           Dave just glares at him. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON Leia SINGING in the infamous "Star Wars Holiday 
           Special." Her voice is angelic, but dear god, the song:

                                 LEIA
                        We celebrate a day of peace, 
                        A day of harmony...

           A series of DISSOLVES from the TV special: Luke, Han, R2-D2, 
           C-3PO...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        But the voice was just the 
                        beginning. There were loads of PR 
                        opportunities after the film came 
                        out, but Fox didn't ask me to do 
                        any of them. First, there was the 
                        Holiday Special, where they just 
                        used archival footage of me...

           In a recycled shot from "Star Wars," Vader storms down a 
           hallway.

           The horrendous "Life Day" song continues as we DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. GRAUMMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - DAY

           A FOOTPRINTING CEREMONY. A CROWD is gathered to watch R2-D2, 
           C-3PO, and Vader press their feet into wet cement.

                                 LEIA (V.O.)
                        A day that takes us through the 
                        darkness...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        Then I think they very quickly 
                        realized that it was much cheaper 
                        to dress any big fella up in a 
                        black suit and fob him off as me.

           Some OTHER GUY in a Vader costume carves the name "Darth 
           Vader" into the ground.

                                 LEIA (V.O.)
                        A day that makes us want to 
                        celebrate the light...
                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        And this annoyed me intensely, 
                        because it cheated the fans, who 
                        expected it to be me in the 
                        costume... and I obviously lost a 
                        big earning.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON PRESS EVENT - DAY

           Harrison and Mark are mobbed by throngs of SCREAMING WOMEN. 
           Dave sulks on the outskirts, unnoticed.

                                 LEIA (V.O.)
                        A day that brings the promise that 
                        one day... We'll be free to live...
                        To laugh... To dream...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        And when I was included, not a 
                        single soul recognized me.

           The "Life Day" song builds to the shittiest ending you've 
           ever heard.

                        ...to beeeee!!!

           PRESENT DAY

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        If you were so frustrated, then 
                        why'd you agree to do the second 
                        film?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Honestly, I had no interest in 
                        being a part of it... at least at 
                        first...

           INT. DAVE’S STUDY - 1979 - NIGHT

           Dave paces in his study, SCREAMING into an old rotary phone:

                                 DAVE
                        Two more?! You tell 'em to shove it 
                        up their arse!

           He SLAMS the phone down.
                                 THE MONSTER (O.S.)
                        We must consider our next move 
                        carefully, David.

           Dave turns to face The Monster, no longer frightened by its 
           ghostly presence. The silent Minotaur looms over its 
           shoulder.

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        We've toiled too long and too hard 
                        to go unrecognized... the world 
                        must see our face, hear our 
                        voice... 

           Dave holds his gaze for a moment, then bows his head... his 
           wound still fresh...

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        This wrong can still be righted...

           The Monster floats over to him... then whispers:

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        But you must defend with fire that 
                        which is rightfully yours...

           A charged beat of silence as Dave ponders this... 

           ...then looks up and LOCKS EYES with The Monster:

                                 DAVE
                        What do you suggest?

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - 1979 - DAY

           CLOSE ON: EMPEROR PALPATINE'S GREEN WRINKLED FACE. The 
           original one, with the BULGING EYES and CHEAP LUMPY MAKEUP:

                                 EMPEROR
                        There is a great disturbance in the 
                        Force...

           A HULKING CAMERA is wheeled right up to his face, just inches 
           away:

                                 EMPEROR (CONT’D)
                        We have a new enemy... 

           ON THE SIDELINES-- Dave watches the shot, wearing the Vader 
           costume sans-mask, his eyes filled with fury...

           The First A.D. feeds Vader's lines to the Emperor:
                                 FIRST A.D.
                             (flatly)
                        If he could be turned, he would 
                        become a powerful ally.

                                 EMPEROR
                        Yes. Yes. He would be a great 
                        asset. Can it be done?

           Dave spots The Monster floating across the soundstage, 
           watching his every move...

                                 FIRST A.D.
                        He will join us or die, my master.

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Cut! Marvelous. Let's break there.

           KERSH (late-50s, the warm, paternal director of "Empire") 
           shoots up from behind the camera as the set suddenly swarms 
           with activity.

           Dave marches up to the First A.D.

                                 DAVE
                        Oi! Who the fuck is that?

                                 FIRST A.D.
                        The Emperor, I guess, must be 
                        another bad guy.

                                 DAVE
                        How many scenes does he have?

           The First A.D. shrugs. Dave suddenly GRABS him by the collar, 
           whispers in his ear--

                                 DAVE
                        From now on, I do the fucking 
                        lines.

           --then shoves him away and MARCHES off. 

           The Monster floats after Dave, a malevolent grin spreading 
           across its face...

           LATER

           A FLASHBULB pops, illuminating Carrie, Mark, and Harrison. 

           Gary watches as a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps off a few more shots.
                                 GARY
                        Great, now let's get a few with 
                        Darth and Mark. Dave!

           Dave saunters over, holding Vader's mask in his hands, and 
           positions himself next to Mark.

           Dave's costumer hurries over and reaches for the helmet:

                                 COSTUMER
                        Shall we pop that on?

                                 DAVE
                        We shan't.

                                 COSTUMER
                        Umm... I think we need to...

           The costumer looks to Gary for guidance.

                                 GARY
                        Dave, buddy. Put the mask on.

                                 DAVE
                        Gary, cunt. Go fuck yourself.

                                 GARY
                        Goddamit Dave!!!

           Gary's apoplectic, his face BEET RED--

                                 GARY
                             (sputtering)
                        I-- you can't-- speak to me--

           The photographer places a hand on Gary's shoulder, politely 
           interjects:

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        How about we, uh, get some with and 
                        some without? Yeah?
                             (beat)
                        Let's start without.

           Dave shoots a victorious SMIRK at Gary as the photographer 
           SNAPS off some shots...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        The second film was a very 
                        different experience. Kersh was a 
                        strong supporter of my work...

           ...behind him, The Monster looks upon the scene approvingly, 
           the ever-silent Minotaur at his side...
                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        And the PR situation was far 
                        better. By all accounts, they 
                        wanted loads of pictures of me with 
                        the mask off.

           Dave GRINS triumphantly as the light FLASHES across his face.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        It was wonderful... the industry 
                        was finally starting to recognize 
                        me...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - PR DEPARTMENT - LATER

           Dave lounges near a desk in street clothes, tapping his foot.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Did you say thirty?

                                 DAVE
                        No, three-hundred.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh, right. Here they are.

           An OFFICE WORKER strolls out, lugging a STACK OF PHOTOS. She 
           drops them on the desk: BAM! 

           Dave flips through them:

           Dave in the Darth costume, no mask, posing with various cast 
           members...

                                 GARY (PRE-LAP)
                        I want him gone!

           INT. GARY'S OFFICE - LATER

           Gary paces around the room, a phone jammed to his ear. 
           George's timid voice CRACKLES from the handset:

                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        We just... can't, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        He called me a cunt in front of 
                        half the cast!!!

           Gary waits for a response... silence...
                                 GARY
                        George?

                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        If we fire him, he'll just create 
                        more problems... who knows what 
                        he'll say to the press? We'll get 
                        crucified!

                                 GARY
                        Who gives a shit what--

                                 GEORGE
                        Gary. We just need to get through 
                        this. 

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dave's workout equipment has migrated inside. He's completely 
           taken over the living room.

           He GRUNTS on the bench press, PUMPING iron, as The Monster 
           grips the BARBELL from behind, spotting him.

           The phone RINGS in the other room. Norma peeks her head in:

                                 NORMA
                        It's for you.

           Dave CLUNKS the weight down. Snatches the phone.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah?

           INT. SLICK AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           Dave's NEW AGENT (30s, hotshot) swaggers around his glass-
           walled London office, flipping through Dave's maskless PR 
           shots.

                                 AGENT
                        Hey there superstar! Got an offer 
                        for you.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY.

                                 DAVE
                        Hit me with it.

           Dave takes a HUGE BITE of a hardboiled egg. 
                                 AGENT
                        Commercial campaign. Gonna be huge. 
                        The Green Cross Code Man.

                                 DAVE
                        What's the part?

                                 AGENT
                        You're the guy, you're him. Some 
                        kind of superhero, saves kids from 
                        getting hit by cars and shit.

                                 DAVE
                             (disappointed)
                        A superhero? What's the mask look 
                        like?

                                 AGENT
                        No mask.

           Dave perks up.

                                 AGENT (CONT'D)
                        Just that sweet, sweet Dave Prowse 
                        mug.

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave hangs up the phone, stunned. He turns to The Monster, 
           who shoots him a sly grin:

                                 THE MONSTER
                        The game is afoot, David... 
                        everything is proceeding as I have 
                        foreseen... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON - STREET

           A LITTLE BRITISH KID (8) steps into the street, almost 
           getting HIT BY A CAR--

           --but Dave JUMPS in his way, wearing a silly green-and-white 
           superhero costume with a giant X across the chest.

                                 DAVE
                        Where do you think you're going, 
                        you dumbo?
                                 LITTLE KID
                             (heavy lisp)
                        Sorry Green Cross Code Man.

           Dave raises his hand in a stopping-gesture:

                                 DAVE
                        Always stop, Stop, STOP!

           With each "stop," Dave's (presumably egg-scented) hand gets 
           bigger and bigger... until it fills the entire screen--

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Cut!

           The DIRECTOR (30s) rushes over, shakes Dave's hand.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        It's been a real pleasure, Mr. 
                        Prowse. 

                                 DAVE
                        Of course. Anything for the 
                        children... um, when exactly will 
                        these be airing, do you know?

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Could be a little while yet, still 
                        waiting to sort out some details on 
                        the ad buy. But seriously, thanks 
                        again for agreeing to be part of 
                        this. 

           The director marvels at Dave, can't help but smile:

                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Darth Vader! Fuckin' brilliant!

                                 ANNOUNCER (PRE-LAP)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to a 
                        new edition of... To Tell The 
                        Truth!!! 

           INT. TV SHOW SET - DAY

           A cheesy 70s TV THEME blasts as the studio audience applauds. 

           THREE PANELISTS saunter onstage, take their seats behind a 
           long desk stage-right.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        And now, let's meet the actor who 
                        played Darth Vader in Star Wars!
           THREE TALL MEN emerge out of the shadows and step into a 
           spotlight. 

           One of them is Dave, looking as happy as we've ever seen him: 
           his face and voice are going to be on television!  

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ok panel, your job is to identify 
                        the real Dave Prowse!

           The audience APPLAUDS--

           LATER

           Onstage, Dave sits behind a large desk, flanked by the two 
           Fake-Daves, as a PANELIST interviews him:

                                 PANELIST
                        Number Three, when an actor takes a 
                        part where one's face is never 
                        seen, do you do it reluctantly, do 
                        you do it for the money, or--

           PUSH IN on Dave's face, strained...

                                 DAVE
                        You, uh, you... you do it for the 
                        part itself. The seeing of the face 
                        doesn't really worry me all that 
                        much--

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dave flips through the mail. RIPS open a large manila 
           envelope, and his eyes light up--

                                 DAVE
                        Norma! Norma!!!!

           She rushes into the room.

                                 DAVE
                        Look!

           He holds up a letter: it's from "The Official David Prowse 
           Fan Club."

                                 NORMA
                        Oh... well... isn't that nice.

           She smiles unconvincingly.
                                 DAVE
                        Bet you never thought that would 
                        happen.

           She shuffles out of the room.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                             (calling after her)
                        Probably wouldn't have my own fan 
                        club if I'd taken some stupid job 
                        selling insurance, eh?

           Dave chuckles to himself, then looks back down at the letter, 
           reading it over and over, soaking it in...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           CLOSE ON an 8x10 glossy photo of Dave in the Vader costume, 
           sans-mask, signed in silver pen:

           "David Prowse IS Darth Vader."

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           Dave strolling through the soundstage, leading a gaggle of 
           FAWNING MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN (members of his new fan club) on a 
           behind-the-scenes tour. They all carry autographed photos.

           Gary watches from across the room, pissed.

                                 DAVE
                        And this is the combat rehearsal 
                        area. I'm technically not supposed 
                        to say anything about this but...
                             (whispering)
                        I have a big lightsaber fight with 
                        Luke at the end of the movie. Big 
                        climactic scene. Been doing loads 
                        of training to get ready for it.

           The ladies are impressed. Dave puts a finger to his lips, 
           playfully:

                                 DAVE
                        Shhh. Mum's the word!

           They turn a corner, and approach an area with a BENCH PRESS 
           and several FREE WEIGHTS. 

                                 DAVE
                        And over here we have my training 
                        area...
           Dave stops at the bench press.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Now, playing Darth Vader is no easy 
                        task. The costume itself weighs 
                        forty pounds, so it requires a very 
                        strict fitness regimen to stay in 
                        peak physical condition...

           He picks up a BARBELL and lifts it high above his head 
           dramatically, GRUNTING like a neanderthal. 

           EEEUUURRRAAGGHHHH!!!

           The ladies "ooh" and "ahh." One PAWS at his bulging bicep.

           Dave chuckles and winks flirtatiously, relishing the 
           attention:

                                 DAVE
                        Now, now, Elizabeth, you know I'm a 
                        married man.

           The women burst into GIGGLES, just as:

           Harrison pops around a corner, munching on an apple.

                                 FAN
                        Oh sweet Jesus... is that... 
                        Harrison Ford???

           BAM! Dave slams the weight down on the floor.

                                 DAVE
                        Trust me, you don't want to--

                                 FAN
                             (suddenly blurting)
                        Harrison!!!

           Harrison spots the group, swaggers over.

                                 DAVE
                             (under his breath)
                        Bollocks.

           If they were excited about Dave, then seeing Harrison is like 
           staring directly into the sun. If the sun were a movie star 
           they wanted to fuck.
                                 HARRISON
                        It's so nice of you beeeauutiful 
                        ladies to keep Davie company on 
                        set, he really doesn't have much to 
                        do these days.

           The women swoon. Speechless.

           Harrison strolls past Dave, leaning in close:

                                 HARRISON
                             (whispering)
                        Real beauts, chief. Buncha rejects 
                        from the Cantina... that one looks 
                        like Greedo's retarded sister.

           Harrison ZINGS the apple core into a trash can, then saunters 
           off.

           ON DAVE-- simmering. He turns to the women:

           One of them indeed looks uncannily like Greedo. Big round 
           eyes, little puckered mouth, a GREEN BOW on her head.

           INT. CORRIDOR ON SET - LATER

           Harrison practices holstering and re-holstering his blaster 
           as Dave storms up to him, livid.

                                 DAVE
                        I demand to be treated with 
                        respect, I'm a major actor on this 
                        picture, and--

                                 HARRISON
                        If this blaster were real, I'd 
                        shoot your dick off right now.

           Harrison aims it at Dave's crotch.

                                 HARRISON (CONT’D)
                        Pew, pew, pew.
                             (beat)
                        Now you're dickless.

           What the fuck? 

           Dave's caught off-guard by this strange behavior...

                                 DAVE
                        No, you're dickless!
                                 HARRISON
                             (flatly)
                        You are.

                                 DAVE
                        NO, YOU ARE!!!

                                 HARRISON
                        Jesus, chill out you psycho.

           Harrison ambles off, unfazed... 

           ...then turns and points the blaster at Dave's crotch again--

                                 HARRISON
                        Pew, pew, pew...

           A P.A. rushes up to Dave.

                                 P.A.
                        New pages for you Mr. Prowse. Just 
                        need you to sign for them.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Dave flips through the script pages, then abruptly stops. His 
           eyes widen.

           CLOSE ON THE PAGES--

           "A respirator tube now retracts from Vader's uncovered head.  
           The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. 
           The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader's 
           head."

           The mask is coming off!!! Fuck yeah!

           INT. BOREHAMWOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Dave eats alone, smugly wolfing down a plate of egg fried 
           rice. Each bite showers the table with egg fragments.

           A WOMAN (30s, cutting edge of 1970s fashion) flounces up:

                                 WOMAN
                        Pardon me, are you Dave Prowse?

           Dave catches sight of her, and almost CHOKES on his egg dish. 
           She's gorgeous.
                                 DAVE
                             (on guard)
                        Who's asking?

                                 WOMAN
                        I'm Stacy Wright, I'm with the 
                        Borehamwood Herald. I saw you on To 
                        Tell The Truth...

           She slides into his booth.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        You're him, right? The actor?

           The word loosens him up, he puffs up his chest.

                                 DAVE
                        I am, yes. The actor. Yes. I am the 
                        actor.

                                 STACY
                        Wow. It's a pleasure to meet you.

           She shakes his hand, then slides over really close, brushing 
           up against him.

                                 STACY
                        I'd love to do a story on you. Meet 
                        the real man behind the mask...

           She leans over, her lips grazing his ear, as she seductively 
           whispers:

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        ...all of him. Call me if you're 
                        interested.

           She slips a BUSINESS CARD out and KISSES it, leaving a RUBY-
           RED LIP PRINT-- 

           --then slides the card into his pocket, and sashays away...

           ...leaving Dave bowled over, floating in a cloud of her 
           perfume.

                                 THE MONSTER (O.S.)
                        She desires more than a story, 
                        David.

           The Monster suddenly sits across from him.

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT'D)
                        Let the thirst of your loins be 
                        slaked!
                                 DAVE
                        But... my family...

                                 THE MONSTER
                        A thankless bunch of miscreants! Do 
                        not deny yourself the pleasures of 
                        the flesh... Seize them and taste 
                        your true power...

           ON DAVE-- conflicted, staring down at the card... 

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - HAIR AND MAKEUP - DAY

           Vader sits in a makeup chair, maskless, the BACK OF HIS PALE, 
           BALD HEAD exposed. 

           An FX ARTIST puts finishing touches on the LATEX BALD CAP, 
           adjusting the prominent JAGGED SCAR, when--

           --Dave, wearing street clothes, suddenly wheels into the 
           room. He stops dead in his tracks.

                                 DAVE
                        What the bloody hell is this!?

           The seated Vader turns: it's stuntman BOB ANDERSON (50s, 
           friendly English chap).

                                 BOB
                        Oh, hey Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        What-- Why-- I-- I am-- I am to be 
                        used for the unmasking! Not my 
                        stunt double.

           The FX artist shrinks back, frightened.

                                 BOB
                        They're not seeing the face, Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        That's-- That's not the point! The 
                        fans expect it to be me! Me!!! 

                                 BOB
                        Well I was already suited up, they 
                        thought it'd save some time because 
                        we've...

           ON DAVE-- his eyes glazing over as Bob's voice fades to an 
           unintelligible drone... how is this happening?!
           The Monster and The Minotaur suddenly materialize behind 
           Bob...

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Defend your fortress, David! Cry 
                        havoc, and let slip the dogs of 
                        war!

           Dave SNAPS out of his stupor, then slowly and methodically 
           swivels around.

           CLICK!

           He LOCKS the door. Then turns to face Bob and the FX artist, 
           an unsettling grin distorting his features...

                                 DAVE
                             (slowly and forcefully)
                        I am to be used for the unmasking.

           Bob and the FX artist exchange a nervous look, both deeply 
           creeped out...

           ...a long tense moment passes, the air electric...

                                 BOB
                        Uh, sure Dave... yeah, no problem.

           Frazzled, Bob gets up, starts slowly pulling the BALD CAP 
           OFF... as Dave looks on, his eyes BLAZING--

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - LATER

           Dave/Vader sits in VADER'S POD, maskless, his head covered in 
           latex and makeup.

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Action!

           The helmet slowly lowers onto Dave's head... as he subtly 
           cranes his neck... angling his face... 

           ...trying to get that sweet, sweet Dave Prowse mug in the 
           shot before it's obscured by the mask--

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Cut! You're moving your head again, 
                        Dave. We're really not supposed to 
                        see your face in this one.

                                 DAVE
                        Why not?
                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Because that's what the script--

                                 DAVE
                        But it's only a glimpse, Kersh! It 
                        would stoke the audience's 
                        curiosity, the fans would simply 
                        eat it up!

           The CREW shifts irritably. They've been at this for a while. 
           Kersh sighs, then stands up from behind the camera:

                                 KERSH
                        I'm not joking around here. 
                        Straight ahead. Literally just sit 
                        there and stare at the wall. 
                        Easiest scene in the world.

           The CAMERAMAN leans over:

                                 CAMERAMAN
                             (quietly)
                        We could toss it on tracks, then 
                        pan to keep his face out.

           Kersh checks his watch.

                                 KERSH
                        Do it.

           CORRIDOR - LATER

           Dave strides down the hallway, a victorious smile spread 
           across his face, The Monster and The Minotaur marching 
           faithfully at his side.

           A far door FLINGS open, and out traipses:

                                 HARRISON
                        Hey chief! Last day tomorrow, huh? 
                        We're really gonna miss you.

           Dave does his best to ignore him...

           ...but as Harrison saunters past, he makes his hand into a 
           gun, aims it at Dave's crotch:

                                 HARRISON
                        Pew pew pew!

           ON DAVE-- murder in his eyes. He clenches his fists, seconds 
           away from pummeling Harrison-- 
           --when The Monster takes his hand and gently intones:

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Calm yourself David, there are 
                        other ways to conquer that 
                        miserable rogue... 

           INT. DAVE'S STUDY - LATER THAT EVENING

           Dave sits at his desk, staring down at STACY'S BUSINESS CARD. 
           The Monster looms behind him.

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Yes... take her... show him you are 
                        not to be mocked... 

           Dave's gaze drifts over to a FRAMED PHOTO on the wall:

           Dave and Norma on their wedding day. Happier times, now long 
           forgotten.

           The Minotaur lumbers from the shadows, picks up the phone and 
           offers it to Dave--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Stop... stop... STOP!!!

           What the hell?!? 

           It's Dave's own voice, coming from across the room:

           The GREEN CROSS CODE MAN strikes a hero-pose, shimmering BLUE 
           like the other two apparitions.

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        What do you think you're doing, you 
                        dumbo? Your family loves you.

                                 THE MONSTER
                        And what have they done for you?! 
                        Other than take, and take, and--

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        David, listen to reason! When our 
                        commercials air, the world 'round 
                        will finally see and hear the real 
                        you... witness your real acting! We 
                        can achieve our dreams without 
                        wickedness... 

           Dave looks between The Monster and Green Cross, devil and 
           angel...
           ...then glances back down at Stacy's card... the RED LIP 
           PRINT beckoning...

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER 

           Dave storms through the living room, trailed by Norma. 

                                 NORMA
                        Just for a couple hours, Dave! They 
                        want to see what their father does 
                        all day!

                                 DAVE
                        Ahh! So now that dad's gone and 
                        become a movie star, what with his 
                        own bloody fan club, now everyone's 
                        keen to support me? Where was this 
                        interest before, when I was--

                                 NORMA
                        Just an hour then. Lunch!

           He flies up the stairs, Norma right on his heels--

                                 DAVE
                        Absolutely out of the question. 
                        Highly unprofessional.

                                 NORMA
                        Mark Hamill brought his bloody two-
                        year-old to set last week!

           Dave reaches the top of the stairs, jets down a hallway-- 

                                 DAVE
                        How'd you know that?

                                 NORMA
                        It was in the Daily Mail!

                                 DAVE
                        Well Mark is an unprofessional 
                        tosser, and I'm not going to sink 
                        to--

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        I can't come tomorrow?

           Dave and Norma spin around to see Rachel (now 12) in her 
           pajamas, half-asleep, standing in her bedroom door.
                                 DAVE
                        I'm sorry munchkin. I wish you 
                        could.

           Rachel pouts.

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you at least coming to my play 
                        on Friday?

                                 DAVE
                        Of course. Now go back to sleep 
                        darling.

           Dave kisses her on the forehead, then ushers her back into 
           her room, and gently closes the door.

                                 DAVE
                             (to Norma, quietly)
                        What play?

                                 NORMA
                        Are you serious?! Your daughter has 
                        been talking about this non-stop 
                        for the past month.

                                 DAVE
                        Well I've been a little busy 
                        putting food on the table, I 
                        thought that's what you--

                                 NORMA
                        Why won't you let them come? Are 
                        you embarrassed by us? Are you 
                        ashamed of your own family?

                                 DAVE
                        Why now, eh Norma? Where was all 
                        this interest in my career, where 
                        was your support when I was just a 
                        nobody?

           Norma fights back tears...

                                 NORMA
                        You won't even set aside an hour to 
                        spend with your own children...

           ...then looks him straight in the eye:

                                 NORMA (CONT’D)
                             (coldly)
                        You're still a nobody. 
           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - THE NEXT DAY

           CLOSE ON-- Stacy the reporter, her voluptuous figure 
           struggling to breathe under a tight blouse and painted-on 
           mini-skirt. Basically Jessica Rabbit.

           She hangs on Dave's arm as they strut around set, a smug grin 
           plastered on his face. 

           Every eye drifts in her direction as the CREW labors away on 
           the GANTRY/CLOUD CITY set.

                                 DAVE
                        And this is where the big laser 
                        sword battle takes place.

                                 STACY
                        Wow. This is incredible.

                                 DAVE
                        I know.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - PR DEPARTMENT - LATER

           Dave leads Stacy into the PR office, swaggers up to a desk, 
           where an OFFICE WORKER taps away on a typewriter. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hello love, more prints for your 
                        superstar super-villain.

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        Oh. Mr. Prowse. Did--

                                 DAVE
                        Five-hundred this time. 

           He shoots a wink at Stacy.

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        I'm sorry, did Gary not inform you?

                                 DAVE
                        Inform me of what, love?

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        He's put a hold on all print 
                        orders.

                                 DAVE
                        And why has he done that?
                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        Well, he felt certain cast members 
                        were... taking advantage.

                                 DAVE
                        That's absurd... I-- I have an 
                        important signing event coming up, 
                        I need those prints, my fans--

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        You could always pay out-of-pocket 
                        for some copies of the ones you 
                        already have.

           Dave bristles at this.

                                 DAVE
                        Well then just a couple, for the 
                        lovely lady here.

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        I'm sorry Mr. Prowse. Gary was very 
                        clear--

           Dave grits his teeth, struggling to keep his cool...

                                 DAVE
                        You mean to tell me you can't print 
                        one bloody photo of your star-
                        villain for a die-hard fan who's 
                        doing a cover story feature profile 
                        of me for a major publication?

           OUTSIDE THE PR OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave leaves the office, empty-handed and humiliated, Stacy in 
           tow...

           He tries to shake it off:

                                 DAVE
                        Gotta conserve paper, you know. 
                        Can't go traipsing about cutting 
                        down entire forests willy-nilly 
                        just so superstar actors can have 
                        their photo prints.

           He shoots Stacy a smile, laughs nervously.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Say. You know what would be a real 
                        treat?
           CORNER OF THE SET - MOMENTS LATER

           Harrison REHEARSES lines under his breath:

                                 HARRISON
                        ...the Princess. You have to take 
                        care of her. You hear me? Huh? 

           Harrison closes his eyes, then PASSIONATELY TONGUE-KISSES THE 
           AIR for a long uncomfortable beat...

                                 HARRISON
                        I love you too.

           He grimaces at the line. Doesn't sound right.

           When Dave suddenly strides up, Stacy on his arm.

                                 DAVE
                        Harrison! I'd like you to meet s--

                                 HARRISON
                        Oh hey there! You must be Dave's 
                        nurse.

           ON DAVE-- at a loss. What's that supposed to mean?

           Harrison KISSES her hand, flashing a devilish smile... 

           Stacy looks like she might blow a fuse. In her pants.

                                 HARRISON
                        How's ol' Davie boy doing? I heard 
                        he was suffering from a pretty bad 
                        case of "shit for brains." That's 
                        not fatal is it?

           Dave forces a laugh. His voice comes out shaky and strained:

                                 DAVE
                        Haha! Quite the wit, Harrison!
                             (to Stacy)
                        You see, this is the sort of humour 
                        we enjoy on set. Friendly ribbing. 
                        Typically, I'd come back at him 
                        with an even sharper barb... 
                        something cutting, yet fraternal... 
                        like... ahhh... um...

           An awkward pause as Dave racks his brains for a comeback... 
           and comes up empty. 

           He shifts directions: 
                                 DAVE
                             (to Harrison)
                        She's a reporter, actually. Doing a 
                        feature profile on me for a major 
                        publication. Cover story.

                                 STACY
                             (flustered)
                        I'm Stacy... nice to meet you Mr. 
                        Ford... 
                             (to Dave)
                        Um, is there a ladies room nearby 
                        by any chance?

           Dave points off down a hallway.

                                 STACY
                        Excuse me--

           She trots away.

                                 DAVE
                        What do you think about that, eh?

           Harrison shrugs.

                                 HARRISON
                        She ain't a reporter.

                                 DAVE
                        Wanna bet?

                                 HARRISON
                        Nope.

                                 DAVE
                        All I know is, she's a fit bird and 
                        she's dying to get a piece of this.

           Dave FLEXES as hard as he can, dusting off one of his old 
           bodybuilding poses. His muscles BULGE like they might 
           explode...

           ON HARRISON-- not even close to impressed.

                                 OLD DAVE (PRE-LAP)
                        In his biography, Harrison Ford 
                        dismisses my seven-year involvement 
                        with the Star Wars saga in a single 
                        line...
           PRESENT DAY

           Dave snatches Harrison's book from a shelf--

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        ...where he refers to me as... 

           --flips to a highlighted passage:

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        ...and I quote, "David Prowse, the 
                        bodybuilder who played Darth 
                        Vader." 

           He SNAPS the book shut.

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Which really does annoy me. You 
                        know, Sir Laurence Olivier used to 
                        train regularly at a very well-
                        known gym in London, but you never 
                        hear of him being referred to as a 
                        bodybuilder. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        He also played Hamlet. Like fifty 
                        times.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        What's your point? 

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - CLOUD CITY GANTRY SET - LATER

           Vader and Luke DUEL with WOODEN SWORDS on the darkened set.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

           Stacy watches from the sidelines, eyes riveted on Dave/Vader.

           CRACK!!!!

           Luke's sword suddenly SNAPS in half.

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Cut!!! Damn it Dave!

           Production screeches to a halt.

                                 KERSH
                        I told you to cool it, stop 
                        breaking the god damn swords.
                                 DAVE/VADER
                             (muffled)
                        I can't help it, they're cheap 
                        pieces of shite, look--

           Dave SWINGS the sword around crazily, SLAMMING it against a 
           railing. It SHATTERS to pieces.

                                 KERSH
                        That's it!!! Off the set Dave! Bob, 
                        you're up!

           Bob Anderson, the stunt man, already in full Vader garb, 
           hurries onto set. 

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        What?! No! I can do it... Sorry, 
                        Kersh. I'm sorry... please...

           The two Vaders share an awkward look... 

           ...as dozens of exhausted crew members stare daggers at 
           Dave... a long strained silence passes...

           MOMENTS LATER

           Vader again BATTLES with Luke--

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

           --while Dave sulks in a chair on the sidelines.

           Stacy lounges beside him, barely concealing her 
           disappointment.

                                 STACY
                             (whispering)
                        How often does he take over like 
                        that?

           CRACK!

                                 DAVE
                        Rarely. Quite rarely. It's usually 
                        me in the costume...
                             (beat)
                        Although he does a tiny bit of the 
                        combat... but I do all the lines... 
                        every single one... all the 
                        important--

                                 FIRST A.D. (O.S.)
                        Shhhhhhhh!
           Dave immediately shuts up.

           Stacy eyes him, skeptical...

           LATER

           Stacy looks bored out of her skull, propping her head up with 
           her hands. Half-asleep.

                                 BOB/VADER
                        Obi-Wan has taught you well, you 
                        have controlled your fear.

           Bob's doing the lines now.

           Fuck.

           Dave shoots Stacy a nervous look.

           But she doesn't look back. Ignoring him completely.

           SEVERAL MORE EXCRUCIATING HOURS LATER

           Vader and Luke continue sparring.

           Vader points his wooden sword at a giant chunk of foam 
           debris--

           --and the CREW yanks some wires, sending it sailing across 
           the room, SLAMMING into Luke.

           ON THE SIDELINES-- Dave taps his foot impatiently...

           This is taking forever.

           Stacy glances at her watch, then offers Dave a tepid smile:

                                 STACY
                             (whispering)
                        I've gotta call my editor quick. 
                        Excuse me.

           In a flash, she's gone. Someone else quickly takes her seat:

           The Monster.

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Do not allow these half-men to 
                        render you impotent, David... You 
                        must wrest control of your own 
                        destiny...
                                 DAVE
                             (hushed)
                        But what can I do?! My hands are--

                                 FIRST A.D. (O.S.)
                        Shhhhhhhhh!

           The First A.D. glares at him: What the hell, Dave?!

                                 THE MONSTER
                        You disappoint me, David. Perhaps 
                        you were meant for obscurity... 
                        Perhaps you deserve to be 
                        forgotten...

           ON DAVE-- brooding, his pride wounded.

           He glances around set, then spots The Minotaur beside a 
           GIGANTIC WALL.

           It sways precariously, Bob/Vader directly below it...

           The Minotaur GESTURES to the floor: a few pathetic sandbags 
           struggle to support the wall's weight.

           If the sandbags were removed...

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Yes... now you see...

           In a trance, Dave slowly rises from his chair...

           ...then creeps towards the sandbags...

           ...drifting through the crowded set, unseen...

           When the Green Cross Code Man suddenly STEPS INTO HIS PATH--

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        Search your feelings, David, you 
                        can't do this. I feel the conflict 
                        within you...

           ON DAVE-- mind racing, struggling to make a decision...

                                 GREEN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        These people are your friends. They 
                        are a team... and you are a part 
                        of--

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Cut!

           Bob yanks his Vader mask off.
                                 BOB
                        Alright, I'm dying in this thing. I 
                        gotta take a break.

                                 KERSH
                        No prob, Bob. Dave, you're up!

           Green Cross BEAMS at Dave, victorious:

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        Huzzah!

           Dave GLARES at The Monster, appalled by what he almost 
           convinced him to do.

           The Monster scowls, then:

           POOF! Vanishes into thin air.

           LATER

           Dave lowers the Vader mask on, then takes his position on the 
           edge of the gantry.

           Luke clutches onto a platform beneath him as loud fans 
           suddenly WHIR to life.

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Action!

                                 DAVE/DARTH
                             (shouting)
                        If you only knew the power of the 
                        dark side! Obi-Wan never told you 
                        what happened to your father.

                                 LUKE
                        He told me enough! He told me you 
                        killed him!

                                 DAVE/DARTH
                        No... Obi-Wan killed your father.

           A long silence...

                                 KERSH (O.S.)
                        Great! Let's cut there! Marvelous. 
                        I think we got it.

           Crew pours onto set. The costumer pops off Dave's helmet as 
           Kersh strolls over and shakes his hand.
                                 KERSH
                        Nice work there, Dave. Exactly what 
                        we needed.

           Dave can't help but smile, his ego stroked by the compliment.

                                 KERSH
                        You know, you've been a real asset. 
                        Hope we get the chance to work 
                        together again sometime.

           Kersh squeezes his shoulder, then hurries off.

           ON DAVE-- bursting with pride...

           He looks around for Stacy...

           But her chair's still empty.

           She never came back. She missed the whole thing.

           CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave storms down corridor after corridor...

                                 DAVE
                        Stacy?!

           ...finally arriving at an open area where he spots:

           Stacy sneaking out of Harrison's trailer, giggling, adjusting 
           her blouse. She scampers off down a hallway--

           ON DAVE-- What the fucking fuck?

           A moment later, Harrison emerges, hair tousled, buckling his 
           belt. 

           Dave just stands there stupefied, seething with rage... 

           ...then RACES toward the trailer, his eyes afire--

           But Harrison spots him and scurries inside, SLAMMING the door 
           just in time--

                                 DAVE
                        Harrison! You cunt! I'll fucking 
                        kill you, you fucking cunt!!!

                                 HARRISON (O.S.)
                        Ooooh, I'm reeeally scared!
           Harrison's face pops up in a window. He flashes a shit-eating 
           grin, then FLICKS Dave off. 

           Dave turns BRIGHT RED, blind rage coursing through his veins. 
           He reaches for the trailer door--

           --he could easily rip it from its hinges, then tear Harrison 
           in half-- 

           --when Green Cross Code Man suddenly materializes:

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        Calm yourself, David. Forsake 
                        jealousy and rejoice in your 
                        virtuous triumph: Kersh is proud of 
                        you, you have your dignity, and 
                        your family is safe...

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Onstage, a hand-painted backdrop hangs behind cardboard cut-
           out scenery. 

           The audience is packed with eager parents waiting for the 
           play to start.

           Norma sits in the front row, tapping her foot anxiously. An 
           empty seat beside her.

           She glances over her shoulder at the entrance... then down at 
           her WATCH--

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           DAVE'S WATCH. He stares down at it as seconds tick past--

           INT. AUTOGRAPH CONVENTION - CONTINUOUS

           --then looks up at the LINE OF ADORING FANS snaking across 
           the convention hall. All eyes on him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Is there a problem, Mr. Prowse?

           Dave mulls something over... then:

                                 DAVE
                        Well... I could use a fresh pen. 
                        This one's a bit dry.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Of course, sir.
           Dave waves the next CLUSTER OF FANS over. They scurry up, 
           grinning ear-to-ear. 

           Dave POPS the cap off a fresh pen, and signs a MASKLESS PHOTO 
           with a theatrical flourish:

           "Dave Prowse IS Darth Vader"

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER THAT EVENING

           Dave creeps in, shuts the door quietly, then starts padding 
           up the stairs--

                                 NORMA (O.S.)
                        She doesn't want to see you.

           Norma sits cross-legged on the living room floor, nursing a 
           glass of wine, a magazine splayed open at her feet. She 
           doesn't even look up at him.

                                 DAVE
                        The signing went late, I tried to--

                                 NORMA
                        Save it.

           Dave's about to protest when he notices something on the 
           floor beside her:

           STACY'S BUSINESS CARD. The RED LIPSTICK PRINT faded and 
           warped, like it's been through the laundry.

                                 DAVE
                        Norma--

                                 NORMA
                        I'd rather not, David...

           Dave watches her for a long, sad beat... 

           ...then trudges up the stairs to:

           RACHEL'S BEDROOM DOOR 

           He knocks lightly.

                                 DAVE
                        Rachel?

           Silence.

                                 DAVE
                        Munchkin? Can I come in?
           Still nothing. 

           He nudges the door open, and peers inside:

           RACHEL'S ROOM

           Rachel's curled up in bed. She quickly turns away from him, 
           her cheeks streaked with tears.

           Dave kneels down beside her:

                                 DAVE
                        I'm so sorry darling, I tried to be 
                        there... 

           She stays silent.

                                 DAVE
                        Rachel?

                                 RACHEL
                        I don't want to be an actor 
                        anymore.

           She pulls the covers over her head... Dave stares down at her 
           tiny form... hidden beneath the blankets...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           KABOOM!!! An AT-AT WALKER hits the snowy ground HARD and 
           EXPLODES into a million pieces.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - "EMPIRE" PREMIERE - NIGHT

           A sea of TUXES and GOWNS gazes up at the opening battle scene 
           of "The Empire Strikes Back."

           We PAN through the crowd, face after face completely bowled 
           over by the special effects, finally landing on:

           Dave. Wearing a blank expression. Barely even watching. The 
           seat beside him empty. No Norma.

           ONSCREEN-- BOOM! A door is blasted to smithereens. Vader 
           emerges through the smoke into an icy hallway.

           Dave perks up--
           LATER

           ONSCREEN-- the mask-lowering scene in Vader's pod.

           In the audience, Dave watches closely, eyeing the side of 
           Vader's head, hoping for a glimpse of his face--

           --his heart races as the helmet gets lower--

           --lower and lower--

           --and then it's over. The helmet's back on. 

           Not a sliver of his face revealed.

           Dave slumps down in his seat. Foiled again.

           LATER

           Dave watches, rapt, as ONSCREEN-- 

           Luke climbs out onto the gantry, his hand freshly chopped 
           off, as Darth -- with the voice of James Earl Jones -- 
           intones from the platform:

                                 VADER
                        Obi-Wan never told you what 
                        happened to your father.

                                 LUKE
                        He told me enough. He told me you 
                        killed him.

                                 VADER
                        No... I am your father.

           The audience GASPS in disbelief. Minds blown. They have just 
           witnessed one of the biggest reveals in film history.

           ON DAVE-- Shell-shocked. Not the line he filmed on set. Kersh 
           lied to him. Just like the others...

                                 LUKE
                        No. That's not true. That's 
                        impossible!!!

                                 VADER
                        Search your feelings, you know it 
                        to be true.

           Dave starts to TREMBLE, a quiet rage slowly building deep 
           inside of him...
           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           A drunken Dave stumbles into his darkened house.

           All is quiet. 

           He staggers up the stairs, down the hall to his--

           STUDY

           --where he shoves the door open. Then goes pale:

           Green Cross is TIED TO A CHAIR in the middle of the room, 
           BOUND AND GAGGED, barely conscious, dried blood caked to his 
           face and neck.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He is of no use to us anymore, 
                        David.

           Dave spins around:

           The Monster and The Minotaur float behind him, GLOWING 
           BRIGHTER than they ever have before.

           A cold shiver runs down Dave's spine...

                                 DAVE
                        What have you done?

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Witness the treason your friend 
                        hath wrought--

           The Monster snaps his fingers and the TV flickers on. 

           ONSCREEN-- Dave's Green Cross Code commercial plays. It's 
           finally airing! 

           Dave stares at the screen, his expression a strange mixture 
           of excitement and fear...

           And then it happens:

                                 GREEN CROSS (ON T.V.)
                        Remember: stop, look and listen!

           It's not Dave's voice. 

           It's been overdubbed. Again.

           The Monster snaps his fingers and the TV clicks off.

           Dave turns to Green Cross, who WHIMPERS in the chair...
                                 DAVE
                             (barely a whisper)
                        You lied to me. You said they would 
                        hear my voice. 

                                 THE MONSTER
                        David. You know what must be done.

           The Monster slowly extends his hand, offering something:

           A LIGHTSABER.

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        The hate is swelling in you now. 
                        Take your weapon. Use it...

           Almost in a trance, Dave steps toward him...

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        Give in to your anger...

           Dave reaches out, clutches the weapon...

           ...as The Monster gestures to Green Cross, who now weeps 
           silently...

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        He is defenseless. 

           Dave IGNITES the lightsaber...

           ...its ELECTRIC HUM pulsing through the air...

           Green Cross tries to plead with him, his voice muffled 
           through the gag:

                                 GREEN CROSS
                        Please... don't...

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Strike him down with all of your 
                        hatred, and your journey towards 
                        the Dark Side will be complete!

           Dave closes his eyes tightly...

           ...slowly raises the lightsaber above his head...

           ...tears now streaming freely down his cheeks...

           ...he takes a deep breath...

           Then suddenly OPENS his eyes--
           --and brings the blade down with a TERRIBLE FURY--

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           BAM!!! 

           A PROP lightsaber blade SMASHES down on DARTH VADER.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           The Emperor's Throne Room set.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        Well Return of the Jedi, that was 
                        easily the worst film experience of 
                        my life...

           Director RICHARD MARQUAND (50s) shouts instructions at 
           Mark/Luke and Bob/Vader as they rehearse the final lightsaber 
           fight from "Return of the Jedi." 

           Dave hovers on the sidelines, seething.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        ...because we had a director, 
                        Richard Marquand, who didn't want 
                        to speak to me. At least on the 
                        first two, Gary gave me the time of 
                        day... but unfortunately, he and 
                        George parted ways for Jedi...

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - EVENING

           Dave eats dinner with his family in silence...

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        At that point, my family wouldn't 
                        have anything to do with Darth 
                        Vader... 

           Norma and Rachel both stare down at the table, refusing to 
           even look at Dave. He abruptly gets up, grabs his plate and 
           leaves.

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        ...Norma said Star Wars had been an 
                        intrusion into our life.

           INT. DAVE'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave eats alone, eyes vacant, as The Monster and The Minotaur 
           sign 8x10 glossies of him in costume: 
           "Dave Prowse IS Darth Vader."

                                 OLD DAVE (V.O.)
                        And on top of all of this, Richard 
                        started using my stuntman for all 
                        of the dialogue scenes, the scenes 
                        that I should've been doing... In 
                        fact, I was hardly even given any 
                        pages of the script...

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           Dave mopes around set, looking pale and numb...

           He spots the scene being shot: Bob/Vader struggling to throw 
           the Emperor over a railing-- 

           --when the wire rigging system malfunctions. For probably the 
           hundredth time.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Cut! Damn it! Alright, back to 
                        one...

           ON DAVE-- setting his jaw. This will not stand.

           He collars a nearby P.A.:

                                 DAVE
                        How long have they been at this?

                                 P.A.
                        All week.

           Dave SNORTS derisively.

           INT. WARDROBE DEPARTMENT - LATER

           The room is empty, except for Dave, who stares at himself in 
           the mirror as he carefully and methodically suits up as 
           Vader. 

           No help from his usual costumer.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave/Vader storms onto set, his cape flapping dramatically as 
           Bob/Vader again attempts the Emperor-toss. 

           Carrie watches from the sidelines, as Dave stomps right into 
           the shot, interrupting the take.
           Richard flies out of his chair:

                                 RICHARD
                        Cut!!! Why the fuck are there two 
                        Vaders in the shot? One Vader man-- 
                        should only be one Vader!

           Dave unceremoniously SHOVES Bob off the set--

                                 BOB
                        What the-- What are you doing, 
                        Dave?

           --then strides back up to the Emperor, and tears the STUNT 
           RIGGING/WIRES off him.

           He's going to do this shit for real.

           Without warning, he seizes the Emperor, hoists him up high--

           Richard looks around, confused... 

                                 RICHARD
                        Uhhhhh... action, I guess?

           Dave/Vader carries the Emperor to the edge, straining to keep 
           him aloft, using every ounce of his strength...

           ...closer and closer to the railing...

           ...when he suddenly WOBBLES--

           CLOSE ON-- Dave's knee, quivering, giving out... then:

           POP!!!

           Something SNAPS inside... his old Tuberculosis wounds RIPPING 
           WIDE OPEN--

           --but he doesn't stop... he grits his teeth, pushing through 
           the pain--

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        Ahhhhhhh!!!

           --then HURLS the Emperor over the edge.

                                 RICHARD
                        Cut!
                             (stunned)
                        Damn. That was perfect... Great, 
                        moving on.
           Dave RIPS the Vader helmet off, then LIMPS over to Richard, 
           shoves a finger in his face--

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        See! Same old shite. If you had 
                        included me from the start you 
                        would've saved hundreds of thousand 
                        of pounds. I can do this Richard!
                             (pounding his chest)
                        I am Darth Vader!!!

           He storms off, limping down a hallway--

           ON CARRIE-- watching him stagger away...

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           SWOOSH!!!

           Dave plunges his injured leg into a tub of ice water. Winces 
           in pain, struggling to hold back tears.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You ok?

           Carrie stands in the doorway, genuine concern in her eyes.

           Dave quickly wipes away his tears.

                                 DAVE
                        Fine. Not a big deal really. 

           Carrie proceeds with caution...

                                 CARRIE
                        Dave... if you were-- look, it's 
                        really none of my business, but 
                        maybe if you lightened up a little 
                        bit, tried to be a little nicer to 
                        people, you know--

                                 DAVE
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about? I am nice. I'm plenty nice.

           Carrie studies him for a long, sad beat... a broken man who 
           can't admit he's broken...

           She wants to say something... but knows it's a lost cause.

                                 CARRIE
                        Ok, Dave... I'll see you around.
           Dave just glares at her, waits for her to leave the room...

           ...then GRABS his knee, GRIMACING in pain--

           INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

           Dave, in street clothes, now wearing a METALLIC BACK/LEG 
           BRACE, lurches down the hall. Looking almost half-robot. 

           A nervous P.A. pads by, when Dave suddenly corners him.

                                 DAVE
                        Where's Richard?!

                                 P.A.
                        I-- I haven't seen him.

           Dave GRABS him by the shirt:

                                 DAVE
                        Why am I not getting more pages?!

           ON THE P.A.-- too scared to speak.

                                 DAVE
                        I am a major star of this film. I 
                        need to see the full script. Where 
                        is it!?

                                 P.A.
                        I don't-- I don't know.

           Suddenly, Dave spots a familiar face at the end of the hall:

           It's George. 

           For a moment, Dave's eyes soften... the ghost of a smile 
           flits across his face as he's transported back to an earlier, 
           happier time...

                                 DAVE
                        George!

           George spots him and cringes, then hurries off down the 
           hallway--

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        George!!! What are you--

           Dave LIMPS after him, moving as fast as he can in the brace--

           --but George remains just out of reach--
           --darting around corner after corner--

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I need to talk to you!!!

           --Dave's wearing down, running out of breath--

           --George hoofs it even faster, desperate to avoid him--

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Please! George!!!

           --when Dave suddenly trips, CLATTERING to the ground.

           ON DAVE-- his tormented face pressed against the floor, his 
           labored breathing receding into a steady, rhythmic pulse...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - EARLY MORNING

           CREAK, CREAK, CREAK--

           The studio lot is empty. Deserted.

           CREAK, CREAK--

           Dave marches around a corner munching a hardboiled egg, his 
           leg brace SQUEAKING with each step. Resolve in his eyes.

           The Monster and The Minotaur trail him as he approaches a 
           door.

           He JIGGLES the handle. Locked.

           He looks around to make sure he's alone, then GRIPS it again, 
           SQUEEZING it as hard as he can--

           SNAAAPPP!!!

           It breaks off. He KICKS the door open--

           CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave CREAKS down the empty halls of the studio.

           INT. HARRISON'S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           The trailer is a complete mess, dark and silent...

           The door suddenly flies OPEN:
           Dave LOOMS in the doorframe, a featureless silhouette. The 
           Monster and The Minotaur flanking him.

           Dim BLUE LIGHT falls across the floor...

           ...when Dave suddenly spots what he's looking for:

           A SCRIPT peeking from the debris.

           Dave snatches it--

           BAM! A distant studio door SLAMS.

           He freezes... listening for signs of movement... then 
           scurries out the door--

           INT. DAVE'S GARAGE - LATER

           Dave paces in the garage, madly flipping through the script, 
           reading... and reading... then suddenly stops.

           CLOSE ON the page. Several fragments jump out: "VADER...let 
           me look on you with my own eyes... Luke removes the mask from 
           his father's face... the dying man smiles..."

           Dave goes pale. The mask is finally off. For a real scene. 
           Moments before Vader dies. 

           This is it. His final chance for glory.

           There's no time to lose.

           INT. DAVE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave RACES to set, swerving through London traffic.

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - DAY

           Dave limps down corridors, weaving through crew members, all 
           hard at work. He grabs one of them:

                                 DAVE
                        Where's today's call sheet?

           Dave slams the CREW GUY against the wall.

                                 DAVE
                        Show me!

           The terrified CREW GUY digs around in his pocket, pulls out a 
           crumpled sheet of paper, hands it over.
           Dave scans it quickly...

           ...and his heart sinks.

           AN IMPOSING DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Four BURLY GUARDS loiter in front of it.

           Dave shuffles towards them, a desperate, broken man.

                                 MAIN GUARD
                        Sorry. Closed set.

                                 DAVE
                        I must get in. I'm supposed to be 
                        in there... I...

           Dave WAVES HIS HAND in front of the guard's face.

                                 DAVE
                        You will let me in.

           The guards exchange puzzled looks.

                                 MAIN GUARD
                        I will not. Strict orders.

           Dave peers over the guard's shoulder, through a small window 
           on the door.

           DAVE'S POV-- the final moments of Vader's death scene can 
           barely be seen through the hazy glass. Luke kneeling before a 
           maskless Vader, who's now being played by a new actor: 

           SEBASTIAN SHAW.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Cut! Wonderful!

                                 FIRST A.D. (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen that's a 
                        picture wrap on Mr. Sebastian Shaw!

           APPLAUSE ERUPTS on the other side of the door.

           ON DAVE-- he's too late. The blood drains from his face...

                                 THE MONSTER (O.S.)
                        There is but one option left, 
                        David... 

           Dave collapses to the ground in tears... 
           ...as The Monster kneels down and whispers, with venom:

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Their base deception must be repaid 
                        with malice tenfold...

           The words DISTORT and ECHO inside Dave's head... 

           ...as his sobs gradually transform into HEAVY RHYTHMIC 
           BREATHS...

           ...a rising CACOPHONY of madness, getting louder and louder 
           as we slowly PUSH IN on his tortured face...

           ...the noise reaching a DEAFENING CLIMAX...

           ...when he finally LOOKS UP--

           And ALL SOUND DROPS OUT.

           His eyes glint in the sunlight, now filled with a new, darker 
           purpose...

           INT. GEORGE'S PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

           George paces around the room -- which is stuffed wall-to-wall 
           with STAR WARS toys -- clutching a copy of THE DAILY MAIL.

           Dave sits before the desk, his eyes riveted on George, his 
           gaze unwavering, laser-focused...

           George tosses the PAPER onto the desk. THWOP!

           The headline reads: 

           "VADER TO BE KILLED OFF IN THE NEXT STAR WARS MOVIE - AN 
           EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH DAVE PROWSE"

                                 GEORGE
                        Darn it, Dave, how could you do 
                        this?!

                                 DAVE
                        I did nothing of the sort. How 
                        could I? I've no clue how the movie 
                        ends.

           George stares at him, dubious. 

           Dave continues, his voice calm and measured:
                                 DAVE
                        I've been given hardly any pages. 
                        In fact, I've barely even shot a 
                        single scene. Bob has been used 
                        almost exclusively. So I haven't 
                        the faintest idea what this film is 
                        even about.
                             (beat)
                        What happened was, the reporter 
                        called up, and he told me the 
                        ending... then he wrote an article 
                        to make it look like I was the one 
                        spilling the beans. It's utter 
                        nonsense.

                                 GEORGE
                        Harrison's missing his script.

                                 DAVE
                        Maybe he leaked it. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Why in God's name would he do that?

                                 DAVE
                        Because he's a wanker.

           George shakes his head.

                                 GEORGE
                        His trailer was broken into...
                             (beat)
                        ...and there were little bits of 
                        egg shells on the floor.

           ON DAVE-- unruffled.

                                 DAVE
                        That's odd.

           A heated silence passes... Dave changes the subject:

                                 DAVE
                        From very start, you never liked 
                        me, did you?

                                 GEORGE
                        I liked you just fine.

                                 DAVE
                        I've done nothing but contribute... 
                        I made Vader into an icon... I did 
                        it! And this is the thanks I get.
           George can't believe what he's hearing...

           The First A.D. suddenly peers into the office:

                                 FIRST A.D.
                        Bob sprained his ankle. We're gonna 
                        need Dave.

           Dave turns to George:

                                 DAVE
                        I suppose I'll get blamed for that 
                        one too, eh?

           INT. ELSTREE STUDIO - LATER

           A corridor on the "Endor" set. Vader stands before a CUFFED 
           LUKE, in custody of a COMMANDER and some STORMTROOPERS.

                                 COMMANDER
                        He was armed only with this.

           He hands Luke's saber to Vader.

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        Perhaps I shall shove it up his 
                        arse, and then turn it on. Would 
                        you like to watch Commander?

           CREW MEMBERS exchange puzzled glances, suppress chuckles. 

           Dave's now just saying offensive nonsense in place of Vader's 
           real dialogue. One last pathetic attempt at revenge.

           Carrie, Harrison, and Sir Alec watch from the sidelines. 
           Appalled at what Dave's become. 

           Mark and the other actors ignore Dave's improvisations, and 
           soldier on with the scene, as if everything's normal.

                                 COMMANDER
                        Yes, my lord.

           The commander and his stormtroopers exit.

                                 DAVE/VADER
                             (to Luke)
                        The Emperor desires to fondle your 
                        buttocks.

                                 LUKE
                        I know, Father.
                                 DAVE/VADER
                        So, I shall let him know you're 
                        interested then. Perhaps you shall 
                        be lovers.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        That's it!!!!!

           George BURSTS onto the set, on the verge of exploding.

                                 GEORGE
                        One more fucking word out of you 
                        and your career is over! Do you 
                        want that?!

           ON THE CREW-- a sea of stunned faces. They've hardly heard 
           George speak, let alone raise his voice.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I will fucking end you!!!! You're a 
                        speck of fucking dust. Okay? 
                        Nothing! I don't need this shit!!! 
                        You're a self-entitled little brat 
                        and I'm fucking through!!!

                                 DAVE/VADER
                        I--

                                 GEORGE
                        NOT ANOTHER WORD!!!!!!

           Dave shuts up. 

           The crew stands frozen in place.

                                 GEORGE
                        Richard, do the goddamn lines.

           Richard nods. Everyone resets the scene.

           George watches, red-faced, panting.

                                 RICHARD
                        Action.

                                 COMMANDER
                        He was armed only with this.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Good work commander... leave us.

           Dave silently mimes the part, beaten into submission. 

           Crushed.
           INT. ELSTREE STUDIOS - END OF THE DAY

           Cast and crew celebrate the final day of filming. Cheering 
           and hugging, high-fiving.

           Dave watches from across the room.

           A non-entity.

           He slinks out the door. 

           No one even notices.

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

           Dave shuffles down the sidewalk, lost and alone. His leg 
           brace creaking with each step.  

           The Monster and The Minotaur trail him. His only companions.

                                 THE MONSTER (PRE-LAP)
                        Despair not, David... Let us leave 
                        this unfortunate saga behind... 

           INT. DAVE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Dave sits in a dark corner, staring blankly at the remains of 
           the mannequin he previously destroyed. The Monster and The 
           Minotaur flank him, offering counsel:

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        The battle may be lost but the war 
                        rages on... others will come, with 
                        even greater roles... 

           Dave just stares at the mannequin's head... barely 
           listening...

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        The world will know us yet... it is 
                        our destiny...

           Dave suddenly snaps--

                                 DAVE
                        And what have you done for me?! 
                        Except goad me towards my own 
                        destruction and poison my mind! 

                                 THE MONSTER 
                        You still can't see it David? There 
                        is no you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE MONSTER  (CONT'D)
                        We are you and you are us, there is 
                        no escaping it, we shall be 
                        together forever--

                                 DAVE
                        No!!! Leave me!

           Dave grabs the mannequin's MOP HANDLE from the floor and 
           furiously HACKS AWAY at The Monster, but each blow PASSES 
           RIGHT THROUGH IT. Leaving the specter unscathed.

                                 THE MONSTER
                        Together we shall go forth into the 
                        world and smite our enemies with 
                        merciless violence!

           The Monster's voice rises into an evangelical fervor...

                                 THE MONSTER (CONT’D)
                        We shall steal upon our prey with 
                        silent tread, so that they might 
                        never detect the hands which plot 
                        their demise...

           Dave covers his ears--

                                 DAVE
                        Begone, fiends!!!!!!

                                 THE MONSTER
                        ...or we shall die valiantly in the 
                        glory of battle!!!!!!!!

           Dave suddenly emits a DEAFENING PRIMAL SCREAM--

           --RATTLING the tools on the workbench-- 

           --SHATTERING the lightbulb overhead---

           --and STORMS out of the garage, into the--

           STREET

           He rushes away, panting... 

           ...then suddenly stops.

           All is strangely quiet... 

           ...the sudden tranquility unsettling...

           ...he spins around:

           The streets are empty.
           The ghosts haven't pursued him.

           Has he won? 

           Has he finally banished his tormentors for good?

           He creeps back up the driveway and into the--

           GARAGE

           Darkness. He fumbles around for a flashlight... 

           ...finds one... 

           ...then FLICKS it on and RECOILS IN HORROR:

           The Monster and The Minotaur have been CUT TO PIECES. Their 
           SICKLY BLUE BODY PARTS strewn across the garage. Ghostly 
           blood drips from the walls.

           Dave tries to scream, but his voice catches in his throat... 
           his face frozen in a silent mask of sheer terror--

                                 OLD DAVE (PRE-LAP)
                        And like that...

           PRESENT DAY

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT'D)
                        ...it was over. 

           Old Dave stares off into the distance. Worlds away.

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT'D)
                        It ended cordially enough though. 
                        The shoot had been difficult, like 
                        I said, but I sensed no hard 
                        feelings. We ate some going-away 
                        cake, George and I shook hands, and 
                        that was that.

           ON THE INTERVIEWER-- smelling bullshit.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Really.

           He waits for a response. Nothing.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Well... you still haven't answered 
                        the question. 

           The interviewer speaks slowly and firmly:
                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        Dave, why do you think-- Why did 
                        George Lucas ban you from all 
                        official Star Wars events? There 
                        must be a reason.

                                 OLD DAVE 
                        And I've told you, I don't bloody 
                        know!
                             (beat)
                        You'd have to ask George. I 
                        definitely upset him at one stage 
                        or other and I do feel disappointed 
                        about that. But I honestly have no 
                        idea what I did wrong. 

           The interviewer just stares in disbelief. All of this 
           nonsense to end up exactly where he began, with no clear 
           answers.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Have you ever thought of simply 
                        apologizing?

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Apologizing for what?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        I think you know. You could 
                        apologize right now, here in this 
                        interview, and who knows? Perhaps 
                        it might mend things with George, 
                        perhaps it might... give you some 
                        peace of mind?

           Dave stands his ground.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I haven't done anything that 
                        warrants an apology. 

           He fixes a steely glare on the interviewer:

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I didn't leak the bloody ending.

           The interviewer holds his gaze... Dave stares him down, eyes 
           afire... even his droopy eye remains steady...

           The interviewer finally sighs, gives up.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        What about the new film? Do you 
                        even think you'll see it?
           This strikes a nerve.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Hmmm, let me see: Those behind it 
                        have cut me out and have continued 
                        to ignore me for years, I've never 
                        had a call from anyone to be in it, 
                        nobody even bothered to get in 
                        contact with me to ask about my 
                        association with it... 

           His begins quivering, anger slowly rising...

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        And when the new film was being 
                        made, they had a big party to 
                        launch it and I never got invited. 
                        Which is strange as Darth Vader is 
                        the most important character. So do 
                        I have any interest in watching it? 
                        No, I don’t.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Did you have any fun making Star 
                        Wars? Anything at all you remember 
                        fondly?

           Dave thinks for a long moment, then cracks a smile.

                                 OLD DAVE 
                        Easy. Getting paid. 

           He chuckles. No one else does.

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        But no, I mean, I had a nice 
                        experience... I enjoyed working 
                        with George Lucas, and Gary Kurtz 
                        the producer was very pleasant.

           The interviewer can barely contain his exasperation.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        You're serious. You've just spent 
                        the past two hours talking about 
                        how they took advantage--

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Now don't go twisting my words. 
                        That's the problem with talking to 
                        you lot, you always end up making 
                        me sound like I'm something I'm 
                        not. 
           A charged beat...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        And what are you?

           Dave's eyes GLEAM with a hint of madness.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        I'm the ultimate screen villain of 
                        all time.

           A long moment of unsettling silence...

           LATER

           The film crew wraps up. Takes down lights. Coils cables.

           Dave watches them pack in silence.

                                 OLD DAVE
                        So when does this air?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Honestly? I'm not sure it will. 

                                 OLD DAVE
                        And why's that?

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Not sure if there's enough 
                        interest.

           Ouch. That stings. 

           Dave suddenly snatches his CANE and shakily stands, barely 
           able to hold himself upright. 

                                 OLD DAVE
                        Right then. Well, thanks for 
                        coming, off you go. 

           Dave starts shooing them out, staggering towards the door 
           with his cane.

                                 OLD DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Off you go now...

           AT THE DOORWAY

           The interviewer turns to Dave... and looks deep into his sad, 
           haunted eyes: Whatever man once occupied this body is barely 
           there now. 
           He's about to say something... then decides against it.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Goodbye Dave.

           Dave just stares at him blankly for a beat...

           ...then shuts the door.

           LATER

           Dave sits alone in his upholstered chair, dozing. The house 
           now dark and perfectly silent.

           He suddenly wakes with a start. Check his watch: it's late.

           He peels himself from the chair, grabs his cane, and shuffles 
           towards the staircase.

           Then gently hooks the cane on the railing, and starts 
           climbing the stairs, carefully, slow as a snail, when--

           --a sharp pain suddenly shoots through his knee, he wobbles--

           --then loses his footing, and tumbles to the floor. THUD!

           He GROANS... his breathing labored, heavy... 

           ...then makes a feeble attempt to pull himself to his feet... 
           but it's useless, he's too weak...

           ...he reaches for the hanging cane... but it's just out of 
           his grasp... 

           ...he squeezes his eyes shut in concentration, reaches out 
           again, as if willing it to come to him...

           ...but it's no use. The cane gently rattles against the 
           bannister, mocking him...

           He gives up, slumps to the ground--

           --and lies there in defeat, the house dead quiet.

           A long, silent moment passes...

           ...then a floorboard suddenly CREAKS.

           He cranes his neck to get a look...

                                 OLD DAVE 
                        Norma?
           ...another CREAK... 

           ...and another...

           ...then a BLACK BOOT steps into view... and Dave looks up:

           DARTH VADER towers over him, in all his terrifying glory. 
           BLUE and TRANSLUCENT, just like the other ghosts.

           His empty eyes impossible to read...

           Vader slowly crouches down...

           ...then scoops Dave into his arms... lifts him up...

           ...cradling him like a child...

           TIME SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN as Vader carries him up the stairs... 
           each step powerful and deliberate... 

           ...the ONLY SOUND Vader's mechanical, rhythmic breathing...

           INT. DAVE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Vader gently sets Dave onto the TWIN-SIZE BED...

           ...pulls the blankets up under his chin...

           ...kneels down beside him... staring right into his eyes...

           ...then reaches his gloved hand out and BRUSHES DAVE'S HAIR 
           FROM HIS FOREHEAD. Just like Dave used to do for Rachel.

           Dave smiles up at the soulless mask... 

           It seems to cast a strange spell over him, as if he's being 
           called back to some distant dream... 

           ...Vader's BREATHING seems to grow LOUDER... and LOUDER... 
           OVERTAKING ALL SOUND... becoming DEAFENING...

           ...as we PUSH IN ON THE MASK... gazing down, unwavering, 
           Dave's haunted face reflected in its DARK, GLASSY EYES--

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

                                          THE END
