           OVER BLACK:

           The spark of a lighter - A crackling singe - Bubbling water...

           MUSIC CUE: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre’s - The Recipe fades up. 

           EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - NIGHT

           A 1930’s bungalow in desperate need of repair. The lawn’s 
           overgrown, windows barred and shades blacked out.

           The water continues to bubble over the music.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hit that shit homie.

           The sound of lungs sucking back smoke.

           INT. KITCHEN - GROW HOUSE - SAME

           A cloud of smoke fills the frame. As it dissipates, we see--

           ASHLEIGH TAYLOR (black/20s), a lipstick tomboy, bobbing to 
           the beat in an I Smoke LA tank top. A rip on the iconic I 
           Heart NY, with the heart replaced by a pot leaf. 

           She’s looking at someone across the table. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Well?

           Angle on two white guys, JEFF and ERIC (late-20s), preppy in 
           polos with Harvard Crimson caps. Jeff’s holding a BUBBLER.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s that good shit.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Home grown hybrid I’m calling King 
                        Tut. You’ll feel it in your face.

                                 ERIC
                        Got us a would-be herbologist.

           Eric stands, as she corrects him.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Nothing would-be about it, and the 
                        proper term is cultivator.
                                 JEFF
                        I’ll call you whatever you want, as 
                        long as I get some of this.

           Ashleigh slides a dime bag across the table.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        That’s it?

           She looks over at Eric tugging on a LOCKED DOOR. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Read the sign.

           He looks at the door, but nothing’s there.

                                 ERIC
                        Where’s your bathroom?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                             (Points)
                        That way.

           Ashleigh walks over and picks a piece of paper up off the 
           floor, the sign reading -- KEEP OUT -- and tacks it back up.

                                 JEFF
                        Can I get an ounce?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Dimes and samples from here on out.

                                 JEFF
                        Come on Ash, don’t do me like that.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Got an investor, taking my talents 
                        legit.

                                 JEFF
                             (Genuine surprise)
                        Really... Who?

           Jeff takes a monster hit and almost coughs up a lung.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Why? You wanna buy in?

                                 JEFF
                        How much we talking?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Two fifty.
           He coughs again, blanching at the number.

                                 JEFF
                        Let me think about it.

           INT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - LATER

           The music’s mellowed, the guys walking out the front door.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Gonna think it over, right?

           Jeff’s polite, but has no intention of giving it a second 
           thought.

                                 JEFF
                        Absolutely.

           They shake and she closes the door.

           INT. AUDI - NEXT

           The guys slide in, Eric examining the dime bag.

                                 JEFF
                        Any seeds?

           Eric nods.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Can you clone it?

           He sniffs the nuggets, smiling ear to ear.

                                 ERIC
                        Most definitely.

           INT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - SAME

           Ashleigh walks over to the Locked Door, opening it to reveal 
           a veritable JUNGLE on the other side.

           INT. GARAGE - GROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A garage converted GROW, with six-foot-tall MARIJUANA PLANTS 
           cooking under the pink glow of full spectrum LED lamps.

           Fans circulate the air, while PVC pipes irrigate the plants.
           Ashleigh takes out a small pair of scissors and trims the 
           buds, caring for the plants like they’re her own children.

           Suddenly, one of the lights flickers and goes dark. She tests 
           the socket -- It’s dead. 

           Ashleigh runs an extension cord from a POWER STRIP inundated 
           with plugs, connects it and the light flickers back to life.

           We hold on the Power Strip as she leaves, a small spark 
           jumping from the slew of plugs tapped into it.

           INT. BEDROOM - GROW HOUSE - LATER

           Ashleigh’s fast asleep in an empty bedroom, no furniture 
           aside from her floor bound mattress.

           Suddenly--

           ERRRR - ERRRRR - ERRRR - ERRRR

           The smoke alarm sounds.

           Ashleigh crawls out of bed and crosses to the door to find 
           SMOKE creeping in through the bottom.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What the hell?

           She opens it and--

           A BLACK CLOUD RUSHES IN

           She coughs as smoke fills her lungs.

           INT. HALLWAY - GROW HOUSE - NEXT

           Ashleigh stays low, hurrying down the hall to discover--

           FLAMES RACING UP THE WALLS

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Oh my God.

           She runs to the kitchen and grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, pops 
           the pin like a grenade and takes aim--

           SWOOSH

           Foam hits the flames, but it has little effect. The fire 
           climbing the walls and catching the ceiling.
                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no...

           Ashleigh runs over to the Locked Door and grabs the handle, 
           but it burns her hand--

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           She wraps her sweatshirt sleeve around her other hand and 
           opens the door--

           WHOOSH

           Fresh oxygen feeds the flames.

           Ashleigh coughs as black smoke billows from the Grow, flames 
           eating away at the walls and dancing across the ceiling.

           Time slows... 

           She looks around as the fire gains in heat and intensity.

           Ashleigh glances behind her, the back door her only way out.

           She takes one last look at her precious plants and bolts.

           EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - LATER

           FIREMEN are battling the blaze, while NEIGHBORS watch from 
           behind a wooden barricade.

           A FIRE MARSHAL approaches the crowd.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Anybody live here?

           The Neighbors all shake their heads.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL (CONT’D)
                        Anyone at all?

           Ashleigh’s standing at the back of the crowd, watching in 
           despair as the flames consume her crop.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

                                                   TITLE UP: GREEN RUSH
           EXT. PRISON YARD - FCI TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           INMATES are mingling in self-segregated cliques -- Crips, 
           Bloods, MS-13, Aryan Brotherhood...

           Jogging the wall away from the crowd is LU TAYLOR (black/40s), 
           a hackneyed, loner of an inmate, averse to that clan mentality.

           He locks eyes with a GUARD, who nods as he passes.

           Lu glances over his shoulder as the Guard turns his back and 
           a TENNIS BALL flies over the wall.

           Lu scoops it up and shoves it down his prison issued pants.

           INT. CHOW LINE - FCI TERMINAL ISLAND - LATER

           Lu’s behind the line, plating food for the lunch crowd.

                                 LU
                        Chicken or veg?

                                 INMATE 1
                        Chicken. 

                                 LU
                        Chicken or veg?

                                 INMATE 2
                        Chicken.

           He passes the plates over the sneeze guard.

                                 LU
                        Chicken or veg?

                                 INMATE 3
                        Veg.

           The magic word. Lu drops a nickel bag under the veggie entree 
           and passes it across. The Inmate moves on, no one the wiser.

           Another INMATE working beside Lu whispers.

                                 INMATE 4
                        Yo, you got any smack?

                                 LU
                        Know I don’t fuck with that poison.

                                 INMATE 4
                        Help a brother out.
                                 LU
                        Get out of here with that help a 
                        brother. Go on and help yourself.

           INT. PRISON CELL - FCI TERMINAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Lu’s on the bottom bunk scanning a thick packet, while his 
           CELLMATE reads above him.

                                 CELLMATE
                        Know what you’re gonna say?

                                 LU
                        Been rehearsing for months.

           Lu lays the packet across his chest and we see the title--

           LUIS TAYLOR - PAROLE PACKAGE 

                                 CELLMATE
                        Remember your yes sirs and no sirs.

                                 LU
                        Yes sir.

           His Cellmate snickers, as Lu gazes at a few old PHOTOS taped 
           to the bottom of the top bunk. 

           One of a YOUNG WOMAN (black/20s), holding a NEWBORN, another 
           of a YOUNG GIRL (black/9-10) and a third more recent image of 
           a YOUNG MAN (black/20s).

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Call’em whatever they want, as long 
                        as they sign my release.

                                 CELLMATE
                        I’ll be praying on it.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - FCI TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           Lu is seated across from the PAROLE BOARD, fidgeting in his 
           chair, nervous despite all his preparation.

                                 MEMBER 1
                        Very impressive. I can’t remember 
                        the last time we received a 
                        document this thorough.

                                 LU
                        I’m sincere about my 
                        rehabilitation... Sir.
                                 MEMBER 1
                        Two prior convictions for second 
                        degree robbery and a third strike 
                        for intent to distribute--

                                 LU
                        Marijuana sir. All three were non-
                        violent and my third strike came a 
                        decade after time served for the 
                        first two. Done twelve years for it.

                                 MEMBER 2
                        Mr. Taylor, are you aware that 
                        without recent changes to the law, 
                        you wouldn’t be here today?

                                 LU
                        I am Ma’am and grateful.

           The Members stare back, their expressions impossible to gauge.

                                 MEMBER 3
                        What do you plan to do if released?

                                 LU
                        Spent almost half my life inside 
                        these walls. Gonna work hard at 
                        whatever I find and try my best to 
                        make up for lost time. My daughter’s 
                        full grown. I’d like the chance to 
                        get to know her.

           Lu scans their faces, just as inscrutable as they were before.

           Prelap: BEEP - BEEP - BEEP

           EXT. FCI TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           The prison gates open, Lu standing behind them in street 
           clothes, holding a plastic bag. 

           He breathes deep and takes his first steps as a semi-free man 
           in over a decade.

           INT. HALFWAY HOUSE - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - AFTERNOON

           Lu drops the plastic bag with all his worldly possessions on 
           a naked twin mattress that’s covered in stains. 

           The room not much of an upgrade from his prison cell.

           Lu’s P.O. is a grungy guy (white/50s), bitter about his place 
           in the world.

           He hands Lu a slip of paper.

                                 P.O.
                        Work release, here’s the address.
                        If you’re a no show, I’ll hear 
                        about it and you’ll be one step 
                        closer to the can. Understood?

           Lu nods.

                                 P.O. (CONT’D)
                        Check in once a week, phone’s okay. 
                        I don’t hear from you, the cops 
                        hear from me. That clear?

                                 LU
                        Crystal.

                                 P.O.
                        Something on your mind?

           Lu shakes his head.

                                 P.O. (CONT’D)
                        Then get the hell outta here.

           Prelap: KNOCK - KNOCK - KNOCK

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - AFTERNOON

           Another window barred bungalow with a clean paint job. The 
           lawn and bushes recently trimmed.

           KEISHA (40s), the woman from Lu’s photo, but over a decade 
           older, answers the door like she’s just seen a ghost.

                                 KEISHA
                        When’d you get out?

                                 LU
                        Yesterday.

           She sizes him up -- Prison fit beneath his old clothes.

                                 KEISHA 
                        What took you so long?
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - KEISHA’S HOUSE - NEXT

           Lu and Keisha are sprawled out on twisted sheets, making love 
           like it’s their honeymoon.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - KEISHA’S HOUSE - LATER

           The two are lying on their backs, catching their breath.

                                 LU
                        Feel like I’m fifteen.

                                 KEISHA
                        Fuck like it too.

           He laughs as Keisha slides on a shirt.

                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        Where you staying?

                                 LU
                        Halfway house. Gave me work 
                        release. Gonna fly straight.

                                 KEISHA
                        That’ll last.

           Lu takes offense, but doesn’t argue.

                                 LU
                        Thanks for the letters.

                                 KEISHA
                        Only pen pal I’ve ever had.

                                 LU
                        Lingerie shots were a nice touch.

                                 KEISHA
                        Stop...

           The conversation grows stale. A moment they’ve both dreamt 
           about, spoiled by the harsh reality of expectations.

                                 LU
                        Ash still living here?

                                 KEISHA
                        Moved out almost a year back.

           There’s a heaviness in Keisha’s voice that Lu can’t place.
                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        Always wanted to be like her daddy.

           INT. BEDROOM - KEISHA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Lu’s looking around a teen girls bedroom. Posters and magazine 
           clippings taped to the wall -- PTAF and Kendrick Lamar...

           He closes in on some photos taped to the headboard, ASHLEIGH 
           at different ages, playing and posing with friends.

           Keisha’s in the doorway, fully dressed.

                                 KEISHA
                        Called you a Lyft.
                             (Off his look)
                        It’s like a cab.

                                 LU
                        Think I read about those.

                                 KEISHA
                        It’s ten past five...
                             (A beat)
                        My husband’s coming home.

           The words husband and home are like a knife in Lu’s side.

           He looks at a high school graduation photo -- Keisha, 
           Ashleigh and a straight faced MAN who must be her husband.

                                 LU
                        Nine to five guy?

                                 KEISHA
                        Might not be flashy, but at least I 
                        know he’s coming home.

           Lu gestures to the photos.

                                 LU
                        Alright if I take one?

           Keisha nods and he plucks one off, walking towards the front 
           door, when-- 

                                 KEISHA
                        Lu...

           He turns back, expectant.

                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll go and see her, yeah?
                                 LU
                        First chance I get.

           EXT. GROW HOUSE - CREWNSHAW - MORNING

           A burnt out skeleton of 2x4’s. Black ash covering the lawn 
           like demonic snowflakes.

           Special Agent ROSANNA CORTES (Latin/mid-30s), pant suit 
           serious, makes her way over to the Fire Marshal.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Cortes, DEA.

           She extends a hand, they shake, but he doesn't look happy.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Been waiting on you over two hours.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Didn’t have enough to do?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        You’re gonna love this.

           EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - NEXT

           The Fire Marshal leads Rosanna to the edge of the house where 
           the garage once stood.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Looks like we got us a Grow.

           Rosanna bends down, scanning the charred remains.

                                 ROSANNA
                        That what caused it?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Power strip. Too many cables, not 
                        enough juice. Thought it was a 
                        squatter til we dug around here. 
                        Think they’d be more careful.

           She picks up a blackened stalk.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Forensics go over this area?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Been waiting on you, like I said.
                                 ROSANNA
                        Dive in. Let me know if they find 
                        anything traceable. Phones, 
                        computers, receipts, shit like that.

           Rosanna hands him her card and turns to go, when--

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        How much you think it’s worth?

           She looks over the remains, counting the burnt out pots.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Sixty, seventy plants... Half-a-
                        mil, give or take.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Think they got State Farm?

                                 ROSANNA
                        My guess... Not even a real name on 
                        the property title.

           INT. ASHLEIGH’S CAR - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - MORNING

           Ashleigh’s parked with the engine off, her face wrecked from 
           the sleepless night.

           Her phone vibrates on the passenger seat. She glances at the 
           screen -- STEVEN -- and a nervous look envelops her face.

           She lets it ring, afraid to answer, but picks it up at the 
           last second.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Hey...

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        Ash?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Yeah, it’s me.

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        Thank God. Are you hurt?

           Relief washes over her.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        No, I’m alright.

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        Where are you? What hospital?
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I’m not. I got out.

           There’s silence on the other end of the line.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Steven... You there?

           He responds, his voice different, cold and calculated.

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        Why didn’t you call?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I... I don’t know--

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        We’re partners, aren’t we?

           She starts to tremble.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Yeah, I just--

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        I called a friend at the department 
                        when I didn’t hear from you. Do you 
                        know what he told me?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        No.

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        He said it was an overwhelmed outlet. 
                             (A beat)
                        I thought that can’t be my Ashleigh, 
                        she wouldn’t be so careless.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I don’t know how it happened. I was 
                        asleep--

                                 STEVEN (PHONE)
                        We’ll discuss it when you come by.

           By the look on her face, that’s the last thing she’s gonna do.

                                 STEVEN (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make me come looking. Neither 
                        one of us wants that.

           A tear tumbles down Ashleigh’s cheek as the line goes dead.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - LATER

           Jeff is walking Ashleigh through a massive GROW operation, 
           filled with rows upon rows of Marijuana plants. 

                                 JEFF
                        Impressive, right?

           Ashleigh looks around, envious.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Very...
                             (A beat - Nervous)
                        You give any thought to what we 
                        talked about?

                                 JEFF
                        It hasn’t even been a day Ash--
                             (Off her grimace)
                        Look... all of our capital is tied 
                        up in this place. We might be able 
                        to bring on another grower in six 
                        months if you’re interested.

           Ashleigh’s desperate.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I’m looking for a partner, if it’s 
                        more equity...

                                 JEFF
                        What happened to your investor?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We’re doing a second round--

           She stops dead in her tracks when she spots a row of recently 
           planted pots labeled -- KING TUT.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        You steal my seeds?

           Jeff’s face falls. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hold on, I can explain--

           Ashleigh’s desperation turns to rage.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You stole my strain and didn’t even 
                        bother to change the name?
                                 JEFF
                        Hey, wait a second--

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        That’s infringement. I’ll sue your 
                        ass.

           Jeff’s demeanor changes and he goes on the offensive.

                                 JEFF
                        Sue. Us. Over what? An illegal grow 
                        you built in your garage?

           Ashleigh’s rage is undercut by the harsh reality of her 
           situation. She has no leverage.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Get real Ash, you’re punching above 
                        your weight here.

           She knocks over a few pots and storms out of the building.

                        You can kiss that job offer goodbye!

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Lu’s gazing at a NEON GREEN CROSS glowing above a storefront.

           MUSIC CUE: Ice Cube’s - Smoke Some Weed.

           INT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - NEXT

           There’s a SECURITY GUARD standing right inside the entrance.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I.D. please.

           Lu hands him his I.D. and looks around, his face like 
           Dorothy's when she first set foot in Oz.

           The place is like an herbal Apple store, with sleek wooden 
           tables and glass display cases containing every strain of 
           Marijuana you can imagine.

           He approaches a wall display, reading the labels of Cannabis 
           candies that look like M&M’s, Jolly Ranchers and Reeses Cups.

                                 LU
                        Well I’ll be damned...
           Millennial BUD TENDERS are waiting on Millennial CUSTOMERS, 
           all of them white except the Security Guard and one of the 
           girls behind the counter with her back to us.

           Lu’s the only person over 40 in the entire place.

           He surveys the scene some more, not a single Customer appears 
           to have any recognizable ailment, except for one--

           A WOMAN in a head scarf, missing her eyebrows.

           Lu steps in line, zeroing in on Customers exchanging twenties, 
           fifties and hundred dollar bills for tiny green pill bottles.

           His eyes are drawn to the CASHIER, removing her drawer from 
           the register and carrying it down a short hall to a back room.

           He watches her close, as decades old instincts kick in. 

           The Cashier knocks and the door opens, revealing the OWNER 
           (white/40s), behind a desk with a SAFE built into the wall.

                                 OWNER
                        Close the door.

           She does and Lu cases the place -- Safe, security cameras, 
           entrances and exits... An old pro planning a heist in his head.

           INT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - NEXT

           Lu reaches the front of the line and a Bud Tender greets him.

                                 BUD TENDER
                        How can I help you?

                                 LU
                        Alright if she does?

           Lu gestures towards-- 

           ASHLEIGH

           The Bud Tender that had her back to us.

                                 BUD TENDER
                        Customer Ash.

           Lu looks down at the Display Case as Ashleigh walks over.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        How can I help you?
                                 LU
                        I’m not sure exactly, it’s been 
                        awhile.

           She leans down and pulls out a sample tray. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We carry over 150 varieties grown 
                        all over the state. Hogs Breath is 
                        a sativa blend from the central 
                        valley. This is a Pineapple Rhino, 
                        which is my personal favorite. Give 
                        it a smell.

           Ashleigh holds it out like some sort of pot Sommelier and 
           meets Lu’s gaze, recognizing him for the first time.

           She goes quiet as they hold each others stare. Surprise, joy, 
           fear, anger - A mix of emotions swirling around inside of her.

           She takes a moment to collect herself, struggling to find 
           words and not break down in front of her Co-Workers.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        We also have an Alaskan Thunderfuck 
                        and our top seller is a Girl Scout 
                        Cookie indica. 

                                 LU
                        Wanna try the candy, since I don’t 
                        like the smell.

           She nods, doing everything she can to remain professional.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You like sweet or savory?

                                 LU
                        A little bit of both.

           She pulls out some options, M&M’s, Brownie Bites, Lollipops...

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We strongly recommend sticking to 
                        the portion size listed on the back 
                        of the bag.

           Lu looks at the display case, troubled.

                                 LU
                        Know a lotta guys who got time for 
                        a whole lot less.

           She finally breaks, tears welling in her eyes.
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Yeah, me too...

           An emotional moment lingers, so much going unsaid.

                                 LU
                        Pack of M&M’s and a few of those 
                        lollipops.

           She rings him up as he hands her a twenty and a slip of paper.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Where you can find me... If you 
                        wanna grab a coffee and talk.

           EXT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - DAY

           A bleak desert of a boulevard, concrete stretching on forever.

           Lu’s staring at the slip of paper from his Parole Officer, 
           the address matching the run down DINER in front of him.

           There’s a sign in the window pushing a $9.95 DINNER SPECIAL.

           INT. WASHROOM - DINER - LATER

           A BUS BOY drops a tub of dishes beside the sink. Lu rinses 
           them off and stacks them in a tray that he sends through the 
           washer, when another Bus Boy drops a new tub beside him.

           INT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - LATER

           The MANAGER’S door is open, Lu knocks.

                                 LU
                        Gonna take my break.

           The Manager’s at a small desk, the office more like a closet.

                                 MANAGER
                        What break?

           He doesn’t look up from his old desktop computer.

                                 LU
                        I’ve been going at it eight hours 
                        straight.

                                 MANAGER
                        Need you to clean the bathrooms 
                        before the dinner rush.
                                 LU
                        What rush?

           The Manager smolders.

                                 MANAGER
                        Come here. Close the door.

           Lu steps inside and does as he’s told.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Your P.O. and I have come to an 
                        understanding. I take care of him 
                        and he gives me guys like you. Guys 
                        that do what I say or I call him up 
                        and tell’em they’re selling coke to 
                        the server’s... That what you want?

           The Manager stares him down, no response necessary.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Good. I’m glad we could come to an 
                        understanding. 
                             (Back to the computer)
                        Mop’s out back.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - DINER - NEXT

           A tattered old mop is sitting in a bucket of brown water. Lu 
           stares at it as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a 
           pot lollipop that he tucks under his tongue.

           INT. BATHROOM - DINER - LATER

           Lu’s mopping away with a grin, the job much easier to bear.

           INT. OFFICE - ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - AFTERNOON

           Banded bundles of cash are spread out on the desk, the Owner 
           organizing them while Ashleigh watches.

                                 OWNER
                        We can’t work with an unlicensed 
                        grow. Regulators are begging for 
                        reasons to shut shops down.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Wouldn’t be unlicensed if you 
                        invested.
                                 OWNER
                        We’ve got a surplus of suppliers 
                        already. I get ten calls a week 
                        from new farms trying to break in.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        But you’d own a piece of this one.

           The Owner sighs and leans back in his chair.

                                 OWNER
                        We don’t have the money Ash--

           Ashleigh gestures to the bundles of cash on the desk.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What’s that?

                                 OWNER
                        This? Our monthly tax bill. All of 
                        it goes right in Uncle Sam’s pocket.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Jesus...

                                 OWNER
                        Crazy we’re still paying in cash, 
                        while every other business on the 
                        planet pays by check or a wire.

           Ashleigh’s eyes suddenly light up, a revelation crashing over 
           her like a wave.

                                 OWNER (CONT’D)
                        To be honest Ash, I’m not all that 
                        interested in cultivation. Sorry.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        No worries, I understand.

           She gets up and walks out, pulling the slip of paper Lu gave 
           her from her pocket.

           INT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - LATER

           The place is empty, Muddy Waters - Champagne & Reefer playing 
           on the radio while Lu mops up.

           The bell on the door chimes and -- ASHLEIGH -- steps inside.
           INT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - NEXT

           Lu and Ashleigh are in a booth with slices of pecan pie in 
           front of them.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        How’s it feel?

           Lu considers the question.

                                 LU
                        Been inside so long, not sure if I 
                        know how to function just yet.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        It’s a shame... Locked up all that 
                        time and when you get out, it’s not 
                        even a crime anymore.

           The Manager pops his head in.

                                 MANAGER
                        These dishes aren’t gonna wash 
                        themselves.

           Lu glances over his shoulder.

                                 LU
                        Be right there.

           He turns back to Ashleigh, taking her in.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Last time I seen you, you still had 
                        your baby teeth.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Never let me visit.

                                 LU
                        That’s no place for a child. Didn’t 
                        want you to see me like that.

           She frowns and looks around. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        This what you wanna be doing with 
                        the rest of your life?

                                 LU
                        Hoping it’s temporary.
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What kind of job you gonna get with 
                        three strikes on your record.

           Lu’s taken aback.

                                 LU
                        Haven’t been out long enough to 
                        think about it.

           Ashleigh’s expression turns mischievous.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What if you could get back at them? 
                             (Off his look)
                        What if we could get back at them, 
                        together?

           Lu looks her in the eye, curious.

                                 LU
                        Get back at who?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        The people that put you away.

           He plays along, not wanting to scare her off.

                                 LU
                        Can’t fight City Hall.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        That’s funny.

                                 LU
                        What is?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You’ll see... If you come check out 
                        this score I’m casing. 

           Lu turns serious.

                                 LU
                        Retired from thieving a long time 
                        ago, before you were born.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        These people have no clue what 
                        they’re sitting on.
                                 LU
                        You’ve got a job, a good one from 
                        the looks of it. Why you wanna 
                        throw that away?

           She leans in, sincere.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Get a piece for myself. A piece for 
                        you. Got all these rich white boys 
                        setting up shop, making serious

           She slides her phone across the table, the browser open to an 
           article titled: Harvard MBA’s building the Hermès of Cannabis.

                        Doesn’t matter. What matters is 
                        that people like us can’t even get 
                        a foot in the door. Don’t have 
                        access to enough capital to get a 
                        license. Can’t go to a bank and get 
                        a loan, because they don’t work 
                        with dispensaries. It’s all private 
                        equity. You don’t have a connect, 
                        you’re left out in the cold.

                        It’s fifty thousand for the license

                        get left with the crumbs.

           Lu’s quiet, appreciating her ambition, however misguided.

                                 LU
                        Fresh out after twelve years and 
                        you’re asking me to risk going back?

           Ashleigh’s relentless.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Think of it as restitution for time

                        Knew I’d be tempted to get back 
                        into the life... Never though it’d 
                        be coming from you.

           A tense silence lingers, when--

                                 MANAGER  (O.S.)
                        Lu, move your ass!

           Ashleigh looks away, as Lu ease up on the guilt.

                                 LU
                        I’ll take a look, but only to prove 
                        to you that it’s a bad idea.

           A college neighborhood, USC students walking the streets. 
           Ashleigh’s behind the wheel, Lu sitting shotgun eyeing Zen 
           Dispensary with a dismissive grin.

                                 LU
                        You’re the only black girl on the

           The Security Guard steps outside, the Owner following with a 
           bag slung over his shoulder as he gets in his car.

           She tails the car through bustling downtown traffic, the 
           Dispensary Owner not slowing down for anyone.

           Ashleigh cuts left, right and left again, keeping pace with 
           the Owner, while Lu holds on for dear life.

                                 LU
                        Where the hell we going?

           The Owner slows down, signaling before he pulls into a garage. 
           Ashleigh parks at a meter.

                                 LU

                        Come on.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DOWNTOWN L.A. - NEXT

           The Owner emerges, looking over his shoulder every few steps, 
           while Ashleigh and Lu keep their distance.

           He takes a left onto TEMPLE and another on MAIN, walking 
           towards a second floor sky-bridge and into the back entrance 
           of a building -- Ashleigh stops.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        That’s it.

           Lu looks around, oblivious.

                                 LU
                        What’s it?

           She points, Lu following the imaginary line from her finger 
           to--

           EXT. GRAND PARK - DOWNTOWN L.A. - LATER

           Lu and Ashleigh are sitting at a PINK PARK BENCH, City Hall’s 
           32 story tower looming in the background.

           He laughs, looking at Ashleigh like she’s out of her mind. 

                                 LU
                        You’ve got ambition, I’ll give you 
                        that.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I’m not laughing. 

                                 LU
                        For starters, it’s too public and 
                        has too much security. But you 
                        wanna know what your biggest 
                        problem is?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What’s that?

                                 LU
                        That it’s fucking City Hall! I’ve 
                        seen five cops pass by in three 
                        minutes. 

           Ashleigh leans close.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        My boss pays a hundred grand in

                        remember? Won’t work with 
                        dispensaries, growers, anybody.

           Lu’s tempted, but gets serious. A veteran schooling a rookie.

                        time? Twelve years and for what?

                        work and no one bats an eye.

           She’s like a toddler throwing a fit over a candy bar in the

                        insured. Do it right, no one gets 
                        hurt. It’s just like robbing a bank.

                                 LU

           Ashleigh’s face falls and she pulls her hand away.

                        Weren’t around for me then, don’t 
                        know why I thought you would be now.

                        Forensics came up empty. Remnants 
                        of a mattress, some clothes, but no 
                        electronics.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Mens or women’s clothes?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Mens I figure. 

           He runs his finger through the dust.

                        Why wasn’t this washed?

           Rosanna doesn’t react.

                                 ROSANNA
                        You sure?

                        Name on it belonged to a dead guy.

                        Am I speaking in tongue?

           A young FIREMAN comes running.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Alright if I drop by and dig 
                        around?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Can’t without one of our guys 
                        present.

           A wolf-whistle rings out from somewhere in the station. 
           Rosanna ignores it, accustomed to this type of ill treatment.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL (CONT’D)
                             (Yelling)
                        Knock it off.
                                 ROSANNA
                        Anyone available?

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        I’ll put in a request.

           He doesn’t appear too motivated.

                                 ROSANNA
                        When should I expect a call?

           The Fire Marshal turns to her, savoring the moment.

                                 FIRE MARSHAL
                        Not fun waiting around is it?
                             (Grins)
                        You know the way out.

           Prelap: A fence rattling.

           EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - AFTERNOON

           The remains of the house are surrounded by a temporary chain 
           link fence. Rosanna climbs it and catches a pant leg. It tears.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Son of a bitch.

           INT/EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - NEXT

           Rosanna’s pants bottoms are tucked into her hiking boots.

           She kneels down with a paint brush, tweezers, and a bandana 
           covering her face like a bandit, combing through the ruins 
           like a playground archaeologist.

           INT/EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - MONTAGE

           Rosanna bounces around various rooms of the ruins, brushing 
           away dust and digging through debris, while the sun drops 
           lower and lower in the sky.

           INT/EXT. GROW HOUSE - CRENSHAW - LATER

           There’s five or ten minutes of daylight left.

           Rosanna continues to dig through the charred remains, 
           examining the remnants of irrigation tubes, herbicides and 
           grow lights, when--
           CRACK - CRACK - CRACK - CRACK - CRACK

           She jumps, as KIDS run past and rattle the fence with sticks.

           Rosanna takes a breath and gets back to work, scraping away 
           the soot one layer at a time, desperately searching for any 
           scrap of evidence when she spots--

           A PARTIAL RECEIPT

           A tiny piece of singed paper nine out of ten people would 
           have missed. 

           She holds it up to the dying light, barely able to make out 
           the W-E-S in the name LOWE’S, along with a partial DATE and 
           the last three digits of a PRODUCT NUMBER.

                                 ROSANNA
                             (Sotto)

           Ashleigh’s in the back seat, the windows taped over with 
           grocery store fliers.

           She lays down, using her backpack as a pillow, when--

           SOMEONE SCREAMS

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Fuck this.

           She sits up, rips off the fliers and climbs behind the wheel.

           Prelap: KNOCK - KNOCK - KNOCK

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - NIGHT

           Keisha answers, Ashleigh on the stoop. No words are 
           exchanged, as Keisha steps aside and invites her in.

           INT. BEDROOM - KEISHA’S HOUSE - NEXT

           Ashleigh drops her bag on the bed, Keisha in the doorway.

                                 KEISHA
                        How long?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Just until I find a place.
           There’s tension between them.

                                 KEISHA
                        Stay out of Ray’s way when he comes 
                        around, you hear me?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Long as he stays out of mine.

           Ashleigh looks away, as Keisha shakes her head.

                                 KEISHA
                        You ain’t changed one bit.

           EXT. STREETS - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Lu’s walking towards a BUS STOP, when he spots a DOPE BOY 
           working the corner. He watches him for a second considering...

           EXT. CORNER - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - NEXT

           Lu looks left and right as he approaches, no cops in sight.

                                 DOPE BOY
                        What you into old man?

                                 LU
                        Got any herb?

           The Dope Boy laughs.

                                 DOPE BOY
                        Get the fuck outta here. Nobody 
                        slanging that shit no more.

                                 LU
                        No?

                                 DOPE BOY
                        Nah, go buy it at the shop.

                                 LU
                        Any of y’all go legit?

                                 DOPE BOY
                        Can’t if you got a felony rap.

                                 LU
                        That right?
                                 DOPE BOY
                        Hell yeah. Caught pushing herb, 
                        white, crystal, can’t work a shop.
                             (A beat)
                        You wasting my time or what?

           Suddenly -- A SIREN BLARES & LIGHT BAR FLASHES.

           MUSIC CUE: Ice Cube’s - Good Cop Bad Cop.

                                 DOPE BOY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

           The Dope Boy takes off running, dropping a bag at Lu’s feet--

           PLOP

           Lu looks down, terror washing over him when he sees the bag 
           of COKE... He takes off too, booking it down an ALLEY.

           A UNIFORM hops out of the BLACK & WHITE and give chase, his 
           boots pounding the pavement as he zeroes in on his prey.

           EXT. ALLEY - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - NEXT

           Lu’s feet are flying across the pavement, breathing hard as 
           he hops a chain link fence blocking his path--

           RIIIPPP

           He tears his pants, the jagged edge scraping his thigh.

                                 LU
                        Shit...

           He looks over his shoulder, the Uniform close behind, hopping 
           the fence without breaking stride. 

           Lu presses on, cutting a hard right, a left and another 
           right, the sound of the Uniform’s boots falling faint.

           He looks over his shoulder again, the Uniform nowhere in 
           sight -- His prison yard exercise proving its worth. 

           Lu slows to a jog when he spots--

           THE BLACK & WHITE

           --as it cuts a hard right and follows him down the block. He 
           picks up the pace, running towards a METRO STATION. 

           He blends into the crowd as he flies down the steps, the Cop 
           Car losing him in the throng.
           INT. METRO STATION - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - NEXT

           Lu flies down the steps, as the train doors are about to 
           close and slides on at the last second.

           The Uniform comes up short, looking in the train car windows, 
           but Lu’s lying under a seat, out of sight.

           EXT. PERSHING SQUARE - DOWNTOWN L.A. - LATER

           Lu exits the Metro Station at the corner of 5TH and OLIVE and 
           spots the L.A. PUBLIC LIBRARY down the block.

           INT. LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY - DOWNTOWN L.A. - LATER

           A warm wooden room with bookshelves and tall lamps. The place 
           empty, like most libraries tend to be nowadays.

           Lu’s at a computer, running a Google search. A series of 
           headlines flash across the screen.

           - STUDY: LEGAL POT TO BE A $5 BILLION BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA

           - $1 BILLION IN MARIJUANA TAXES IS ADDICTIVE TO GOVERNORS

           - CALIFORNIA CANNABIS LAWS LEAVE GREY AREA FOR FELONS

           He holds on the last headline, staring at the word -- FELONS.

           He clicks on the link and we zoom in on words and phrases:

           Licensing authority - Deny application - Convicted of any 
           felony controlled substance...

                                 LU
                        Well I’ll be damned...

           EXT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - EVENING

           Ashleigh exits the shop, surprised to find Lu waiting for her.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What do you want?

                                 LU
                        To hear that business plan of 
                        yours.
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - UNIVERSITY PARK - LATER

           The two are in a booth, the table covered in documents. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        ...license and application process 
                        is fifty grand, plot of land runs 
                        around three hundred thousand. 
                        Another seventy for the greenhouse, 
                        twenty five for irrigation and five 
                        a month for electricity...

           Lu studies the numbers Ashleigh’s laid out in a spreadsheet.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        All in, startup costs are around 
                        five hundred thousand.

                                 LU
                        You have first year revenue 
                        projections?

           She grins.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You’ve done your homework.

                                 LU
                        Lotta time to read in prison.

           Ashleigh shows him another document.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Six or seven months for the plants 
                        to mature. Sell what we harvest to 
                        dispensaries and edible companies.

           She points to a figure.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Current estimates take monthly loan 
                        payments into account. We do what 
                        we talked about, there’s no loan. 
                        Profit margins will be much bigger.

                                 LU
                        Add a ten percent skim. Need to 
                        launder the cash, and that costs.

           She had no idea.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Right...
           Lu studies the numbers.

                                 LU
                        All in all... Looks good.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        It is good and so am I. 

           He can see the passion in her eyes, when a WAITRESS comes by 
           to refill their cups. They sit in silence until she departs.

                                 LU
                        I’ve got two conditions.

           Ashleigh’s eyes light up.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        You help plan the job, but when the 
                        time comes, you’re on the bench. 
                        Can’t risk you getting pinched.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Number two?

                                 LU
                        When it’s all over... 

           He hesitates.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Spit it out.

                                 LU
                        I want a job.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Doing what?

                                 LU
                        Handy man, planter, waterer, 
                        whatever you need.

           Ashleigh thinks it over.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Alright.

           She extends a hand and they shake.

                                 LU
                        Let me make a few calls.
           INT. STAPLES - DAY

           An OLD LADY is standing at the TECH DESK with a laptop. 

           MANNY (black/late-20s), the Young Man from the photo in Lu’s 
           prison cell, who looks more like a running back than an I.T. 
           guy, is behind the counter in a red Staples shirt.

                                 OLD LADY
                        I called my son, but he’s busy. He 
                        usually helps.

                                 MANNY
                        Was he really busy or just making 
                        up an excuse?

                                 OLD LADY
                        My, you’re fresh.

           He’s playing on his phone and still hasn’t looked at her.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        Can you call the repair man?

                                 MANNY
                        I am the “repair” man.

                                 OLD LADY
                        You look like you stock shelves.

           He puts down the phone.

                                 MANNY
                        What was that?

           The Old Lady backs away, as he practically snatches the 
           laptop out of her hands.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Let me have a look.

           Manny fiddles with it for a few seconds and--

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Voila.

           She looks at the screen.

                                 OLD LADY
                        How’d you do that?

                                 MANNY
                        You dragged everything to the 
                        recycle bin.
                                 OLD LADY
                        Oh, how silly... What do I owe?

                                 MANNY
                        It’s on the house.

           She grins and walks off, while Manny goes back to his phone.

                                 LU (O.S.)
                        You look busy.

           He recognizes the voice and smiles.

                                 MANNY
                        When’d you get out?

                                 LU
                        A week ago.

                                 MANNY
                        Come here man.

           Manny walks around the counter and the two embrace.

                                 LU
                        Got a favor to ask.

                                 MANNY
                        What kind of favor?

                                 LU
                        An opportunity came along that I 
                        couldn’t pass up. 

                                 MANNY
                        Couldn’t or wouldn’t?

                                 LU
                        A little bit of both.

           Manny looks suspicious.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Hear it out, for old times sake.

           He considers the request.

                                 MANNY
                        Alright, but no promises.
           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - DAY

           A minimal, meticulously organized studio with computer parts 
           neatly arranged on tabletops.

           Lu’s at the kitchen table.

                                 LU
                        Nice place.

                                 MANNY (O.S.)
                        Tell me again why we had to meet 
                        here?

           Manny enters the frame and hands Lu a bottle of water.

                                 LU
                        Conference room at the halfway 
                        house was booked.

           There’s a knock at the door and Manny answers, Ashleigh 
           standing in the hall with her backpack on.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You Manny?

           She looks Manny up and down, surprised by his appearance.

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, yeah... Come in.

           Ashleigh bats her eyes as she steps inside.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Don’t look like a hacker.

                                 MANNY
                        Don’t judge a book--

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        --by the cover, yeah, I know.

           They sit beside Lu and Manny gets right down to business.

                                 MANNY
                        So, what’s the plan?

           Lu nods to Ash. She’s nervous, avoiding eye contact with 
           Manny, like a school girl with a crush.

           She takes a breath and blurts out--

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We’re gonna rob City Hall.
           Manny’s face falls and Lu hangs his head.

                                 MANNY
                        Get out.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What? I just got here.

                                 LU
                        Manny--

                                 MANNY
                        I thought you were talking a bank or 
                        a business, not a heavily guarded 
                        government building.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        It’s just like a bank, swear to 
                        God.

                                 MANNY
                        It’s a suicide job and I’m in no 
                        mood to go back.

           He gets up and opens the door, but Lu doesn’t budge.

                                 LU
                        It’s seven figures. 

           Manny’s intrigued.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Low seven... Barely seven, but 
                        still seven.

           He sits back down.

                                 MANNY
                        I’m listening. 

           INT. LOWE’S HOME IMPROVEMENT - MID CITY - DAY

           Rosanna’s at the CUSTOMER SERVICE counter.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Can you identify any of it?

           The young CLERK across from her is looking at an enlarged 
           copy to the partial receipt.

                                 CLERK
                        Who did you say you’re with?
           She flashes her badge.

                                 CLERK
                        Let me get my manager...

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - LOWE’S HOME IMPROVEMENT - NEXT

           The MANAGER looks over the receipt.

                                 MANAGER
                        Product ending with those digits, 
                        probably PVC pipe. Can’t tell the 
                        diameter without the whole thing.

                                 ROSANNA

                             (Off his look)
                        Can you tie it to a purchase date?

                                 MANAGER
                        I can try.

           He types the numbers into a database on his computer.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Takes a minute.
                             (A beat)
                        You got a partner?

                        Nope.

                        Dangerous for a girl going it alone 
                        in your line of work?

                                 ROSANNA
                        No more than it is for a man.

           He turns back to the computer, taken down a peg.

                                 MANAGER
                        Could be four different dates, two 
                        from over a year ago.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Other two more recent?

                        Keep sixty days in store by law. 
                        Rest is at headquarters, but they 
                        tend to delete it.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Can you put in a request?

                                 MANAGER
                        Sure.

           Rosanna stays put.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        What, like right now?

                                 ROSANNA
                        Am I speaking in tongue?

           She stares him down until he picks up the phone.

           INT. GOLDEN WEST MANOR MOTEL - WESTERN AVE. - AFTERNOON

           A run down economy stay that’s pay by the hour.

           Keisha’s putting herself together in the bathroom, the bed a 
           ball of sheets in the foreground.

                                 LU (O.S.)
                        Ash back home?

                                 KEISHA
                        Where’d you hear that?

           Lu’s at the end of the bed sliding into his pants.

                                 LU
                        From her.

                                 KEISHA
                        It’s temporary.

           Keisha’s fixing her makeup in the mirror.

                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        What she say?

                                 LU
                        Nothing, just mentioned it.
                                 KEISHA
                        You tell her you seen me?

                                 LU
                        What if I did?

                                 KEISHA
                        Don’t play.

                                 LU
                        Not a word.

           She’s relieved, but hides it well.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Dropped by the store and grabbed a 
                        coffee after her shift.

                                 KEISHA
                        Waste no time do you?

                                 LU
                        Nope.

           He takes her in his arms and kisses her neck.

                                 KEISHA
                        Stop... I gotta go.

                                 LU
                        Stay.

           There’s desire in his voice, something Keisha hasn’t heard in 
           a long time.

                                 KEISHA
                        I would but...

                                 LU
                        But what?

                                 KEISHA
                        Need to get started on dinner.

                                 LU
                        That what you do for him? Cook and 
                        clean?

           Her demeanor changes.

                                 KEISHA
                        Don’t do that.
                                 LU
                        Do what?

           She pushes him away.

                                 KEISHA
                        Make me feel small.

           Keisha grabs her purse and leaves.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - EVENING

           Manny’s at the kitchen table looking off screen.

                                 MANNY
                        You mind?

                                 ASHLEIGH (O.S.)
                        It’s more comfortable over here.

           Ashleigh’s lounging on his bed, having put more of an effort 
           into her appearance than their first meeting.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Come sit.

           She takes a sip of water and Manny looks at his watch.

                                 MANNY
                        Where’s your father?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Why? You bored?

           She takes another sip, when--

           KNOCK - KNOCK

           Manny pops up and runs to the door. Ashleigh sits up and 
           throws on a cardigan.

                                 MANNY
                        Where you been?

                                 LU
                        Missed the bus.

           Lu takes a seat at the table, Ashleigh noticing a LIPSTICK 
           stain on his shirt collar, as she hands out some papers.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        These are the eight most profitable 
                        dispensaries in L.A. county.

                        Our job is to hijack the payment 
                        appointment calendar and schedule 
                        them back to back to back. 

           Lu and Manny flip through the pages.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking we could payoff 
                        someone on the inside. A teller, a 
                        guard, someone like that.

           Manny and Ashleigh’s legs touch under the table...

                                 LU
                        Can’t trust those people. They talk 
                        at the first sign of trouble and if 
                        they’re smart, they’ll wanna be cut 
                        in. Manny can you hack it?

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah. Change the dates and times, 
                        confirm the appointments by phone.

           Ashleigh brushes her foot against Manny’s shin, but he pulls 
           his leg away.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll need one of you to access a 
                        computer inside to install the bug.

                                 LU
                        I want eyes in there anyway to map 
                        it out.

           Ashleigh brushes his leg again and this time, he keeps it 
           there. She grins and Manny buries a nervous smile.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, yeah... Fine.

           Lu looks at Ashleigh, her face a portrait of professionalism.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                             (Clears his throat)
                        I might be able to crack their 
                        surveillance feed too.

                                 LU
                        You think?
                                 MANNY
                        It’s possible, but I won’t know 
                        until I’m in the system.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        How do we get to a computer?

           Lu smiles.

                                 LU
                        We take the tour.

           INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - DAY

           A TOUR GUIDE is leading a group through the art deco lobby.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Three architects; Parkinson, Austin 
                        and Martin, were commissioned to 
                        design the building in 1925...

           Lu and Ashleigh are standing amongst the VISITORS, snapping 
           cell phone photos like everyone else.

                        tallest in Los Angeles upon its 
                        completion in 1928.

                        If you could follow me this way...

           The group follows the Tour Guide into another room, but 
           Ashleigh breaks away, walking past a sign that reads--

           ROOM 101 - CITY FINANCE

           MUSIC CUE: Kendrick Lamar - i.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           The place is like an old bank, with open Teller windows, 
           industrial tile and furniture that dates back to the 90’s. 

           Ashleigh peeks her head in from the hall.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Excuse me...
                                 TELLER
                        Yes.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Which way’s the restroom?

                                 TELLER
                        Down the hall and to the right.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Thanks.

           She sticks a piece of tape over the strike plate as she 
           leaves, depressing the latch.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - LATER

           The Tour Group is walking along the 27th floor, looking out 
           over the downtown skyline, the steel-skinned WALT DISNEY 
           CONCERT HALL visible off in the distance.

           Ashleigh glances below, spotting the TELLERS walking down the 
           City Hall steps towards Grand Park. 

           She looks over at Lu and nods.

           INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           Lu steps off the elevator on the first floor and makes his 
           way to the Finance Office.

           A sign on the door reads -- OUT TO LUNCH.

           He tries the door. It opens, the strip of tape still in place.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The lights are off, the office empty. Lu takes a step in and--

           FLASH

           --the lights turn on. 

           He stops dead in his tracks and looks around... There’s a 
           motion sensor blinking on the ceiling.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Ashleigh’s still on the 27th floor, looking out over the 
           front steps towards the fountain at Grand Park, when--
           One of the Tellers runs back up.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Shit.

           The VISITOR beside her glances over.

                                 VISITOR
                        What was that?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Nothing.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           Lu inserts a THUMB DRIVE into the USB port on a Teller’s 
           computer and double clicks the program icon.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Ashleigh tries to send a text message to warn him, but she 
           has no bars.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Come on, come on, come on....

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           Lu watches the status bar that’s moving at a snails pace.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Ashleigh runs around the deck, holding her phone above her 
           head, desperate to get a signal.

           She bumps into the Tour Guide pointing out landmarks.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Hey!

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Sorry.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           The status bar is nearing eighty percent, when--

           THE DOOR HANDLE RATTLES
           Lu turns towards the sound as the door opens and a Teller 
           steps inside.

           ON THE TELLER--

           Walking in, but Lu’s nowhere in sight.

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Ashleigh finally gets a signal and the text goes though.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           The Teller grabs her purse from off a chair and moves back to 
           the door, when--

           DING - DING

           The sound of a text message echoes throughout the office.

           ON LU--

           Hiding under a desk, his phone glowing with Ashleigh’s text.

           The Teller checks her phone -- No alerts.

           She slides it in her purse and looks around, spotting--

           LU

           --hunched over a desk.

                                 TELLER
                        Who are you?

                                 LU
                        Me?

                                 TELLER
                        How’d you get in here?

           The Teller back pedals towards the door...

           INT. ELEVATOR - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Ashleigh’s in a crowded elevator, heading down to the first 
           floor in a quiet panic.
           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           Lu and the Teller hold each others stare as she nears the 
           door and--

                                 LU
                        Just emptying out the garbage.

           He holds up some garbage bags that he grabbed from the bins 
           underneath the desks, impersonating a janitor.

                                 TELLER
                        Oh, duh.

                                 LU
                        Scared me to death. Thought I was 
                        alone.

                                 TELLER
                        Me too, sorry.

                                 LU 
                        Enjoy your lunch.

           The Teller walks out the door and Lu turns on the computer 
           screen -- The bug fully installed.

           He pulls the Thumb Drive from the USB port and runs for the 
           door, when he spots--

           A GUARD 

           Patrolling the hall right outside the door.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - NEXT

           Ashleigh exits through the front and turns left at the bottom 
           of the steps, leaving Lu to fend for himself.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Lu peeks through the window, the Guard still in position.

           He pulls the phone from his pocket and sends a text.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - NEXT

           Ashleigh races away from the building, abandoning Lu, when 
           his text comes through on her phone--

                Help guard
           She hesitates, waffling on whether or not to return...

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - LATER

           Lu peeks out again, the Guard still in position. He dips down 
           and scans the room, looking for a way out, when--

                                 ASHLEIGH (O.S.)
                        Excuse me...

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        How can I help you?

           He peeks out to find Ashleigh standing next to the Guard.

           INT. HALLWAY - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I’m looking for the east stairwell.

                                 GUARD
                        It’s down that hall to the left.

           He points, she looks, but doesn’t move.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I just came from that way. Would 
                        you mind showing me?

                                 GUARD
                        Can’t leave my post.

           She throws him a smile that would melt an iceberg.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        It’ll just take a second...

           Ashleigh holds his stare longer than expected and--

                                 GUARD
                        Alright, but we gotta be quick.

           INT. FINANCE OFFICE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Lu watches, as Ashleigh leads the Guard away.

                                 LU
                        Good girl.

           He creeps out and removes the tape, closing the door gently.
           INT. ASHLEIGH’S CAR - DOWNTOWN L.A. - LATER

           Ashleigh fires up the engine, Lu in the passenger seat.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You install it?

                                 LU
                        I think so.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Did it work?

                                 LU
                        I don’t know, try Manny.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - SAME

           Manny’s at the table typing away, when he answers his phone.

                                 MANNY
                        What’s up?

                                 ASHLEIGH (PHONE)
                        Give us good news.

                                 MANNY
                        I’m working on it.

           His fingers are moving a mile a minute, punching code into a 
           dialog box.

           INT. ASHLEIGH’S CAR - DOWNTOWN L.A. - SAME

           Ashleigh’s riding an adrenaline high, Lu calm and composed.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Sorry about the Teller, my cell 
                        signal was shot.

                                 LU
                        You got the job done and we got 
                        out. That’s what counts.

           She smiles, savoring his praise.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - SAME

           Manny’s fingers come to a stop and hover above the ENTER KEY. 

           It’s the moment of truth--
                                 MANNY
                             (Sotto)
                        Here it goes...

           INT. ASHLEIGH’S CAR - DOWNTOWN L.A. - SAME

           Silence... 

           Lu and Ashleigh wait as dead air lingers for what feels like 
           forever, until a somber voice comes over the line.

                                 MANNY (PHONE)
                        Bad news guys...

           Lu and Ashleigh share a frustrated glance in the rearview.

                                 MANNY (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Looks like this suicide job’s a go.

           Ashleigh screams.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Ha!

           She grabs Lu’s hand and holds it tight.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        We did it!

           Ashleigh honks the horn.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        We fucking did it dad!

           It’s the first time she’s called him that.

                                 LU
                        Alright, alright, calm down... and 
                        chill on the language.

           She turns on the radio as she pulls onto the freeway, PTAF’s - 
           Boss Ass Bitch bumping from the speakers.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We hacked mother f-ing City Hall!

                                 LU
                        Yes we did...

           INT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - NIGHT

           Lu and Ashleigh are eating a celebratory dinner.
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Who says you can’t fight City Hall?

           They cheers and dig in.

                                 LU
                        Was it me, or were you making eyes 
                        at Manny the other day?

           Ashleigh grins.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Oh, please...

                                 LU
                        Am I wrong?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Seen mom’s shade of lipstick on 
                        your shirt collar...

           Lu almost spits out his drink.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Am I wrong?

           They hold each others stare. A silent truce offered, when--

           BELLS CHIME

           Lu looks at the door.

                                 LU
                        Sorry, we’re closed.

           Ashleigh turns towards the door and her face falls.

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        Think you can make an exception. 
                             (A beat)
                        Right Ash?

           STEVEN POOL (white/40s), an unremarkable man dressed in a 
           loose fitting suit is standing inside with his MUSCLE in tow.

                                 LU
                        You know this guy?

           Ashleigh’s expression says more than words ever could.

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re in business together.
           Steven walks over, while his Muscle flips the OPEN sign to 
           CLOSED, locks the front door and closes the blinds.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           Ashleigh slides in and Steven sits down beside her, but Lu 
           doesn’t budge.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t mind standing.

           His Muscle nods as Steven settles in, Lu noticing a pistol 
           tucked into the Muscle’s waistband.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re her father right? Fresh from 
                        Terminal Island?
                             (Off Lu’s look)
                        You didn’t tell him?

           Ashleigh shakes her head.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Secrets don’t make friends Ash.

                                 LU
                        Don’t talk to her, you talk to me.

                                 STEVEN
                        Alright... 

           Steven eyes Ashleigh’s food and takes a bite.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s good. Very good.

           Lu’s eyes are burning right through him.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        I invested a great deal of money in 
                        your daughter. She got careless and 
                        burned through it. Literally.

                                 LU
                        What are you looking for?

                                 STEVEN
                        To be made whole.

           Suddenly, Steven grabs Ashleigh by the hair and tugs her head 
           back.
           Lu swats the Muscle’s pistol to the floor, about to pounce, 
           when Steven pulls a gun of his own.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Easy...
                             (To his Muscle)
                        What the hell am I paying you for?

           The Muscle scrambles for his gun and presses the barrel 
           against Lu’s head. Steven still has a grip on Ashleigh’s hair.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        I told you I don’t like to come 
                        looking.

           He brings the barrel to her lips.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Open up.

           She does as she’s told and he shoves the barrel in her mouth, 
           Lu watching, helpless.

           The Manager pops his head in and turns right around.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Consider this a courtesy visit. 
                             (To Lu)
                        I’m sure Ash can fill you in on the 
                        details.

           Steven pulls the gun from her mouth and leaves -- Message 
           received.

           Lu looks at Ashleigh like he’s ready to blow, but before he 
           can speak, she springs from the table and runs out the door.

                                 LU
                        Ash--

           EXT. DINER - JEFFERSON BLVD. - NEXT

           She’s pacing up and down the sidewalk, Lu on her heels.

                                 LU
                        Who the hell was that?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Steven--

                                 LU
                        He a shark?
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I didn’t know it at the time.

                                 LU 
                        Jesus Christ...

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        He said he was an investor.

                                 LU
                        I thought you wanted to go legit?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        That’s what his money was for. It’s 
                        the only way I could raise it. I 
                        tried everywhere and they all 
                        laughed in my face.

           Lu takes a breath.

                                 LU
                        Where’d it go?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        An accident at the grow. The whole 
                        place... It burned down.

                                 LU
                        Guys like him don’t believe in 
                        accidents and they sure as hell 
                        don’t buy insurance.
                             (A beat)
                        How much you into him for?

           She doesn’t answer.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        How much?

           It takes her a second to summon the courage.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Five hundred.

           Lu cringes.

                                 LU
                        That’s half the score.

           He tries to keep calm.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        What else you keeping from me?
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        That’s it, swear to God.

           Lu takes a second to digest everything he’s heard, realizing--

                                 LU
                        That’s why you came to me, isn’t it?

           She plays dumb.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What?

                                 LU
                        It was never about getting payback. 
                        You just needed me to cover for 
                        you. Someone disposable to take the 
                        fall if things went south.

           She deflects, but he sees right through her.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        It’s not like that, I swear--

                                 LU
                        Looks like it from where I’m 
                        standing.

           A tense moment lingers.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You know what. You want out? Fine. 
                             (A beat)
                        I’ll do it myself, like I’ve been 
                        doing my whole life.

           She gets in her car and drives away, leaving Lu alone in the 
           street. 

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - LATER

           It’s late, the lights out, everyone asleep.

           INT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - NEXT

           Ashleigh storms inside and slams the door.

           INT. KITCHEN - KEISHA’S HOUSE - NEXT

           She’s at the counter pouring herself a shot of liquor, when--
                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        Who the hell do you think you are?

           She puts down the bottle and looks at RAY (black/40s), 
           Keisha’s husband, whom we recognize from the graduation photo.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Coming in at all hours of the night 
                        with no respect for anyone living 
                        here.

           She throws the shot back and pours another.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Fuck off Ray.

           He seethes.

                                 RAY
                        Fuck off?

           Ray marches down the hall, returning with Ashleigh’s backpack 
           and a handful of her clothes. 

           Keisha’s in a bathrobe behind him.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Talking like that to me in my own 
                        Goddamn house? You’ve got some 
                        nerve girl.

           He opens the door and throws her things on the front lawn.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Get out.

           Ashleigh looks at Keisha.

                                 KEISHA
                        What I tell you?

                                 RAY
                        I said get out.

           Ashleigh throws back another shot. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Ask her who she’s been seeing on 
                        the side?

           Keisha’s eyes go wide.

                                 RAY
                        What’s that?
           Ashleigh throws her mother a cold glare and walks out the 
           door. Ray turns to Keisha.

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell she talking about?

           Prelap: KNOCK - KNOCK

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - NIGHT

           Manny opens the door for Ashleigh, her eyes red from crying.

                                 MANNY
                        You alright?

           She steps inside and Manny puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Ashleigh turns to him and their eyes meet. She leans in for a 
           kiss, but he pulls away.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come...

           She moves back towards the door, about to leave, when Manny 
           grabs her hand. 

                                 MANNY
                        No, stay.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - LATER

           Ashleigh’s in bed, beneath the covers, coming down from her 
           buzz. Manny’s sitting on the edge of the mattress. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        We’re doing this, right?

                                 MANNY
                        It’s a good plan. Trust it.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You won’t back out?

                                 MANNY
                        Hell no. We’re almost at the finish 
                        line.

           They sit in silence, Ashleigh contemplating what’s next.
                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        You know where I met Lu?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Have an idea.

                                 MANNY
                        I was the youngest kid in there, 
                        nineteen...
                             (A beat)
                        You need people to have your back 
                        on the inside if you’re gonna 
                        survive. Lotta wolves preying on 
                        the weak and I was weak. Lu had my 
                        back from day one. Kept me safe 
                        when no one else would. Didn’t ask 
                        for anything in return.

           Ashleigh listens.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Only reason I’m here today is cause 
                        of him. He’s like a father to me.
                             (A beat)
                        I know he’s trying to be one for you.

           Manny tucks her in and lays down on the couch.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Get some rest.

           He turns out the light and Ashleigh stares at the ceiling.

           INT. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY - L.A. BUREAU - DAY

           There’s a FEDEX ENVELOPE on top of a MAIL CART that’s rolling 
           across the floor. A hand drops it in an INBOX.

           Rosanna picks it up and looks at the return address-- 

           LOWE’S CORPORATION, MOORESVILLE, N.C.

           She tears the seal and pulls out a DVD.

           INT. OFFICE - DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY - L.A. BUREAU - NEXT

           The DVD loads on a laptop and SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE plays.

           Rosanna fast forwards, pausing on a grainy image of a GIRL at 
           the checkout counter with what appears to be PVC Pipe.
           She enlarges the image, barely able to recognize the Girl’s 
           L.A. DODGERS cap and the ZEN DISPENSARY logo on her T-shirt, 
           no clue what it’s an image of.

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - DAY

           Lu knocks and Ray answers, seeing red when he realizes who it 
           is.

                                 LU
                        Ash around?

                                 RAY
                        No.

                                 LU
                        Thought she was crashing here?

                                 RAY

                        You fucking my wife?

           Lu’s face falls.

                                 LU
                        What?

                                 RAY
                        You heard me mother fucker.

           Keisha calls out from inside.

                                 KEISHA (O.S.)
                        Who is it?

           Ray doesn’t answer, balling his fists, ready to throw.

                                 LU
                             (Yelling)
                        Keisha, where’s Ash?

           Keisha comes to the door and Ray stands his ground.

                                 KEISHA
                        I got it.

                                 RAY
                        You better.

           She steps outside and Ray slams the door.
                                 KEISHA
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 LU
                        Looking for Ash. What you tell him?

           Ray is watching them through a window.

                                 KEISHA
                        Her and Ray got into it. She said 
                        some shit. You tell her anything?

                                 LU
                        Nothing, I swear.

           She doesn’t believe him.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Know where she went?

                                 KEISHA
                        Your guess is as good as mine.

           Lu turns to go, but can’t help himself.

                                 LU
                        I’m sorry about what I said. It was 
                        wrong, but he ain’t right for you. 
                        I hope you to know that.

           He leaves, tears welling in Keisha’s eyes as she shouts loud 
           enough for Ray to hear.

                                 KEISHA
                        Next time you come around looking 
                        for Ash, you better call first!

           Lu shows his I.D. to the Security Guard and walks in,

                        Ash working today?

                                 BUD TENDER
                        She’s off til tomorrow.

           EXT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - NEXT

           Lu steps outside, when a text from Manny comes through on his 
           phone. He looks at the screen, but we don’t see the message.
           INT. BATHROOM - MANNY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Ashleigh’s in the shower. She turns the water off and wraps 
           herself in a towel.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - NEXT

           She steps from the bathroom to find--

           LU

           --sitting on the edge of the bed, Manny at the kitchen table.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You tell him I was here?

           Manny shrugs his shoulders.

                                 LU
                        Can we talk?

           A beat.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Let me get dressed.

           EXT. MANNY’S BUILDING - KOREATOWN - LATER

           Lu and Ashleigh are sitting on the front steps.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        You mad at him?

                                 LU
                        Who?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Manny.

                                 LU
                        Mad at you for what you told Ray.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I had a couple drinks...

           An awkward silence passes.

                                 LU
                        Why didn’t you tell me about the 
                        money straight up?

           Ashleigh considers the question.
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Scared I guess... Hadn’t seen you 
                        since I was a kid and then you just 
                        showed up out of the blue. Know Ray 
                        better than I know you...
                             (A beat)
                        I was desperate... Seemed like the 
                        easiest way to get you to go along.

           Her admission cuts Lu to the bone.

                                 LU
                        I know I haven’t earned your trust, 
                        but from here on out, we’ve gotta 
                        honest with each other. We have to 
                        be, if this thing’s gonna work.

           Ashleigh nods.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        My freedom, Manny’s freedom, even 
                        your own... It’s all on the line. 
                        This isn’t a game we’re playing.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I know.

                                 LU
                        Do you?

           He looks deep into her eyes, seeing if she truly understands 
           the severity of what they’re embarking on.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Can we trust each other?

           She nods, when Manny suddenly pokes his head out the door.

                                 MANNY
                        Got something you both need to see.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - NEXT

           Lu and Ashleigh are looking over Manny’s shoulder at a grid 
           of black and white video feeds.

                                 MANNY
                        Surveillance feeds. Every damn one.

           He double clicks a box and it enlarges, the three able to see 
           a TELLER in the Finance Office in the middle of a transaction.
                                 LU
                        This is good Manny, real good.

           The Teller walks a CUSTOMER to the end of the row, opens a 
           door and the Customer hands her a bag.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        That’s it.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What?

                                 LU
                        That exchange, right there. That’s 
                        our way in.

           Manny cuts to a new feed, where the Teller is dumping the 
           money from the bag out on a table. 

           She arranges the bundles and runs the bills through a CASH 
           COUNTER while the Customer waits.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        How much that look like to you?

                                 MANNY
                        High five, low sixes.

                                 LU
                        Can you map the place out from this?

                                 MANNY
                        I can try.

                                 LU
                        Get on it and Ash... 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Yeah.

                                 LU
                        Take first watch. Write down 
                        everything that happens in there. 
                        Every customer, teller, guard, 
                        shift change. You got me?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        I got you.

           He looks at his two person crew.

                                 LU

           Ashleigh’s at the counter with a CLERK pushing lotions and 
           ointments.

                        What if I want the euphoria?

           The phone rings.

                                 CLERK
                        Excuse me.

                        payment appointment.

           INT. LITTLE BUDDHA MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - HANCOCK PARK - SAME

           The Clerk looks over her shoulder.

                                 CLERK (PHONE)
                        Let me get the owner for you.
           She puts the call on hold and heads to the back, returning 
           with the OWNER, a pristine bohemian woman (white/40s).

                                 OWNER (PHONE)
                        Yes?

           The Clerk returns to Ashleigh.

                                 CLERK
                        Where were we?

           Ashleigh points to a tube of lotion in the display case.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Can I try that one?

                                 CLERK
                        Of course.

           The Clerk bends down, as Ashleigh takes out her phone.

                                 OWNER (PHONE)
                        The sixteenth at 2:00pm is fine.

           Ashleigh pretends to take a picture of the lotion, but 
           actually snaps a photo of the Owner.

           The Clerk pops up with a new tube.

                                 CLERK
                        Did you just take a picture?

           Ashleigh’s face falls.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        What?

                                 CLERK
                        A picture, on your phone?

           A tense moment lingers as the two hold each other’s stare.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Think you could tag us on

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - LATER

           Lu’s looking at the Surveillance Feed.

                                 MANNY
                        Contractors must have gone in 
                        overnight.

                                 LU
                        Neither one of you bothered to 
                        check?

                                 MANNY
                        It’s a government building. They’re 
                        closed on weekends.

           We finally see what they’re talking about--

           The Finance Office has been renovated with bulletproof glass 
           Teller Windows and a Dispensary Bin for large deposits.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Entry point’s gone.

                                 LU
                        No shit.

                                 MANNY
                        How do we get them to open that 
                        door?

           Lu thinks.

                                 LU
                        We go low tech.

           Angle on Manny looking down at the floor, as a vibrating 
           sound is heard off screen.

           The vibrating stops and Manny makes a face.

                                 LU (O.S.)
                        So?

           Manny makes a so-so gesture with his hand.
           Angle on Lu, lying on the floor.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        You get down here and try it. I’m 
                        old and your floor’s hard.

           INT. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY - L.A. BUREAU - MORNING

           Rosanna’s with a TECH running an image search.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Think you can find it?

                                 TECH
                        Oh yeah. This system runs through a 
                        database of public posts. It’s like 
                        Google on steroids.

           A series of Tweets and Instagram posts appear. The Tech 
           scrolls through them, when Rosanna spots something--

                                 ROSANNA
                        That one, there.

           The Tech clicks on an Instagram post of--

           ASHLEIGH

           --wearing a non-grainy version of the T-shirt and Dodgers cap 
           from the Lowe’s security footage.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)

           INT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - DAY

           Ashleigh’s behind the counter, grabbing her purse and jacket.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        See ya.

           EXT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - NEXT

           Ashleigh exits the store and heads for the parking lot, when--
           SIRENS BLARE & LIGHT BARS FLASH

           She drops her purse on the pavement, as three Black & Whites 
           come screeching to a halt.

           A COP’S voice booms over the loudspeaker.

                                 COP (LOUDSPEAKER)
                        Put your hands in the air and get 
                        down on the ground!

           Ashleigh’s heart almost explodes, as she takes in the COP 
           CARS surrounding her.

                                 COP (LOUDSPEAKER) (CONT’D)
                        Put your hands above your head!

           She raises her arms and drops to her knees, the Bud Tender and 
           Security Guard looking on from inside the shop.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE PRECINCT - LATER

           Ashleigh’s cuffed to a table, the room cold and grey.

           Rosanna enters and drops a manila folder on the table. She 
           opens it and pulls out two photos.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Look familiar?

           Ashleigh looks at them -- A still from the Lowe’s footage and 
           the Instagram post of her in the same shirt and cap.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        These dates a coincidence?

           Rosanna circles the matching dates on each photo, but 
           Ashleigh doesn’t say a word.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        You’re young, you don’t have a 
                        record, so I’ll make it easy.

                        Who are you working with?

           Ashleigh trembles as the cold cuffs choke her wrists and 
           vibrate against the table. 

           She looks Rosanna dead in the eye, about to break, when--

                                 ASHLEIGH
                             (Soft)
                        Lawyer.
                                 ROSANNA
                        What’s that?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                             (Louder)
                        Lawyer.

           Rosanna sighs.

                                 ROSANNA
                        I know you didn’t fund this working 
                        behind that counter. There was half-
                        a-mil worth of gear and product in 
                        that house. Somebody staked you.

           Ashleigh sticks to the script.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Lawyer.

           Rosanna tucks the photos back in the folder.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Alright...

           She stands and moves towards the door.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        You wanna do time, that’s fine.

           Rosanna turns back.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Cute girl like you will get a lot 
                        of unwanted attention.

           INT. TWIN TOWERS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - LATER

           A cell door opens and Ashleigh steps inside wearing an orange 
           DOC jumpsuit.

           The two INMATES sharing the cell take her in with predatory 
           eyes. Caged wolves just given a lamb.

           INT. OFFICE - DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY - L.A. BUREAU - EVENING

           Rosanna’s sitting across from the ASSISTANT SPECIAL AGENT IN 
           CHARGE (ASAC/white/50s), a buttoned up DEA bureaucrat.

                                 ROSANNA
                        She’s a kid. There’s no way she 
                        raised that money herself.

                        School records say she was an honor 
                        roll student.

                                 ASAC
                        Father did time, right?

           Rosanna nods, as her Boss looks off camera.

                                 ASAC (CONT’D)
                        What does the lawyer think?

           The camera pans to reveal--

           STEVEN

           --sitting on a couch up against the wall.

                                 STEVEN
                        I have enough evidence to convict 
                        as is. I don’t see the need for you 
                        to waste anymore resources on this, 
                        but I’ll leave that up to you.

           Her Boss thinks it over.

                                 ASAC
                        Steve’s right.

                                 ROSANNA
                        There’s someone bigger behind it.

                                 ASAC
                        It’s a garage grow Rose and we have 
                        bigger fish to fry.

                        She won’t talk, maybe some time in

                        Don’t dwell on it, you did good 
                        work.

           Manny’s phone rings -- A number he doesn’t recognize.

                        Hello?

           He listens, concern crossing his face as Lu looks him over.

                        Who is it?

           Lu and Manny are watching the entrance from the sidewalk,

                                 LU
                        Stay here.

           Keisha walks in the opposite direction. Lu jogs to catch up.

                        Keisha.

                        Something about a burned down house

           They arrive at her car, Keisha surprised by his tone.

                                 KEISHA
                        Did you know about it?

           She looks at him, but Lu avoids her stare.

                        You knew and you didn’t to tell me?

           He’s quiet, when Keisha bursts out laughing.

                        Been out a month and she’s telling

                        for it and one day -- BOOM, it’s 
                        legal. Now I’m the bad guy. The one 
                        who locked up innocent people, when 
                        I was just doing my job. Hell,

                        gonna get paid first.

                        when you get out. System’s broken. 
                        We’re all just trying to make a buck 
                        at the end of the day, aren’t we?

           Lu’s thrown by Steven’s admission.

                        What’s keeping me from snitching?

                                 STEVEN
                        Three time felon’s word over a 
                        career DEA attorney... Come on.
                             (A beat)
                        Little pigeon says our girl got 
                        pinched.

                                 LU
                        Pigeon, huh?

                                 STEVEN
                        Now I have to consider some things.

                                 LU
                        Like what?
                                 STEVEN
                        Like if she knows how to keep her 
                        mouth shut.

                                 LU
                        She knows, if not, I’ll get her the 
                        message.

                                 STEVEN
                        She doesn’t, bad things will happen 
                        Lu. Things much worse than prison.

                                 LU
                        That a threat?

                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t make threats, I make 
                        promises.
                             (A beat)
                        A girl like her... She won’t last 
                        inside. You know that.

           Lu does.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Dykes making her do disgusting 
                        things... She gets out, the only 
                        way to get even is if she goes to 
                        work. You know what I mean by work.

           He does.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        She’ll make fifty a suck, two 
                        hundred a fuck and ten years from 
                        now she still won’t be out from 
                        under it. If she lasts that long. 
                             (A beat)
                        They never last that long.

           Lu’s a ball of fury beneath his calm facade.

                                 LU
                        I’ll get you the money.

                                 STEVEN
                        Take on the debt?

                                 LU
                        Long as you forget you ever met her.

           Steven grins.
                                 STEVEN
                        On a dishwashers pay?

                                 LU
                        You’ll get your money.

                                 STEVEN
                        For some reason, I believe you.

           Steven leans in, deadly serious.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        She says one word, the deal’s off.

           EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - NEXT

           Lu climbs out of the SUV and it drives off into the night.

           INT. VISITATION ROOM - TWIN TOWERS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           Two phones, a desk and glass divider. Lu and Ashleigh are on 
           opposite sides.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        She has me on a security tape 
                        buying the irrigation tube.

                                 LU
                        Were you living at the house?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Kinda.

                                 LU
                        Kinda, what’s kinda?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Slept there sometimes.

                                 LU
                        Leave anything?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Clothes maybe... Some receipts, but 
                        they might be with the papers I 
                        showed you.

                                 LU
                        Where?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        In my bag at Manny’s.
           Lu looks down the row of the hardened INMATES.

                                 ASHLEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Thought one day you’d get out and 
                        the whole thing would be up and 
                        running... You’d come around and see 
                        it for yourself. I was hoping you 
                        would. Thought you’d be proud of me.

           Lu keeps it together and changes the subject.

                                 LU
                        You got a lawyer?

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        The one they assigned.

                                 LU
                        That won’t do. Need a better one, 
                        one that won’t tell you to plead. 

           There’s a hint of fear in Ashleigh’s eyes that wasn’t there 
           before. The reality of her situation starting to sink in. 

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Can’t afford a lawyer.

                                 LU
                        Your mom and me, we’ll figure it 
                        out.

                                 ASHLEIGH
                        She ain’t got the money.

           Ashleigh breaks. The prospect of prison finally feeling real.

                                 LU
                        Hey, look at me... 

           She does.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Stay strong, keep your head down 
                        and don’t say nothing. Not a word, 
                        you hear me?

           Ashleigh nods, as tears spill down her cheeks.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna pull this job, get a 
                        good lawyer and get you out.

           She desperately wants to believe him.
                                 ASHLEIGH
                        Promise?

                                 LU
                        I promise.

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LEIMERT PARK - DAY

           Keisha opens the door. Lu’s on the stoop.

                                 KEISHA
                        Thought I told you to call first?

                                 LU
                        I need a favor.

                                 KEISHA
                        A favor?

                                 LU
                        Want your daughter in or out?

           She crosses her arms.

                                 KEISHA
                        What you need?

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - DAY - VARIOUS

           Manny’s at the kitchen table watching the Surveillance Feed. 

           On Screen -- Various OWNER’S that Ashleigh photographed are 
           making their tax payments at the Finance Office.

           We hold on the Dispensary Owner from Little Buddha, as she 
           dumps a bag of cash into the Depository Bin.

           It takes two Tellers to carry it over and count it.

                                 MANNY
                        That is a lot of green.

           The Tellers finish up and one hands the Owner a receipt.

           Manny clicks on another feed, watching another Teller stack 
           the cash in the Safe.

           He tracks the first Teller on screen, as she knocks on the 
           Finance Manager’s door and says something we can’t hear.

           The Finance Manager picks up the phone and makes a call, 
           Manny continuing to watch, when--
           DING

           A new event alert appears on the hacked Calendar.

           He double clicks the appointment and sees the words--

           BRINKS PICKUP

           INT. CITY BUS - SAME

           The bus is moving, Lu sitting, when--

                                 ROSANNA (O.S.)
                        Seat taken?

                                 LU
                        All yours.

           He slides in and Rosanna sits down beside him.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Everybody says L.A.’s got the worst 
                        public transportation, but they’re 
                        the ones that don’t ride the bus.

                                 LU
                        Right about that.

           Rosanna extends a hand and Lu goes to shake it, but pulls 
           back when he spots a BADGE in her hand.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Been going to work and calling my 
                        P.O. every week like he said.

           A WOMAN behind them overhears and changes seats.

                                 ROSANNA
                        I know, we spoke.

                                 LU
                        So, what’s this about?

                                 ROSANNA
                        Ashleigh.

           Lu’s face falls.

                                 LU
                        You the one with the security tape?

                                 ROSANNA
                        Word travels fast.
           His phone vibrates in his pocket.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Need to get that?

           Lu shakes his head.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        What’s a kid like her doing working 
                        an illegal grow? She got daddy 
                        issues?

           He takes offense.

                                 LU
                        You got nothing better to do than 
                        harass a good kid?

                                 ROSANNA
                        She is a good kid, reminds me of me 
                        when I was her age... I know she 
                        didn’t fund that grow herself. 
                        Who’s she working with?

                                 LU
                        How would I know? Hadn’t seen her 
                        in over ten years.

           His phone rings again, but he ignores it.

                                 ROSANNA
                        You seen her since?

                                 LU
                        Couple times.

                                 ROSANNA
                        She say anything about it?

                                 LU
                        Didn’t come up... 

           Rosanna grins.

                                 ROSANNA
                        She’s not talking Mr. Taylor. If 
                        she doesn’t, she’s going to go away 
                        for a long time and there is 
                        nothing I can do about it.

           The Bus pulls over. Rosanna stands and hands him her card.
                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Get her to talk. You don’t want to 
                        lose her when you just got her back.

           Rosanna gets off, Lu watching her as the Bus pulls away.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - LEIMERT PARK - A SHORT TIME LATER

           Lu’s walking away from the Bus Stop, when another call comes 
           through on his phone.

                                 LU
                        Yeah?

                                 MANNY (PHONE)
                        I’ve been calling you non-stop.

                                 LU
                        Got caught up.

                                 MANNY (PHONE)
                        We got a problem.

                                 LU
                        What?

           (Intercut as needed).

                                 MANNY
                        They scheduled a Brinks.

                                 LU
                        For when?

                                 MANNY
                        An hour from now.

                                 LU
                        How much has been delivered?

                                 MANNY
                        Half the score...

           Lu almost keels over. 

                                 LU
                        Can you cancel it?

                                 MANNY
                        Not without the pin.

           INT. STOLEN CAMRY - EVENING

           Lu’s driving the STOLEN CAMRY that was parked on the street, 
           his cell phone on speaker.

                                 MANNY (PHONE)
                        Turning onto Chavez.

           He floors it as he weaves through traffic.

                                 MANNY (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Took a left on Alameda, a mile up.

           Lu cuts left, passing UNION STATION as he turns onto Alameda.

                                 LU
                        Pulling onto Temple.

                                 MANNY (PHONE)
                        You’re close, you see it?

           He drives fast and spots--

           THE BRINKS TRUCK

                                 LU
                        Got it.

           Lu floors it, almost clipping the back of a PICKUP TRUCK, as 
           he pulls alongside the Brinks.

           EXT. STOLEN CAMRY - CONTINUOUS

           Lu cuts a hard left and crashes into the Brinks Truck front 
           right wheel well.

           The two vehicles skid along the street and come to a stop, as 
           other cars brake and swerve to avoid the collision. 

           INT. STOLEN CAMRY - NEXT

           Lu tries his door, but it’s smashed in and won’t open. He 
           climbs over the console and exits out the passengers’ side.
           EXT. TEMPLE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The Brinks DRIVER is already out of the truck, his REVOLVER 
           aimed and at the ready.

                                 DRIVER
                        What the hell man?

           He looks at Lu, who has sunglasses on and a cap pulled low.

                                 DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Get back or I’ll shoot.

           He cocks the gun, but Lu tucks tail and runs as a COP CAR 
           suddenly appears on the scene.

           EXT. TEMPLE STREET - NEXT

           Lu races down Temple towards the 101 Freeway. He looks over 
           his shoulder, as the Black & White turns up the block.

           Lu pumps his arms as he cuts across traffic, cars hitting 
           their brakes and skidding to a stop to avoid him, when--

           THUD

           A car hits him and he rolls across the hood.

                                 LU
                        Shit--

           He lands hard on the pavement and gets to his feet, limping 
           onto ALISO STREET that runs parallel to the 101.

           The Cop Car gets caught in the pile up and a UNIFORM hops out 
           and gives chase.

           EXT. ALISO STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Lu looks over his shoulder, the Uniform fifty yards behind.

           He cuts left on ALAMEDA, jogging now as the Uniform shouts.

                                 UNIFORM
                        Stop or I’ll shoot!

           Lu’s out of breath, about ready to give himself up, when--

           SCREECH

           A car pulls to a stop -- Manny behind the wheel.
                                 MANNY
                        Get in.

           INT. MANNY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Lu slides in and Manny peels out.

                                 LU
                        How’d you find me?

           Manny holds up a phone.

                                 MANNY
                        Find my phone app.

           Lu looks at the screen, a BLUE DOT tracking his location.

                                 LU
                        Thank God for that.

           INT. MANNY’S APARTMENT - KOREATOWN - LATER

           Lu chugs a glass of water and throws Ashleigh’s backpack over 
           his shoulder.

                                 LU
                        Get some sleep.

                                 MANNY 
                        You too.

                                 LU 
                        See you in a few hours.

           He leaves the apartment and closes the door--

                                                                 BLACK.

           INT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           Keisha is sleeping on her living room couch.

           Ashleigh’s eyes are wide open on the lower bunk in her cell.

           Manny’s staring at the ceiling in his studio apartment.

           Lu’s looking through Ashleigh’s bag and finds her RECEIPTS.

           The morning sun rises slowly over the downtown skyline.

           The Owner unlocks the door and enters the shop.

           INT. BACK OFFICE - ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - NEXT

           The Owner opens the safe and takes a whiff, before stuffing 
           bundles of cash in a duffle bag and paging the front desk.

                                 OWNER
                        Can you send Wayne back?

           INT. BACK OFFICE - ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - NEXT

           There’s a knock on the door and the Owner opens it to find--

           MANNY

           --dressed in a Security Guard’s uniform with sunglasses on.

                                 OWNER
                        Who are you? Where’s Wayne?

                                 MANNY
                        I can call the assignment office if 
                        you want?

           The Owner checks his watch.

                                 OWNER

           EXT. ZEN MARIJUANA DISPENSARY - UNIVERSITY PARK - NEXT

           Manny escorts the Owner and duffle bag to the parking lot and--

           ZAP

           He shocks the Owner with a TAZER and he falls to the ground. 
           Manny grabs his car keys, pops the trunk and lifts the Owner’s 
           body inside.

           A TELLER greets a Customer from behind a window.

                                 TELLER
                        How can I help you today?

                        Jay Greenstein, here for my 2:00...

           A reverse angle reveals Manny with the duffle bag, wearing 
           the Dispensary Owner’s jacket, hat and sunglasses.

           She checks the schedule -- JAY GREENSTEIN 2:00pm -- and looks 
           at Manny, suspicious.

           Manny watches the Teller send the bills through a cash 
           counter as she holds her nose.

                                 TELLER
                        I’ll never get used to the smell.

           She bands a bundle and sprays it with Febreeze, dulling the 
           scent of marijuana embedded in the bills.

                                 MANNY
                        Sorry about that.

           The Teller finishes counting and types up a receipt. 

           She prints it under her desk and bends down to grab it, but 
           when she pops back up--

           MANNY’S GONE...

                                 TELLER
                        Mr. Greenstein? 

           There’s a vibrating sound coming from the other side of the 
           window. She stands up and looks at the floor to find--

           MANNY
           Writhing around in the throes of a violent seizure.

                                 TELLER (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God!

           She runs out the SECURITY DOOR and races to his side, 
           clutching his head in her hands to protect it.

                                 TELLER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Greenstein can you hear me?

           His tremors continue, until--

           CLICK

           His body goes still, the Teller’s too.

                                 MANNY
                        Don’t scream.

           The Teller’s face falls, as Manny presses a pistol against 
           her ribs.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)

                        Excuse me...

           The Guard turns to find a DELIVERY MAN tugging a hand truck 
           with boxes of paper.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Best way to the finance office?

           The Delivery Man lifts his head and we realize it’s--

           The Guard points.

                                 GUARD

           The Cop inspects his credentials and pops the top on one of

           He moves towards the ALARM BUTTON, about to press it, when--

           The barrel of Manny’s pistol hits the side of his head.

                                 MANNY
                        I wouldn’t do that.

           The Finance Manager goes still.

                        Open the safe.

           The Finance Manager’s hand shakes as he turns the combination 
           dial and tries the door, but--

           IT DOESN’T OPEN

                        Take a breath and go again.

           The Finance Manager does as he’s told, going through the 
           process a second time and--

           THE DOOR OPENS

           Manny recoils and brings his hand to his nose. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Shit, that’s dank.
                             (To the Manager)
                        Put this on.

                        It’s not a fashion show.

           The Finance Manager slides the hood over his head and Manny 
           zip ties his wrists behind his back, lowering him to the 
           floor beside the Teller, when his phone vibrates.

           waiting on Lu.

           INT. FREIGHT ENTRANCE - LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

           Lu’s out of line, watching the Cop opening the lid of a box 
           to find-- 

           PAPER ON TOP

           He opens another -- More paper... A third -- Even more...

           Lu looks at one of the handle slits -- There’s money beneath 
           the first row of paper reams.

                                 COP
                        Have a good one.

           Lu loads the paper back into the van and closes the doors.

           He slides behind the wheel and pulls onto MAIN STREET, Manny 
           runs over and hops in when--

           AN ALARM CRIES OUT
           POLICE appear at the Freight Entrance with their guns drawn--

                        Get down.

           Lu hits the gas and speeds away -- Bullets piercing the sides 
           of the van, blowing out a back window and popping a tire.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - NEXT

           Black & Whites give chase, as the van turns up the block, 
           sparks flying from the tire that’s rolling on its rim.

           Lu’s got a solid head start, but the tire and stalled traffic 
           threaten to even the race.

           He looks in the sideview mirror, seeing red and blue lights 
           flashing behind them. 

           Lu pulls onto the sidewalk, sending PEDESTRIANS diving out of 
           the way, as he cuts a sharp right to bypass the traffic.

           EXT. STAPLES VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The van teeters on two wheels, sparks still flying, in danger 
           of tipping over as it pulls through the turn.

           He speeds down the ramp and pulls next to a MINI-VAN.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Keisha’s behind the wheel. She sees the bullet holes and 
           shattered windows.

                                 KEISHA
                        Oh dear God...
           INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Lu and Manny hop out.

                                 LU
                        Open the back.

           Keisha pops the back door and the two transfer the cash 
           filled boxes from the Cargo to the Mini-van.

           They’re fast, the entire job done in a matter of seconds.

           INT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Lu hops in back, about to shut the door, when Manny runs off.

                                 LU
                        Where you going?

           He jogs over to another car and pops the trunk to find--

           THE DISPENSARY OWNER 

           --tied up inside.

                                 MANNY
                        Your bill’s paid.

           He tosses the Owner his TAX RECEIPT, jacket, hat and glasses 
           and runs back to the Mini.

                                 LU
                        Really?

                                 MANNY
                        I don’t rob regular people.

                                 LU
                        Let’s go.

           Keisha peels out in reverse.

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NEXT

           Keisha’s about to pull out of the garage, when sirens scream 
           and COP CARS fly by-- 

                                 KEISHA
                        Holy hell!

           --almost clipping the front of the Mini-van.
                                 LU
                        Just breathe.

           She takes a breath and drives on.

           INT. MINI-VAN - NEXT

           Keisha drives the speed limit as she approaches a Police 
           enforced CHECKPOINT.

                                 KEISHA
                        What the hell kinda favor is this?

                                 LU 
                        A big one.

           Lu throws a blanket over the boxes, as Keisha watches the 
           POLICE inspect the cars ahead of them like border security.

           She closes in on the front of the line, her heart beating 
           through her chest.

                                 LU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Just breathe and it’ll be alright.

           EXT. CHECKPOINT - NEXT

           Keisha arrives at the front and rolls down her window. One 
           Cop watches her, while another one looks in the windows with 
           a flashlight.

                                 COP
                        License please.

           She hands it over -- A brutally tense moment lingering, as 
           the second Cop peers in the windows.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Keisha waits, beads of sweat bubbling on her brow.

                                 COP
                        Unlock the doors please.

           She does and--

           THWISH

           The second Cop opens the sliding side door. An infinitely 
           long moment lingers as the Cop looks around and--
                                 SECOND COP
                        It’s clear.

           Keisha’s confused.

                                 COP
                        Drive on.

                                 KEISHA
                        Thank you officer.

           She rolls up the window and eases on the gas, when--

           Lu and Manny pop up from under the cover of the depressed 
           cargo area, where the seats fold down.

                                 LU
                        You did good.

                                 KEISHA
                        This is the last time I’m doing you 
                        any favors. You can count on that.

           EXT. BUS STOP - A SHORT TIME LATER

           Keisha hops out of the van.

                                 LU
                        Thank you.

                                 KEISHA
                        Get going, before someone sees you.

           She smiles as they pull away.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE PARKING LOT - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NIGHT

           The Mini-van pulls up, Steven’s SUV already waiting.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Lu steps out, while Manny grabs a cell phone from the center 
           console and shoves it in his pocket. 

           There’s a second one there that he leaves in the cup holder.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE PARKING LOT - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS

           Steven and his Muscle step out of the SUV.
                                 STEVEN
                        You’re early.

           Manny appears with three boxes of paper from the back. Steven 
           nods and his Muscle pops the lid on one and reels back.

                                 MUSCLE
                        Stinks... but looks good.

           Steven grins.

                                 LU
                        We good?

                                 STEVEN
                        Little pigeon told me about a heist 
                        at City Hall. Seven figures taken 
                        from the Finance Office.

                                 LU
                        Where you keep all them birds?

                                 STEVEN
                        Not just any bird...

           Steven pulls out his pistol.

                                 LU
                        You’ve been made whole.

                                 STEVEN
                        What kind of man would I be if I 
                        passed up an opportunity like this? 

           Lu looks at Manny.

                                 LU
                        Give me your gun.

           Manny doesn’t move.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Give it to me and get in the van.

           Steven stands there with a shit eating grin on his face, as 
           Manny pulls out the pistol and takes aim at-- 

           LU...

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        What the hell you doing?

                                 STEVEN
                        Meet my little pigeon.
                                 MANNY
                        I’m sorry Lu.

           Steven nods to his Muscle.

                                 STEVEN
                        Get the rest.

           The Muscle moves to the back of the Mini-van, while Manny 
           holds Lu in place at gunpoint.

                                 LU
                        Thought you didn’t rob regular 
                        people?

                                 MANNY
                        He traced the hack... Was gonna 
                        turn me in if I didn’t play along.

                                 LU
                        What about Ash?

           Manny winces at the mention of her name.

                                 MANNY
                        She’s smart, she’ll be alright.

           The Muscle returns with the rest of the cash.

                                 STEVEN
                        Put it in back.
                             (To Manny)
                        Let’s go.

           Manny backs away from Lu and the three hop into the SUV, 
           Steven calling out to Lu before closing the door.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Hire a lawyer. She’s gonna need it.

           A bundle of cash lands at Lu’s feet and the SUV pulls away.

           INT. MINI-VAN - NEXT

           Lu slides behind the wheel about to turn the key, when he 
           notices a cell phone in the cup holder. He picks it up and 
           looks at the screen-- 

           IT’S MANNY’S PHONE

           He unlocks the home screen to find the Find My Phone App 
           still tracing the location of his phone.
           INT. SUV - SAME

           Steven and his Muscle are up front, Manny in the middle row, 
           the outline of Lu’s cell phone in his pocket.

           INT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - SAME

           Keisha’s cell rings. She answers, not recognizing the number.

                                 KEISHA
                        Hello?

           Lu’s voice comes through the receiver.

                                 LU (PHONE)
                        It’s me.

                                 KEISHA
                        What now?

                                 LU (PHONE)
                        I need another favor...

           EXT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Keisha walks towards the trash cans waiting by the curb for 
           the morning pickup.

           She adds another bag and looks back at the house, before 
           walking towards--

           THE MINI-VAN

           Lu rolls down the window and she hands him--

           A GUN

                                 KEISHA
                        It’s Ray’s.

           He looks it over, the serial number filed off.

                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        Not registered.

                                 LU
                        I appreciate you.

                                 KEISHA
                        This is the last time, for real.
                                 LU
                        I know.

           Keisha smiles and walks back towards the house, when--

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Keisha...

           She turns back, expectant.

                                 KEISHA
                        Yeah?

                                 LU
                        Here.

           He holds out the cash.

                                 LU (CONT’D)
                        Post bail and get her a lawyer.

           She takes the money.

                                 KEISHA
                        I’m sorry... I didn’t mean that 
                        shit I said about you and Ash.

                                 LU
                        I know.
                             (A beat)
                        You don’t hear from me, tell her... 
                        Tell her I tried.

           Keisha leans in and gives Lu a soft kiss, before he pulls off 
           into the night.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - LATER

           The SUV is parked outside.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Lu’s watching the building with a phone at his ear and 
           Rosanna’s business card in his hand.

                                 LU
                        You want the guy who staked the 
                        grow? Go to 1115 Industrial Street.
           EXT. BACK ALLEY - WAREHOUSE - NEXT

           The Muscle comes out the back door and lights up a cigarette. 
           He takes a long drag and exhales, when--

           CRACK

           A pistol hits the back of his head. He stumbles, but doesn’t 
           go down--

           CRACK - CRACK

           Lu hits him two more times and he collapses onto the 
           pavement. He kneels over him and takes his gun.

           INT. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY - L.A. BUREAU - NIGHT

           Rosanna’s burning the midnight oil, the VOICEMAIL button on 
           her phone blinking red.

           She picks up the receiver and plays the message.

                                 LU (VOICEMAIL)
                        You want the guys who staked the

           INT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NEXT

           Industrial work lights illuminate the open space, as Steven 
           gives Manny a tour.

                                 STEVEN
                        A year from now, you won’t be able 
                        to see the forest through the trees 
                        in here. We’re gonna be the 
                        Budweiser of the Cannabis business.

                                 MANNY
                        Budweiser, huh?

           Suddenly--

           CLICK

           They stop at the sound of a PISTOL HAMMER snapping into 
           firing position. Lu appears from behind a cement pillar.

                                 STEVEN
                        You don’t waste any time, do you?

                                 LU
                        Where’s the money?
                                 STEVEN
                        Why would I tell you that?

           Lu brushes his finger against the trigger.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re no killer. I can see it...
                             (Gestures to his eyes)
                        Right here.

           Steven reaches for his gun and--

           BANG

           Lu fires a shot at the cement floor. Steven and Manny jump.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, alright... You made your 
                        point.

                                 LU
                        Where - Is - It?

           Lu holds Steven’s stare, when--

           LIGHTS SHINE IN THE WINDOWS

           Lu glances away for a split second and Steven pulls his gun--

           BANG - BANG - BANG

           A shot clips Lu’s leg -- Manny dives for cover.

           Lu stumbles and falls to the ground, scurrying behind a 
           cement pillar.

           INT. ROSANNA’S CAR - SAME

           Rosanna’s idling outside, having just heard the shots.

                        Shots fired at 1115 Industrial 
                        street, requesting backup.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NEXT

           Lu’s behind a pillar, holding his wounded leg, when---

           BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG

           More bullets blister the cement buffer.
           The shooting stops and Lu listens for movement, peeking 
           around the left side of the pillar, but he can’t see a thing.

           He does the same with the right and sees a shadowy figure on 
           the move. He cocks his gun, exhales and spins around--

           BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG

           Lu holds his fire when he sees--

           MANNY

           Standing in the middle of the floor.

           Manny lifts a hand from his chest and blood pours from a 
           bullet wound, staining his shirt.

           Lu and Manny lock eyes for an instant, before Manny falls to 
           the floor.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - SAME

           Rosanna’s approaching the entrance with her weapon drawn and 
           creeps inside.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NEXT

           Lu takes cover behind the pillar again, torn apart by what 
           he’s just done.

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        Hell, you just made me a half 
                        million dollars.

           Lu glances at the blood seeping from Manny’s body, as it 
           expands across the floor.

           He leans against the pillar, listening for movement, not sure 
           of Steven’s location, when--

           BANG - BANG - BANG

           Three shots chip away at the cement -- One clips Lu’s 
           shoulder, sending his gun flying from his hand and another 
           rips into the side of his stomach. 

           Lu moves for the gun, but Steven kicks it across the floor.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Strange the lengths parents will go 
                        for their children. Guess that’s 
                        why I never had any.
           Steven circles the column...

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Shame you won’t be around to see her 
                        if she gets out.

           Lu comes into focus as Steven bends down.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to enjoy this.

           He raises his pistol, when--

                                 ROSANNA (O.S.)
                        Drop the gun!

           Steven glances at Rosanna and--

           BANG

           Steven’s eyes go wide.

                                 LU
                        I’ll be around...

           Rosanna fires at the sound of the shot--

           BANG - BANG - BANG

           Steven stumbles backwards and Lu rolls away, the Muscle’s 
           pistol smoking in Lu’s hand.

           Steven brings his hand to his stomach, feeling the oily blood 
           leaking from his body.

           Lu’s beside Manny now, watching his blood puddle on the 
           floor, as Manny struggles for breath.

                                 MANNY
                        I’m sorry Lu...

           Lu looks him over, he’s in a bad way.

                                 LU
                        It’s alright, you’re gonna be fine. 
                        You’re gonna be alright.

           Manny shakes his head, knowing his fate. 

                                 MANNY
                        I’m sorry, I’m so so sorry...

                                 LU
                        Yeah, me too.
           Rosanna’s voice cries out.

                                 ROSANNA (O.S.)
                        Police, drop your weapons!

           With his last dying breath, Manny whispers--

                                 MANNY
                        The back room...

           His eyes gloss over -- He’s gone.

           Sirens blare and light bars flash as Black & Whites pull up 
           to the scene.

           Rosanna approaches a body resting against a pillar with her 
           weapon drawn. 

                                 ROSANNA
                        Show me your hands.

           She takes another step to find -- STEVEN -- resting against a 
           pillar, his shirt covered in blood.

                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)

                                 STEVEN
                        He ran out the back.

           Lu limps into an empty room, the paper boxes scattered across 
           the floor.

           He looks around and finds a bag and kneels down, unzipping it 
           to find the stolen cash stuffed inside.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NEXT

           Uniforms descend on the scene, Rosanna giving them orders.

                                 ROSANNA
                        Get someone around back, now!

           A Uniform kneels beside Manny, quickly realizing he’s D.O.A.
                                 ROSANNA (CONT’D)
                        And call a bus, civilian down.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - WHOLESALE DISTRICT - NEXT

           Lu limps out the back door with the bag, passing the Muscle 
           who’s lying on the pavement.

           He nudges him with his foot and takes aim, ready to fire, but 
           pulls back at the last second. 

           He removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket--

           ASHLEIGH’S RECEIPTS

           --and opens the door to the SUV and tucks it in the glove 
           compartment.

           Rosanna and the Uniforms burst out the door, ready to fire--

                        Get on the ground!

           A reverse angle reveals--

           --rolling around on the pavement, the Mini-van gone...

           There’s an AIRSTREAM TRAILER parked behind a pickup truck,

           The door to the trailer opens and Ashleigh steps out, 
           climbing down the steps with two cups of coffee. We track her 
           as she walks towards--

           A GREENHOUSE
