           EXT. HARTSVILLE CEMETERY - PRESENT

           A soft rain falls. 

           HENRY (10) a wide-eyed kid in an ill-fitting suit, stands a 
           few feet away from the rest of the family. 

           Henry’s Mom, ELAINE, is disheveled in a cheap black dress. 
           She clings to his Dad, ANTHONY, and Henry’s two younger 
           sisters, PAIGE and OLIVE.   

           They’re all a mess.

           Behind the family, it looks like the whole town of Hartsville 
           came out for the funeral. 

           Henry blankly stares at a photograph of his GRANDMA GENNY and 
           the casket beneath it.

           IN MEMORY OF GENEVIEVE HOOPER

           Tears start to well but Henry swallows them back. He’s going 
           to be strong today. 

           Then his mother reaches out, but Henry pulls away.

           This is all suddenly too much for little Henry. He runs as 
           fast as he can from the service.

           Elaine starts to go after him, but GRANDPA WILBUR (70s), 
           whose vibrant green eyes always seem to be lost somewhere 
           else, stops her.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        I’ll get him.

           EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry hides behind an ENORMOUS GRAVESTONE. He scrolls through 
           his Iphone. 

           ON SCREEN: - Photos of Henry and Grandma Genny: 

           Henry dressed as a Brontosaurus, his arms wrapped around 
           Genny. 

           In a birthday hat, Henry with a gap-toothed grin. 

           In his baseball uniform, Henry and Grandma Genny sporting 
           their best “tough guy” scowls.
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (O.C.)
                        Henry, I don’t want to be at that 
                        service anymore than you do, but...

           Henry grips tighter to his phone. He doesn’t bother looking 
           up. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Come on. Your mother needs you 
                        right now. Your family needs you. 

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t care. It’s not fair. You 
                        got, like, a hundred years with 
                        her.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        You’re right. Sometimes life isn’t 
                        fair. But you gotta appreciate what 
                        you did get. And what you still 
                        got. 

           Grandpa Wilbur kneels beside his grandson.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Your grandmother may be gone, but 
                        the rest of us are still right 
                        here.

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t get it. Just... leave me 
                        alone. Please.

           Henry turns away. Knowing he’s not getting through, Grandpa 
           Wilbur rises to his feet.

           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - LATER THAT DAY

           Establishing. A quaint suburban home on a tree-lined street.

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A simple wake. Friends and relatives gather around Midwestern 
           delicacies. Jell-o molds and the like. 

           Grandpa Wilbur and Henry’s Mom, Elaine, look out the window. 
           OUTSIDE: Henry sits alone below a SYCAMORE TREE.

                                 ELAINE
                        He’s been like this since she died. 
                        He’ll barely talk. Won’t eat. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELAINE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve tried everything, but I can’t 
                        get through to him. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Why don’t you try leaving him with 
                        me? Just for the weekend. See what 
                        I can do. Besides, I could use the 
                        company. 

           Elaine smiles up at her Dad. Just then, ANTHONY brings her a 
           plate of food. She turns to watch Paige and Olive play in the 
           living room. Then at Henry... sitting alone in the rain.

                                 ELAINE
                        I guess it couldn’t hurt.

           INT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Henry tosses his bags on a pullout couch. He looks around the 
           room. This place is STUFFED with old SCIENCE FICTION books. 

           THE MAN WITH NO TIME by Wilbur Hooper. PLANET OF BOBOGS by 
           Wilbur Hooper  ROCKETSHIPS AND OTHER WAYS TO TRAVEL IN STYLE 
           by Wilbur Hooper.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (O.C.)
                        That bed gonna be all right?

           Henry nods.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Dinner is at 4:30. I usually do my 
                        writing after that. So, you got 
                        free rein of the house. Except... 
                        well, there is one pretty important 
                        rule. Under no circumstances are 
                        you to go in the shed. 

           Grandpa Wilbur points outside at the SHED. It’s bolted with 3 
           PAD LOCKS.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        It’s strictly off limits.

                                 HENRY
                        Why?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        It’s private. That’s where I do all 
                        my writing. No one has ever stepped 
                        foot in there but me. Not your 
                        mother. Not your grandmother. 
                        Nobody. You understand?
           Henry nods.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        No, this is important. I’m gonna 
                        need a verbal confirmation.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. I understand.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Good. I’ll see you in a bit.

           INT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Grandpa Wilbur and Henry sit in silence. They each pick at a 
           burnt POT ROAST.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Sorry. Your grandmother did most of 
                        the cooking. Guess there’s a lot 
                        I’m going to have to get used to.

           Henry doesn’t respond. He keeps his head down. Grandpa Wilbur 
           clears the plates. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        I’ll order pizza tomorrow. Now, I’m 
                        gonna go write. You gonna be, OK?

           Henry nods. He watches his Grandfather walk out the shed. And 
           triple lock the door behind him.

           EXT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S SHED - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A full moon hangs in the sky. Grandpa Wilbur finishes up 
           working, but as he exits: He leaves the shed door askew. 

           INT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Henry snores.

           CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Henry bolts awake. He looks at his clock 
           3:30 AM flashes.

           CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! He searches for the noise, it’s coming 
           from outside. From the shed. And the door to the shed? It’s 
           open.

           Henry’s curious. For all he knows, the sound could be his 
           grandfather.
           INT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry sneaks by his Grandfather’s room. He puts his ear to 
           the door. Snoring. The noise outside isn’t his grandfather. 
           Henry’s curiosity is growing.

           EXT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Henry stares at the open shed door. 

           CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Whatever is in there, it’s calling to 
           him. Henry looks around. Does he risk it? Of course he does. 

           As he enters, moonlight flickers against the glass window. An 
           auspicious moment of Spielbergian awe.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Henry turns on the flashlight in his 
           Iphone and looks for the noise. 

           CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Henry turns to an OLD OAK TABLE. Where a 
           pair of ROCKET POWERED ROLLER SKATES are slamming against 
           something METAL. Henry picks up the skates and turns them 
           off. 

           He sees the skates were slamming into a METAL ROCKER with a 
           robotic arm holding a BABY BOTTLE.

           Henry furrows his brow - what is this stuff? This isn’t a 
           writer’s workshop... it’s an inventor’s lab!

           As Henry continues his search, he picks up a strange looking 
           UMBRELLA.  But when he opens it - the umbrella douses him 
           with WATER. 

           Henry screams as he tries to fight the umbrella, but the 
           water continues to spray. In the tussle, Henry drops his 
           phone. It smacks on the ground with a sickening shatter.

                                 HENRY
                        Shit. 

           Henry looks around to make sure an adult didn’t hear him 
           curse.

           The umbrella finally trickles out. Henry is soaking wet. He 
           picks up his phone. The light won’t come on. He begins to 
           panic. But that’s when he sees it.
           Sitting on a desk is a thin, leather bound book. Old and 
           weathered, but it’s not like anything else in the workshop. 
           It’s... professional.

           And a stream of moonlight perfectly illuminates the book like 
           a spotlight: 

           THE GADABOUT TM 1050

           Curious, Henry opens to the first page and reads:

                                 HENRY
                        Congratulations on purchasing your 
                        Cudworth-Hooper Gadabout TM 1050. A 
                        “lite-vacuum” time machine.

           Henry stops. His eyes go wide.

                                 HENRY
                        What?

           Mesmerized, Henry turns to another page.

                                 HENRY 
                        Before using your Gadabout time 
                        machine, please familiarize 
                        yourself with all operating 
                        instructions and safety features 
                        found in this owner’s manual...

           Henry flips through the manual. A BRIGHT RED PAGE with a 
           skull and cross bones grabs his attention.

                                 HENRY
                        Never attempt to operate your time 
                        machine in the event of Dimensional 
                        Collapse. Doing so may result in 
                        fire, explosion, implosion, flood, 
                        earthquakes, gravitational reverse, 
                        accidental death, universal 
                        destruction and/or the end of time 
                        and space. 

           Henry shuts the manual --

                                 HENRY
                        What is this thing?

            -- And notices the back cover: A picture of his grandfather 
           at 20 years old under the text-The Gadabout Time Machine was 
           invented by Wilbur Hooper. 

           Suddenly, the door to the shed flies opens. 
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (O.C.)
                        Henry, are you in here?!?

           Henry tries to hide, but it’s too late. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        What was the ONE RULE??! I told you  
                        to stay out of the shed!

           Henry holds up the Gadabout manual.

                                 HENRY
                        What is this thing?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        It’s nothing. Come on, out of here. 
                        NOW!

                                 HENRY
                        Did you invent a time machine?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        That’s ridiculous, Henry. There’s 
                        no such thing as a time machine.

           Henry can tell Grandpa Wilbur’s hiding something.

                                 HENRY
                        Tell me! Or I’m going to tell 
                        everybody what you’re really doing 
                        in here! 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        You’ll do no such thing!

                                 HENRY
                        I’m calling my Mom. Right now!

           Henry puts the phone to his ear.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        OK. OK. If I tell you about the 
                        Gadabout. You promise to keep this 
                        place to yourself?

                                 HENRY
                        I promise.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        All right. But not here.

           Grandpa Wilbur takes the manual from Henry and exits. 

           The tiniest of smiles forms on Grandpa Wilbur’s lips.
           EXT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The sunrises over the horizon. Grandpa Wilbur and Henry sit 
           on TWO ROCKING CHAIRS looking out into the street.  And on 
           the table between them are TWO COFFEE CUPS and the GADABOUT 
           MANUAL.

           Grandpa Wilbur hands Henry a coffee cup. Henry frowns at it.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        It’s cocoa, Henry.

           Henry smiles and takes a sip.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Now, if I tell you this. You have 
                        to promise to not tell a soul. 
                        Swear to me. No one can know.

           Henry nods.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Verbal, Henry. Swear to me.

                                 HENRY
                        I swear!

           Grandpa Wilbur takes a long sip of his coffee. Let’s Henry 
           squirm a bit.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        All right. I wasn’t always a 
                        writer. Once upon a time, I was 
                        somewhat of an inventor.

                                 HENRY
                        What do you mean inventor?

           The suburban home ticks back in time.  The paint freshens. 
           The trees begin to shrink. The cars parked outside grow 
           bigger and brighter.  

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        Well, it all started right here in 
                        Hartsville. July 3rd, 1958.

           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - 1958

           And suddenly, there stands a 22-year-old WILBUR HOOPER on the 
           front porch. Surprisingly handsome with a nerdy charm. The 
           same vibrant green eyes always dreaming of something bigger.
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        I was a young man with my whole 
                        life in front of me. And just 
                        certain that I was going to be a 
                        huge success. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m going to be a huge failure.

           Young Wilbur looks down at a LARGE CONTRAPTION covered in a 
           white sheet. He hangs his head, but then a pair of arms wrap 
           around his waist. There’s GENNY (22) - she practically glows.

                                 GENNY
                        You are not. 

                                 WILBUR
                        My Dad always told me I was “never 
                        going to amount to nothing.” I was 
                        born in Hartsville a fool. I was 
                        going to die in Hartsville a fool. 
                        That’s what he said. And I’m 
                        starting worry, Genny, what...

           Wilbur turns to Genny, fear overcoming him.

                                 WILBUR
                        What if he was right?

                                 GENNY
                        He’s not, Wilbur. Besides, you’re 
                        already everything. 
                             (she kisses Wilbur)
                        My only worry is that you get too 
                        successful. I’m not sure I’d even 
                        know how to love you in an ironed 
                        shirt.

                                 WILBUR
                             (grabbing his wrinkled 
                              collar)
                        Do I need to change?

                                 GENNY
                        Of course not. You’re going to do 
                        great.

           They share a moment of warmth. This is a couple worth rooting 
           for.

           Wilbur’s confidence buoyed, he turns to leave - But as he 
           drags the large contraption down the driveway a look of worry 
           crinkles on Genny’s brow. 
           And we see why:

           INT. HARTSVILLE BANK - JULY 3RD, 1958

           CLOSE ON: Sweat pours down Wilbur’s face.

           He stands in front of a conference table lined with middle 
           aged men in MATCHING SUITS. Wilbur nervously checks a thick 
           stack of NOTE CARDS. He’s not doing great.

                                 WILBUR
                             (stuttering and 
                              stammering)
                        Time is an... um an illusion. But 
                        manipulating that illusion requires 
                        an enormous amount of - 

                                 JAMES HART
                        Jesus H. Christ, Wilbur. What do 
                        you want my money for this time? 
                        Spoon Forks again?

           At the far end of the table, JAMES HART (45) owner of the 
           HARTSVILLE BANK, puffs on his CIGAR and kicks his feet on the 
           table.

                                 MATCHING SUIT 1
                        Remember the glasses that fit in 
                        your eyeballs?

                                 MATCHING SUIT 2
                        Or the phones that connected to the 
                        air?

           The room fills with laughter.

                                 JAMES HART
                        Agh, if you weren’t so entertaining 
                        we wouldn’t keep letting you in 
                        here.

                                 WILBUR
                        No, this time you’re going to love 
                        it! 

           Wilbur nods to the LARGE CONTRAPTION under in a white sheet.

                                 WILBUR
                        This is going to be a HUGE SUCCESS. 
                        You see..
                             (back to his cards)
                        Time requires energy. Well, 
                        manipulation of... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILBUR (CONT'D)
                        Time itself just moves. It’s the 
                        fourth quadrant of.. What I’m 
                        trying to say is. To manipulate 
                        that - 

                                 JAMES HART
                        Just show it to us, Wilbur!

           Wilbur nods. And then peels off the sheet and we get our 
           first look at his invention -

           A crude five by five box of unfinished metal. The crass 
           device perches uneasily on a set of wobbly wheels. Everything 
           about it says: DEATH! DO NOT ENTER!

           The men go silent. The cigar falls from Mr. Hart’s mouth.

                                 WILBUR
                        I call it the, umm, Go-Backer.

           Wilbur holds for applause... it obviously doesn’t come.

                                 WILBUR
                        And it’s, umm, this is the exciting 
                        part. It’s -

                                 JAMES HART
                        Not even funny this time. It’s just 
                        sad. 

                      MATCHING SUIT 1
                                                     MATCHING SUIT 2
           So sad. 
                                              A tragedy really.

                                 WILBUR
                        But I haven’t told you what it 
                        does.

                                 JAMES HART
                        What it does is give me the heebie 
                        jeebies.

                      MATCHING SUIT 1
                                                     MATCHING SUIT 2
           So scary.
                                              Frightening really.

                                 WILBUR
                        But really I think you’re going to 
                        want to hear what it -  

                                 JAMES HART
                        ENOUGH! 

           Mr. Hart nods to a pair of SECURITY GUARDS.
                                 JAMES HART
                        Wilbur, I say this as a friend. 
                        Some men just don’t have it. And 
                        life gets a whole lot easier for 
                        ‘em when they accept that.
                             (after letting that sink 
                              in)
                        It’s time to accept it.

                                 WILBUR
                        But I -

                                 JAMES HART
                        You’re a fool, Wilbur. And you’re 
                        not welcome in here again.

           The guards pick Wilbur up by the elbows.

                                 WILBUR
                        WAIT! WAIT!

           INT. HARSTVILLE BANK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wilbur is lifted by the guards, his feet dancing in the air. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Just listen to me. 

           INT. HARTSVILLE BANK LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

                                 WILBUR
                        I’ve invented a - 

           The guards toss Wilbur out the door.

           EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE BANK - CONTINUOUS

           He lands on the concrete with a THUD. A defeated whisper is 
           all he has left.

                                 WILBUR
                        But I’ve invented a time machine.

           And then just for good measure. WHACK! His machine rolls in 
           behind, smacking Wilbur in the back of the head.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wilbur drags his rickety machine through the town square.
           Everything well kept and clean. This is 1950s small town 
           America at its finest. And all decked out for the 4th of July 
           celebration tomorrow.

           LEROY the SHOP KEEPER tips his hat as Wilbur treads by his 
           APPLIANCE STORE selling the latest in 1950s conveniences.

                                 LEROY
                        Hey Wilbur. You got scraps for me?

           Wilbur looks back at the machine.

                                 WILBUR
                        Not yet.

           As Wilbur walks, his machine awkwardly SCREECHES behind him. 

                                 LEROY
                        Poor fool.

           As Wilbur trudges along he passes: 

           - VICKY the TEENAGE TICKET TAKER at the MOVIE THEATER playing 
           “Another Time, Another Place” starring Lana Turner.

           - BARBARA a HOUSEWIFE pushing a stroller in one hand and 
           grasping the hand of a small boy in the other.

           - VITO of VITO’s ITALIAN RESTAURANT, standing in front of his 
           quaint brick building with an American Flag out front.

           All of them avoid Wilbur’s gaze. And their faces fall to an 
           expression of sad pity after he passes. 

           EXT. ACORN STREET - HARTSVILLE

           The nicest street in Hartsville. 

           As Wilbur continues to drag his contraption, he passes 
           BEAUTIFUL HOME after BEAUTIFUL HOME. His eyes fill with envy.

           And as he walks, the houses get smaller and smaller until 
           Wilbur turns to the corner of his own street -

           EXT. OAK STREET - HARTSVILLE

           The trees may be shorter and the fences are certainly whiter. 
           But it’s the same street where Grandpa Wilbur started our 
           story.

                                 DON
                        Ah, a fellow man of the trade.
           Wilbur had been so focused on comparing his life to his 
           neighbors that he hadn’t noticed DON CUDWORTH (Mid 20s) 
           appear beside him. 

           Don Cudworth could sell pool tables to Harold Hill, but most 
           folks reach for their wallets as soon as he smiles.

           At present, Don pulls a bulky VACUUM CLEANER behind him.  

                                 DON
                             (studying Wilbur’s 
                              invention)
                        Never seen one of these before. 
                        What’s it do?

           Don knocks on the device.

                                 WILBUR
                        Stop that!

                                 DON
                        Never touch another man’s 
                        merchandise. Believe you me, I get 
                        it, friend. So, who saddled you 
                        with this monstrosity? Kirby?

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not a salesman.

                                 DON
                        Ah, don’t get down on yourself. You 
                        just got stuck with a real dud 
                        there. And listen I’ve been in some 
                        terrible small towns, but this one 
                        might be the very worst of the 
                        worst. So, it’s not all your fault.

           Don studies Wilbur for a moment.

                                 DON
                        But I believe in you. You’ll sell 
                        one yet. 

           Wilbur didn’t know it, but he needed that. 

                                 DON
                        Ah, this is me. And look at that. 
                        No car in the driveway. And if I’m 
                        not mistaken that’s Perry Como 
                        wafting on the speakers. We got a 
                        housewife all by her lonesome. And 
                        that means I got a sale. Best of 
                        luck to you fellow traveller. Men 
                        like us gotta stick together. 
                                 WILBUR
                        But I’m not a - 

           But Don’s already wielded the vacuum cleaner up to the front 
           door. And he’s hardly knocked before a BEAUTIFUL HOUSEWIFE 
           with RED CAT EYE GLASSES lets him inside.

           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Wilbur lugs up the driveway.  And we see Genny and Wilbur’s 
           home in its heyday. It’s different than every other home on 
           the block; well loved instead of well kept. Which is an 
           optimistic spin on saying it’s in rough shape.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Wilbur rolls the machine inside. Even in 1958, his workshop 
           is stuffed with failures. 

                                 WILBUR
                             (to himself)
                        Dad was right.

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME 

           The failures still weigh on his mind as he opens his front 
           door. But then there’s Genny. She smiles, and everything 
           about Wilbur’s day suddenly doesn’t seem so dire. 

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Wait a minute.

           EXT. WILBUR’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - PRESENT DAY

           Wilbur and Henry rock on the porch. Henry sports a cocoa 
           mustache.

                                 HENRY
                        If you had a time machine, why 
                        didn’t you just got back and do the 
                        meeting again?

                                 WILBUR
                        Tried that. After about the 10th 
                        time. I resigned myself that it was 
                        never going go right.

                                 HENRY
                        Why not just use the time machine 
                        for yourself?
                                 WILBUR
                        That’s awful selfish. Great 
                        inventions are meant to be shared 
                        with the world.

                                 HENRY
                        You really expect me to believe in 
                        any of this?

                                 WILBUR
                        That’s up to you. Now, can I get 
                        back to the story?

           Henry nods, wipes away his mustache.

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S KITCHEN = 1958

           A model 1950’s kitchen with all the model 1950’s trimmings. 
           Wilbur sulks at the kitchen table.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        Now, see your grandmother loved me 
                        something fierce, but she never 
                        cared much for my time machine.

           Genny spins the makings of a pie crust in a BATTERY POWERED 
           KITCHEN-AID MIXER. 

                                 GENNY
                        Maybe it’s for the best. Give you, 
                        us some time for each other and 
                        maybe finally - 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not going to let you marry a 
                        failure.
                             (gesturing to their beat-
                              up home)
                        This is not going to be our life. 

                                 GENNY
                        You’re not a failure, and I happen 
                        to love our life. 

           Suddenly, Genny’s mixer dies.

                                 GENNY
                        Oh not again.

                                 WILBUR
                        Battery’s probably dead. 

           Wilbur pours himself a glass of water. 
                                 WILBUR
                        And you just think you love our 
                        life. Can you pass the salt? 

           Genny hands him the SALT. Wilbur pours LOTS of salt into the 
           glass. 

                                 WILBUR
                        But you’ll see. When I finally sell 
                        the Go-Backer. I’ll get you the 
                        ring and the proper house and the 
                        family and the whole thing. 

                                 GENNY
                        I just need you, Wilbur. 

           Genny kisses Wilbur.

                                 GENNY
                        But I wouldn’t mind hurrying up on 
                        that family.

                                 WILBUR
                        Yes, you’ve made yourself crystal 
                        clear on that point.

           They share a smile. And then Wilbur removes COPPER WIRING and 
           ALUMINUM FOIL from a drawer. 

                                 WILBUR
                        But I don’t think you really 
                        understand, Genny.

           Wilbur pulls TWO CLIPS from Genny’s hair.

                                 WILBUR
                        The Go-Backer’s not just going to 
                        change our lives. It’s going to 
                        change the whole world.

           Wilbur attaches the hair clips to opposite ends of the copper 
           wiring. 

                                 GENNY
                        TV dinners were supposed to “change 
                        the whole world” Instead, everyone 
                        forgot how to cook. And what do 
                        people do with that extra time not 
                        cooking? They watch more Jackie 
                        Gleason. Your machine might give 
                        people more time, but that doesn’t 
                        mean they’re going to appreciate it 
                        any differently.
           Wilbur folds a piece of aluminum foil and wraps it around the 
           side of the cup.

           Suddenly, the weight of what Genny said hits him.

                                 WILBUR
                        What are you trying to say, Genny? 
                        Do you not believe in the Go-
                        Backer? Do you not believe in me? 

           Genny collects herself. She knows what she is about to say is 
           hard, but she needs to say it.

                                 GENNY
                        Of course I believe in you. And I 
                        love you. BUT I’m worried that 
                        you’re so set on proving your 
                        father wrong, that you haven’t 
                        thought about if what you’re doing 
                        is right.

           Wilbur isn’t quite sure how to respond, but he’s hurt. He 
           turns away and focuses on his work, attaching one hair clip 
           to the foil and the other hair clip to the blender. The 
           copper wire runs between them. 

           Suddenly, a spark shoots and the blender springs to life. 

                                 WILBUR
                        That salt water battery’s not a 
                        permanent fix, but it should hold 
                        ‘til I can buy you a new one. 

           Wilbur coldly walks to his work shed.

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur wait. Why don’t we go to 
                        Vito’s tonight? Have a nice dinner. 
                        Forget all about this. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I need to get back to work. 

           But then Wilbur stops. He mulls something over, and decides 
           it’s his turn to speak his mind.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny, my Dad’s wrong. And so is 
                        Mr. Hart. And so... so are you. I’m 
                        going to make this thing a success.  
                        I’m not a failure, and I’m not 
                        gonna let you tell me otherwise.

           This breaks Genny’s heart, but Wilbur stays firm.
                                 WILBUR
                        Tell me when the pie is ready.

                                 GENNY
                        The pie is for tomorrow. We’re 
                        going to the July 4th parade. Did 
                        you forget?

           He did. He forgot the 4th of July. Literally the easiest 
           holiday in the world to remember.

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur...

                                 WILBUR
                        I’ll be done late tonight.

           With that, Wilbur leaves. A sadness wells inside Genny. 

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Curlers in her hair. Genny readies for bed... but Wilbur 
           isn’t there. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        You see, this might be hard to 
                        understand now. But back then, it 
                        took a lot of courage for your 
                        grandmother to move in with me 
                        before we were married.

           She looks out the window. The lights to Wilbur’s workshop 
           shine. Genny turns off her lamp. And crawls into bed... 
           alone.

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Genny awakens. She turns to the other side of the bed. It’s 
           still neat. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        But that day she made a decision.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED

           Wilbur, exhausted and dirty, studies his machine. In a 
           attempt to spruce it up, he’s painted it BRIGHT RED. And 
           somehow made it uglier.
           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S KITCHEN - DUSK

           Apple pies line the counter. Genny stares at them, tears 
           filling her eyes. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        One that, in it’s own way, took a 
                        whole lot more courage.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED

           Wilbur hammers the machine. And yes, it’s gotten even worse. 

                                 GENNY
                        I’m leaving. 

                                 WILBUR
                             (not looking up from his 
                              work)
                        Is it time already? Would you be 
                        upset if I didn’t go? 

                                 GENNY
                        I’m leaving.

                                 WILBUR
                        I heard you. I’m asking --

           Genny stands there in her PAISLEY SUMMER DRESS. BLUE SUITCASE 
           in hand. Her eyes watering but resolute. 

                                 WILBUR
                        What is this about?

           BOOM! Outside, a GREEN firework shoots into the night sky. 
           The color illuminates the shed.

                                 GENNY
                        I have to leave.

                                 WILBUR
                        I don’t understand. I thought you 
                        loved me.

                                 GENNY
                        I do. But this house. This little 
                        shed. It’s enough for me, but it’s 
                        never going to be enough for you. 
                        You want big, wonderful things from 
                        your life. And I can’t keep holding 
                        you back from them.
                                 WILBUR
                        That’s not fair.

                                 GENNY
                        It’s not. For either of us. I know 
                        that.  And I know that even if you 
                        sweep me off my feet right now, 
                        part of you is always going to 
                        regret it. That’s why I’m making 
                        this decision for both of us. 

                                 WILBUR
                        But I need you, Genny. 

                                 GENNY
                        I need you too, Wilbur. But maybe 
                        that’s not enough.

           Genny’s said all she can... and now it’s time for her to 
           leave.

                                 WILBUR
                        Wait! GENNY, WAIT!

           But Genny’s gone.

           Wilbur’s doesn’t know what to do. He turns to his machine. Is 
           this what he really wants? Wilbur suddenly isn’t so sure. 

           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME

           Tears streaking down her face, Genny runs down the driveway. 

           BOOM! Genny looks up as the second RED firework explodes in 
           the night sky.  A couple passes Genny on the sidewalk, mid-
           fight: 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hurry, we’re missing it!

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        And who’s fault is that?

           Genny buries her head and rushes past them. 

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED

           Wilbur picks up a CROW BAR. His knuckles go white gripping 
           into the steel. He’s about to make a decision when - 

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
           Wilbur runs to the door.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny!

           But it’s not Genny. It’s Don Cudworth. His vacuum cleaner and 
           million dollar smile in tow.

                                 DON
                        Hey friend! Good to see you again.
                        Nobody was at the front door, 
                        friend, so I thought I’d try back 
                        here -  

                                 WILBUR
                        Not interested.
                             (as he tries to shut the 
                              door.)
                        And it’s the Fourth of July.

                                 DON
                             (pressing himself against 
                              the door.)
                        Men who want things other men can’t 
                        have need to do things other men 
                        won’t do. That means this man 
                        doesn’t do holidays.

           Don smiles. Wilbur again tries to shut the door, but Don 
           sneaks in his polished shoe.

                                 DON
                        Just hear me out friend. I sell one 
                        more of these fine machines, and 
                        I’m out of your town forever. But 
                        I’m in a bit of a pickle ‘cause all 
                        your friends and neighbors are at 
                        the fireworks. And you see, I’m 
                        afraid if I spend another night at 
                        the Hartsville Inn, well I might go 
                        a little batty. So, maybe we can 
                        help each other out?

           Using some form of door-to-door salesman wizardry, Don snuck 
           into the shed during the previous speech.

                                 WILBUR
                        How did you?

                                 DON
                             (taking in the mess)
                        Now you look like a man who could 
                        use a vacuum.
           Don’s already plugged in the vacuum.

                                 DON
                        See how it sucks away -

                                 WILBUR
                        JUST STOP IT!

           Wilbur unplugs the vacuum. Undeterred, Don shifts gears.

                                 DON
                        Hey, there it is!

           Don walks right up to Wilbur’s machine. 

                                 DON
                        Now, come on. You have to tell me 
                        what this thing does, friend.

           And because Wilbur’s had about all he can take. He tells him.

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s a time machine. Now, leave me 
                        alone.

                                 DON
                        Wait just one minute. You can’t 
                        tell me you have a time machine and 
                        then kick me out on the street. And 
                        just so I’m understanding you 
                        right, you mean a time machine? As 
                        in a machine that travels 
                        through... time? 

           Wilbur doesn’t answer. But something about the way he’s 
           looking at Don tells him he might be telling the truth.

                                 DON
                        Show me. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not showing you anything. Now, 
                        get out!

                                 DON
                        Well... fair enough. I’ve been at 
                        this long enough to know when I’m 
                        not getting anywhere. 

           Don makes his way to the door...
                                 DON
                        BUT, if I’m not mistaken, you were 
                        walking that thing home from the 
                        town square yesterday. Which means 
                        you took it to show to somebody. 
                        And because it’s still here that 
                        means it either doesn’t work or you 
                        got laughed out of the room before 
                        you reached the punch line. 

           Wilbur looks away. Don senses it was the latter.

                                 DON
                        And yet, you invented a time 
                        machine. You might be responsible 
                        for the greatest innovation known 
                        to man... and you deserve to show 
                        that to someone. Even if just to 
                        prove to yourself that you’re more 
                        than this squalor you currently 
                        reside in.

           Don lets that linger. Wilbur looks around at his humble shed.

                                 DON
                        Now, I’m not claiming to be someone 
                        special. But I am offering to take 
                        a peek.

           Wilbur thinks on that for a moment. Then, he walks over to 
           the device and... opens the door. 

           A moment of awe and grandeur as we build up to our first 
           proper look inside the time machine. The anticipation slowly 
           crescendos until Don peeks inside and sees:

           Two folding chairs crammed together. Three dirty car 
           batteries welded on top of each other. And a time dial duct-
           tapped to the wall.

                                 DON
                        You don’t plan on killing me, 
                        right?

           INT. WILBUR’S “GO-BACKER” DEVICE

           Cramped. Cold. Everything about the experience is pretty 
           horrific. But Don’s smile never leaves.

                                 DON
                        So, where we headed? To see ancient 
                        kingdoms? The wild west? The 
                        dinosaurs?
                                 WILBUR
                        No. Travelling that far back would 
                        require an unfathomable amount of 
                        energy. Of Battery power. 

                                 DON
                        What happens if you use too much 
                        energy?

                                 WILBUR
                             (as he readies the 
                              machine)
                        First off, when the engine runs out 
                        of battery it collapses in on 
                        itself.

                                 DON
                        OK... What happens then?

                                 WILBUR
                        Disaster. Of what capacity I have 
                        no interest in finding out.

           Wilbur tests the batteries on the floor.

                                 WILBUR
                        This battery can handle travelling 
                        back an hour. Hour and half at 
                        most. It’s time travel for simple 
                        trips. 

           Off Don’s look.

                                 WILBUR
                        Time requires energy. Well, 
                        manipulation of... Time itself just 
                        moves. It’s the fourth quadrant of - 

                                 DON
                        Friend, how’s your car engine work?

                                 WILBUR
                        Fuel, air, pressure, and 
                        electricity combine to create the 
                        small explosion that moves the 
                        car's pistons up and down until - 

                                 DON
                        Well, most people don’t know that. 
                        Let me let you in on a universal 
                        truth, friend, Americans don’t care 
                        how machines works. They care what 
                        machines can give ‘em. Give ‘em 
                        more time. Give ‘em more freedom. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Give ‘em more envy from their 
                        neighbors. And when you give ‘em 
                        that, they don’t want to know how 
                        you did it. They want know how you 
                        can give ‘em more of it.

                                 WILBUR
                        But I’m just explaining how - 

                                 DON
                        What do you say we just try it?

           Wilbur nods and reaches over to the TIME DIAL. Which looks an 
           awful lot like a regular old EGG TIMER.  He turns it back 
           three minutes. 

           The whole machine starts to violently shake. And hum. Don 
           covers his ears. Waits for the big event. More shaking. MORE 
           HUMMING!

           AND THEN - 

           Nothing. Everything just stops.

                                 WILBUR
                        All right, when we go outside 
                        remember to lay low.

                                 DON
                        Wait, that was it?

                                 WILBUR
                        What were you expecting?

                                 DON
                        I don’t know. 
                             (with great awe and 
                              wonder)
                        “Time travel”?

                                 WILBUR
                        Let me let you in on a universal 
                        truth. Science is boring.

           Wilbur peeks out the door. Smoke fills the cabin. 

                                 WILBUR
                        All right, hurry. We gotta go now!

           This guy is clearly a nut job.
           EXT. WILBUR’S SHED - THE PAST?

           Everything looks exactly the same.

                                 DON
                        All right. You got me, friend. Very 
                        funny.

                                 WILBUR
                        Shh!

           Wilbur pulls Don behind an ENORMOUS WORK TABLE. From behind 
           the table, the rest of shed is obstructed from view. 

                                 DON
                        What are you -

           But then he hears it -  

                                 PAST DON (O.S.)
                        Now see. 

           Don peeks around the table and SEES HIMSELF IN THE PAST

                                 PAST DON
                        You look like a man who could use a 
                        vacuum.

           Present Don turns to Wilbur, his mouth stupidly agape.

                                 DON
                             (whispered)
                        I don’t believe it. I DON’T BELIEVE 
                        IT! You actually invented a time 
                        machine?

           Wilbur smiles in a way we haven’t seen before. Pure joy.

                                 WILBUR
                        I did.

                                 DON
                        So, what do we do now? Wait, I read 
                        about this in a Ray Bradbury novel,  
                        I can’t let my past self see me, 
                        right? 

                                 WILBUR
                        No. Well, not yet.
                             (off Don’s confused look)
                        See that you doesn’t know time 
                        travel exists. So, you’d scare the 
                        bejesus out of him.
           Behind them, in the “past” we hear:

                                 PAST WILBUR
                        It’s a time machine. Now, leave me 
                        alone.

           Back to the present:

                                 WILBUR
                        But if a future you came to see you 
                        now, you’d be fine with it, right?

                                 DON
                        Sure...?

                                 WILBUR
                        When talking to your past self you 
                        just have to remember that you’ll 
                        be just as scared of you as you are 
                        of you. So, as long as you visit a 
                        you that knows there could be 
                        another you. You’ll be fine.

                                 DON
                        I didn’t follow a word of that, 
                        friend. 

           Wilbur laughs in his kooky way.

           Oddly charmed, Don turns to his past self -

                                 PAST DON
                        I’m not claiming to be someone 
                        special. But I am offering to take 
                        a peek.

           Don reaches out for a PENCIL on Wilbur’s work table, but 
           Wilbur smacks his hand away.

                                 WILBUR
                        Be careful. If you change the past, 
                        you’ll remember it. But to everyone 
                        else, it just becomes reality. 

                                 DON
                        So, what do we do now? Go back to 
                        the future?

                                 WILBUR
                        No, we can’t go back to the future. 
                        You can only go back to the 
                        present.
           Mystified, Don shakes his head. Wilbur’s a tough guy to 
           follow. Never-the-less, he follows him back into the machine. 

           INT. WILBUR’S GO-BACKER

           Wilbur points to a cracked button labeled PRESENT. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I push this, and we travel to the 
                        exact moment we left. Our past 
                        selves will be climbing in just as 
                        we’re climbing out. 

                                 DON
                        How’s that work?

                                 WILBUR
                        Past Don and Wilbur use their 
                        Gadabout in the past timeline.  And 
                        we use OUR Gadabout to return to 
                        their present timeline once, and 
                        independent of when, past Don and 
                        Wilbur depart.

                                 DON
                        Do you even follow that?

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s all easier in practice.

                                 DON
                        If say so. But why can’t we go to 
                        the future?

                                 WILBUR
                        Because the future is always 
                        changing, and locating that kind of 
                        moving target would require an 
                        enormous amount of energy.

           Wilbur presses the PRESENT button. Waits a moment, and then -

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - THE PAST

                                 PAST DON
                        You don’t plan on killing me, 
                        right?

           Past Don and Past Wilbur climb into the machine. The Gadabout 
           glimmers and DISAPPEARS.
           Moments later, another Gadabout reappears. Don and Wilbur 
           climb out. 

                                 DON
                        So, what now?

                                 WILBUR
                        Now, you go back to your vacuums. 

                                 DON
                        BACK TO MY VACUUMS?! No! I need to 
                        be a part of this.

                                 WILBUR
                        There’s nothing to be a part of.

                                 DON
                        That is the single greatest 
                        invention in the history of human 
                        civilization! 

                                 WILBUR
                             (almost to himself)
                        The bank doesn’t think so. 

                                 DON
                        You told the bank that you invented 
                        a time machine and they said what? 
                        “Time travel? Who’d be interested 
                        in that?”

                                 WILBUR
                        Well, no. Not exactly. You see... 
                        I mentioned the Go-Backer and -

                                 DON
                        THE GO-BACKER?!? That’s what you’re 
                        calling this thing? Sounds to me 
                        like you just need a salesman.

           Wilbur hadn’t thought about that. Don smells a whiff of his 
           favorite thing - opportunity. He reaches into his coat pocket 
           and lays out a out A STACK OF BILLS.

                                 DON
                        This is everything I’ve earned 
                        since I’ve been in Hartsville. I 
                        want to be your partner. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not sure I’m looking for - 
                                 DON
                        Friend, I don’t want to be selling 
                        vacuum cleaners the rest of my 
                        life. And I don’t think you want to 
                        spend the rest of yours in this 
                        shed.  But I think together we can 
                        create a life beyond our wildest 
                        dreams. 

           Wilbur catches his reflection in beat-up machine. His wild 
           hair. His hallow eyes. His WRINKLED SHIRT.

                                 DON
                        You’re not a fool, Wilbur. You’re a 
                        genius. And with my help, the world 
                        can finally see that. 

           Don extends his hand. 

                                 DON
                        So, what do you say partner?

           Wilbur looks back to the shed door... where Genny left. He 
           makes a decision - 

           And shakes Don’s hand.

                                 DON
                        You’re not going to regret this! 
                        Not going to regret it!!! Don 
                        Cudworth and...

                                 WILBUR
                        Wilbur Hooper.

                                 DON
                        Cudworth and Hooper. That sounds 
                        like two men ready to change the 
                        world to me. 

           EXT. WILBUR’S HOUSE - PORCH - PRESENT

           Henry runs a FINGER along the manual.

           INSERT: The Cudworth-Hooper Gadabout TM 1050.

                                 HENRY
                        You know how I know this isn’t 
                        real?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        How is that?
                                 HENRY
                        If it was real, you’d be a bag- 
                        gillionaire.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Maybe there’s a reason I’m not.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, ‘cause this story is baloney.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        What do you say we stretch our 
                        legs? Unless, of course, you want 
                        me stop.

                                 HENRY
                        No. Keep going.

           Henry stands. Grandpa Wilbur follows him and they start their 
           walk through Hartsville.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR 
                        All right. So, Don started changing 
                        the time machine. Started changing 
                        me.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - 1958

           Don digs through his briefcase.

                                 WILBUR
                        So, what exactly are you thinking?

                                 DON
                        Oh, I got ideas.

           From his briefcase, Don spreads out ADVERTISEMENTS 
           exemplifying the height of 1950’s atomic age design: THE 
           CADILLAC CYCLONE and THE EGG CHAIR along with photos of MEN 
           WITH MARTINIS and CIGARS and WOMEN SMOKING CIGARETTES AROUND 
           A RADIO. 

                                 DON
                        We’re gonna give that thing style.

           Don pulls out a fresh suit.

                                 DON
                        We’re gonna give you style. 

           Don pulls out a KODAK BROWNIE video camera.
                                 DON
                        Then, we’re gonna give the people a 
                        show. But first, we gotta do a heck 
                        of a lot better than the Go-Backer.

           CLOSE ON: A FLYER

           The smiling faces of Don and Wilbur under the title: THE 
           GADABOUT TM 1050!

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Gadabout? What does that even mean?

           INT. SUZY’S DUPLEX APARTMENT - EDGE OF HARTSVILLE - AFTERNOON

           SUZY (Early 20s), who believes in one holy book - Amy 
           Vanderbilt’s “Complete Book of Etiquette”, sits on a small 
           couch next to Genny. Who holds the FLYER.

                                 SUZY
                        Is it French? It sounds French -
                             (in a terrible french 
                              accent)
                        Gadooobooot.

                                 GENNY
                        It means to travel often. For 
                        pleasure

                                 SUZY
                        For pleasure? Oooooooh. That is 
                        French. 

                                 GENNY
                        I just can’t believe he’s actually 
                        going to do it.

           Suzy reads more text: GET ONE BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS DO! TONIGHT 
           AT THE HARTSVILLE AUDITORIUM!

                                 SUZY
                        Is it a kind of car? 

                                 GENNY
                        I’m sure you’ll find out tonight.

                                 SUZY
                        You know, you really should come. 

                                 GENNY
                        No, I... that’s all right.

           Suzy condescendingly squeezes Genny’s knee.
                                 SUZY
                        Isn’t it just like a man? To leave 
                        you and then become a big success? 

           Genny tries to ignore that. Suzy returns to the flyer.

                                 SUZY
                        So, pleasure? Is it something for -

           In her best PG friendly way, Suzy tries to pantomime sex.

           INT. HARTSVILLE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           A buzz of activity. A large projection screen looms at the 
           front of a PACKED HOUSE.

           INT. HARTSVILLE AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE

           A thin curtain separates Don and Wilbur from the crowd. We 
           can almost make out the finished Gadabout behind them, but it 
           never quite comes into view. 

           Wilbur, who now wears a SUIT and HAIRCUT as crisp and clean 
           as Don’s, nervously paces.

                                 DON
                        Calm down, Wilbur. 

                                 WILBUR
                        But what if they hate it?

                                 DON
                        No one’s going to hate time travel.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny did.

                                 DON
                        Who’s Genny?

           Wilbur stops pacing.

                                 WILBUR
                             (brushing it off)
                        It’s not important. 

           Don clocks Wilbur’s lie. Stores it away.

                                 DON
                        Listen to me. We’re going to play 
                        the ad. Show off the Gadabout. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Then, the whole world’s going to 
                        beg us to take their money.

                                 WILBUR
                        Not the whole world. Just 
                        Hartsville. Don, you agreed to a 
                        trial run. The implications of wide-
                        spread - 

                                 DON
                        I heard you, friend. But I still 
                        don’t know what you’re so worried 
                        about. We’re about to give people 
                        the whole world at their finger 
                        tips... how could they possibly 
                        misuse that?

           Wilbur thinks on that.

                                 WILBUR
                        You’re right. I just... 

                                 DON
                        Friend, look at all those people. 

           Don parts a small opening in the curtain, revealing the whole 
           town of Hartsville.

                                 DON
                        After tonight, you’re going to be a 
                        new man. So, stop worrying about 
                        who you are. And start preparing 
                        for who you’re gonna be.

           The auditorium lights suddenly dim. The crowd goes silent. 
           Don turns on a PROJECTOR.  A picture flickers.

           CUDWORTH-HOOPER PRESENTS:  THE GADABOUT TM 1050

           ON SCREEN: THE GADABOUT COMMERCIAL

           The black and white crackles. A 1950’s Kitchen (which we 
           recognize as Wilbur’s) fills the screen.

           A HOUSEWIFE (whose CAT EYE GLASSES we might remember from 
           Don’s first vacuum sale) cleans a dirty kitchen. In the next 
           room, her baby starts to cry. She runs for the child. As she 
           does, the OVEN starts to smoke. The woman returns with a BABY 
           crying in her arms. She sees the smoke -  

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        Oh no!
           She pulls out the CHARRED TURKEY. But with the mess in the 
           kitchen, she has no where to put it. Then, she hears the 
           dreaded words - 

                                 HUSBAND (O.S.)
                        Honey, I’m home. 

           The housewife collapses, completely overwhelmed. Don walks 
           into the picture.

                                 DON
                        Just need a little more time? 

           The housewife turns to Don and sadly nods her head.

                                 DON
                        Well, now you can have it... with 
                        the Gadabout TM 1050!

           As if by magic, The Gadabout appears inside the kitchen. 

           We’ll see it in color in just a moment, but even in black and 
           white - it’s MAJESTIC.

           A SHINING CIRCULAR DOME. As if Cinderella’s pumpkin merged 
           with a luxury automobile. Every edge and seam finished with 
           CHROME. It rests on four STURDY TIRES and OVAL WINDOWS dot 
           the exterior.

           INT. THE GADABOUT

           Inside the Gadabout, Don and the Housewife sit in two LEATHER 
           EGG CHAIRS facing a sleek console covered with dozens of 
           CONTROLS, LEVERS, and BLINKING LIGHTS.

                                 DON
                        The Gadabout TM 1050 is a time 
                        machine. Designed for home use. 

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        A time machine? That sounds 
                        complicated.

                                 DON
                        Time travel couldn’t be easier. All 
                        you have to do is set the patented 
                        time wheel to how far back in time 
                        you’d like to travel. 

           Don points to the TIME WHEELS - rotating dials nestled below 
           two FLIP CLOCKS. One marked Hours. The other minutes. 
                                 DON
                        The Gadabout can safely travel back 
                        in time up to two hours.

           The Housewife dials the time wheel back 30 minutes.

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        It is easy!

                                 DON
                        And with the Gadabout there’s no 
                        reason not to travel in style.

           Don flicks a lever and A METAL CLAMP comes out of the 
           console. It offers the Housewife a cigarette. Simultaneously, 
           Don lights a CIGAR on a SIMULATED WOOD FIRE FLAME. And then 
           in a flash, Don whips them both up a pair of MARTINIS in the 
           Gadabout’s custom bar. 

                                 DON
                        Now, we’re ready.

           The housewife nervously grabs the sides of her chair. 

                                 DON
                        Not to worry, time travel is as 
                        safe as that cigarette. All you 
                        have to do is press that little 
                        button.

           Don pushes a RED BUTTON (light grey for now) just below the 
           time wheels. 

                                 DON
                        And we’re time travelling!

           INT. WILBUR’S KITCHEN

           Don and the housewife step out of the Gadabout. The Housewife 
           looks at the time on her oven. 

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        Why it’s 30 minutes ago!

           The Housewife removes the turkey from the oven. A perfect 
           golden brown.

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        It really worked!

                                 DON
                        The Gadabout always works! 
                                 HUSBAND (O.S.)
                        Honey, I’m home.

           Now, the housewife greets her husband with a martini, a 
           perfectly cooked turkey and a sleeping baby in her arms.  

           (Wilbur plays the HUSBAND, even in his cameo role he’s a 
           truly horrendous actor.)

           JUMP CUT: 

           The Housewife, her HUSBAND and YOUNG SON sit around the table 
           enjoying the turkey with Don. 

                                 DON
                        And the Gadabout is so stylish and 
                        compact, it could be right at home 
                        on your driveway or as the focal 
                        point of your living room. And the 
                        Gadabout’s not just for you, Nancy. 
                        Oh No.
                             (turning to the child)
                        Junior, imagine getting a little 
                        more time to finish that homework. 
                             (to the husband)
                        And Mr. Smith why not spend an 
                        extra hour with the fellas? I won’t 
                        tell.   

           The whole family laughs. 

                                 DON
                        The Gadabout TM 1050. Get it right 
                        here in Hartsville. Before anyone 
                        else.

           A picture of the Gadabout fills the screen. 

                                 JINGLE SINGERS (O.S.)
                             (SUNG)
                        There’s nothing left to be sad 
                        about. With your very own Gadabout.

           The picture slowly crackles out. 

           INT. HARTSVILLE AUDITRIUM

           The audience sits in stunned silence. A time machine can’t 
           actually be real. But then the curtains begin to part, and 
           out drives THE GADABOUT... in all its glory. And yes it 
           DRIVES... Don’s even given it locomotion.

           And I can’t stress enough how absolutely SPECTACULAR it is.
           The Gadabout situates in front of the crowd. The door opens. 

                                 DON
                        That’s right, folks. The Gadabout 
                        TM 1050. A time machine... for 
                        everyone!

           And of course that induces PANDEMONIUM. The crowd mobs Don 
           and Wilbur. Wilbur stands silent, unsure what to say.

                                 SUZY
                        Is a time machine safe?

           Everyone turns to Wilbur... He freezes.  Don steps into to 
           save him.

                                 DON
                        Of course it’s safe. As long as you 
                        follow all the simple precautions 
                        in the manual.

           Don pulls out the manual. A much thinner version of the one 
           now in Henry’s hands.

                                 VITO OF VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT
                        When can I have one?

                                 DON
                        As soon as we get into production. 
                        Which once we have the funds should 
                        be -  

                                 VOICE
                        OUT OF THE WAY!

           The crowd parts to reveal James Hart, an unlit cigar dangling 
           from his mouth. Mr. Hart looks in the WINDOW of the Gadabout 
           and sees - An exact replica of what we just saw in the ad... 
           but this time in vivid color.

           He flings open the door and then presses a button on the 
           interior console. The SIMULATED WOOD FIRE FLAME emerges and 
           Mr. Hart lights his cigar.

                                 JAMES HART
                             (skeptical as ever)
                        Let me see if it works. 

                                 DON
                        That’s why it’s here, friend.

           James kicks the tires on the Gadabout and then gingerly ducks 
           into the machine. Don climbs in after. 
           Moments later, the Gadabout FLASHES and disappears. The crowd 
           gasps! The Gadabout reappears almost instantaneously. The 
           crowd gasps... again!

           The Gadabout door flies opens. James Hart stumbles out... a 
           changed man. His hair and suit are disheveled. He walks 
           toward Wilbur with the crazed look of someone who, well, has 
           just time travelled.

                                 JAMES HART
                        I’m not often wrong about a man. 
                        Never wrong really, but Mr. Hooper, 
                        you have the full support of the 
                        bank. However much you need, this 
                        should be in the hands of every 
                        American by yesterday.

                                 DON
                        Not every American quite yet. We’re 
                        trial running right here in 
                        Hartsville! 

           Don winks at Wilbur.

                                 JAMES HART
                        Of course you are! Hartsville is 
                        going to be the time travel capital 
                        of the world!

           The crowd erupts. Leroy the SHOPKEEPER, his WIFE, and TWO 
           KIDS approach Wilbur.

                                 LEROY
                        Wilbur, anything you need, don’t 
                        hesitate to ask. Whatever I can do 
                        to be apart of this.

           Leroy excitedly shakes Wilbur’s hand. Wilbur’s still stunned 
           by all this to speak.

                                 DON
                             (whispered)
                        You did it Wilbur... 

           All around the auditorium, everyone pulls money from their 
           BILLFOLDS and PURSES.

                                 DON
                        But I think we’re going to have to 
                        move production out of your shed.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        So, that’s what we did. We bought a 
                        factory.
           EXT. OLD FARM BUILDING - OUTSIDE HARTSVILLE

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        Well, a farm really.

           Don and Wilbur stand in front of a decrepit, abandoned farm 
           building just outside of Hartsville, the downtown nestled 
           below a hill. 

           HARTSVILLE RIVER separates the locales while a charming 
           BOWSTRING BRIDGE connects them.

                                 WILBUR
                        Don, I was born in this town. And I 
                        know everything about it.
                             (Wilbur points out 
                              sections of Hartsville.)
                        The civil war battle on the river. 
                        The forgotten train stop. The old 
                        dirt roads. 

                                 DON
                        What’s your point, Wilbur?

                                 WILBUR
                        In the history of Hartsville, Old 
                        Peterson’s farm is without a doubt 
                        the ugliest thing ever constructed.

                                 DON
                        That’s why it’s so cheap. Come on, 
                        you of all people should have some 
                        imagination. Just dream a little.

           And sure enough as Wilbur looks back up to the building. It 
           transforms into - 

           EXT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES 

           A dazzling factory. Like an old Coca-Cola plant, the Cudworth-
           Hooper logo is plastered on SCAFFOLDING.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MOMENTS LATER

           When Wilbur and Don first enter the space it’s an old, dusty 
           BARN. But as Don talks us through his plans, they manifest 
           themselves before us.

                                 DON
                        First, we mold the Gadabout’s 
                        foundation.
           An enormous machine spewing FIRE and METAL presses molds of 
           the Gadabout.

                                 DON
                        We assemble the time console. 

           A long ASSEMBLY LINE snakes through the space. The machinery 
           and FACTORY WORKERS each appear piece by wonderful piece. The 
           Factory Workers are the same Hartsville citizens from the 
           town hall. LEROY, who abandoned his appliance store, waves.

                                 LEROY
                        Glad to be here, Wilbur!

                                 DON
                        The engine and battery construction 
                        will of course stay private.

           A THICK BLACK CURTAIN drops over that section.

                                 DON
                        And then it all comes together.

           The mold. The console. The engine. The battery. They merge  
           to create the marvelous Gadabout.

                                 DON
                        Right here!

           A PAINT SPRAY GUN MACHINE drops from the ceiling. Coating the 
           various completed Gadabouts in LIME GREEN. ROYAL BLUE. BRIGHT 
           PINK.

                                 DON
                        And one final step - Personal 
                        inspection by the President of the 
                        company.

           Don shows Wilbur his office door - Wilbur Hooper. President 
           of Cudworth-Hooper Industries. Wilbur runs his fingers along 
           his name.

           Then, he turns to the factory. Blustering with activity. A 
           perfectly designed engine of innovation and industry. A 
           living manifestation of Wilbur’s dreams. It’s all finally 
           real. 

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s beautiful.

           A tear forms in Wilbur’s eye. And the first Gadabouts are 
           loaded onto a TRUCK.
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        And then time started to move... 
                        fast. 

           A LARGE CLOCK hanging over the factory begins to TICK. TICK. 
           TICK.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        And slow. There was a lot of time 
                        travel.

           MONTAGE MUSIC!!! To the tune of the GADABOUT JINGLE.

           CLOSE ON: The CLOCK ticking closer and closer to twelve. 
           Quickly, the clock morphs into the SPINNING WHEELS OF A 
           BICYCLE.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE BRIDGE 

           A YOUNG BOY (10) rides a GREEN BIKE across the bridge. When a 
           HUGE BULLY appears in front of him. The bully shoves the boy 
           to the ground. And rides away with his bike as the young boy 
           wipes blood from his skinned knees.

           INT. SUZY’S BEDROOM

           CLOSE ON: A TWO BELLED ALARM CLOCK. WHACK! A hand slaps away 
           the ringing.

           And reveals Suzy, groggy eyed and not quite ready to get out 
           of bed. But she slowly and painfully rises to her feet.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE

           A matching suit from the bank, let’s call him FRANK has just 
           been fired. He carries a box with all of his things... and he 
           has a terrible haircut.

           IN RAPID SUCCESSION:

           Tears streaming down his face, the young boy walks through 
           his front door: And sees the Gadabout. 

           Exhausted, Suzy passes her Gadabout on her driveway.

           A deflated Frank passes his Gadabout on the street.

           THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME GREAT IDEA.

           The Young Boy turns the TIME WHEEL in the Gadabout back 30 
           minutes. Suzy an hour. Frank two.
           Then, they ALL HIT THE RED BUTTON. 

           EXT. THE YOUNG BOY’S SUBURBAN HOME - HARTSVILLE

           The young boy walks out his front door, PUSHING HIS GREEN 
           BIKE, but the moment he steps outside - another version of 
           himself is waiting. 

           His future self hangs a STOP WATCH around his past self’s 
           neck. The clock ticks down from TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES. Then, 
           the future boy shoves a small PARCEL attached to a matching 
           STOP WATCH into the bike’s basket.

           The young boy is thoroughly confused, but his future self 
           just gives him a knowing wink.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - HARTSVILLE - LATER

           The young boy peddles his bike down MAIN street. The stop 
           watch around his neck ticking down from TWENTY MINUTES. As he 
           rides, he passes - 

           GADABOUT’s gleaming Everywhere. A Bright RED GADABOUT rests 
           outside a BARBER SHOP.

           INT. HARTSVILLE BARBER

           FRANK sits down for a haircut. But before the Barber can 
           raise his scissors, a pair of hands whisk the Barber apron 
           off Frank. And there stands another Frank with a terrible 
           haircut, he moves his past self over to a new barber.

           EXT. OAK STREET - HARTSVILLE

           The young boy continues to ride. His stop watch ticking down 
           to 10 minutes. He rides by JAMES HART’s house

           INT. ACORN STREET - JAMES HART HOUSE

           James Hart rushes inside and turns on his television... the 
           end credits of Jackie Gleason play. James Hart curses to 
           himself, but then - 

           He sees another version of himself in the living room, 
           finishing a TV dinner and laughing heartily at the episode’s 
           last joke. James Hart’s future self points his past self to 
           the Gadabout in the living room.
           EXT. HARTSVILLE BRIDGE

           The boy and his bike. The clock ticking down to 5 minutes. 

           INT. SUZY’S BEDROOM

           CLOSE ON: The two belled alarm clock. 

           WHACK! Suzy slaps the alarm. She flips over to find - BACON 
           and EGGS. Then, she looks at herself in the mirror - her hair 
           and make-up already done.  And today’s dress is pressed and 
           waiting. With a note -

           “Have a good day, Suzy! Love, Suzy!”

           INT. HARTSVILLE BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM

           Frank, the matching suit, stands to give a presentation. But 
           before he gets up, he looks down to his hand - IN REAL TIME. 
           Sharpie writing appears on his palm. 

           “YOUR FLY IS DOWN.”

           On a note pad on the table is scribbled, “AND YOU’RE NOT 
           WEARING BRIEFS.” Frank quickly zips his fly.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE BRIDGE

           The young boy sits on the ground as the bully rides away with 
           his bike. He looks down at the stop watch. It clicks ZERO! 
           The stop watch RINGS!

           POOF! Grey smoke rises from the bike’s basket. The bully 
           begins to gag. He tosses the bike to the ground and runs far 
           away from it. The young boy nervously walks toward the bike. 
           Holding his nose as he approaches, he finds a STINK BOMB in 
           the basket. The timer attached to it blinking ZERO. 

           The boy looks up and from the other side of the bridge, his 
           future self gives him a knowing wink.

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        WAIT! How is TIME TRAVEL EVEN 
                        POSSIBLE?!?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 2016

           Henry and Grandpa Wilbur have reached the town square. A few 
           chain stores have moved in, but its charm is still in tact... 
           except the building on the hill is a TARGET. 
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        The engine and battery construction 
                        are labelled right there in the 
                        manual.

           Henry frantically flips to that page. Sure enough, there is 
           an illustration. Every part of the engine and battery labeled 
           with corresponding numbers. 

           But when Henry reads the numbers - they’re all labeled OTHER. 

                                 HENRY
                        Is this a joke?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Well, I can’t give away all my 
                        secrets.

           Henry gives his grandfather the stink eye.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                             (laughing that off)
                        Let’s go grab a bite.

           Grandpa Wilbur opens the door to VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT. 
           It’s still there. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Unless you want my roast again?

                                 HENRY
                        No thanks.

           Henry and Grandpa Wilbur share a smile. 

                                 HENRY
                        But if this story is true, wouldn’t 
                        there be, like, Gadabouts 
                        everywhere? It doesn’t add up.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Of course it doesn’t. Story’s not 
                        done yet. Now, the Gadabout was a 
                        hit.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES 

           The assembly line machinery roars as the Factory workers 
           frantically try to keep up. 
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        And the people of Hartsville didn’t 
                        know how they ever lived without a 
                        time machine. But Don thought we 
                        needed to start thinking bigger. 

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        It’s been three weeks. No major 
                        hiccups. It’s time to go National.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           A clean and professional version of Wilbur’s work shed. A 
           GIANT, FRAMED PHOTO of HARTSVILLE hangs over Wilbur’s desk.

                                 DON
                        But the thing is, Wilbur. These 
                        small town folks? They’re fine 
                        travelling back an hour or two. But 
                        real people. New Yorkers and the 
                        like. They’re going want to go 
                        BACK. FAAAAR BACK. And to go 
                        FORWARD!

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s not possible. If the battery 
                        were to die and the engine were to 
                        collapse - 

                                 DON
                        Disaster. You’ve said.

           Don pulls out the Gadabout manual.

                                 DON
                        But that’s why we have the manual. 
                        Anything you think might go wrong. 
                        We just put a disclaimer in here. 
                        And we’re no longer liable. 

           Don sets the manual on Wilbur’s desk where he notices the 
           framed picture of GENNY. Embarrassed, Wilbur shoves the photo 
           into a drawer. 

                                 DON
                        But Wilbur if we aren’t working 
                        toward the future. Then, this 
                        company is meaningless. It’d knock 
                        your socks off how quickly this can 
                        all go way.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t want to go back to that 
                        shed now do you, friend?
           Don smiles, but he also lets that wash over Wilbur. 

                                 DON
                        You’ll figure out that pesky 
                        battery.

           Wilbur slumps in his chair... what’s he going to do?

           INT. SUZY’S DUPLEX APARTMENT - GENNY’S ROOM

           Genny finishes applying an EYE LINER PENCIL. She’s dolled-up, 
           clearly getting ready for some big event, when she hears 
           GIGGLING from just outside her door.  

           She opens it to find -

           INT. SUZY’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY

            - THREE SUZY’S in IDENTICAL DRESSES talking to each other in 
           the bathroom. One Suzy sits on the TOILET. While another Suzy 
           leans on the SINK. And a third Suzy finishes her HAIR. 

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        And then he’ll make a comment about 
                        the weather. It won’t sound like a 
                        joke, but it is.

                                 SUZY (TOILET)
                        Oh yes, he loves when you laugh at 
                        that. 

                                 GENNY
                        What are you doing?

                                 ALL THREE SUZYS
                             (turning to Genny)
                        Oh, you look beautiful.

           All three Suzys giggle at their unison response.

                                 GENNY
                        Thank you. But Suzy, why are 
                        there... three of you?

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        I’m telling me how my date is going 
                        to go. Giving myself some tips.

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        I went first. It went pretty well. 
                                 SUZY (TOILET)
                        Then my date went even better. 

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        And this time it’s is going to be 
                        perfect. 

                                 GENNY
                        Is this safe? 

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        Gadabouting your dates? Oh, it’s 
                        the hippest.

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        The hippest.

                                 SUZY (TOILET)
                        The absolute hippest.

                                 GENNY
                        I don’t know. It sounds - 

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        WAIT A MINUTE! Don’t tell me you’re 
                        only going on your date tonight in 
                        the present?

                                 SUZY (TOILET)
                        Genny, are you square? 

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        Go for an hour. Then, Gadabout and 
                        start again. 

                                 GENNY
                        No, I think I’ll just do it the 
                        once.

                                 ALL THREE SUZYS
                        WHY?!

                                 GENNY
                        I don’t need to time travel to know 
                        if I like a man. 

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        How did that work out with Wilbur?

                        TOILET SUZY
                                                        HAIR SUZY
           SUZY!
                                              SUZY!
                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        Sorry, but it’s true. And you both 
                        were thinking it.

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        What she’s... what I’m trying to 
                        say is that this is your first date 
                        in a long time. Don’t you want it 
                        to be perfect?

                                 GENNY
                        I’d rather it be real. Great dates 
                        aren’t perfect. They’re messy. 
                        They’re awkward. They’re 
                        complicated... cause that’s what 
                        love is. And you’re never going to 
                        experience that if you’re so busy 
                        trying to change it.

           Genny pauses. That hits her in a way she wasn’t expecting.

                                 SUZY (HAIR)
                        Well, suit yourself.

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        If you want to waste your time. 

                                 SUZY (TOILET)
                        Go right ahead. 

           The Suzys turn their attention back to themselves.

                                 SUZY (SINK)
                        Now, during the salad course, he’s 
                        going to get something green stuck 
                        in his tooth.

                        SINK SUZY
                                                       TOILET SUZY
           Don’t mention it!
                                              Don’t mention it!

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur sits comatose behind his desk. He looks at his DESK 
           PHONE. And then he pulls out the photo of Genny from his 
           drawer. He looks from the photo to the phone. He’s about to 
           make a decision when his door opens.  

                                 LEROY
                        You have a minute, Mr. Hooper? 

           Wilbur hurriedly shoves the photo in his desk.
                                 WILBUR
                        Not right now. 

                                 LEROY
                        Well, I won’t bother you. I just 
                        wanted to say thank you before 
                        heading home. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Thank you for what?

                                 LEROY
                        All this. I mean, you’re doing for 
                        Hartsville what Henry Ford did for 
                        Detroit. And for me, well, I’ve 
                        been a working man my whole life. 
                        Spent every hour of my day puttin’ 
                        food on my family’s table. But now, 
                        after I’m done putting in a day’s 
                        work, I can use that machine of 
                        yours to go back and sit at that 
                        table and enjoy that food with ‘em. 
                        It’s one thing to provide for your 
                        family, but actually getting to see 
                        ‘em everyday. It’s - 
                             (he gets choked up)
                        Life changin’. And when every man 
                        in the country has their very own 
                        Gadabout... can’t even imagine the 
                        good that’ll do. And being a part 
                        of that. It means a lot to me. So, 
                        I just, well, wanted to say thank 
                        you. 

           Leroy smiles, soft and sweet.

                                 LEROY
                        Sorry, I won’t take any more of 
                        your time, Mr. Hooper.

                                 WILBUR
                        Thank you, Leroy.

                                 LEROY
                             (as he exits)
                        Oh, and I do love that jingle. 
                        “There’s nothing left to be sad 
                        about. With your very own 
                        Gadabout.”  

           Wilbur smiles. His purpose reinvigorated, he bolts to his 
           feet and yanks the battery plans from his wall. Leroy’s 
           right. Everyman in the country deserves their own Gadabout.
           CLOSE ON: Wilbur’s CLOCK as the hours tick away.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE - LATE 
           AFTERNOON

           The sun sets as piles of TRASH litter Wilbur’s desk. 

                                 WILBUR
                        If I put the gel inside the... NO, 
                        then I need to. THINK, WILBUR! 
                        THINK!

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Moon light shines through the window. The factory is empty. 
           Wilbur is buried in a pile of trash.

                                 WILBUR
                        What if I move the current and wire 
                        it through. Wait, NO! Then I have 
                        to - AHHH!

           Wilbur chucks another failed idea across the room. Almost 
           hitting Don as he peeks his head in the door. 

                                 DON
                        How’s it coming, friend?

                                 WILBUR
                        I can’t get the electrons to remain 
                        stable and move fast enough through 
                        any kind of reliable electrolyte. 

           Don looks at Wilbur, not understanding a word of what he just 
           said.

                                 WILBUR
                        My Dad was right.

           Wilbur collapses in a heap. That sensation of failure creeps 
           up on him. No amount of success ever seems to wipe that 
           feeling completely clean. Don sees this... and has an idea.

                                 DON
                        Well, Wilbur, it’s been my 
                        experience that not one single, 
                        solitary good idea has ever come 
                        without the aid of a martini.

                                 WILBUR
                        No, I can’t. I have to - 
                                 DON
                        One drink. Then I promise I’ll take 
                        you right back here to keep beating 
                        yourself up.

           Wilbur laughs. Looks around at his mountain of bad ideas.

                                 WILBUR
                        I guess it couldn’t hurt.

           INT. VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A busy FRIDAY NIGHT. Dozens of plates of SPAGHETTI and 
           CHICKEN PARMESAN. 

           A WAITER carries a tray of RED WINE. He tries to avoid a 
           passing patron, but he TRIPS. And spills the wine all over a 
           WOMAN in a WHITE PARTY DRESS.  

           VITO appears beside her. 

                                 VITO OF VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT
                        Not to worry. One minute and this 
                        will have never happened. 
                             (grabbing the waiter, 
                              whispered)
                        My Gadabout’s out back. 5 minutes 
                        oughta do it.

           The waiter hurries out back and passes Genny on her date with 
           Frank - the bad haircut, fly down matching suit.

                                 FRANK
                        You look beautiful. 

                                 GENNY
                        Thank you.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re, ugh, very welcome.

           Frank wipes away a bead of nervous sweat. Genny smiles. She’s 
           clearly got a type.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re also smart. And funny. And 
                        the beautiful is just... a plus. 

                                 GENNY
                        That’s very sweet, Frank. And 
                        you’re quite handsome, too. As far 
                        as “funny”...
                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I know some jokes. Good ones.

                                 GENNY
                        I’m sure you do. 

           Genny and Frank share a moment.

           INT. VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - BAR

           Wilbur and Don order from the BARTENDER.

                                 DON
                        Martini for me. And a -

                                 BARTENDER
                        And a margarita with a salted rim 
                        for you, Mr. Hooper?
                             (off Wilbur’s look)
                        You ordered it earlier. I guess you 
                        ordered it now, just earlier... for 
                        me? Before when you ordered it, I 
                        didn’t know what a margarita was. 
                        And Mr. Cudworth got real upset. 
                        So, I Gadabout-ed back in time, 
                        went to the library, and looked up 
                        the recipe. Now here we are again. 
                        And here are your drinks.

           The bartender slides across the already completed cocktails.

                                 DON
                        Isn’t that fantastic?

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s a lotta work to be honest.

           Don sips his MARTINI. Wilbur his MARGARITA.

                                 DON
                        Margarita?

                                 WILBUR
                        They’re fun.

                                 DON
                        You’re a weird guy, Wilbur. That’s 
                        why I like you. 

           Don pounds his fist on the bar, then looks out at the dinner 
           crowd - it’s pulsing with energy.
                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Look at that excitement. We did 
                        this. The whole country’s going to 
                        be like this soon. 

                                 WILBUR
                        If I solve the battery.

                                 DON
                        You will. Because that is what 
                        great men do. Look at the rest of 
                        these “men”.

           Don turns Wilbur around to face the dining room. 

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        All of them content with 
                        mediocrity. Men who look at their 
                        wives. Their homes. Their cars. And 
                        smile with satisfaction? Those are 
                        not men destined for greatness. No, 
                        great men like you and me say... 
                        Are you OK, Wilbur? 

           He isn’t. Wilbur’s gone white. He’s spotted Genny and Frank. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m. I’m fine. I just... I’ll... 
                        I’ll be right back.

           Don watches Wilbur go. Not liking the look he just saw.

           INT. VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - GENNY’S TABLE

           Genny laughs with Frank, clearly the date is going 
           spectacularly well.

                                 GENNY
                        That is a good joke. 

           The WAITER approaches.

                                 FRANK
                             (without skipping a beat)
                        I’ll have an old fashioned. The 
                        lady will have a martini. Very dry. 
                        With cocktail onions instead of 
                        olives. 

                                 GENNY
                        How did you know that? 
                                 FRANK
                        Is it olives instead of onions? Did 
                        I screw it up again?

           Frank pulls out a thick notebook labeled “DATE WITH GENNY.”

                                 GENNY
                        How many times have we done this?

                                 FRANK
                        This is the sixth for me. Well 
                        seventh, but I don’t count the 
                        fourth time.

           Frank pulls out a NAPKIN from his notebook.

                                 FRANK
                        I took this from the third date. 
                             (digging through his 
                              notebook)
                        I think I got a toothpick from the 
                        first one in here... 

                                 GENNY
                        And you don’t think that makes this 
                        whole endeavour a little 
                        disingenuous?

                                 WILBUR (O.C.)
                        Genny?

           Wilbur stands awkwardly by the table. A long moment passes, 
           but Genny refuses to look up.

                                 FRANK
                        Wilbur Hooper! Remember me? I’m 
                        Frank. From the bank.
                             (hearing the rhyme)
                        Oh, that’s good. I should always 
                        introduce myself like that.

           Frank writes this down in his notebook.

                                 WILBUR
                        Is this - a ugh -

                                 GENNY
                        It’s a date.

           Genny finally meets Wilbur’s eye. (If there were any music or 
           ambient noise, it comes to an abrupt halt.)

                                 GENNY
                        But it’s good to see you. 
                                 WILBUR
                        You too.

                                 GENNY
                        I’m happy for you.

                                 WILBUR
                        You are?

                                 GENNY
                        Of course. You’re getting 
                        everything you wanted.

                                 WILBUR
                        I am...

                                 DON
                             (appearing over Wilbur’s 
                              shoulder)
                        Hey Wilbur. Who’s this? 

                                 FRANK
                        Frank. From the bank.

                                 DON
                        And you are?

                                 GENNY
                        Genny.

                                 DON
                        You’re Genny? The Genny who doesn’t 
                        like time travel?

                                 GENNY
                             (not sure what he means)
                        Yes, I’m Genny, but - 

                                 DON
                        Wilbur and Genny. 
                             (beat)
                        So, how exactly do you two know one 
                        another?

           Neither Wilbur or Genny respond. Instead, they search each 
           other, hoping to find something.

                                 FRANK
                        They were almost married, but it 
                        didn’t work out. Good thing, right? 

                                 DON
                        When was this?
                                 WILBUR
                        Genny left me right before you 
                        knocked on the shed. 

           This is obviously HUGE news for Don. Genny comes into 
           context, she shaped the whole trajectory of his life.

                                 DON
                        ... Lucky for me.

                                 FRANK
                        Me too!

                                 WAITER
                             (dropping the drinks)
                        Old fashioned. Martini with 
                        cocktail onions. 

           Hating every moment of this, Genny hurriedly grabs her drink. 

                                 GENNY
                             (to the Waiter)
                        Thank you. 
                             (raising her glass)
                        It’s nice to see you, Wilbur.

           Frank grabs his old fashioned, but SHOCKS himself when he 
           touches the drink. He yelps in surprise. Wilbur’s eyes light 
           up.

                                 WILBUR
                        Can you do that again? 

                                 FRANK
                        It hurt.

                                 DON
                        He didn’t ask if it hurt, friend. 
                        He asked you to do it again.

           Genny’s seen that look in Wilbur’s eye. 

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur, not here. Please. 

                                 WILBUR
                        If you don’t mind, Frank. Rub your 
                        feet on the carpet and then grab  
                        your drink again.

                                 GENNY
                        Frank, you don’t have to - 
                                 FRANK
                        It’s all right. It’s strange, but 
                        I’ll do it. For Wilbur.

           Frank rubs his feet on the carpet. And then grabs his drink. 
           He shocks himself again.

           IN CLOSE UP, SLOW MOTION: Wilbur watches as the ELECTRIC 
           SHOCK travels between his finger and the LIQUID of his drink.

                                 WILBUR
                        That’s it! A completely LIQUID 
                        electrolyte. I have to... go. 
                        Frank, you’re a genius. 

                                 FRANK
                        I am?

                                 GENNY
                        You don’t have to rush - 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m sorry. Good bye. I have to... 

           On his way out, Wilbur grabs the Woman in the white dress. 
           (Not a wine stain to be found.)

                                 WILBUR
                        A LIQUID ELECTROLYTE!

           Genny watches him go, her heart breaking a little bit more.

                                 GENNY
                        Good-bye, Wilbur.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE - HOURS 
           LATER

           Sparks fly from the inside of the Gadabout as Wilbur installs 
           the NEW BATTERY.

           INT. THE GADABOUT

           Wilbur rips off his welder’s mask. He looks down at the Time 
           Wheel.  There are two new rotating dials and flip clocks. One 
           marked DAYS. The other YEARS. 

           Next to it is a gauge labeled - BATTERY POWER. A keen eye 
           might notice it’s full charge is 1.21 gigawatts, but no need 
           to make a thing of it. What we do make a thing of is the HUGE 
           NEW LIGHT BULB labeled LOW BATTERY WARNING. 
           Wilbur taps the light bulb, but the light stays off.

                                 WILBUR
                        Now, where should I go?

           Wilbur looks around his office and spots a BLACK UMBRELLA 
           resting in the corner. He smiles, but then tries to shake off 
           the thought... but it’s too late. Wilbur knows exactly where 
           he’s going.

                                 WILBUR
                             (to himself)
                        You are a damn fool.

           Wilbur flips the YEAR and DAY dials. And then he crosses his 
           fingers, points to the sky and presses the RED BUTTON. The 
           Gadabout SHAKES and HUMS like never before. Wilbur buckles 
           in. 

           A glowing light shines from the battery. The battery gauge 
           rapidly declines. Wilbur holds his breath. Did he make a 
           mistake?

           MORE SHAKING. MORE HUMMING.

                                 WILBUR
                        Come on. Come on.

           VIOLENT SHAKING. DEAFENING HUMMING. The tension builds.

           Wilbur grips into the seat as the Gadabout continues to buck. 
           He squeezes his eyes and grits his teeth. And then - 

           It stops. 

           Wilbur lets out a deep, long sigh. He checks the battery... 
           depleted but stable. Content, he slowly opens the Gadabout 
           door.

           INT. FARM BUILDING - 1953

           The factory is back to being a decrepit farm. 

                                 WILBUR
                        It worked.

           Wilbur does a little Wilbur dance. 

                                 WILBUR (CONT’D)
                             (looking down at the 
                              calendar)
                        Now, let’s make sure she’s 
                        accurate.
           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 1953

           A warm summer day. Wilbur hides himself as he slinks through 
           the town square. He dives behind a PINK CADILLAC just in time 
           to see a 17-year- old WILBUR and GENNY pass by. 

           Like the rest of Hartsville, 17-year-old Genny and Wilbur are 
           sweating under the heat. And then, Young Wilbur pulls out a 
           strange looking UMBRELLA. 17-year-old Genny doesn’t 
           understand... until the umbrella starts to spray a fine mist. 

           Genny smiles and joins Wilbur under the canopy. Smitten, 
           Genny rests her head on Wilbur’s shoulder. And then, as if on 
           cue, the cooling umbrella JOLTS and dumps a GALLON OF WATER 
           on top of the young couple. Soaking wet, Wilbur is mortified. 

           But not Genny. She smiles and laughs with a warmth that’ll 
           last ‘til she’s seventy.  And then under the “rain” of the 
           umbrella, she grabs Wilbur by the sides of his face and 
           kisses him.

           The two smile at each other. A nervous, young Wilbur gathers 
           his courage. He has something important to say. 

                                 YOUNG WILBUR
                        Genny, I love you. No, no it’s more 
                        than that. I... I need you.

                                 YOUNG GENNY
                        I need you too, Wilbur.

           The young couple kisses again. Behind the Cadillac, present 
           Wilbur smiles, maybe a tear falls down his cheek. 

                                 WILBUR
                        It works.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        I found that umbrella! 

           INT. VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT

           Plates of spaghetti sit in front of Henry and Grandpa Wilbur.

                                 HENRY
                        It was in your shed. Wait, does 
                        that mean this story is really... 
                        real?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Of course it’s real. 
                                 HENRY
                        You really had a time machine? 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        I did.

           Henry puts down his fork.

           He studies his Grandfather. Is he telling the truth?

                                 HENRY
                        You have an excellent poker face.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Too bad I can’t play. Inventing’s 
                        all I’ve ever had a knack for. 

                                 HENRY
                        And writing.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        That’s just inventing stories. 

           Grandpa Wilbur winks at Henry.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Now, after I tried it out, I took 
                        the Gadabout back to the present. 

           INT. GADABOUT - 1958

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        Well, 1958.

           Returned from his trip, Wilbur checks the battery gauge and 
           then taps the LOW BATTERY LIGHT... it stays dormant. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Stable.

           He opens the door to the Gadabout. But as he exits - 

           CLOSE ON: The Low battery light FLASHES an OMINOUS RED.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur rushes to his office phone.
           INT. DON’S HOME 

           RING!  Don answers. In the b.g. the woman in the WHITE DRESS 
           from Vito’s is in a negligee. 

                                 DON
                        Hello.

                                 WILBUR
                        IT WORKS!

           We cut back and forth as necessary.

                                 DON
                        What works?

                                 WILBUR
                        I went back five years!

                                 DON
                        FIVE YEARS!?!?

                                 WILBUR
                        But I think that’s just the 
                        beginning.

           In the b.g. of Wilbur’s office, the GADABOUT’S LOW BATTERY 
           LIGHT flashes rapidly. 

                                 WILBUR
                        If my calculations are correct, we 
                        can go further.

                                 DON
                        How far back are we talking?

                                 WILBUR
                        Far Back. Really Far Back. Maybe 
                        hundreds of years. 

                                 DON
                        What about the future?

                                 WILBUR
                        I told you. The future’s not 
                        possible. See the lithium liquid 
                        electrolyte allows the electrodes 
                        to - 

                                 DON
                        Science is boring, Wilbur. But I’d 
                        kiss you if I were there. I’d kiss 
                        you!
           The WOMAN in the b.g. frowns. 

                                 DON
                        I’ll have a press event set for the 
                        morning! Goodbye Hartsville. Hello 
                        America! FINALLY!!!

           Don hangs up the phone. 

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur collapses at his desk. Exhausted and triumphant.

           But behind him, inside the Gadabout, the low battery light 
           flashes faster and faster. 

           Until - KABOOM! An energy field explodes from the time 
           machine! Wilbur’s flung from his chair. 

           From behind his desk, he turns to the Gadabout - the inside 
           of the machine glows a VIOLENT BRIGHT WHITE. And then the 
           light SHINES THROUGH THE GADABOUT. And begins to circle 
           around the machine... and form a BLACK HOLE OF WHITE LIGHT.

           Then, like an enormous magnet, everything in the room points 
           toward the Gadabout created BLACK HOLE.

           BOOM! The glass on Wilbur’s FRAMED POSTER OF HARTSVILLE is 
           shattered, and then the whole thing is yanked toward the 
           energy field, but when it meets the center of the light... 
           the map of Hartsville DISAPPEARS INTO OBLIVION. That can’t be 
           a good sign.

           Suddenly, everything in the room is being sucked toward the 
           Gadabout created hole. All Wilbur’s plans. His coffee cups. 
           His desk.

                                 WILBUR
                        WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

           Then Wilbur finally sees it. THE FLASHING LOW BATTERY LIGHT 
           pierces through the white light.

                                 WILBUR
                        I pushed it too far...

           Wilbur looks around, and he spots the OLD, ORIGINAL Gadabout 
           battery lying on the floor.  Wilbur runs to it as everything 
           in his office swirls toward the black hole. Wilbur leaps on 
           the old battery just before it’s pulled into oblivion.  And 
           then, HE FIGHTS HIS WAY TOWARD THE GADABOUT. 

           He has to replace the battery. 
           Wilbur fights through the energy field and CLIMBS INSIDE THE 
           GADABOUT. Inside, the engine is glowing a brilliant WHITE 
           LIGHT... The engine is the source of the black hole.

           At this proximity, gravity’s practically disappeared. Wilbur 
           floats in the air as he holds tight to the console. Trying to 
           avoid being sucked inside the black hole.

           Holding on for his life, Wilbur rips the battery from the 
           Gadabout. The whole room shakes LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE. Wilbur 
           thrusts the old battery into the Gadabout console. He hooks 
           it up to the engine. And the moment the wires meet - 

           EVERYTHING STOPS. The Gadabout returns to normal. 

           Breathing heavy and covered in sweat, Wilbur climbs out of 
           the machine. 

           HIS OFFICE IS A MESS.  Wilbur takes in the damage - Half his 
           things are missing, the other half destroyed. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Now... What just happened?

           Wilbur dusts himself off, grabs his CHALK and heads for the 
           blackboard.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE - MORNING

           The rising sun glints through the windows. Wilbur’s office is 
           covered in mathematical equations. Every surface has some 
           number or figure scrawled on it. 

           He’s even turned an OLD MODEL TRAIN of Hartsville’s first 
           Locomotive into a writing surface. And at the top of the 
           black board in HUGE BOLD PRINT and circled for emphasis is -

           DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE

           INSERT: A flash of the BRIGHT RED Dimensional collapse page 
           from the manual.

                                 WILBUR
                        This is bad.

           Suddenly, Wilbur hears a commotion from outside.

                                 DON (O.C.)
                        Thank you all for coming.

                                 WILBUR
                        Oh no. No! NO! NOO!!!!
           Wilbur sprints through the factory, but when he opens the 
           main door -

           EXT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES

           Don stands in front of a PRESS CORP. 

                                 DON
                        Cudworth-Hooper Industries is proud 
                        to announce the NATIONAL RELEASE of 
                        the Gadabout TM 1050!

           The crowd goes NUTS. Don turns and sees a disheveled Wilbur.

                                 DON
                        And here he is. The man himself, 
                        Wilbur Hooper. The inventor of the 
                        time machine!

           The cameras turn to Wilbur.

                                 DON
                             (whispered)
                        You couldn’t have at least 
                        showered?

                                 WILBUR
                             (whispered)
                        We need to talk.

           FLASH! A bulb explodes. 

           CAMERA POV: A black and white photo of Wilbur (the same one 
           from the back of the manual.)

                                 DON
                        One week from today, the Gadabout 
                        will be available nationwide. And 
                        we’re going to have a gala right 
                        here in Hartsville to celebrate!

           More applause.

                                 DON
                        Now, Wilbur, would you like to make 
                        the next announcement?

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m afraid it’s not quite ready for-

                                 DON
                        The Gadabout can now safely travel 
                        back CENTURIES!
           The cameras stop flashing. Did they hear that right?

                                 DON
                        That’s right. Time travel is now in 
                        YEARS! 

           The cameras go nuts. Wilbur’s blinded by the light. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Don, we need to talk. NOW. 

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - DON’S OFFICE

           The Gadabout’s luxuries are put to shame by Don’s posh 
           office. Over Don’s desk is a LARGE FRAMED POSTER OF A 
           SPRAWLING METROPOLIS.

           FOUR SECURITY GUARDS stand by the door.

                                 DON
                        Is there some sort of problem?

                                 WILBUR
                        The battery is not as stable as I 
                        thought. We have to go back to two 
                        hours.

                                 DON
                        WE CAN’T DO THAT! Are you trying to 
                        make a fool of me Wilbur?

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s not safe.

           Wilbur turns and smacks into one of the SECURITY GUARDS.

                                 WILBUR
                             (re: security)
                        What’s this about?

                                 DON
                        You grow. You need muscle. Who 
                        knows when the folks out there 
                        might try to unionize? 

           Wilbur studies Don, not quite sure what he means. But Don 
           ignores him and picks up the manual. It’s noticeably thicker.

                                 DON
                        Now listen Wilbur, if the battery 
                        is a little unsafe then all we have 
                        to do is put a warning in the 
                        manual.
                                 WILBUR
                        It’s not a little unsafe. We’re 
                        talking about DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE.

                                 DON
                        What is that?

                                 WILBUR
                        The end of time and space. Every 
                        time line collapsing in on itself 
                        until there’s nothing left. 
                        Anywhere. Any when.

                                 DON
                        So, we write a disclaimer. Beware 
                        of dimensional collapse. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen Wilbur, we gotta keep moving 
                        forward or we’re finished. I’ve 
                        seen it a thousand times, you start 
                        worrying about the tracks and the 
                        train’ll run you over.
                             (throwing an arm around 
                              Wilbur)
                        You can do this. Sometimes I think 
                        I believe in you more than you 
                        believe in yourself.

           Don’s charm once again pollutes Wilbur’s mind.

                                 WILBUR
                        I guess I can... Maybe try to. I 
                        just need more time. 

                                 DON
                        You have a time machine. You have 
                        all the time in the world. And 
                        never forget. You’re not alone 
                        anymore. We’re in this together.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        So, Don focused on the national 
                        release. While I worked on the 
                        battery. 

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

           Don weaves through the thundering machinery.
           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur circles a date in his CHECKERBOARD CALENDER - THE 
           NATIONAL RELEASE. He counts back a week and crosses out the 
           first day.

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        But if you knew it was dangerous? 
                        Why did you agree to work on it?

           INT. VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - 2016

           Empty plates sit in front of Henry and Grandpa Wilbur.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Because I was scared. Because, you 
                        see Henry, you never met your great- 
                        grandfather. He died when I wasn’t 
                        much older than you, but he was a 
                        cruel man. He didn’t get what he 
                        wanted out of life, so he was 
                        determined to make sure I didn’t 
                        either. But I thought if I proved 
                        him wrong I’d, I don’t know, get 
                        his love beyond the grave I guess. 
                        Which sounds silly now as an old 
                        man saying it.

           Henry looks up at his grandfather, still not getting it. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        The only way I can put it is that 
                        sometimes we chase the love we’re 
                        after so hard that we ignore the 
                        love we have. 

           VITO, who’s gotta be ninety, approaches the table. 

                                 VITO OF VITO’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT
                        I just wanted to let you two know 
                        how sorry I am. Genny was the 
                        finest person I ever knew. And, 
                        well, she might be in a better 
                        place, but Hartsville is certainly 
                        a worse place without her. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Thank you, Vito. 

           Vito nods and clears the plates. Henry smiles at his Grandpa. 
                                 HENRY
                        So, how did you... how did you get 
                        back with Grandma?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Well, those time travel kinks we 
                        were trying to work out?

           INT. SUZY’S APARTMENT

           Genny walks into the apartment with a bag of GROCERIES.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        They started to reveal themselves.

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy!?!

           The groceries crash to the floor.  Genny panics and runs to 
           the phone. 

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur works on the battery. 2 days have been crossed off his 
           CHECKERBOARD CALENDER.

           RING!

                                 WILBUR
                             (answering the phone)
                        I’m getting closer, Don.

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur?!

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny?! What’s wrong?

                                 GENNY
                        I didn’t know who else to call. 
                        It’s Suzy. She’s... everywhere.

           INT. SUZY’S APARTMENT

           Wilbur and Genny stand together. The front door opens behind 
           them, Suzy enters in a PINK DRESS - 

                                 SUZY (PINK DRESS)
                        Back to the flower dress. He HATES 
                        pink!
           And we see why Genny called: The apartment is FULL OF SUZYS. 
           There have to be at least twenty five Suzys. Some Suzys wear 
           different dresses, others have different hairstyles, and a 
           few have applied different color lipsticks. But all of the 
           Suzys are arguing about how to salvage their date. It seems 
           no matter what they try, the date just doesn’t like them.  

                                 SUZY (OVERLY HEAVY MAKE-UP)
                        Your laugh is all wrong. It’s too 
                        desperate. 

                                 SUZY (NO MAKE-UP)
                        Like this?

           Suzy (NO MAKE-UP) tries a subtler laugh. 

                                 GENNY
                        What do we do, Wilbur? More of them 
                        just keep coming. 

                                 SUZY (CONSERVATIVE DRESS)
                        Maybe you just need to loosen up.

           A VERY DRUNK Suzy enters the apartment. 

                                 SUZY (DRUNK/ FLOWER DRESS)
                        One Martini. We stick to one 
                        Martini!

                                 WILBUR
                        We have to find the original Suzy.

                                 GENNY
                        Why?

                                 WILBUR
                        All of the Suzy’s are coming back 
                        to this moment in time. So, we have 
                        to convince the original Suzy to 
                        never go back in time after her 
                        date before she even goes on it. 

                                 GENNY
                        Why?

                                 WILBUR
                        Well, if the original Suzy 
                        continues moving forward in her own 
                        timeline, that should stop the loop 
                        before it even begins. All the 
                        subsequent Suzy’s would then 
                        disappear because they would never 
                        travel back in time in the first 
                        place.
           While Don is always befuddled by this “Wilbur speak”, Genny 
           is enchanted it.

                                 GENNY
                             (teasing him)
                        Well, that makes sense I guess.

           They share a smile.

                                 GENNY
                        But how do we stop her from going 
                        back? She won’t listen to me.

                                 WILBUR
                        We have to try.

                                 SUZY (BEEHIVE HAIRDO)
                        What if we get to know him better? 

           Another very disheveled Suzy enters.  

                                 SUZY (VERY DISHEVELED)
                        Don’t ask about his mother. Just 
                        DON’T DO IT!

                                 GENNY
                        Come on.

           Genny grabs Wilbur’s hand and plunges into the gaggle of 
           Suzys. They weave through the chaos. Wilbur smiles as he 
           looks down at he and Genny’s entwined hands

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy, I need you to listen to me. 

                                 SUZY (RED LIPSTICK)
                        I don’t need your advice, Genny.

                                 WILBUR
                        Which one of you is the original?

           The Suzys continue to talk amongst themselves.

                                 SUZY (BLACK LIPSTICK)
                        He asked what made me happy. I said 
                        long walks.

                                 SUZY (NO LIPSTICK)
                        I said bubble baths. 

                                 SUZY (EYE GLASSES)
                        I said a well cooked meal.
                                 ALL THREE SUZYS
                        But he didn’t like any of those.

                                 GENNY
                        Are any of you the original Suzy?

                                 ALL THREE SUZYS
                        We’re busy Genny.

                                 SUZY (RED LIPSTICK)
                             (to the Suzys)
                        So, how do we answer?

                                 GENNY
                             (to Wilbur)
                        This isn’t working.

           Another Suzy enters the apartment. She gags and covers her 
           mouth.

                                 SUZY (TURNING GREEN)
                        Don’t let him order the fish!

                                 WILBUR
                        We have to keep trying!

                                 GENNY
                             (grabbing a Suzy)
                        How many times have you been on the 
                        date?

                                 SUZY (HOOP EARRINGS)
                             (pulling away)
                        I don’t have time for this Genny.

           Suzy (HOOP EARRINGS) turns back to a small group of Suzys.

                                 SUZY (ORIGINAL)
                        I don’t understand. What’s funny 
                        about barometers?

                                 SUZY (VERY HIGH HEELS)
                        You don’t have to understand -

                                 ALL SUZYS
                        You just have to laugh. 

           All the Suzys turn to SUZY (ORIGINAL), who’s in the center of 
           the Suzy nucleus, and practice their laugh.  She tries to 
           replicate all twenty-five laughs, simultaneously.

                                 GENNY
                        I think that’s her!
                                 WILBUR
                        Where?

                                 GENNY
                        In the center! Come on!

           Another Suzy enters. 

                                 SUZY (STRAIGHT HAIR)
                        Have we tried curling our hair?

                                 SUZY (VERY CURLY HAIR)
                        We have!

           Genny and Wilbur fight through the crowd, the contradicting 
           advice is deafening. Suddenly, a Suzy reaches out to Wilbur.

                                 SUZY (MASCARA STAINED TEARS)
                        Wilbur, you’re a man. Maybe you 
                        have some insight. 

           Suzy (MASCARA STAINED TEARS) pulls Wilbur into a tiny Suzy 
           circle. He’s a goner.

                                 WILBUR
                        Keep going, Genny!

           Genny finally reaches the inner Suzy circle. 

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy!

                 SUZY (WINE STAINED DRESS)
           Tell him about yourself.
                                                  SUZY (HUGE EARRINGS)
                                              But don’t give any opinions.

                  SUZY (FORMAL NIGHT GOWN)
                                                     SUZY (PAJAMAS)
           Be confident.
                                              But let him lead. 

                   SUZY (LOW CUT DRESS)
                                               SUZY (HIGH NECK LINE DRESS)
           Kiss him good night.
                                              But only if he initiates.

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy! You have to stop going back.

                                 SUZY (ORIGINAL)
                        Stop being such a square. 

           Suzy turns back to the other Suzys.

                                 SUZY (ORIGINAL)
                        So, he doesn’t like the - 

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy, THIS IS MADNESS!
                                 SUZY (ORIGINAL)
                        This is dating.

                                 GENNY
                        Look around, it shouldn’t take this 
                        many tries to have one date go 
                        right. 

           Suzy turns back to Genny.

                                 GENNY
                        You need to find someone who 
                        appreciates you for you. And that 
                        starts with you.

                                 SUZY
                        It does?

                                 GENNY
                        Suzy, you can’t find love til you 
                        love yourself. 

                                 SUZY
                        I do?

                                 GENNY
                        Who you are is enough. And if a 
                        date doesn’t see the first time, 
                        then there’s no reason to do it 
                        again.

                                 SUZY
                        ... You’re right.

                                 GENNY
                        So, STOP GOING BACK!

           One Suzy disappears. 

                                 GENNY
                        SUZY! Promise me, you’ll go on the 
                        date one time. 

                                 SUZY
                        All right. All right. I promise.

           POOF! POOF! POOF! One by one all of the Suzy’s slowly 
           disintegrate. The chaos ends. Just one Suzy, Wilbur and Genny 
           remain in the apartment.

           Suzy throws her arms around Genny.

                                 SUZY
                        Thank you. I guess I needed that.
           Suzy steps away from the embrace.

                                 SUZY
                        Now, excuse me. I need to be alone.

           Suzy walks back into her bedroom. Genny smiles.

           EXT. OUTSIDE SUZY’S APARTMENT 

           Next to Suzy’s apartment, a young couple paints their house 
           BLUE. He stands on a ladder, while she looks at paint 
           swatches... Unsure of their choice. As the young woman frets, 
           Genny walks Wilbur out.

                                 GENNY
                        Well, thank you for -

                                 WILBUR
                        You’re welcome.

           Genny and Wilbur share an awkward moment. But the nice kind.

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s always nice to... see you.

                                 GENNY
                        Yes, if Suzy does it again. I’ll 
                        call you.

           Wilbur and Genny let something pass between them. Something 
           that never quite left. (Behind them, the house is now being 
           painted RED.)

                                 GENNY
                        Wait. How do we know Suzy’s not 
                        going to do it again?

                                 WILBUR
                        All these kinds of warnings are 
                        spelled out in the manual. 

                                 GENNY
                        That doesn’t mean it’s safe. 
                        Imagine if we couldn’t have stopped 
                        her? There might be hundreds of 
                        Suzys.

                                 WILBUR
                        Well, then all hundred Suzys should 
                        read the manual.
                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur, you can’t honestly tell me 
                        the Gadabout isn’t dangerous.

           Genny points to the new world around them. (The house is now 
           GREEN.)

                                 GENNY
                        Just look what it’s doing to 
                        people. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’ve seen what it’s doing. It’s 
                        giving everybody a better life.

                                 GENNY
                        At the cost of ruining the lives 
                        they had. That’s not better, 
                        Wilbur. And if you don’t see that, 
                        you’re a fool. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not a fool. 

           Genny stops. Fool is a trigger world for Wilbur.

                                 GENNY
                        I didn’t mean... a fool. I meant - 

                                 WILBUR
                        No. I heard what you said. I’ve 
                        always heard you. You’ve never 
                        believed in me, Genny. Not really 
                        at least. Not in anyway that 
                        counts.

           Genny isn’t quite sure what to say. (And the house is now 
           Yellow)

                                 WILBUR
                        The Gadabout is moving forward. And 
                        if you keep worrying about the 
                        tracks, you’re going to get run 
                        over. So, get on board. Or get out 
                        of the way.

           Tears well in Genny’s eyes.

                                 GENNY
                        All right. If that’s really what 
                        you think. 

           She turns back to the house. But then:
                                 GENNY
                        I know I made this choice for us, 
                        Wilbur. I just wasn’t expecting it 
                        to hurt so much. And for you to be 
                        so OK with it. Cause looking at you 
                        Wilbur... it’s still hard for me.

           Genny storms into the house. Wilbur runs his hands through 
           his hair... what’s he doing? 

           (And the house behind them is back to the original BLUE.)

           INT. SUZY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           When Genny enters, she hears THREE SUZYS have already 
           collected in the bedroom.

                                 SUZY (ONE)
                        I don’t get the joke.

                                 SUZY (TWO) (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to.

                                 SUZY (THREE) (CONT’D)
                        Just laugh.

           Suzy laughs.

                    SUZY (TWO) (CONT’D)
                                                  SUZY (THREE) (CONT’D)
           But not like that.
                                              But not like that.

           Frustrated, Genny grabs her purse and heads for the door.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - HOURS LATER

           Genny, confused and sad, walks through the town square. All 
           around her, Gadabouts are landing. People are walking in 
           groups... with versions of themselves. Genny tries her best 
           to ignore it.

           She passes by Leroy’s appliance store, which is boarded up 
           and abandoned. 

           A HOUSEWIFE hurries by Genny with her baby and small son. The 
           young boy looks inside a TOY SHOP window and points to a RED 
           PLANE. He starts to cry for it, but before he even gets a 
           chance ANOTHER HOUSEWIFE appears and hands her son the plane. 

           But with the toy so easily in his hands, the boy no longer 
           cares for it. He casually tosses it into the street, and a 
           car SMASHES it to bits. Then, the boy points at the store 
           window and cries for ANOTHER TOY.
                                 GENNY
                        This isn’t right.

           Genny stares up at the Cudworth-Hooper industries factory on 
           the hill. It blows THICK BLACK SMOKE into the sky. 

                                 GENNY
                        It’s not right.

           Determined to do something, or at least try, Genny walks over 
           the Hartsville bridge and marches toward the factory.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

           Since we last saw it, the factory has tripled its output and 
           workforce.  Everything is working in perfect precision until - 
           Two SECURITY GUARDS appear behind Leroy.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 1
                        Mr. Cudworth would like to have a 
                        word.

                                 LEROY
                        With me?

                                 SECURITY GUARD 2
                        Now.

           The security guards lift Leroy up by his elbows.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - DON’S OFFICE

           The security guards plop Leroy down in a chair in front of 
           Don’s ostentatious desk. Leroy turns to see TWELVE guards at 
           the door... but if you look closely. It’s the same four men 
           repeated three times.

                                 DON
                        Leroy, do you enjoy working here at 
                        Cudworth-Hooper Industries?

                                 LEROY
                        Of course, I do.

                                 DON
                        Glad to hear it, friend. Then you 
                        understand we here at Cudworth 
                        demand a little extra from our 
                        employees.
                                 LEROY
                        Yes. The overtime with the national 
                        release? I’ve been puttin’ in my 12 
                        hours everyday.

                                 DON
                        I know you have. But we expect you 
                        to put in a Gadabout workday.

                                 LEROY
                        What’s a Gadabout workday?

                                 DON
                        Well, when you finish that 12 hour 
                        shift. What’s to stop you from 
                        going back and working it again? 
                        And again?

                                 LEROY
                        But that doesn’t leave anytime for - 

                                 DON
                        You own a time machine. You got all 
                        the time in the world. 

           Suddenly, Don looks through his window. And sees Genny enter 
           the factory.  She’s frantic and calling out for Wilbur. Worry 
           fills Don’s face.

                                 LEROY
                        But that means I won’t be able to -

                                 DON
                        I’m afraid it’s not up for debate, 
                        friend. You either put in a 
                        Gadabout workday... or no work day 
                        at all. Now excuse me. 

           Don stands up from his desk as the security guards escort 
           Leroy back to the assembly line. 

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur?!? Wilbur, where are you?

                                 DON
                        I’m afraid he’s a little busy at 
                        the moment. How can I help you?

           Genny sees Don’s smiling face, but she doesn’t budge.
                                 GENNY
                        Where is he?

                                 DON
                        Let me take you to his office. 

           Don walks Genny through the factory. As he does, he passes 
           Leroy working on the line. There are now three of him. 

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        That’s a good man, Leroy.

           All three Leroys sadly smile back at their boss.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - JUST OUTSIDE WILBUR’S 
           OFFICE

           Don and Genny peer into Wilbur’s office. 

                                 DON
                        As I said, he’s a busy man.

                                 GENNY
                        I’ll wait.

                                 DON
                        Do you mind my asking what this is 
                        all about?

                                 GENNY
                        It’s between Wilbur and I.

                                 DON
                        Understood. If I believe in 
                        anything, it’s the power of a 
                        private conversation.

           Don watches the way Genny looks at the Gadabout assembly.

                                 DON
                        I take it you don’t care much for 
                        the Gadabout.

                                 GENNY
                        I don’t. No. 

                                 DON
                        I hope I’m not prodding, but why is 
                        that?
                                 GENNY
                        Well... I don’t think you and 
                        Wilbur understand exactly what 
                        you’ve created.

                                 DON
                        I certainly agree with you there.

                                 GENNY
                        You do?

                                 DON
                        Of course. No man creates something 
                        of this magnitude and fully 
                        understands what it’s capable of. 

                                 GENNY
                        And that doesn’t scare you?

                                 DON
                        Terrifies me. I think if a man 
                        isn’t a little scared of the 
                        choices he makes, he hasn’t really 
                        thought through what he’s chosen. 

                                 GENNY
                        But you don’t think time travel is 
                        dangerous? 

                                 DON
                        Of course it is.
                             (beat)
                        But did you know that before the 
                        train was introduced people thought 
                        that if the human body went over 
                        thirty miles an hour that it would 
                        explode... on the spot. Boom!

           Genny laughs, despite herself.

                                 DON
                        Sounds silly now doesn’t it?

                                 GENNY
                        This is hardly a train. We’re 
                        talking about time travel. 

                                 DON
                        And we’re taking precautions. See 
                        this -

           Don removes a SMALL METAL DEVICE from his pocket. It sort of 
           looks like a chrome ever-lasting gobstopper.
                                 DON
                        Something I came up with. An 
                        emergency beacon. Tracks every 
                        Gadabout. I’ll know when and where 
                        every single one of these machines 
                        is at all times.

                                 GENNY
                        Isn’t that a little invasive?

                                 DON
                        People are always happy to trade 
                        privacy for safety. Besides, I 
                        gotta keep a close eye on 1958. 
                        Can’t have anybody going and taking 
                        credit for inventing Wilbur’s time 
                        machine. Now, let’s be honest with 
                        each other. What is it about the 
                        Gadabout that really scares you?

                                 GENNY
                        I guess having all that time. 
                        Doesn’t it make time... 
                        meaningless? And when we don’t 
                        value time. What do we value?

                                 DON
                        Each other I hope.

           Don walks over to Wilbur’s office. He peers inside, which 
           encourages Genny to do the same. Inside, Wilbur slaves away 
           on the battery. Oblivious to everything else in the world.

                                 DON
                        You want to know what I truly love 
                        about the Gadabout?

           Genny turns to Don.

                                 DON
                        It means a world without past 
                        mistakes. Anything in our lives 
                        that we regret, that has ruined us 
                        in some way. We can make it like it 
                        never happened. 

           Don lets that linger. 

                                 DON
                        For me, that means, well... when I 
                        was a young man, I fell in love. 
                        High school sweethearts, I guess 
                        you could call us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        And Betsy was the type of girl who 
                        had our whole lives mapped out for 
                        us. But I wasn’t a success as fast 
                        she’d planned, and she got 
                        restless. Not even married yet, and 
                        I could already feel her pulling 
                        away from me. So, to prove myself, 
                        I took to the road, started selling 
                        vacuums. Made a little money. And 
                        when I got back, Betsy got 
                        everything she wanted... with 
                        somebody else. While I was gone, 
                        she’d married the mayor’s son. 
                        Broke my heart. Shattered me, 
                        really.
                             (beat)
                        You know, I can still close my eyes 
                        and remember the way Betsy 
                        smelled... I hate it.  Which is why 
                        I love the Gadabout.  That machine 
                        is the possibility of a world with 
                        no ugly pasts. Hell, maybe in a 
                        Gadabout world there is no such 
                        thing as sorrow. Or sadness. Or 
                        heartbreak.

           Don lets that sit for a while as Genny looks in at Wilbur. 
           Genny needs a world without heartbreak. (Something Don knew 
           when he started his speech.) Tears stream down Genny’s face. 
           Don offers her his HANDKERCHIEF.

                                 DON
                        Have you had dinner, Genny? I’m 
                        committed to getting out in front 
                        of these time travel issues and, 
                        well, I’d love to hear more about 
                        what you have to say. 

           Genny looks back at Wilbur. And then to Don... and his 
           genuine smile.  

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur’s hair is on end. He works away at the battery... but 
           he doesn’t seem to be getting any closer. Leroy stands in the 
           corner of his office with a clipboard.

                                 WILBUR
                        What haven’t we tried?

           Leroy looks at his notes.
                                 LEROY
                        I’ll be honest, Wilbur. I don’t 
                        understand a word of what I’ve been 
                        writing. 

           Frustrated, Wilbur crosses another DAY off the CHECKERBOARD 
           CALENDER.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE BRIDGE

           Don and Genny share an ice cream cone as they walk over the 
           bridge. Genny talks and, for the first time in a long time, 
           feels heard. It shines all over her face.

           EXT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

           The assembly line continues to pump out Gadabout after 
           Gadabout... Don’s added even more bells and whistles to the 
           console. 

           We see workers put in the EMERGENCY BEACON, but suddenly ONE 
           BEACON clangs to the floor. The assembly lines stops. 
           Everyone turns to the fallen beacon. Don slowly picks it up 
           from the floor. 

                                 DON
                        You scuffed my beacon, Ms. Kulhman.

           Four Ms. Khulman’s cower into themselves.

                                 MS. KUHLMAN
                        I’m... I’m sorry, Mr. Cudworth.

                                 DON
                        You know the rules. Two more of you 
                        in here tomorrow at half the pay

                                 MS. KUHLMANS
                             (in  unison)
                        Yes, Mr. Cudworth.

                                 DON
                        Good. NOW BACK TO WORK!

           The assembly line springs back to life.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           TWO MORE DAYS HAVE BEEN CROSSED OFF THE CHECKERBOARD 
           CALENDER.
           Wilbur, his face covered with days of scruff, studies jars of 
           possible LIQUID ELECTROLYTES. He looks at his reflection in 
           the window - Even shed Wilbur was never this bad. 

           Leroy stands in the corner, a little nervous about the man 
           Wilbur’s becoming. Then, Leroy notices the reflections of the 
           jars. The refracted light has created a LARGER DUPLICATE of 
           each jar. 

                                 LEROY
                        Geez, wouldn’t it be nice if we 
                        could just make it bigger?

                                 WILBUR
                        Of course, but that would... wait, 
                        why can’t we do that?

           Wilbur studies the calculations on his blackboard.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - DON’S OFFICE

           Genny writes out an impossibly long list of potential time 
           travel disasters. Don can’t help but smile at Genny’s 
           enthusiasm.

           EXT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - WILBUR’S OFFICE

           Wilbur looks down at the CHECKERBOARD CALENDER...

           TODAY’S THE DAY: THE NATIONAL RELEASE GALA.

           And then over at a completed battery on his desk... it’s 
           DOUBLE the size. 

                                 LEROY
                        We did it, Wilbur.

                                 WILBUR
                        Thank you for your help, Leroy.

                                 DON (O.C.)
                        Oh god, Wilbur!

           Don stands in the doorway, wearing a TUX. 

                                 DON
                        You LOOK AWFUL.

                                 WILBUR
                        I fixed it. 
                                 DON
                        Of course you did! What’s the 
                        Wilbur science this time?

                                 WILBUR
                        No science. 
                             (gesturing to the new 
                              battery)
                        Just double the size.

           Don laughs.

                                 WILBUR
                        Sometimes you’re so busy looking 
                        for the smart solution that you 
                        miss the simple one.

                                 DON
                        We’ll get the batteries into 
                        production tonight. Speaking of, 
                        Leroy I think you’re needed back on 
                        the line.

                                 LEROY
                        Yes, Mr. Cudworth.

           Leroy hangs his head and heads out of the office.

                                 WILBUR
                        What about the gala?

                                 DON
                        That’s for us. Not the workers.

                                 WILBUR
                        But Don, it’s still not... Not 
                        completely safe. If the dimensional 
                        collapse were to occur.

                                 DON
                        And how likely is that?

                                 WILBUR
                        With the new battery, you’d have to 
                        push the Gadabout to the... limit. 

                                 DON
                        To the future? 

                                 WILBUR
                        NO! I mean, we probably have the 
                        power now, but the future is 
                        hypothetical. What you’d see is...
                                 DON
                        All right. All right. I understand, 
                        Wilbur. We’ve taken precautions. 
                        The emergency beacon and everything 
                        else. It’s all going to work out. 
                        You did good, friend. Now come on, 
                        I got something to show you.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

           Don opens the door to one of the Gadabouts. He presses a 
           button on the console and out pops: a CONTAINER filled with 
           SALT.  Wilbur is a bit confused.

                                 DON
                        For your margaritas. Thought we 
                        could make ‘em a thing. 

           Wilbur smiles. The gesture isn’t lost on him.

           But then he steps back and looks at the rows of time 
           machines, worry suddenly fills Wilbur’s face.

                                 WILBUR
                        We’re doing the right thing... 
                        right, Don?

                                 DON
                        We’re shaping the future. Can’t see 
                        how that can be anything but right. 
                        Now, come on. Let’s get you 
                        dressed.

           INT. THE GADABOUT GALA

           A party the likes Hartsville has never seen. Don’s theme is a 
           celebration through time. So, it’s as if Jay Gatsby, the 
           former Roman slave Trimalchio, and the Duchess of Richmond 
           came together to throw their most elaborate affair... all 
           filtered through a 50’s lens. It’s a trip.

           Wilbur strolls through the party. A little drunk and 
           therefore trying to enjoy himself but... something just 
           doesn’t seem right. He wipes away falling confetti from his 
           eyes when the crowd seems to part... and there stands Genny.

           She seems right. More beautiful than Wilbur’s ever seen her. 
           He weaves through the crowd until in an instant - Wilbur’s 
           beside her.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny, what are you doing here?
                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur. It’s good to see you. 
                        Really this time.

           Genny throws her arms around Wilbur. He forgot how nice that 
           felt. But then, he steps back. It might just be that she’s 
           had a little to drink, but something about Genny has changed.

                                 WILBUR
                        Really, I don’t understand. Why are 
                        you here?

                                 GENNY
                        Everyone in Hartsville is here.

                                 WILBUR
                        But you hate the Gadabout. 

                                 GENNY
                        I don’t hate the Gadabout. I didn’t 
                        trust the Gadabout. But I’m... 
                        growing. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Did you try it? Is that what 
                        changed your mind?

                                 GENNY
                        Not exactly.  

           Suddenly, Don appears beside Genny. 

                                 DON
                        What are you two talking about?

                                 WILBUR
                        We’re just - 

           Then, as if in slow motion, Wilbur watches as Don wraps his 
           arm around Genny’s waist. Genny tries to shoo away his hand, 
           but it’s too late. Wilbur stands there shocked... not quite 
           sure what he’s just seen.

                                 WILBUR
                        Are... you two...

                                 GENNY
                        No, well... 

                                 DON
                        Maybe. 

           Genny and Don share a smile.
                                 GENNY
                        We haven’t. We wanted to talk to 
                        you first. Before we - 

                                 DON
                        But you’ve just been so busy with 
                        the battery.

           Wilbur isn’t sure if he’s more angry or sad. In all 
           probability, he’s too broken to know.

                                 WILBUR
                        No, it’s... it’s all right. I 
                        just... excuse me.

           And then, everything for Wilbur goes into a bit of a haze.

           INT. THE GADABOUT NATIONAL RELEASE GALA - LATER

           Wilbur sways in front of a line of finished margaritas. He 
           takes a long swig from one, and then stares down into the 
           empty salt-rimmed glass. Beside him, a DRUNK HOUSEWIFE talks 
           with a group of other housewives.

                                 DRUNK HOUSEWIFE
                        That’s right. Charlie’s getting 
                        straight A’s and I’m saving a 
                        fortune on a tutor.

                                 ANOTHER HOUSEWIFE
                        But isn’t Charlie a little... slow?

                                 DRUNK HOUSEWIFE
                        Oh, he’s as slow as they come. But 
                        with the Gadabout, he just takes 
                        the tests as many times as it 
                        takes. 

           And suddenly, everything for Wilbur comes into focus.

                                 WILBUR
                        But that’s not what it’s for.

                                 DRUNK HOUSEWIFE
                        What what’s for?

                                 WILBUR
                        The Gadabout. It’s for making 
                        time... not cheating it.

           The women roll their eyes and turn back to each other.
                                 WILBUR
                        Is everyone using it for - 

           Wilbur looks out into the rest of the party. 

           James Hart stands with his wife. Suddenly, James catches eyes 
           with a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN.  They share a familiar smile. 
           James Hart slips away from his wife. 

           He and the young woman leave out the back of the party. But 
           instantaneously, they walk back in. James Hart adjusting his 
           tie. The woman adjusting her dress. Without her noticing, 
           James Hart rejoins his wife. 

                                 WILBUR
                        This isn’t right. 

           Wilbur, now very drunk, thunders toward James Hart.

                                 WILBUR
                        You’re abusing it!  

                                 JAMES HART
                        Abusing what, Wilbur? 

                                 WILBUR
                        The Gadabout isn’t for... that!

                                 JAMES HART
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 WILBUR
                        EVERYONE IS ABUSING IT!

           Wilbur looks around, in every corner of the party people are 
           misusing time travel.Redoing first impressions. Having two 
           conversations at once. Stealing drinks for their past selves. 
           Tiny fractures that are adding up to something big for 
           Wilbur.

           Wilbur’s about to completely snap, when - The music cuts off. 
           And the lights flicker as Don takes the podium. 

                                 DON
                        Welcome friends! To the Gadabout 
                        NATIONAL RELEASE! 

           Don pulls a lever, and a RED CURTAIN drops from behind him 
           revealing - 

           A NEW AD FOR THE GADABOUT:  Don rests an elbow on the time 
           machine as he smiles for the camera.  A slogan pasted across 
           him: Time Travel... now for Everyone! Everywhere! Every when!
           The crowd erupts into applause. 

                                 DON
                        Tomorrow morning, the Gadabout will 
                        be in every home in America!

           Another lever. Another curtain. Revealing: A huge map of the 
           United States. Every major city is plastered with a photo of 
           the Gadabout. 

                                 DON
                        And Hartsville will be the time 
                        travel capital of the world!

           In the middle of the country is a GIANT GADABOUT with 
           HARTSVILLE written across it. Balloons fall from the ceiling. 

                                 DON
                        Now, let’s CELEBRATE!

           A group of chorus girls dressed as all sorts of famous cities 
           and time periods tap onto the stage. They sing the newest 
           jingle (new words, but the same tune.) 

                                 JINGLE SINGERS
                        Time travel now from beginning to 
                        end. Make a mistake? Just go back 
                        and mend!

           James Hart hoots and hollers. The crowd is uncontrollable. 
           The chorus girls just keep repeating the jingle. 

                                 WILBUR
                        What have I done?

           Wilbur rushes to the stage. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Don, this is all wrong!

                                 DON
                        Wilbur, are you --- are you all 
                        right friend?

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s all wrong! WRONG!!

           Don climbs down from the podium. 

                                 WILBUR
                        It’s a mistake! 

                                 DON
                        What’s a mistake?
           Wilbur’s practically manic. Genny appears behind him. 

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur?

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny, you were right. You were 
                        always right. 

                                 DON
                        Wilbur! Hold on a minute. We’re in 
                        this together, remember?

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m not sure we are! 

           Wilbur storms out of the party. 

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur, wait!

           But he’s already gone. Genny wants to run after him, but Don 
           wraps his arms around her. 

                                 DON
                        He’s all right.

                                 GENNY
                        I just hope he doesn’t do anything 
                        stupid.

                                 DON
                        Me too...

           But the look on Don’s face let’s us know one thing: he’s not 
           going let Wilbur do anything stupid.

           INT. CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES - MAIN FACTORY

           Hundreds and Hundreds of Gadabouts. All ready to be unleashed 
           on America. Wilbur cringes. And then hops inside one of the 
           time machines.

           INT. GADABOUT

           Wilbur rips open the console and looks down at the inner 
           workings of the Gadabout engine.

                                 WILBUR
                             (to himself)
                        I have to see what I’ve done. 
           A TINY METAL CLOCK in the engine ticks backward. Wilbur grabs 
           the metal hand, but then stops - 

                                 WILBUR
                        This is crazy. It’s impossible.

           But then Wilbur looks at the trucks waiting to load the 
           Gadabouts. The boxes labeled for: New York, Chicago, Los 
           Angeles, Philadelphia...

                                 WILBUR
                        No. I have to know.

           Wilbur twists the clock as hard as he can - The Gadabout 
           jolts with a violent RUMBLE, and then... the clock ticks 
           FORWARD. 

           If it wasn’t obvious before, it is now. Wilbur’s going to the 
           future.

           Wilbur closes the console. And spins the Time Dial... the 
           other direction. He closes his eyes and SLAMS on the Red 
           Button. 

           BRIGHT LIGHT blinds Wilbur followed by a deafening sound, 
           that can only be described as the world being ripped apart. 
           Suddenly, Wilbur’s thrown weightlessly around the interior of 
           the Gadabout.

           It’s violent and terrifying. Wilbur’s nose starts to bleed. 
           He fights his way to the console.

                                 WILBUR
                        STOP! STOP! I made a mistake. 

           BOOM! Light and sound reverberate like an atomic bomb and 
           then - 

           Nothing. The Gadabout simply comes to rest. Wilbur looks 
           around - is he safe? 

           Wilbur watches the battery gauge needle: it’s stable. The low 
           battery light is off. Crisis subdued, Wilbur flings open the 
           door to the Gadabout and enters - 

           INT. OLD CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES FACTORY - 2017

           It worked. Wilbur’s in the future. He stands in the old 
           factory, but it’s crumbling and abandoned. (Like the run-down 
           car plants in Detroit.)
           Wilbur’s old office is all broken glass and graffiti. Wilbur 
           smiles... maybe the Gadabout never took off? But then Wilbur 
           opens the doors to the factory and sees - 

           EXT. HARTSVILLE - 2017 (GADABOUT EDITION)

           The quaint small town long gone, and in its place is a 
           sprawling metropolis. One sky scraper rises above them all - 
           CUDWORTH-HOOPER INDUSTRIES.

                                 WILBUR
                        Oh no. 

           Wilbur walks toward the town and passes a large sign: Welcome 
           to Hartsville: Time Travel Capital of the World.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 2017 (GADABOUT EDITION)

           Gadabout posters, billboards and video ads cover every inch 
           of the grimy urban center. A graffiti covered HIGH TECH METRO 
           TRAIN blows its high pitched whistle as it whizzes through 
           the buildings.

           Actual Gadabouts are huddled on every street corner. Vito’s 
           is a MONSTROUS OLIVE GARDEN... staffed by what appear to be 
           actual 1st Century ROMANS. Most of the buildings themselves 
           are all covered in THICK BARS. Signs warn: STOP TIME CRIME. 
           JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN. DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD.

           An old man reads a newspaper with PRESIDENT TRUMP. (I guess 
           there is no future where that’s avoidable.)

           A YOUNG COUPLE exits from a shimmering Gadabout. The WOMAN 
           holds a CHICKEN and an EGG.

                                 WOMAN
                             (looking between chicken 
                              and egg)
                        I can’t believe we actually solved 
                        it!

           FLASH! A Gadabout lands right next to Wilbur. Forcing him to 
           dive out of the way, as a group of PUNK KIDS run from the 
           Gadabout carrying an ancient NATIVE AMERICAN HEADDRESS, a 
           16th CENTURY MUSKET, and WOOLLY MAMMOTH HORN. 

                                 PUNK KID 1 
                        Hey Tommy, remember when I killed 
                        your grandfather back there? 

                                 TOMMY
                        You what?
           Tommy looks down... his hands start to disappear. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Oh no.

           And like that, Tommy vanishes into oblivion.  The other boys 
           laugh as they play with their time travelling treasures, but 
           no one pays them any mind. This is a normal day in 
           Hartsville.

           And then a DEAFENING CLANG vibrates the sidewalk. Up the 
           street, Seventy-five 75-year-old Suzy’s bicker amongst 
           themselves as they push identical WALKERS.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny was right.

           Wilbur looks up at the sparkling tower of Cudworth-Hooper 
           Industries. MARBLE STATUES of Don and Wilbur are positioned 
           out front.

                                 WILBUR
                        ...I ruined everything.

           Suddenly, a huge commotion breaks out in front of the 
           Cudworth-Hooper building.  The main door flies open and out 
           walks a 78-YEAR-OLD WILBUR HOOPER. Overweight and yet somehow 
           hallow. A deep sadness shines from within him. 

           Wilbur stares right at his 78-year-old self. Old Wilbur 
           lifelessly signs papers and offers a half hearted smile to 
           the cameras who surround him. And then - Old Wilbur locks 
           eyes with his younger self. 

           Upon seeing young Wilbur, a tear forms in Old Wilbur’s eye. 
           The two stare at each other, young Wilbur haunted by his 
           future self. Old Wilbur wants to say something, but before he 
           can, he’s whisked away by his security guards. 

                                 WILBUR
                        What have I done?

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        That doesn’t make any sense.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 2017

           On their walk back, Grandpa Wilbur and Henry have reached the 
           edge of the small town. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s not how Hartsville looks.
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Of course it doesn’t... story’s not 
                        finished yet. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 2017 (GADABOUT EDITION)

           Wilbur stands there frozen... this can’t really be his 
           future. And then a video screen grabs Wilbur’s eye. It’s the 
           end of a Gadabout ad:

           A 78-year-old Don fills the screen, he somehow looks 
           spectacular. 

                                 DON
                             (on-screen)
                        And that’s a Gadabout promise. From 
                        Don -

           Genny appears beside him.

                                 GENNY
                        And Genny Cudworth.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny Cudworth?

                                 DON
                        The Gadabout. It’s our past.

                                 GENNY
                        And our future.

           Genny and Don embrace as the Gadabout forms behind them.

                                 WILBUR
                        This can’t be right. It can’t be -

           Tears fill Wilbur’s eyes.

                                 WILBUR
                             (Wilbur screams at video 
                              Don.)
                        This is all your fault! Why’d I 
                        ever listen to you?!

           Wilbur picks up a rock and throws it at Don on the screen! 
           The screen CRACKS and gets stuck on the Gadabout slogan:

           MAKE A MISTAKE? JUST GO BACK AND MEND! MAKE A MISTAKE? JUST 
           GO BACK AND MEND!

           As Wilbur watches the slogan repeat, he forms an idea. 
                                 WILBUR
                        I didn’t make this future. Don did. 
                        Maybe I can stop him... before I 
                        even meet him. I just... have to go 
                        back to the beginning.

           Wilbur runs back to his Gadabout. 

           INT. FARM BUILDING - 2017 (GADABOUT EDITION)

           Wilbur hops into his Gadabout. 

           INT. THE GADABOUT

           Wilbur flips the time wheel back 59 years. He presses the Red 
           button. 

           FLASH!

           INT. FARM BUILDING - JULY 4TH, 1958

           Wilbur starts to drive his Gadabout toward the door, but then 
           he remembers where he is. 

                                 WILBUR
                             (to himself)
                        I can’t drive this out there.

           Wilbur climbs out of the Gadabout and looks around... where 
           he spots a WHITE SHEET.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - JULY 4TH, 1958

           Wilbur drags his LARGE SOMETHING UNDER A SHEET through the 
           town square. All of Harstville is gathering for the 
           fireworks. The old, familiar looks of pity greet Wilbur as he 
           passes. Wilbur almost forgot how little this town used to 
           think of him.

           EXT. OAK STREET - HARTSVILLE - JULY 4TH, 1958

           Wilbur hides his Gadabout behind an OAK TREE as he spots Don 
           just next door, knocking with his vacuum cleaner.

           The first GREEN FIREWORK shoots into the night sky. Wilbur’s 
           gotta hurry.
           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - JULY 4TH 1958

           Wilbur approaches his old home. He heads toward his shed when 
           he hears - 

                                 GENNY (O.C.)
                        But this house. This little shed. 
                        It’s enough for me, but it’s never 
                        going to be enough for you. 

           Wilbur ducks behind the shed, he’s still got a few moments. 
           He practices his speech. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Wilbur, I’m from the future. Your 
                        time machine is going to be a big 
                        success, but it’s vitally important 
                        than you never meet a man named - 

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Don’t do it, Wilbur.

           Wilbur turns to see Don, still in his TUX from the Gala. 

                                 WILBUR
                        Don? How did you - 

                                 DON
                        I thought you’d try something 
                        stupid, but I didn’t think this 
                        stupid. 

                                 WILBUR
                        You don’t understand. 

                                 DON
                        I’m not going to let you destroy 
                        everything we created together!

                                 WILBUR
                        No. I can’t let us meet, Don.

           Wilbur turns back to the shed, when he hears - 

           CLICK! Don points a GUN toward Wilbur. 

                                 DON
                        I’m sorry, Wilbur. I didn’t want it 
                        to be this way. 

           Don pushes Wilbur up against the shed, Wilbur look inside: 

           INSIDE THE SHED: Genny, in her PAISLEY DRESS and gripping her 
           BLUE SUITCASE, stares at July 4th, 1958 Wilbur.  
                                 WILBUR
                        Wait. I need you, Genny. 

                                 GENNY
                        I need you too, Wilbur. But maybe 
                        that’s not enough.

           OUTSIDE: This hits Wilbur in a whole new way. And Wilbur 
           realizes, he doesn’t need to just stop Don. He needs to stop 
           himself.

           Suddenly, Genny slams open the door to the shed and flees up 
           the driveway, wiping tears from her eyes as she goes. 

           Not wanting to be seen, Don pulls Wilbur into the grass. As 
           Genny flees up the drive way. The second RED FIREWORK 
           explodes. She passes the young couple, mid-fight: 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hurry, we’re missing it!

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        And who’s fault is that?

           BACK BY THE SHED: Don holds the gun to Wilbur’s head and 
           brings him to his feet. 

                                 DON
                        COME ON! Tie him up!

           Don’s SECURITY GUARDS emerge from the shadows. They grab 
           Wilbur’s arms and slam into the door of the shed. Wilbur has 
           an idea - he knocks on the shed door with his head. Then, he 
           positions the guard in front of the door as they pin his arms 
           behind his back.

           Suddenly, the shed door flies open -

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Genny?

           The swinging door slams into the security guard, which allows 
           our Wilbur to break free. Wilbur runs to his 1958 self. 

           Visually they’ll be easy to distinguish as Wilbur still wears 
           his tux. For script purposes, Present Gala Tux Wilbur is 
           WILBUR and younger Wilbur working in the shed in 1958 is 
           WILBUR (’58) 

                                 WILBUR 
                        COME ON! We gotta go! 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What?!?
           Wilbur grabs his younger self. The Wilburs make a run for it. 

                                 DON
                        Get him! 

                                 GUARD 1
                        Which one?

                                 DON
                        Both of ‘em!

           The security guards chase after the Wilburs... Who rush by 
           Don (July 4th, 1958) standing stunned with his vacuum 
           cleaner.

           BOOM! The third BLUE FIREWORK explodes.

           With the security guards gaining on them, the Wilburs arrive 
           at the Gadabout hiding under the sheet behind a tree.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What is going on?!?

           Wilbur rips off the sheet, and Wilbur (’58) takes in the 
           strange machine.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Is that... the Go-Backer?

                                 WILBUR
                        Sort of. JUST GET IN!

           Wilbur throws Wilbur (’58) into the Gadabout. As he follows 
           himself inside, Wilbur spots a half dozen other Gadabouts 
           hiding on Oak Street. As Wilbur shuts the door to the 
           Gadabout, we see the security guards hop into their 
           Gadabouts.

           INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT 

           Wilbur (’58) takes in the wonders of the Gadabout. As we 
           watch the two Wilbur’s work together, their difference in 
           confidence levels is striking.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        This is amazing. This is my time 
                        machine!

           Wilbur spins the time dial back 30 years.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                             (fiddling with the dial)
                        YEARS!?! It can go back years?
                                 WILBUR
                             (slapping him away)
                        Stop that!

           Wilbur (’58) examines the battery.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Wow.

                                 WILBUR 
                        I know...

                       WILBUR (’58)
           Science is so cool.
                                                         WILBUR 
                                              Science is so cool.

           BAM! A security guard FIRES A GUN at the time machine’s 
           window. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What do these people want?

                                 WILBUR
                        They’re trying to stop me from 
                        stopping you.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Stop me from what?

           Wilbur peels the Gadabout out from behind the tree.

                                 WILBUR
                        Meeting Don.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Who’s Don?

                                 WILBUR
                        The guy trying to destroy the 
                        world!

           Wilbur slams the RED BUTTON. And thus kicks off an awesome 
           “CAR CHASE” sequence, but we don’t use roads. We use all of 
           TIME!

           EXT. HARTSVILLE 1920 / INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           The Wilbur’s Gadabout lands on an OLD DIRT ROAD - the 
           original OAK STREET.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        How’s Don going to destroy the 
                        world?
           Wilbur pulls the Gadabout to a stop. A STUDEBAKER drives by.

                                 WILBUR
                        Listen to me, Wilbur - 

           POP! POP! POP!  Six other Gadabouts land behind the Wilburs.

                                 WILBUR
                        WHAT IN THE HELL?!?!

           The Gadabouts charge, forcing Wilbur to screech his time 
           machine forward. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Keep going!

           Wilbur turns the time wheel 100 years. Slams the Red Button.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE 1850/ INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           The Wilburs’ Gadabout rumbles down OLD RAILROAD TRACKS. 
           Almost instantaneously, the security guards’ Gadabouts 
           appear.

                                 WILBUR
                        I don’t understand. How are they 
                        tracking us?

           A TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES. A coal powered LOCOMOTIVE (a replica 
           from the one on Wilbur’s desk) barrels down the tracks behind 
           them... but the security guards’ Gadabouts easily out run it.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                             (looking back at the 
                              Gadabouts... )
                        What do we do?

           Wilbur looks back at the slow train. His eyes twinkle with an 
           idea.

                                 WILBUR 
                        Improvise.

           Wilbur opens the console and slams the clock forward. And 
           then spins the time wheels into the future. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        The future? That’s not safe!

                                 WILBUR
                        Safer than here!
           Wilbur presses the red button. And the Wilburs are engulfed 
           by the violent noise and rumble. POP! They disappear.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE 2030 / INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT 

           As the Wilburs’ Gadabout lands, the old railroad tracks 
           beneath them transform into the futuristic METRO TRACKS. 
           Wilbur turns back to see - the security guards’ Gadabouts 
           land on the same tracks behind them.

           A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE RINGS OUT! Wilbur smiles and then 
           violently turns his Gadabout off the tracks. Just as -  

           WHAM! The high speed metro train overruns the enemy 
           Gadabouts. Cutting through them like tin foil.  

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        It worked!

           But before Wilbur has time to celebrate, a half dozen other 
           Gadabouts gain ground behind him. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Kind of. It kinda worked.

           Wilbur looks up at the CUDWORTH-HOOPER SKYSCRAPER.

                                 WILBUR
                        We’re going to have to get smarter.

           Wilbur spins the time wheel back. SLAMS THE RED BUTTON.

           EXT. HARSTVILLE 1880/ INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           Where the skyscraper once stood is an empty plot of grass. 
           Wilbur heads right for it. He weaves through the dirt roads 
           of early Hartsville, made up of little more than a SALOON, 
           CHURCH and GENERAL STORE. Chased by the security Gadabouts, 
           Wilbur passes through the empty plot of grass.

                                 WILBUR
                        HOLD ON!

           - he spins the time wheel forward. Hits the Red Button.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE 2016/ INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           Wilbur’s Gadabout appears right in front of the Cudworth-
           Hooper Skyscraper. He turns back and hears a SERIES OF 
           HORRIFIC CRASHES. The security guard’s Gadabouts appeared 
           inside the building!
           One of the Gadabouts crashes through the glass and skids into 
           WILBUR’S MARBLE statue. Decapitating the marbled Wilbur and 
           sending the head flying crashing into the glass of the 
           Wilburs’ Gadabout.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        IS THAT ME?!? WHY IS THERE A STATUE 
                        OF ME!?!

           Wilbur uses the security guard’s destruction to study the 
           console.

                                 WILBUR
                        How are they tracking us?

           His eyes meet the EMERGENCY BEACON. 

                                 WILBUR
                        The beacon! They must be using it 
                        to locate our Gadabout!

           Wilbur rips open the console. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I have to get rid of the beacon. 
                        You drive.

           Wilbur (’58) takes the wheel as Wilbur studies the GADABOUT 
           MANUAL and searches inside the console for the beacon. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What do I do?

                                 WILBUR
                        We know time AND this town better 
                        than they do. Use it!

           Wilbur (’58) spots the Hartsville Bridge up ahead. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        When was the bridge built? 

           Wilbur (’58) speeds over the bridge as the security guards’ 
           Gadabouts gain ground.

                                 WILBUR
                             (as he works)
                        If I know. You know.

           Wilbur (’58) nods and then spins the dial back. He waits for 
           his Gadabout to clear the bridge. The moment it does. He 
           presses the button.
           EXT. HARTSVILLE 1900 / INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           The Wilburs’ Gadabout skids to a stop. 

           OUTSIDE: The security guards’ Gadabouts appear over the 
           river. The bridge isn’t built yet. And thus, the Gadabouts 
           savagely crash into the moving water.

           Wilbur pumps his fist... but then POP! POP! POP! 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        They just keep coming! 

                                 WILBUR
                        Then Keep GOING!

           Wilbur digs into the console. While above him, the LOW 
           BATTERY LIGHT begins to FLASH!

                                 WILBUR
                             (re: beacon)
                        I’ve almost got it. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        When was the battle of Hartsville?

                          WILBUR
                                                      WILBUR (’58)
                 (thinking)
                                                (thinking)
           1863?
                                              1863?

           Wilbur rips out the emergency beacon and then... spots the 
           flashing red light. 

                                 WILBUR 
                        Wait! We have to stop!

           Wilbur (’58) looks at the approaching Gadabouts.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        WE CAN’T STOP!

           Wilbur (’58) spins the time wheel backward and SLAMS ON THE 
           RED BUTTON. 

                                 WILBUR
                        NOOOO!!!!

           EXT. HARTSVILLE 1863 / INT. WILBUR’S GADABOUT

           The Wilburs’ Gadabout lands in the middle of a CIVIL WAR 
           BATTLE. MUSKETS fire everywhere! A security guard’s Gadabout 
           appears and is immediately BLOWN AWAY BY A CANNON BALL.
           More Gadabouts continue to appear. Avoiding musket fire, 
           Wilbur tosses out the beacon. He turns to the flashing LOW 
           BATTERY LIGHT. 

                                 WILBUR 
                        Come on. Just hold a little - 

           BAM!  A security guard Gadabout slams into the Wilburs, 
           toppling their machine toward the river’s edge. The Gadabout 
           flips end over end as the flashing light blinks faster and 
           faster.  WHAM! The Gadabout smashes into an OAK TREE, pinning 
           it just above the water. 

           The force flings the Gadabout’s door open, and Wilbur(‘58) 
           soars toward it. He’s about to be thrown from the machine 
           when Wilbur grabs onto him.  He clutches his past self’s 
           hand, holding him above the rushing river below.

                                 WILBUR
                        Hold on!

           But it’s too late. Wilbur (’58) is slipping. He’s just about 
           to lose his grasp when -  

           KABOOM!!! The energy field and vibrant white light explode 
           from the engine. The black hole forms just as Wilbur(’58) 
           loses his future self’s grip. 

           But rather than falling to the river, the black hole sucks 
           Wilbur (’58) BACK INTO THE GADABOUT.  The door slams behind 
           him, which finally tips the Gadabout into the river. 

           It lands with an enormous splash. The Gadabout fills with 
           water. The Wilburs brace themselves behind the egg chairs as 
           everything inside the Gadabout starts flying toward the 
           engine and the black hole of light.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What is this?

                                 WILBUR
                        The engine’s out of battery. So, 
                        all of time is collapsing in on 
                        itself.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Dimensional Collapse!?!?

           And then all around them: 

           SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH! The other GADABOUTS CRASH LAND!

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        What about those Gadabouts?
           KABOOM! KABOOM! KABOOM!

                                 WILBUR
                        Dimensional collapse...

           Each of the security guards’ Gadabouts explode with energy. 
           Igniting widespread DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE. 

           The civil war battle comes to a stop. The soldiers turn to 
           the insanity at the river.

           INSIDE THE WILBUR’S GADABOUT: WHOOSH! The egg chair is ripped 
           from the floor and into the black hole oblivion. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        How do we stop this?

                                 WILBUR
                        Without another battery, we can’t! 

           BOOM! The windows from the Gadabout explode! The glass soars 
           toward the black hole of light.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        We have to do something!

           The manual flutters toward the collapsing engine. Wilbur 
           (’58) spots the RED PAGE and reads: In case of Dimensional 
           Collapse. 

           Wilbur (’58) grabs the manual out of the air. He keeps 
           reading -

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        In case of Dimensional collapse 
                        send final messages to loved ones. 
                        Well, that’s not helpful. 

                                 WILBUR
                        I’m so sorry, Genny.

           The console begins to collapse in on itself. 

           OUTSIDE: All around the Wilburs the other security guards’ 
           Gadabouts glow with brilliant WHITE LIGHT. Union and 
           Confederate soldiers are pulled toward the collapses.

           INSIDE: The cocktail bar door flies open. The SALT 
           COMPARTMENT for the margaritas flies toward the black hole. 
           Wilbur snags it out of the air. His eyes goes wide as he 
           stares at the SODIUM CHLORIDE.

                                 WILBUR
                        Thank you, Genny!
           Wilbur digs through the bar and pulls out an ICE BUCKET and 
           hands it to Wilbur (’58)

                                 WILBUR
                        Fill that with water.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Why?

                                 WILBUR
                        We’re making a salt water battery!

           Wilbur (’58) tucks the MANUAL in his coat pocket and fills 
           the ice bucket from the river. Wilbur rips out the COPPER 
           WIRING from the console. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Is a salt water battery going to be 
                        enough to stop the collapse?

                                 WILBUR
                        Of course not.

           Suddenly, gravity gives out and the Wilburs lift into the 
           air. Undeterred, Wilbur steadies himself and removes the 
           CIGARETTE HOLDERS and attaches them to the copper wiring. 

                                 WILBUR
                        BUT IT MAY BE ENOUGH TO GET US BACK 
                        TO 1958!

           Wilbur wraps the salt water bucket with METAL from the RADIO.  
           Wilbur attaches one copper wire clamp to the metal bucket, he 
           holds the other clamp next to the ENGINE. And with that, he 
           attaches the clamp to the ENGINE and SLAMS THE RED BUTTON. 

           FLASH!

           EXT. OAK STREET - HARTSVILLE - JULY 4TH, 1958

           The Wilburs Gadabout lands back in 1958.  They check the 
           battery light, it’s FLASHING. But still holding on... for 
           now.

           They slowly climb out of the machine.  Wilbur looks to his 
           right and sees: 

            - Himself from earlier hiding the Gadabout under the white 
           sheet behind a tree. 

            - And farther down the street -  Don (July 4th 1958) selling 
           his vacuum cleaner.
           Everyone looks up to see - BOOM! THE FIRST GREEN FIREWORK 
           lights up the night sky.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Why are we here?

                                 WILBUR 
                        We have to destroy the time 
                        machine.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Destroy it?!?! Are we sure there’s 
                        not another way?

                                 WILBUR
                        There’s not. Now GET DOWN!

           The Wilburs hide behind the OAK trees as they turn to -

           ON THE SHED

           Wilbur (from earlier) walks up the driveway and peeks into 
           the shed.  Don (Gala) sneaks up on him from behind. 

           FROM THE TREES

           Wilbur (’58) points toward the Hartsville river, where dozens 
           of dots of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ARE BEGINNING TO GROW.

                                 WILBUR
                        The dimensional collapse. It’s 
                        spreading to every time. We have to 
                        hurry. 

           ON THE SHED

           Don points the GUN at Wilbur. WHAM! The door to the shed 
           flies open and out walks Genny, in her Paisley dress with her 
           blue suitcase. 

           FROM THE TREES

           Wilbur looks at Genny as she wipes away tears. The way the 
           moonlight hits her hair.  BOOM! The second RED FIREWORK 
           explodes. A YOUNG COUPLE passes by - 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hurry, we’re missing it!

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        And who’s fault is that?

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Who are they?
                                 WILBUR
                        I don’t - 

                                 GENNY (O.C.)
                        Wilbur... is that you?

           Wilbur turns to see Genny staring through the trees - right 
           at him. 

                                 GENNY
                             (looking between Wilbur 
                              and the shed)
                        Wilbur, how are you - how did you -

           Then, she sees Wilbur (’58)

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur? Wilbur, how are there... 
                        two of you?

           Wilbur looks to the shed. 

           ON THE SHED: Don holds the gun to Wilbur’s past self.

           FROM THE TREES:

                                 GENNY
                        There are THREE of you?!?

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny, you have to hide!

           Wilbur grabs Genny and hides her in the trees.

                                 GENNY
                        WHAT IS GOING ON?!?

                                 WILBUR 
                        I promise I’ll explain everything. 
                        For now we have to - 

                                 GENNY
                        Wait a minute! Is this about your 
                        time machine? I told you that it 
                        was going to - 

                                 WILBUR
                        You were right, Genny. You were 
                        always right. And we’re going to 
                        destroy that thing. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Are you sure we have to -
                                 WILBUR 
                             (to Wilbur ‘58)
                        YES! Listen, our past selves are 
                        about to be chased into our time 
                        machine by a bunch of guards. When 
                        that happens, we have to sneak into 
                        the shed and you have to destroy 
                        the time machine. Forever.

                                 WILBUR (JULY 4TH 1958)
                        Why do I have to do it?

                                 WILBUR
                        This is your original time line. 
                        You’re the only one who can set it 
                        back... And be certain that you 
                        never make the time machine again. 

           Wilbur turns to the house in time to see:

           ON THE SHED

           Wilbur (July 4th 1958) emerges from the shed. Wilbur fights 
           off the guards and grabs Wilbur (Earlier ’58) and the two 
           head for the Gadabout.

                                 DON
                        Grab them!

                                 SECURITY GUARD 1
                        Which one?

                                 DON
                        Both of them!

           BEHIND THE TREES

           The hiding Wilburs watch as their past selves run away from 
           the security guards and hop into their Gadabouts. In that 
           time line, the TIME CHASE IS ON.  

           BOOM! The third BLUE FIREWORK explodes. Which means it’s time 
           for our Wilburs to sneak to the shed. But as they start their 
           journey - 

           KABOOM!! Their Gadabout bursts with energy. The dimensional 
           collapse is back on.

                                 WILBUR 
                        We have to hurry!

           Suddenly, Genny feels a pull on her dress and her feet are 
           lifted off the ground. Wilbur holds her tight. 
                                 WILBUR
                        STAY AWAY FROM THAT!

           Wilbur drags Genny toward the shed. Wilbur (’58) follows. In 
           the distance, the bright white lights shine over the river.

           EXT. HARTSVILLE RIVER

           The Dimensional Collapse lights continue to grow. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE

           The whole town gathers as they look up to the fireworks 
           exploding in the night sky. Suddenly, Suzy sees the white 
           lights. 

                                 SUZY
                        What are those?

                                 FRANK
                             (who appears beside her)
                        They must be new this year. Pretty 
                        aren’t they?

           And then - RUMBLE! Bleachers begin to shake. People scurry 
           from them just as WHOOSH! The bleachers fly toward to the 
           lights. Then all of Downtown Hartsville begins to shake and 
           then soar toward the dimensional collapses. Complete chaos as 
           the citizens duck for cover. 

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           The trio enters. Wilbur freezes for just a moment. He’d 
           forgotten how depressing this place was. But then a section 
           of the roof FLIES OFF THE SHED and soars toward the 
           dimensional collapse. 

           Wilbur picks up the CROW BAR and hands it to Wilbur (’58) 

                                 WILBUR 
                        You have to destroy it. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        The time machine is a success. THEY 
                        BUILD STATUES OF ME! There has to 
                        be another way!

                                 WILBUR
                        There isn’t!  
                                 DON
                        Yes, there is.

           Don, in his TUX, stands in the doorway, his GUN pointed at 
           Wilbur. Wilbur (’58) recognizes Don from the statue. From the 
           vacuums.

           Suddenly, Don pushes a very confused Don from July 4th, 1958, 
           still holding his vacuum, into the shed. 

                        DON (’58)
                                                      WILBUR (’58)
           What is going on?
                                              What is going on?

                                 DON
                        You see, Wilbur, there is another 
                        way. 
                             (pointing to his past 
                              self)
                        You two can escape in the original 
                        time machine. 

           Don gestures to the Go-Backer. Behind the Dons, BOARDS FROM 
           THE SHED CRACK IN HALF and fly to the dimensional collapse.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Wilbur, you can still have the life 
                        you wanted. You don’t have to 
                        listen to him. You don’t have to be 
                        a failure.

           Wilbur (’58) looks between Don and Wilbur... unsure what to 
           do.

           BOOM! The whole shed tears off its foundation and RIPS TOWARD 
           THE GADABOUT BLACK HOLE. 

           Wilbur’s worktable collapses, the machinery and batteries 
           EXPLODE... igniting a roaring fire around the scene. Wilbur 
           uses the distraction to tackle Don, knocking the gun out of 
           his hand. 

                                 WILBUR
                             (to Wilbur ‘58)
                        DESTROY IT!

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        I... I can’t.

                                 GENNY
                        You have to Wilbur. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        I can’t! My dad can’t be right. I’m 
                        not going to be a failure.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILBUR (’58) (CONT'D)
                             (softly to Genny)
                        And you heard him, we can start a 
                        new time line. 

           Wilbur (’58) looks between Don (’58) and Genny.

                                 WILBUR
                        The three of us.

                                 GENNY
                        I’m not going with you, Wilbur. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        YOU HAVE TO!

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTSVILLE - 1958

           Suzy and Frank cower together as all Hartsville is ripped 
           apart. Suddenly, Suzy is pulled toward the dimensional 
           collapse. Frank holds on to her with all he’s got. 

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - 1958

           Don and Wilbur continue to fight over the gun. They each grab 
           the handle.  

           BANG! The gun accidently fires. EVERYTHING STOPS.

                                 GENNY
                        Wilbur?

           Genny looks down as... her paisley dress fills with BLOOD.

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny!

           Genny grabs her stomach and collapses to the ground. Wilbur 
           and Wilbur (’58) run to her.

                                 DON 
                        YOU HAVE TO GO NOW, WILBUR!

           Wilbur (’58) cradles Genny as she coughs up blood. Like a 
           strong wind, the dimensional collapse swirls up everything in 
           the shed.

                                 DON (’58)
                        Come on! Leave her! She’s not going 
                        to make it.

           Genny eyes’ flutter. 
                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        Genny! Genny!

                                 GENNY
                             (whispered)
                        Wilbur, you were never a failure. 
                        You’re my everything. And I’m sorry 
                        if maybe I didn’t love you hard 
                        enough for you to know that.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        You loved me plenty, Genny. I was 
                        just too stupid to notice.

           Genny weakly smiles up at Wilbur. 

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        I need you.

           Genny’s eyes begin to flitter away from consciousness.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        No!

           Wilbur grabs Wilbur (’58)

                                 WILBUR
                        You have to destroy it. Before it 
                        destroys everything.

           In a fit of rage, Wilbur (’58) springs to his feet. He grabs 
           a chunk of FIERY WOOD from the work table and holds it over 
           the Gadabout’s engine. He’s going to destroy it.

                                 DON 
                        Wilbur, if you destroy the time 
                        machine. Then, you die a sad old 
                        man. In this sad little town. With 
                        a sad little life. A FAILURE. 

           Wilbur (’58) holds the fiery wood over the Gadabout. 
           Uncertainty in his eyes.

           Suddenly, gravity starts to loosen. Genny’s pulled into the 
           air, but Wilbur grabs her. Wilbur holds Genny as close as he 
           can. But they’re losing the fight against the collapse. 
           They’re being violently sucked away from the scene.

           Wilbur (’58) turns back to Don, and then Don (’58) waiting on 
           him. Don (’58)’s feet are lifted into the air. He grabs onto 
           the table.

                                 DON (’58)
                        LET’S GET OUT OF HERE, FRIEND!
                                 DON
                        Your new life is waiting, Wilbur.

           Everything swirls around them as Wilbur (’58) lowers the 
           flaming wood.

                                 WILBUR (’58)
                        I don’t need another life. I need 
                        to save this one.

           Wilbur (’58) shoves the flame into the time machine. KABOOM! 
           Wilbur (’58) is blown back as the original Gadabout EXPLODES! 
           The world shakes. And then... 

           EVERYTHING GOES BLACK.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED - JULY 4TH, 1958

           Wilbur slowly opens his eyes and finds himself lying on the 
           shed floor. Everything has returned to normal... except for 
           the charred, demolished Gadab... Go-Backer smoking in the 
           middle of the room. 

           Wilbur stands, but as he does... The GADABOUT MANUAL falls 
           from his coat pocket. Wilbur stares down at it... and then 
           hides it in the table. Where it’ll stay for the next fifty 
           years.

                                 WILBUR
                             (as he remembers)
                        Genny.

           Wilbur frantically opens the door to his shed.

           EXT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME 

                                 WILBUR
                        GENNY! WHERE ARE YOU?

           Wilbur runs to the driveway after her, but she’s not there. 

                                 WILBUR (CONT’D)
                        GENNY?!?!

           He sprints onto - 

           EXT. OAK STREET - HARTSVILLE

                                 WILBUR
                        GENNY! 
           But Genny’s gone. Wilbur doesn’t see her anywhere.

           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME

                                 WILBUR
                        GENNY! GENNY!

           But she still doesn’t answer. Wilbur collapses to the ground. 
           Everything he just did... for naught.

                                 GENNY (CONT’D)
                        Good-bye, Wilbur.

           Genny stands at the top of the stairs. Her paisley dress 
           pristine. The blue suitcase in her hand. In Genny’s mind, 
           they just finished their big fight. She rushes past him - 

                                 WILBUR
                        Genny. Wait! I can’t let you walk 
                        out that door. I just can’t. And
                        I’m sorry I ever let you believe 
                        there was anything in this world 
                        more important than you. I will 
                        never let that happen again. This 
                        is enough. And I’m going to fight 
                        like hell for it for the rest of my 
                        life. Because I need you. Just you.

           Wilbur holds his breath as he waits for Genny’s response. 
           Then, a tear falls down her cheek. 

           KNOCK! KNOCK! The door slowly opens.

                                 DON
                        Hi Friends! I’m Don Cudworth.

           WHAM! Wilbur SLAMS THE DOOR IN THIS FACE!

                                 WILBUR
                        NOT INTERESTED!

           Wilbur turns back to Genny.

                                 GENNY
                        I need you too, Wilbur. 

           Wilbur kisses Genny as long and deep as she’ll let him.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR (V.O.)
                        And that’s it. That’s the story.
           INT. WILBUR AND GENNY’S HOME - THE SHED - 2017

           Henry and Grandpa Wilbur stand back in the SHED. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Now, Henry I could have chosen a 
                        different life, but instead I chose 
                        to appreciate the one I had, and 
                        appreciate every moment of it.
                             (beat)
                        Sometimes that all that really 
                        matters.

           Henry stops. He thinks about that.

                                 HENRY
                        ... Grandpa?

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Yes, Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        You made that whole thing up, 
                        didn’t you?

           Henry looks at the book shelf in the corner. His eyes dance 
           over Grandpa Wilbur’s sci-fi books.

                                 HENRY
                        This is just another one of your 
                        stories. Isn’t it?

           Henry stares up at his grandfather. For just a moment, a bit 
           of magic dances in Grandpa Wilbur’s eyes.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Maybe... maybe not. 
                             (beat)
                        But all that matters is what you 
                        believe. And what you feel. And 
                        Henry, I know you wish things were 
                        different. 

           Henry looks away, but Grandpa Wilbur grabs his hand.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        And I know you got a broken heart. 
                        ‘cause I got one, too. But a broken 
                        heart just means we loved her. And 
                        I can’t tell you how thankful I am 
                        that I got somebody else who loved 
                        your Grandma like I did.

           Henry looks back at Grandpa Wilbur.
                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        And is hurting just like I am, too.

                                 HENRY
                        Me too.

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Good. ‘Cause we got a whole lot 
                        more lousy days ahead of us. And 
                        I’m glad I got ya, ‘cause I’m going 
                        need you, Henry. I’m going to need 
                        you something bad. We all are.

           Now, it’s Grandpa Wilbur’s turn to cry. Henry throws his arms 
           around his grandfather. They hold for as long as Wilbur 
           needs.

                                 HENRY
                        Now, you have to tell me. Did you 
                        start those skates?  And leave the 
                        shed door open?

           Grandpa Wilbur laughs in that same kooky way. 

                                 GRANDPA WILBUR
                        Who’s to say? Now, come on. Your 
                        family’s gonna be here soon.

           EXT. GRANDPA WILBUR’S BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

           Henry sits alone with his phone, scrolling through those same 
           photos of himself and Grandma Genny. At the edge of the yard: 
           His Mom, Dad and sisters eat at a PICNIC TABLE. He looks from 
           his family. To his phone. And makes a decision.

                                 HENRY
                        Goodbye, Grandma.

           Henry places his hand on the photo and then puts the phone in 
           his pocket. 

           He walks to the table and sits between his two sisters. 
           Without saying a word, they lean on his shoulder. His Mom 
           pours him a LEMONADE. His Dad ruffles his hair.

           Henry softly smiles. Back in the family.

           INT. WILBUR’S SHED

           Grandpa Wilbur watches the scene and grins. He packs away the 
           rest of his inventions. He grabs the umbrella and holds it 
           for a moment. 
           Then, he puts the Gadabout manual away in between the rest of 
           his books. His eyes travel over all the titles, the Gadabout 
           manual now just one story amongst many. 

           Maybe it was all make believe.

           But then Grandpa Wilbur turns to a LARGE SOMETHING UNDER THE 
           WHITE SHEET. He looks at it for a moment and then rips off 
           the covering. 

           It’s 50 years old and burnt to a crisp. But there stands 
           Wilbur’s original time machine. Wilbur smiles up at it. He 
           thinks for a moment... and then climbs inside.

           INT. WILBUR’S TIME MACHINE

           Wilbur sits in one of the dingy folding chairs. He grabs an 
           old picture resting on the battery.

           Wilbur and Genny sit on a blanket. Apple pie in front of 
           them. Fireworks in the sky. They made it to that July 4th 
           parade. 

           And then Wilbur looks over to the time dial. A look of 
           wonderment. A curious smile. He reaches out for it. His hand 
           hovering over the dial:

           SLAM TO BLACK. 

           THE GADABOUT.
