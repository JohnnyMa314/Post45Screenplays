           INT. SADAKO’S BEDROOM, 1945 - DAY

           A piece of PAPER, a pair of HANDS... They begin to fold the 
           paper and it starts to take shape: a long neck, tail, wings...

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Thirteen steps. Twenty-four folds.

           FUJIKO SASAKI (20s), hangs a completed PAPER CRANE over an 
           empty crib and smiles, her stoic exterior briefly cast aside 
           by the tranquil magic of the suspended origami crane. 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        The orizuru, or paper crane, is  
                        the most popular of all origami.

           Fujiko looks next to the crib where a toddler plays with a 
           wooden KOKESHI DOLL. This is SADAKO SASAKI (2).

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        In Japan, the crane is believed to 
                        be a magical creature that can live 
                        for a thousand years. 

           Fujiko crouches next to her daughter and plays with another 
           doll. Sadako laughs with delight. 

           Behind them, in the corner, GRANDMA MATSU sits on a stool and 
           sews a garment. She smiles at Sadako.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        A legend promises if a person folds 
                        one thousand orizuru, they will be 
                        granted a wish... 

           Beside her is a FAMILY PHOTO OF THE SASAKIS: Shigeo, Fujiko, 
           Grandma Matsu and the children, Masahiro and Sadako.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        This is called Senbazuru... One 
                        Thousand Paper Cranes.

                                 MASAHIRO (O.S.)
                        Mama! Come quick!

           Fujiko quickly heads downstairs, leaving Sadako with Matsu.

           A BIRD CALL gets Sadako’s attention and she goes to the 
           window overlooking the street. She sees Fujiko walk out to 
           MASAHIRO (5), who’s with a NEIGHBOR. They point at the sky...

           But Sadako is focused on the roof of the opposite house where 
           a SINGLE CRANE is perched; white body, red head, and black 
           wings against the blue sky. The bird captivates her.
           On the horizon past the crane, the HIROSHIMA EXHIBITION HALL, 
           with its distinct DOMED ROOF, glistens in the morning sun.

           The crane CALLS OUT AGAIN then flaps its wings and jumps into 
           the air. Sadako MIMICS the movements, waving her arms and 
           playing with the crane.

           SUDDENLY THERE IS A HUGE BURST OF BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. 

           Sadako covers her eyes as the light FLARES then--

           A DEAFENING SONIC BOOM. The WINDOW SHATTERS. The WOOD 
           SPLINTERS and CRACKS.

           The smiling face of Sadako’s kokeshi doll DISINTEGRATES.

           Sadako is LIFTED off the ground and THROWN BACKWARDS--

           EXT. POND - DAY

           Sadako lands in the KOI POND with a SPLASH. She sinks below 
           the surface. GOLDEN FISH swim around her. All is silent. She 
           looks up from in the water... 

           A COLOSSAL MUSHROOM CLOUD ERUPTS ACROSS THE SKY. 

           It silhouettes her small frame. From her submerged 
           perspective, it is hauntingly serene.

           She kicks to the surface and --

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           -- emerges from the water, gasping for air. Sadako looks 
           around but does not recognize anything.

           Hiroshima as she knew it has disappeared and been replaced 
           with a fierce whirlwind of destruction and chaos. Her two-
           year-old mind tries to make sense of this new world...

                                 FUJIKO (O.S.)
                        Sadako?!

           Her mother’s voice cuts through the roar of the nuclear 
           tornado. It’s difficult to see, harder to hear, but then--

           Fujiko appears through the dust! She scoops Sadako in her 
           arms and desperately checks her for injury. She’s 
           miraculously unharmed.

           Shielding her eyes from the heat and dust, Fujiko carries 
           Sadako to what is left of their home... A MOUND OF DEBRIS. 
                                 FUJIKO
                        Masahiro!

           Fujiko places Sadako on the ground and digs, frantically 
           searching for her other child... 

                                 MASAHIRO (O.S.)
                        Mama...

           Fujiko runs across the rubble to uncover Masahiro. He’s 
           battered but okay. Fujiko pulls him into her arms. 

           That’s when they see Grandma Matsu, buried in the same rubble 
           as Masahiro. She’s not moving. 

           Fujiko checks her pulse... She’s gone. 

           The shadow of the MUSHROOM CLOUD grows larger overhead. The 
           family are all in a state of shock. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        We have to go. 

           Fujiko straps Sadako to her back with a cloth, then takes 
           Masahiro and climbs over the rubble down onto the street. 

           EXT. FLATTENED MAIN STREET / OTA RIVER - DAY

           Fujiko and her children inch through the smoldering debris. 
           The devastation is overwhelming. No houses are left standing. 

           OTHER PEOPLE stumble around them. A SOUND from behind them 
           gets LOUDER and LOUDER and they turn to see... 

           THREE HORSES emerge out of the SMOKE and gallop towards them. 
           One of them REARS UP on its hind legs.

           Fujiko pulls the children with her to the ground. The horses 
           narrowly miss them and gallop into the distance. She looks 
           behind them and sees what the horses were running from: A 
           TOWER OF FIRE HEADED THEIR WAY. 

           As fast as they can, they scramble over to the OTA RIVER. 

           They join OTHER SURVIVORS at the RIVER’S EDGE, all threatened 
           by the fire roaring behind them.  

           Fujiko desperately fights to keep her children from falling 
           in among the CRUSH OF PEOPLE.

           BOATS come down the river, taking in as many people as they 
           can. A BOAT MAN recognizes Fujiko and waves to her. 
           Fujiko quickly hands Masahiro to him then climbs on herself 
           with Sadako and pushes off to the center of the river.

           As the boat begins it’s trek down-river, they round a corner 
           and see the new horizon...

           The Hiroshima Exhibition Hall reduced to a CHARRED SHELL of a 
           building, its domed roof now just a WEB OF STEEL BEAMS. 

           EXT. BOAT - OTA RIVER - LATER

           Time passes as the fires die down. The SMOKE is thick and 
           impossible to see through. But they hear CRIES from all 
           around them. MANY at first, but they die down... 

           After a while there’s just ONE... 

           Then SILENCE.

           Fujiko holds Masahiro and Sadako close. They sleep. The 
           rocking of the boat is lulling her towards sleep too. 

           But A THUNDERCLAP OVERHEAD startles her. 

           RAIN begins to fall and clears the smoke away, but there is 
           something wrong with this rain. Fujiko holds out her hand and 
           collects a couple DROPS...

           The rain is BLACK. 

           Fujiko does everything she can to shield her children from 
           the black rain but it falls on everyone and gathers in BLACK 
           PUDDLES in the bottom of the boat.

           EXT. BOAT - OTA RIVER - LATER

           The boat moors and the family steps safely onto shore. BLACK 
           DUST covers the land like a shroud. PEOPLE lay still on the 
           ground. Not moving. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        They are sleeping. Resting until 
                        it’s safe to go onto the park.

           Fujiko takes Masahiro by the hand and leads him away. Sadako 
           stares as she is carried away on her mother’s back. 

           EXT. OHSHIBA PARK - DUSK

           The family reach a park on the outskirts of the city, which 
           has become a refugee camp for THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
           Fujiko leads her children to a BURNT TREE STUMP, destroyed 
           and splintered open. They collapse, weak from exhaustion. 

           EXT. OHSHIBA PARK - DAWN

           The family is awakened by the SOUND OF TRUCKS.

           RESCUE TEAMS arrive to help the people, overwhelmed. Fujiko’s 
           husband, SHIGEO (29) is among them. He looks all around for 
           his family but can not find them.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Fujiko!? 

           Fujiko hears Shigeo’s distant voice. She fights to her feet. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        Shigeo... Shigeo!

           Shigeo hears her and stops. He charges in her direction and 
           fights his way through a sea of people to find his family. He 
           finally spots Fujiko and runs to her.  

           Fujiko collapses into his arms. He checks her for injuries 
           and looks to his children, then back to Fujiko...

                                 SHIGEO
                        Matsu?

           Fujiko’s face says it all. Shigeo, upset, holds her close. 
           Sadako and Masahiro wake up and see him. Shigeo pulls them 
           into his embrace as well.

                                 SHIGEO
                        It’s going to be okay. We are 
                        together. We have survived. 
                        Everything will be alright.

           As the family stays huddled together, something on the ground 
           catches Sadako’s attention in the morning light... 

           Behind the burnt tree stump is the SILHOUETTE of the once 
           magnificent tree etched into the ground as a CHARRED IMPRINT. 

           Sadako stares at the haunting image...

           Nothing will ever be the same.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           TITLE: ONE THOUSAND PAPER CRANES
           EXT. WASHINGTON SUBURBS - MORNING

           A PAPERBOY rides his bike past one identical home after 
           another in an idyllic 1950’s American Suburb. He throws out 
           NEWSPAPERS and one lands on the driveway. The headline reads: 
           “THE BIGGEST BOMB YET” over a picture of a MUSHROOM CLOUD.

           DATE: FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA. 1957

           INT. COERR HOME - ROBBIE’S ROOM - DAY

           A FAMILY PORTRAIT shows a man in uniform (HICKS) alongside a 
           vibrantly stylish woman (ELEANOR) and a smiling boy (ROBBIE). 

           Next to the photo is A FOLDED AMERICAN FLAG. 

           ROBBIE HICKS (9) lies awake in bed, staring at the display. 
           He’s got his father’s all-American looks but is shrouded in a 
           thick fog of sadness. FOOTSTEPS approach outside the room and 
           he pretends to be asleep.

           In walks ELEANOR COERR (late 30s), already dressed to the 
           nines and ready for the day. She has an unbeatable energy to 
           her that’s perhaps a bit more forced than natural these days.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Alright, Captain. It’s that time 
                        again. Rise and shine.

           Robbie lets out a groan. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I know, I know. It’s so hard to be 
                        nine. Come on, Wym made pancakes.

           Robbie couldn’t care less. Eleanor picks up some DIRTY 
           CLOTHES from the ground and leads us out of the room into--

           INT. COERR HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The rest of the house is still being unpacked. Eleanor makes 
           her way through the maze of boxes into the kitchen--

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           WYMBERLY “WYM” COERR (40s) has the aura of a great college 
           professor, kind of admirably uncool. He wears a colorful 
           apron over his shirt and tie while he flips pancakes.

           Eleanor comes in and smiles at the sight of him in her apron.
                                 WYM
                        I hope you don’t mind...

                                 ELEANOR
                        Not at all. It suits you. Thanks 
                        again for making breakfast. 

                                 WYM
                        Don’t thank me yet. I don’t 
                        actually know what I’m doing here.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Could have fooled me.

           She exits into the--

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Eleanor walks up to the washing machine and throws Robbie’s 
           clothes in. Now that she’s by herself, the Mary Poppins 
           routine fades away and she takes a moment to collect herself. 
           Clearly, it’s been a difficult transition.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Okay.

           One more deep breath and she heads back inside. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Eleanor, Wym and Robbie sit at the table and eat pancakes in 
           painful silence. Wym boldly attempts to break the tension...

                                 WYM
                        What time is it when an elephant 
                        sits on your fence?

           Robbie is unsure of what to say. 

                                 WYM
                        Time to get a new fence.

           Wym smiles, as does Eleanor, but nothing from Robbie. 

                                 WYM
                        What time is it when a giraffe sits 
                        on your fence?

           Robbie shrugs.

                                 WYM
                        Time to go look for your elephant.
           Crickets.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I should get going. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Your lunch is on the counter. Do 
                        you want me to walk you to the bus?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No, I’ll be fine.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Okay then, I’ll just see you at 
                        school this afternoon.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You don’t have to come if you don’t 
                        want to.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Well I do want to so I’ll see you 
                        there. Now what do you say to Wym 
                        for breakfast?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Thanks.

                                 WYM
                        My pleasure. Have a great day at 
                        school.

           Something about him saying that weirds Robbie out. He grabs 
           his lunch and quickly leaves from the front door. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Love you!

           He’s already gone. Eleanor gives Wym a consolatory look. 

                                 WYM 
                        I guess I need some new jokes.

                                 ELEANOR
                        He’ll get there.

                                 WYM
                        I’ve seen Soviet spies crack easier 
                        than that kid.

           She places her hand on his, appreciative of his efforts.

                                 WYM
                        These pancakes are terrible.
           Eleanor can’t contain her laughter. 

           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - DAY

           The main floor of the newspaper is abuzz with the clacking of 
           TYPEWRITERS. Sunlight fills the office, but only after it 
           passes through the thick fog of cigarette smoke. 

           Eleanor is hard at work, pounding the keys of her typewriter. 
           She stands out in every way, the lone woman on the floor, and 
           a lone spot of life in the otherwise drab environment. Then:

                                 JERRY (O.S.)
                        Eleanor!

           The typewriters suddenly stop. The other JOURNALISTS turn to 
           Eleanor as she stands and crosses the deathly still room en 
           route to the big office marked “EDITOR”. 

           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - EDITOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Eleanor comes in to find JERRY BOWER, (50s), with STACKS OF 
           ARTICLES over his desk. She overdoes it with a chipper smile.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Morning, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        How’s “Dear Lily” coming along?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Wonderful. Helping the modern woman 
                        one domestic problem at a time.

           He fakes a smile then reads from a PIECE OF PAPER.

                                 JERRY
                        “Dear Lily, with the threat of 
                        nuclear war looming ever larger and 
                        news that Russia may have built a 
                        bomb five times the size of those 
                        used in Japan, I find it difficult 
                        to go on with my daily routine. Can 
                        you please discuss this issue and 
                        perhaps quell my fears with fact?”

           Jerry looks up to her, not amused. Eleanor doesn’t break. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I know what you’re thinking... That 
                        poor woman.
                                 JERRY
                        I warned you about this. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I hope you’re not suggesting I 
                        wrote that because I would never 
                        compromise the integrity of the 
                        Dear Lily column in such a fashion--

                                 JERRY
                        Stop. Just stop. God help us if 
                        there’s another broad in town 
                        saying shit like this.

           He CRUMPLES THE PAGE and tosses it in the trash. It’s a clear 
           blow to her morale to see it go.

                                 JERRY
                        You begged me for Dear Lily--

                                 ELEANOR
                        I begged you for an assignment--

                                 JERRY
                        And I gave you one! The advice 
                        column! You want to run for 
                        President, best of luck to you! But 
                        if you want to work at my 
                        newspaper, you write what I tell 
                        you to write. Got it?

           Defeated, Eleanor nods in compliance.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Sorry, Jerry. Won’t happen again.

           She retreats from his office.

           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - DAY

           Eleanor sits back at her desk and looks to the STACK OF 
           ENVELOPES addressed to “DEAR LILY C/O THE DISTRICT POST.” She 
           opens the top one and reads. Her low morale sinks even lower.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Dear Lily, my husband said he’d fix 
                        the dishwasher but... Dear Lily, my 
                        mother thinks my kids misbehave... 
                        Dear Lily...

           She tears out her current article and inserts a BLANK PAGE. 
           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - LATER

           Eleanor TYPES away. She finally takes a break and stretches 
           her hands. As she does, she catches sight of her watch...

                                 ELEANOR
                        Oh no... No, no, no, no...

           She quickly gathers her things and leaves.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           The FINAL BELL RINGS as EMPTY BUSES outside drive away in a 
           single file line.

           Eleanor hurries up to the front door. She noticeably does not 
           have any shoes on, just her stockings.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           A door flings open and Eleanor bursts in the hallway. She 
           runs down the hall until she’s outside the right classroom. 

           She peeks through the window and sees a full class, with not 
           only CHILDREN (ages 9-10) but their DADS, seated beside them. 

           CAREER DAY is written on the blackboard, in front of which 
           stands DALE (30s), giving his spiel to the room. 

           Eleanor pulls HIGH HEELS from her purse, slips them on and 
           heads into the class...   

           INT. ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dale stops mid-sentence. Everyone’s attention shifts to 
           Eleanor. MRS. WINTERS, an older, very stern woman clearly 
           disapproves of the interruption. 

           Eleanor cuts through the class and takes a seat next to 
           Robbie, who slumps low in his chair, embarrassed by her 
           entrance. She gives him a kiss and he slumps even further. 

                                 MR. DALE
                        Anyway, when I was your age, I 
                        never could have dreamed I would 
                        one day end up the manager at the 
                        number one television retail outlet 
                        in the Nation’s Capitol--

           Eleanor whispers to Robbie.
                                 ELEANOR
                        Sorry I’m late, work was--

           Mrs. Winters CLEARS HER THROAT and glares at them both.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Mom, please...

           Dale finishes up front and the class politely applauds. Mrs. 
           Winters stands up from her desk. 

                                 MRS. WINTERS
                        Thank you, Dale. Who knew there 
                        were so many ways to sell a 
                        television? Now, since she made 
                        such an effort to join us, let’s 
                        hear from Robbie’s mother, Mrs. 
                        Coerr.

           Not the greatest introduction. Still, Eleanor heads to the 
           front of the class and smiles warmly.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Alright, good morning everyone. 
                        Thank you so much for having me. As 
                        Mrs. Winters said, I’m Robbie’s 
                        mom, Eleanor, and I am a writer at 
                        The District Post.

           A BOY’S hand shoots into the air. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        A question already. Yes, dear?

                                 BOY
                        Why is your name different than 
                        Robbie’s?

           Not a question Eleanor was prepared for. She stumbles over 
           her words as the BOY’S FATHER whispers something to his son 
           and gives Eleanor an apologetic look. 

           Robbie puts his head on his desk. This is terrible.

           Eleanor sees Robbie and falters further. But for his sake, 
           she digs deep and pulls out her most convincing smile...

                                 ELEANOR
                        Do you guys know that there are 
                        caves in Europe that are over forty 
                        thousand years old? Explorers 
                        discovered them, went inside and do 
                        you know what they found? 
           The children are immediately interested. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Drawings. Painted onto the walls of 
                        the caves there are pictures of 
                        animals and ancient people and all 
                        kinds of things. Now, why would 
                        these ancient people do that? What 
                        would they do with those drawings? 

           Robbie lifts his head off his desk. He looks around and sees 
           the interest of his classmates. Even he wants to know. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Tell stories.

           Eleanor starts to move around the room. The kids’ eyes follow 
           her along, as do the dads’.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You see, as long as there have been 
                        people, there have been stories. 
                        From those caves to Ancient Greece 
                        to Shakespeare to your parents at 
                        bedtime. It is mankind’s greatest 
                        tradition. We use them to teach, to 
                        entertain, to comfort... A good 
                        story is a very powerful thing.

           Eleanor looks to Robbie, who finally smiles. She’s done it.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Now, as a journalist, my job is to 
                        tell true stories about what’s 
                        happening in the world around us--

           Suddenly AN ALARM SOUNDS. There’s PANIC in the classroom. 

                                 MRS. WINTERS
                        Duck and cover, children. Duck and 
                        cover! Just like we practiced! Just 
                        like Bert the Turtle!

           The kids GET UNDER THEIR DESKS and brace themselves in the 
           FETAL POSITION. The dads help out and crouch next to them. 

           Eleanor freezes. She looks on the wall at the BERT THE TURTLE 
           CARTOON: a friendly turtle who sees a bright light then hides 
           in his shell. Big words say DUCK AND COVER over him.

                                 MRS. WINTERS
                        Very good! We arranged this drill 
                        to show your daddies what we do in 
                        the event of an atomic bomb.
           Even Mrs. Winters takes shelter under her desk now.

                                 MRS. WINTERS
                        But remember, in a real attack, 
                        there may not be an alarm to warn 
                        us, so if you ever see a bright 
                        flash of light fill up the sky, 
                        what do you do?

                                 CLASSROOM
                        Duck and cover!

           Eleanor, the only one left standing, locks eyes with her son 
           as he cowers under his desk... 

           INT. COERR HOME - DAY

           Eleanor sits at her typewriter, still reeling from the events 
           of the day and unable to write anything.

           A KNOCK at the door startles her. She walks to the front door 
           and opens it to see THE MAILMAN.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Eleanor Hicks?

           No one has called her that in a while.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Formerly, yes. 

                                 MAILMAN
                        Apologies this didn’t arrive 
                        sooner. We had a heck of a time 
                        tracking you down. 

           He hands her a LETTER and leaves. 

           Brown envelope, wrapped in twine, addressed to Eleanor Hicks 
           with JAPANESE STAMPS all over it. Eleanor knows immediately.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Mieko...

           She opens it and pulls out a FLYER with a PHOTOGRAPH of 
           twelve-year-old Japanese girl, dressed in a formal kimono:

           This is SADAKO SASAKI. 

           She then notices something else in the envelope--

           AN ORIGAMI PAPER CRANE.
           Flattened during its journey to America, Eleanor leans in to 
           the bird and blows into it, puffing it back to life. 

           She looks back to Sadako’s picture and begins to read...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE, 1954 - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           A SLIVER OF SUNLIGHT cuts through closed shutters in the 
           cramped attic of the SASAKI’S REBUILT HOME. 

           SADAKO SASAKI (now 12) lies awake on her bed mat, staring up 
           at the damp wood on the ceiling. 

           DATE: 1954

           She looks to see her brothers, MASAHIRO (14) and EIJI (9), 
           and her sister MITSUE (6). They are all still asleep.

           Sadako sneaks to the window and opens the sliding shutters...

           HIROSHIMA IS BEING REBUILT, but there is still a long way to 
           go. The Exhibition Hall, now known as the Genbaku (Atomic 
           Bomb) Dome, still stands, a skeleton of a landmark and proud 
           reminder of what the city has survived. 

           While Sadako warms herself in the morning sun. Masahiro is 
           awakened by the light spilling into the room.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Sadako! It’s too early. 

                                 SADAKO
                        I can’t sleep any longer. I’m too 
                        excited about my race.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Well the rest of us are more 
                        excited about sleeping! 

           He throws a pillow at her. She laughs and runs out.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY

           FUJIKO (now mid-30s) prepares breakfast over the stove. One 
           at a time, her children come into the kitchen. Masahiro, 
           Sadako, Mitsue and Eiji all routinely sit at the table.  

                                 FUJIKO
                        Is everyone ready for school today?
                                 SADAKO/MASAHIRO/MITSUE/EIJI
                        Yes, mama.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I would be more ready if Sadako had 
                        let me sleep longer.

                                 SADAKO
                        That doesn’t make sense. Being 
                        awake earlier should have given you 
                        more time to be ready.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        You don’t make sense! I’m tired.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Enough. If you two keep that up, 
                        you’re not getting any Ochazuke.

           The children perk up.

                                 SADAKO
                        Ochazuke?!

                                 FUJIKO
                        Your favorite on your big day. 

           Fujiko places a pot of sweet rice and a bowl of tea in front 
           of Sadako. Her siblings stare at the treat with envy.

                                 MITSUE
                        We all get ochazuke, right? Not 
                        just Sadako?

                                 FUJIKO
                        Ask your sister...

           Mitsue and Eiji look to Sadako with begging, puppy eyes. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Everyone but Masahiro.

           Masahiro pretends to laugh. Sadako laughs for real with her 
           siblings.

           INT. SASAKI BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Sadako and Masahiro come downstairs dressed for school and 
           walk into their father’s BARBER SHOP. It is at the front of 
           their house, which has been rebuilt with old rotting wood.

           SHIGEO (mid 30s now) is at work with a CUSTOMER in his chair. 
                                 SHIGEO
                        Good morning, my children. 

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Great news, Otou-san, Mama said I 
                        could skip school today and instead 
                        stay here with you!

                                 SHIGEO
                        Did she really?

           Masahiro nods. Sadako shakes her head. Masahiro pushes her.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Go. Both of you. You must go to 
                        school and learn everything you 
                        can. This city needs all the 
                        intelligent young people it can 
                        get. Don’t you agree, Sensei?

           The customer in the chair grumbles. Shigeo makes a face to 
           Sadako and she smiles. Masahiro trudges out of the store.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Sadako, I must work and can’t make 
                        it to the race, but I look forward 
                        to hearing all about it at dinner.

                                 SADAKO
                        Yes, Otou-san.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Remember, the results don’t matter 
                        as long as you compete with 
                        integrity and honor.

                                 SADAKO
                        Yes, Otou-san.

           She bows to her father who bows in return.

                                 SHIGEO
                        But winning is a wonderful bonus.

           Sadako laughs as she runs out.

           EXT. SASAKI HOUSE - STREET - DAY

           Sadako catches up to Masahiro. They crouch into a starting 
           position.

                                 SADAKO
                        One... Two...
           EXT. NOBORICHO PLAYING FIELDS - DAY

           THE STARTING PISTOL CRACKS! The relay race has begun. 

           TOMIKO is first to take off. Sadako stands off the track with 
           the rest of the team and their enthusiastic teacher, MR. 
           NOMURA (30s, with round spectacles).

                                 MR. NOMURA 
                        Bamboo class! Work as a team!

           Sadako looks for her family in the CROWD that has gathered.

           EXT. CROWD - CONTINUOUS

           Fujiko pushes her way through the crowd with Masahiro, Mitsue 
           and Eiji. They reach the front and Masahiro points out--

                                 MASAHIRO
                        There’s Sadako!

           EXT. PLAYING FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

           Sadako catches sight of her family in the crowd and waves. 
           She turns back to the relay race as-- 

           The second runner, HIROKO, gets in position. Tomiko completes 
           the first lap and hands off the baton...

           But Hiroko DROPS IT. 

           Sadako can’t believe it. Hiroko quickly picks up the baton 
           and races on, but they have dropped many strides behind the 
           main pack. 

           Sadako watches the baton pass to the third runner, MIYOKO.

                                 SADAKO
                        Run your heart out!

           Bamboo class is in last place. Sadako takes her position on 
           the line. She looks to the runners coming up behind her and 
           holds out her hand.

           But she starts to feel DIZZY. She closes her eyes, takes a 
           deep breath, and shakes it off, focusing back on the race.

           Sadako takes off as Miyoko slams the baton into her palm. 

           Fujiko, Masahiro, Mitsue and Eiji cheer her on. 
           SADAKO FLIES LIKE THE WIND and closes the gap on the LEADER. 
           She’s focused on the finish line, inching into the lead...

           Her DIZZINESS returns. Her breathing becomes labored. The sun 
           starts to BLIND HER. The world SPINS...

           She hears a LOW GROWL, as if an animal was there. She’s 
           afraid and runs as if she’s being chased by something...

           She runs faster, more desperate. Only ONE RUNNER left in 
           front of her. Sadako inches in front. Then FALLS BACK a 
           couple steps. It’s going right to the wire.

           SADAKO WINS!

           Fujiko and the kids jump for joy! 

           Sadako falls to her knees. She’s dizzy again. 

           BAMBOO CLASS run to Sadako and help her to her feet. Everyone 
           is so happy. Everywhere she looks, Sadako sees the smiling 
           faces of her friends and teachers. 

           INT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Sadako has changed back into her uniform and hurries outside. 
           On her way out, she pauses in front of a DISPLAY on the wall. 
           PICTURES OF CHILDREN, fourteen of them, arranged in memoriam:

           “IN MEMORY OF OUR CLASSMATES LOST TO A-BOMB DISEASE.”

                                 FUJIKO (O.S.)
                        Sadako! Come now!

           Sadako runs off to join her mother.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Sasaki family sits together in the living room. Shigeo 
           reads a newspaper. Fujiko mends a dress while Eiji sleeps 
           against her. Masahiro helps Mitsue with homework. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Otou-san, can I play my Misora 
                        Hibari record?

                                 SHIGEO
                        It’s late, Sadako...

                                 SADAKO
                        Please. Just once?
           Shigeo shares a look with Fujiko. 

                                 SHIGEO
                        Just once.

           Sadako excitedly goes to the record player and drops the 
           needle. “KANASHIKI KUCHIBUE” by Misora Hibari fills the room. 
           It’s a slow, melancholic tune. 

           Sadako sits on the floor and looks at the record sleeve. A 
           picture of MISORA HIBARI, a twelve year old movie star, on 
           the cover. Sadako idolizes the album. 

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Why must we listen to such a sad 
                        song?

                                 SADAKO
                        I think it’s beautiful.

           Sadako clutches the album to her chest, closes her eyes and 
           sways with the music. 

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako is restless and can’t sleep. Eventually she gets up 
           and tiptoes out of her room.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sadako shuffles in to find Fujiko on the final leg of 
           cleaning the kitchen.

                                 SADAKO
                        Mama?

                                 FUJIKO
                        Sadako? Why are you not asleep?

                                 SADAKO
                        I’m scared.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Of what?

           Sadako is scared to say it aloud... But does.

                                 SADAKO
                        During the race today, I felt  
                        dizzy. I almost couldn’t finish. 
                                 FUJIKO
                        You were running very hard. I’m not 
                        surprised you felt sick.

           Fujiko can see she is worried. She takes her hand.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Sadako, you’ve just had your check-
                        up and you’re fine. You do not have 
                        A-Bomb Disease. I know you are 
                        afraid of it, so am I. But that’s 
                        why we get our regular tests. To 
                        keep our fear locked away. 

           Sadako nods, reassured. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        Now off to bed with you. You must 
                        get some sleep if tomorrow is ever 
                        going to come. 

           Sadako smiles and leaves. Once Fujiko is alone, her strong 
           face falters. It is a terrifying thought.

           EXT. NOBORICHI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           A FEW MONTHS HAVE PASSED. Snow blankets the track and field.

           INT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Sadako sits in class. Tomiko leans over.

                                 TOMIKO
                        Guess what. Nasu likes you. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Be quiet. 

                                 TOMIKO
                        It’s true. Chizuko overheard his 
                        friends saying so.

           Sadako looks to CHIZUKO (12) a bigger girl, who nods gravely. 
           She then looks to NASU (12), the “cool boy” in class. Their 
           eyes briefly meet then they both look away. She smiles. 

           Mr. Nomura steps to the front of the class.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Good morning, Bamboo class. Who can 
                        tell me what day it is today?
           Tomiko shoots her hand up, excited at an easy question.

                                 TOMIKO
                        February, 19th, Sensei.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Thank you, Tomiko, but I was hoping 
                        for more than just the date.

           Disappointed, she quiets down. There is no further answer.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Today is the birthday of Toge 
                        Sankichi. Like all of us, he was 
                        Hibakusha.  

           The word unsettles the children.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        But Sankichi took his pain and 
                        anger and put it into poetry. He 
                        died two years ago from A-Bomb 
                        disease, but left us with a 
                        wonderful gift in his words. 

           Nomura holds up a copy of the book, GENBAKU SHISHU, “Poems of 
           the Atomic Bomb.” 

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Who would like to read one of 
                        Sankichi’s poems for the class?

           Sadako looks across the class again at Nasu. She wants to be 
           noticed and knows a way. She raises her hand.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Thank you, Sadako. 

           As she stands at the front of the class, Nomura opens the 
           book and hands it to her. She looks out over her classmates. 
           They’re all watching her. Especially Nasu. With great pride 
           and a strong voice, she begins to read.

                                 SADAKO
                        Give back my father,             
                        Give back my mother...
                        Give grandpa back, grandma back;
                        Give our sons and daughters back.

           It’s an emotional poem and one Sadako doesn’t completely yet 
           understand. As she reads, her voice falters. 
                                 SADAKO
                        Give me back myself.
                        Give back the human race.
                        As long as this life lasts,     
                        Give peace back to us,
                        Peace that will never end.

           Mr. Nomura APPLAUDS her reading. The rest of the class joins 
           in the APPLAUSE. Sadako bows and hurries back to her seat. 

           EXT. SADAKO’S HOUSE - STREET - DAY

           Sadako and Masahiro, still in their school uniform, run out 
           of their house and dart down the narrow street. They turn a 
           corner and head along the RIVER.  

           EXT. STEPS OVERLOOKING HIROSHIMA - SHRINE - DAY

           Sadako races up steps, which lead to a large TORI GATE AND 
           SHRINE. Masahiro struggles to keep up. Sadako reaches the 
           gate and jumps victoriously into the air, delighted. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Sadako wins again! 

           Masahiro slows to a walk, and joins her, defeated.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        My leg cramped. That’s why you won.

                                 SADAKO
                        Your leg has been cramping a lot, 
                        Masahiro. I hope it’s not serious.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Careful, Sadako, I can still beat 
                        you up.

                                 SADAKO
                        You’ll have to catch me first.

           Sadako laughs and runs away to the SHRINE. Masahiro chases. 
           She is quickly far in front of him and rounds a corner. 

           She FREEZES at the sight of something in her path...

           A WOLF. Big, grey, majestic.

           Sadako is scared. The breath leaves her body. Her knees grow 
           weak. Her vision blurs. The world spins. SHE FALLS. 

           Masahiro catches up, alarmed to find his sister keeled over.  
                                 MASAHIRO
                        Sadako!

                                 SADAKO
                        Did you see that?

                                 MASAHIRO
                        See what?

                                 SADAKO
                        Honshu wolf. 

           Masahiro looks, but there’s nothing there. His alarm grows. 

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           DR. HATAGAWA (50s) finishes a series of tests. He looks 
           behind her ears. The area is RED and SWOLLEN. 

           Sadako winces when his finger touches her. He struggles to 
           give her a smile then stands. With a look to Shigeo, he walks 
           to the kitchen. Fujiko takes Sadako’s hand.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Don’t worry. The doctor will help. 
                        How about we listen to your record?

           Sadako nods. Fujiko stands and puts on the record. MISORA 
           HIBARI’S VOICE calls out from the speaker. The record drowns 
           out the voices from the other room. 

           Fujiko closes the partition. Sadako is suddenly very alone. 

           EXT. SADAKO’S HOUSE - STREET - DAWN

           The street is quiet. Fujiko and Shigeo help Sadako outside. 
           Masahiro watches from the doorway as they leave hand in hand. 

           EXT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL, HIROSHIMA - DAY

           Fujiko and Shigeo lead Sadako into the RED CROSS HOSPITAL.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR/EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Sadako and her parents are led through the hospital by DR. 
           NUMATA (50s) and NURSE SATOMI (20s). 

           As they pass open doors, Sadako catches glimpses of PATIENTS. 
           So many of them, some with horrible scars. Her grasp tightens 
           around her mother’s hand. They arrive at the EMERGENCY ROOM.
                                 DR. NUMATA
                        This will be Sadako’s room.

           It’s about as cold and frightening as a room could be.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Doctor, this is the emergency room.

                                 DR. NUMATA
                        Unfortunately, we don’t have any 
                        other available rooms. And we must 
                        begin treatment immediately.

           Fujiko steps in the room, putting on a brave face. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        It’s only temporary. Sadako will 
                        get better and we will be out of 
                        here soon. Thank you, doctor.

           Dr. Numata bows and walks away, followed by Nurse Satomi.  

           Sadako looks at the bed but won’t go near it. Shigeo sits on 
           it while Fujiko begins to unpack Sadako’s belongings.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Sit, Sadako. Get off your feet. 
                        Make yourself comfortable.

           Sadako refuses. She grabs her belongings from her mother, 
           shoving them back in the bag.

                                 SADAKO
                        I don’t want to be comfortable 
                        here. I will not be here long. I’m 
                        going to get better and I’m going 
                        to go home, right? I will go back 
                        to school?

           She looks to her parents who say the only thing they can...

                                 FUJIKO
                        Of course, Sadako.

                                 SHIGEO
                        If you are strong and do as the 
                        doctors say, you will get back to 
                        school in no time. Can you do that?

           Still hesitant, Sadako walks over to the bed and sits down. 
           Her mother strokes her hair while Shigeo steps forward with a 
           GLASS OF WATER and PILLS, WRAPPED IN A SMALL PAPER POUCH.

           Sadako stares at the pills. She shakes her head.
                                 SHIGEO
                        You must, Sadako. 

           Fujiko can see she is scared and gets an idea. She takes the 
           paper pouch, tips the pills out and sets them aside. She 
           begins to FOLD THE PAPER, very carefully.  

                                 FUJIKO
                        Your grandmother always said that a 
                        paper crane was good luck. 
                        Senbazuru she would say. Fold a 
                        thousand cranes and make a wish... 
                        When you were a baby, I would fold 
                        one every night and hang it over 
                        your crib. I made a wish that you 
                        would be safe, happy and live a 
                        thousand years, just like the crane 
                        himself. The day you survived 
                        Pikadon, I couldn’t help but wonder 
                        if the crane was watching over you.

           Fujiko reaches the last step and blows into the breast of her 
           paper crane, expanding its wings. She hands it to Sadako. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        Make a wish. I think the Crane 
                        might have a special ear just for 
                        you, Sadako. 

           Sadako takes the PAPER CRANE from her mother. She feels as if 
           anything might be possible. She closes her eyes and whispers:

                                 SADAKO
                        I wish to get better.

           She opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. Fujiko offers 
           her the pills and Sadako takes them. Her focus turns back to 
           the paper crane in her hand. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Nine hundred and ninety-nine to go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COERR HOME - ATTIC - NIGHT

           A LIGHT GOES ON above Eleanor in a tight, dusty attic. BOXES 
           line the walls, another life’s worth of stuff stashed away. 

           She searches through it all until she finds A BOX MARKED WITH 
           JAPANESE CALLIGRAPHY. With a bittersweet smile, she opens the 
           box and searches through mementos from her time in Japan...
           DRAWINGS. A TRAIN TICKET. A well-worn, dog-eared copy of the 
           NEW YORKER with John Hersey’s HIROSHIMA on the cover. 

           Then below that she sees what she came for:

           Lastly, at the bottom is a thick, well-worn journal with 
           “THINK JAPANESE” by ELEANOR HICKS scrawled on the outside. 

           She flips through PAGES AND PAGES of her old writing...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. FRIGATE - NIGHT

           HUGE WAVES crash against a FRIGATE called “WAR HAWK”. The 
           ship inches closer to CAPSIZING with each violent collision.

           DATE: 1946

           INT. FRIGATE - CABIN - NIGHT

           ELEANOR HICKS (mid 20s now but feels even younger) smiles 
           while she WRITES IN HER JOURNAL. Dressed too fashionably for 
           the moment, she pulls up the bottom of her skirt to keep it 
           from the LARGE POOLS OF WATER sloshing around her HIGH HEELS.

           With her in the tight bunk room are THREE MALE MISSIONARIES, 
           in their Sunday best with BIBLES clutched to their chest. 

           FRANCIS prays to himself. WALTER wipes tears from his cheeks. 
           DOMINIC, on the edge of a breakdown, screams at a LARGE JOLT. 
           He then looks to Eleanor, happily scribbling away...

                                 DOMINIC
                        Mrs. Hicks, I’ve got to ask, what 
                        the hell are you smiling about?!

           If impending death can’t wash the smile from her face, 
           Dominic’s harsh tone definitely doesn’t faze her. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Listen: “As the men of God around 
                        me called out to their maker, I 
                        realized He was in fact calling 
                        back. He was the typhoon battering 
                        our hull. He was the infinite 
                        Pacific. He was the brutal, 
                        beautiful force of nature from 
                        which we were helpless. And He was 
                        calling us home.”
           She looks up from the notebook to see stunned faces.

                                 ELEANOR
                        What do you think? Too much?

                                 DOMINIC
                        I think you’re a looney.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Dom--

                                 DOMINIC
                        She is! If not for God or country, 
                        why would a woman even be on this 
                        ship, traveling into a war-zone, by 
                        herself? Because she’s a damned 
                        lunatic! You heard her, Francis, 
                        she wants to die!

                                 ELEANOR
                        Of course I don’t want to die, I 
                        would much rather go on living. But 
                        if I have to die, I’d like it to at 
                        least make for good reading.

           Eleanor grabs an empty wine bottle, rips out the page from 
           her note book and begins to roll it up. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        And while I may be crazy, in what 
                        could be my final moments on this 
                        Earth, I’m smiling and you’re not. 
                        So, no offense, but I think I’ll 
                        stay the way God made me.  

           Dom has no response. Walter, the silent missionary, has 
           stopped crying. For the first time, he speaks.

                                 WALTER
                        Amen.

           ANOTHER VICIOUS IMPACT shakes them up. 

           Eleanor puts the rolled up story in the bottle and corks it. 
           Nervously, she taps her WEDDING RING on the glass.

                                 DOMINIC
                        You must be an absolute nightmare 
                        for your husband.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Finally, something we agree on.
           EXT. FRIGATE / YOKOHAMA HARBOR - JAPAN - DAY

           The skies are clear as the SHIP safely pulls into the PORT OF 
           YOKOHAMA. From the deck, Eleanor stares in awe as the CITY OF 
           TOKYO, devastated from the war, grows before her eyes. 

           EXT. YOKOHAMA HARBOR - DAY

           Eleanor walks down the ramp of the ship, her legs unsteady 
           from the long voyage. As soon as her feet touch the ground, 
           she kneels down and touches it... She’s actually in Japan.  

           She looks up to see a group of WORKERS glaring at her. 
           Eleanor picks up her luggage and shrugs off their gaze.

           INT. HALLWAY - U.S. BASE - DAY

           MAJOR ROBERT HICKS, late 30s, handsome in an old-fashioned, 
           proud member of “The Greatest Generation” way, walks down the 
           hallway to his office, enjoying his morning cup of coffee.

           A PRIVATE salutes him as he passes. Hicks gives him a nod and 
           they carry on. Hicks reaches a corner and rounds it to see... 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Hi honey.

           The coffee cup falls from his hand and SHATTERS.

           INT. MAJOR HICKS OFFICE - U.S. BASE - DAY

           Hicks hurries Eleanor into his office and closes the door 
           behind them. He forces a smile to his ASSISTANT as he pulls 
           down the SHADE and turns to Eleanor. All smiles are now gone.

                                 HICKS
                        Eleanor, what the hell are you 
                        doing in God Damn Japan?!

                                 ELEANOR 
                        I’m on assignment writing about 
                        life after the war.

                                 HICKS
                        Assignment for whom?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Well, freelance at the moment but 
                        there’s no doubt in my mind someone 
                        will snatch it up when I’m done.
                                 HICKS
                        How did you even get here? We cut 
                        off all civilian transport.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You cut off all American civilian 
                        transport. But you, Major, married 
                        a card-carrying Canuck and there’s 
                        no rules against a Canadian 
                        hitching a ride on a Dutch frigate 
                        with some Christian missionaries.

           He has to sit down. Everything she says angers him further.

                                 ELEANOR
                        After months apart, I thought you 
                        would be happy to see me!

                                 HICKS
                        I am happy to see you, Dear...

           Eleanor is almost relieved...

                                 HICKS
                        But you’re still getting on the 
                        next transport back to the States, 
                        or Canada, or Greenland for all I 
                        care. Anywhere but Japan.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robert, please--

                                 HICKS
                        No, Eleanor! I don’t know what you 
                        thought was going to happen here! 
                        It’s against the rules for you to 
                        stay on the base and there’s not a 
                        chance in hell I could allow a 
                        western woman, especially one I’m 
                        married to, to wander the streets 
                        of Tokyo by her damn self!

                                 ELEANOR
                        That’s fine! I didn’t come to 
                        report on Tokyo. 

                                 HICKS
                        Then where do you want to go?

           She tentatively reaches into her bag and pulls out a well-
           worn copy of the NEW YORKER MAGAZINE with the article 
           HIROSHIMA by John Hersey on the cover. 

           Hicks’ expression becomes even more stern.
                                 HICKS
                        Out of the question.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Why?

                                 HICKS
                        Those people are defeated, Eleanor. 
                        They are in a constant battle to 
                        reclaim some small fraction of the 
                        life they had and they should be 
                        allowed to do so without you mining 
                        their lives for entertainment.

           The accusation pisses her off to no end. He knows it.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Don’t trivialize my intentions. You 
                        know me better than that. This 
                        article is the only account of the 
                        aftermath of the bomb, but when it 
                        ends, it feels like we’re nowhere 
                        near the end of the story. How did 
                        those people recover? How did they 
                        rebuild? I sure as hell want to 
                        know. Don’t you?

           Hicks considers, briefly.

                                 HICKS
                        No. You’re going home.

           Eleanor rises to her feet to make her final plea.

                                 ELEANOR
                        They asked me to be a secretary, 
                        Robert. After writing about the war 
                        for two years, they gave my job to 
                        a veteran and asked me to be his 
                        secretary. I am a writer, dammit. 
                        And if they won’t give me the 
                        stories, I will go get them myself. 

           The husband takes over from the Major again as he listens to 
           his wife’s plea/ultimatum. Frustrated, he gives in.

                                 HICKS
                        Give me a minute.

           Hicks picks up the phone and flips through his ADDRESS BOOK.

                                 HICKS
                        I said give me a minute, Eleanor.
           Eleanor doesn’t protest any further as she steps out and 
           closes the door behind her. 

           Hicks shakes his head while he waits for an answer on the 
           line. He can’t believe he’s doing this.

           INT. RECEPTION - U.S. BASE - DAY

           Eleanor sits on a bench with all her LUGGAGE beside her. She 
           stares out the window and jots notes in her JOURNAL. Hicks 
           steps out of his office and marches up to her.

                                 HICKS
                        Thirty bucks a month gets you room 
                        and board on a farm in Yonago.

                                 ELEANOR
                        How close is that to Hiroshima? 

                                 HICKS
                        As close as I can get you. Listen 
                        to me, Eleanor. You need clearance 
                        to go there and I have to pull some 
                        serious strings for that. In the 
                        meantime, you go to the farm and 
                        wait. I’ll send word when I’ve got 
                        it all figured out. Now that’s it, 
                        final offer, best you’re gonna get.

           He braces himself for another battle, but Eleanor knows when 
           to accept a victory. Her excitement can’t be contained and 
           she leaps into Hicks’ arms and plants a BIG KISS on him.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank you, Major.

                                 HICKS
                        You’re welcome. You’ll be on the 
                        first train out in the morning. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        In the morning?

           He smiles suggestively and tries to help collect her things 
           but she pushes his hand away and does it herself.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I knew you’d be happy to see me.

           She leads him off down the hall.
           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Eleanor is the only Westerner on the packed train. 

           She watches with amusement as the MEN TAKE OFF THEIR PANTS, 
           wearing white long-johns underneath, and hang them, perfectly 
           creased, on a post next to the seat. 

           When the train starts to move, the PANTS ALL SWING TOGETHER. 
           It fully sets in exactly how far from America she is. 

           Outside the window, Eleanor watches as the train passes from 
           the bleakness of WAR-TORN TOKYO into the COUNTRYSIDE-- 

           EXT. TRAIN - DAY

           The train passes rice fields, misty valleys, red temples 
           decorated with dragons, and clusters of thatch-roofed houses. 
           MOUNT FUJI towers in the distance. It’s beautiful. 

           EXT. YONAGO TRAIN STATION - DAY

           The train rolls to a stop at a very RURAL TRAIN PLATFORM and 
           Eleanor emerges amongst a crowd of LOCALS. For the first time 
           she feels uncertain and out of her depth.

           YOSHI MATSUDA, (40), a Japanese man, well-dressed in a suit 
           and hat, approaches her. He speaks very proper English.

                                 MATSUDA
                        Mrs. Hicks?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes!

                                 MATSUDA
                        I am Matsuda. The Major sent me to 
                        escort you. Right this way.

           Matsuda leads her to TWO BICYCLES, one fitted with a TRAILER 
           behind it. Eleanor drops her bags on the trailer.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Bicycles! How wonderful.

           Eleanor kicks off her high heels and picks them up.

                                 MATSUDA
                        Oh good. I was afraid you wouldn’t 
                        know how to ride.
           EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           She doesn’t. Eleanor wobbles and weaves across the road on 
           her bicycle, dress hiked up in a bunch, trying to keep up. 

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM - DUSK

           The sun sets as Matsuda leads Eleanor down a long, bumpy 
           road, RICE FIELDS on both sides. They pass through a GATE 
           breaking up a HIGH WALL and arrive at the FARMHOUSE. 

           Out of breath, Eleanor dismounts the bicycle as the IWAMOTO 
           family emerge from the house to greet her. 

           KATASHI (30), a serious man, stands in front. MIEKO, (mid-
           twenties), his wife, trails behind him, dressed in a simple 
           black shift. Their small boy, NORI, hides behind her legs.

           Matsuda greets the family in a RAPID STRING OF JAPANESE. 
           Eleanor tries to pick out the few words she knows, but it’s 
           pointless. She hears her name and figures she should smile.

                                 MATSUDA
                        Eleanor, this is the Iwamoto 
                        family. Katashi is head of the 
                        household and runs the farm.

           Eleanor bows. She attempts her best Japanese. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank you, Sensei. With honor I 
                        feel to meet your house. 

           Katashi raises an eyebrow. Matsuda gives him a look that 
           says, “just go with it.” Katashi bows.

                                 MATSUDA
                        His wife, Mieko, and their son, 
                        Nori. No need to say anything.

           Eleanor exchanges bows with Mieko then with the little boy, 
           who gives her a little bow which delights her.

                                 MATSUDA (CONT’D)
                        Very good.

           Matsuda takes the bicycle Eleanor rode and fastens it to the 
           trailer behind his own bike.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Wait, can’t I keep the bike? 
                                 MATSUDA
                        I apologize, but I must take it 
                        back with me.

           Eleanor looks around, realizing how isolated she now is. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        So I’m trapped here?

           She helplessly watches Matsuda ride away, then turns back to 
           the family, who stand awkwardly in silence. 

           EXT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mieko opens the door for father and son to enter. They take 
           off their shoes and put on SLIPPERS that wait by the door. 
           Eleanor is about to enter but Mieko stops her. She points to 
           another pair of SLIPPERS set out just for Eleanor.

           Eleanor points to the slippers then to herself. Mieko nods. 
           Eleanor excitedly replaces her heels with the slippers.

           INT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mieko leads Eleanor through the house. There’s very little 
           furniture inside so rooms all look similar. 

           At the back of the house, they arrive at a small room with a 
           futon mattress on the floor, a BLANKET on top and a mosquito 
           net hung from the ceiling. Other than that the room is bare. 

           Mieko stops at the entrance and bows before leaving her 
           alone. Eleanor sets down her bag and looks around at the 
           sparse room. Her unflappable smile loses some of its muster.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You did it, Eleanor. You’re in 
                        Japan. What the hell do you do now?

           INT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - ELEANOR’S ROOM - NIGHT

           ELEANOR’S LUGGAGE crowds the little room. The only light 
           comes from a candle on the floor.

           She writes from her bed pad, back against the wall. She 
           struggles to get comfortable when something makes her pause-- 

           THE MOSQUITO NET ABOVE HER IS MOVING. Eleanor’s confused for 
           a moment then she begins to feel it all around her: 

           THE ROOM IS SHAKING. 
           She panics. THE SHAKING GROWS AND BECOMES MORE VIOLENT. 

           The candle by the bed TIPS OVER AND IS PUT OUT. 

           Eleanor SCREAMS and runs into the main room. THE WHOLE HOUSE 
           SHAKES for several seconds then suddenly stops. 

           Mieko runs out of her room to calm Eleanor.

                                 MIEKO
                        Jishin.

           Mieko nods and MIMES SHAKING A BALL IN HER HANDS.

                                 MIEKO
                        Jishin.

                                 ELEANOR
                             (understanding)
                        Of course. It was an earthquake. 
                        Jishin is an earthquake.

           Mieko listens curiously then very carefully repeats--

                                 MIEKO
                        Earthquake?

           Eleanor smiles. She does the same ball shake motion.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes. Earthquake.

           Mieko, happy to have learned a new word, bows and leaves. 

           Eleanor, adrenaline still surging, goes back to her room and 
           grabs her JOURNAL. She writes by the light of the moon... 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        “Think Japanese”, chapter one. 
                        “Jishin” means earthquake. This 
                        writer can now definitively say she 
                        does not care for “jishin.”

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM - DAY

           The MORNING MIST dissipates off the RICE FIELDS as the sun 
           climbs in the sky. Eleanor walks amongst the FARMERS, lost in 
           the serene moment.
           INT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - DAY

           Eleanor sits on the floor as a traditional breakfast is 
           served. She shifts uncomfortably and rubs her numb legs. 

           EXT. YONAGO TOWN - DAY

           Eleanor is led by Mieko through the main street in the small 
           town. TOWNSPEOPLE gawk at Eleanor constantly. She remains 
           polite and smiles often, but they continue to stare behind 
           her back and look away when she tries to make eye contact.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        People in town are not sure what to 
                        make of my arrival. They think I am 
                        some sort of spy or criminal.

           Eleanor stops outside a store window, admiring the paintings 
           and calligraphy on display. In the reflection she notices a 
           GROUP OF WOMEN behind her, all dressed in beautiful kimonos. 

           INT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - ELEANOR’S ROOM - DAY

           Huddled in Eleanor’s room, Mieko and Eleanor sit on the bed. 
           Mieko looks over her shoulder to make sure they’re alone. 

           Eleanor reaches under her folded blanket and pulls out a 
           SEARS-ROEBUCK CATALOG. Mieko scans the pages in awe. 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        While the language barrier is a 
                        hurdle, it only took a few weeks 
                        for Mieko and I to become fast 
                        friends. It’s funny, for all the 
                        ways we’re opposites to each other, 
                        we’re the same in just as many. 

                                 KATASHI (O.S.)
                        Mieko-san!

           Mieko closes the catalog and buries it in the blanket again. 

           EXT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - DAY

           Eleanor is in the BATH, located behind the house. She dunks 
           her head under water then stands. A TOWEL has been set out 
           for her, but it is THE SIZE OF A HANDKERCHIEF. She frowns.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        After a while, even the local women 
                        came around to me.
           Eleanor looks out to see A GROUP OF WOMEN, led by Mieko, 
           staring at her with absolutely no shame. They watch as she 
           tries to dry off and cover herself with the small towel. 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Their fear of me is gone and they 
                        realize we are in fact the same.

           Mieko speaks to the other women in rapid Japanese while she 
           points at Eleanor, who uncomfortably smiles back.

           INT. HICKS’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           Hicks laughs out loud as he reads Eleanor’s writing. His 
           Secretary glances over at him and he quickly stifles his 
           laughter. He reads on, enraptured.

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM - DAY

           Eleanor has gathered the Iwamoto family on the porch. She 
           films them with her 16mm camera. 

           The family think it’s a ‘stills camera’ and remain still.

                                 ELEANOR
                        No, no... It’s a moving picture 
                        camera. You can move! 

           Eleanor moves about, flailing her arms up and down. Katashi 
           and Mieko don’t understand and remain still.

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM / YONGO TOWN - DAY

           A 16mm MONTAGE OF LIFE ON THE FARM AS ELEANOR:

           - STUDIES AND PRACTICES JAPANESE

           - LEARNS CALLIGRAPHY

           - HELPS ON THE RICE FIELDS

           - INTERVIEWS WORKERS IN THE TOWN

           - HAS HER PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN A KIMONO 

           EXT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - DAY

           Eleanor sweeps the patio along with Mieko. They look up to 
           see Mr. Matsuda riding his bicycle down the driveway. He has 
           Eleanor’s bike on the trailer.
           She looks back to Mieko, who knows what this means.

                                 MIEKO
                        Do not go, Eleanor-san. It is a 
                        shameful place. There is nothing in 
                        Hiroshima but death. Hiroshima is 
                        not Japan. This is Japan. All you 
                        need to see is here.

           Mieko walks inside just as Matsuda arrives at the patio and 
           pulls out an envelope. 

                                 MR. MATSUDA
                        Your request has been granted.

           After waiting all this time, Eleanor suddenly seems anxious, 
           afraid even...

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Eleanor sits in the back of a truck filled with LABORERS and 
           SUPPLIES. People and objects are jostled around with the 
           large bumps in the road. A sense of uneasiness grows in her.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA - DAY

           The truck enters into HIROSHIMA. Eleanor looks all around 
           her, shocked at what she sees:

           The RADIUS OF DAMAGE is still very clear as the landscape 
           changes from destroyed, CONCRETE DESERT to barely standing, 
           FRACTURED BUILDINGS on the outskirts of town.

           Eleanor steps off the truck onto a RAVAGED STREET. Everywhere 
           she looks there’s TWISTED STEEL and SHATTERED CONCRETE. 

           Eleanor stops by some steps that once led up to a building: 

           A CHARRED IMPRINT OF A MAN’S FIGURE IS STAINED ON THE STEPS.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        They refer to it as “Pika-don,” 
                        which simply means “Flash. Boom.” 

           There is no escaping the horror. Eleanor begins to walk 
           towards the only building left standing in the whole city...

           THE GENBAKU DOME. Just as Sadako saw it that horrible day, 
           reduced to nothing more than metal frame and crumbled stone.
           EXT. GENBAKU DOME - DAY

           RELICS of the bomb are littered around the dome.

           A PAIR OF WARPED GLASSES. A TWISTED, DEFORMED TRICYCLE. 

           CROWDS OF PEOPLE, many marked with HORRIBLE SCARS and BURNS. 

           A MAN has an 8MM PROJECTOR set up, projecting onto a SHEET. 
           It shows SILENT NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH. 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        “Hibakusha” is what they call them. 
                        Explosion-effected people. Tens of 
                        thousands sick with what is called 
                        “A-Bomb disease.”

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - DAY

           Eleanor interviews a WOMAN WITH BURNS ON HER FACE.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        We know it as leukemia. 

           SEVERAL OTHER PATIENTS pass by Eleanor in the hallway. 
           There’s so many. It overwhelms her.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        I asked one man where he was when 
                        the bomb fell. He pointed to the 
                        misery all around him and said “the 
                        bomb is still falling.”

           EXT. OTA RIVER - DOME - NIGHT

           Eleanor watches a FAMILY carrying a PAPER LANTERN to the OTA 
           RIVER. They set the lantern in the river and hold each other.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        They light lanterns with the names 
                        of loved ones who died here. The 
                        candle light is supposed to help 
                        the spirits find their way home. 

           Eleanor breaks down into tears as she watches the WARM GLOW 
           float off into the horizon... 

           EXT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - MORNING

           The SUN has just begun to peek over the horizon. 
           Eleanor hurries out of the house and runs over to the bushes 
           on the outskirts of the garden. She THROWS UP and falls to 
           her knees. Her breath falls short. 

           EXT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - LATER

           A LOCAL DOCTOR performs a number of tests on Eleanor while 
           she lays on her back; he listens to her chest as she breaths, 
           takes her temperature and feels around her neck and the back 
           of her ears... 

           The man’s expression is completely stoic while Eleanor’s 
           anxiety increases with each test.

           When he’s done, he turns to Mieko and speaks in JAPANESE. 
           Mieko turns to Eleanor in shock. 

           Eleanor picks up all she needs to hear. She can’t believe it. 
           A wave of uncertain, complicated emotion crashes down on her.

           INT. HALLWAY - U.S. BASE - DAY

           Coffee mug in hand, Hicks makes his way to his office. The 
           same Private salutes him and he gives him the same nod. He 
           reaches the corner and... 

           Eleanor is there. Again. The coffee cup falls from his hand 
           and SHATTERS again.

                                 HICKS
                        Godammit, Eleanor! Stop doing that!

           He looks at her and immediately can tell something’s wrong. 
           She takes a moment to get the words out but finally does...

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m pregnant.

           Hicks takes a second to process then rushes to her and wraps 
           her in his arms, a big smile on his face. She holds on to him 
           tightly, retreating into the comfort of his embrace...

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM - DAY

           A U.S. ARMY JEEP rolls down the dusty road to the Farmhouse. 

           Mieko steps out of the house just in time to see Hicks hop 
           out and walks around to the passenger door. He opens it...

           Eleanor gets outs, FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT. She smiles to Mieko.
                                 ELEANOR
                        I couldn’t leave without saying 
                        goodbye.

           Mieko hurries up to them, beyond excited. She bows to Hicks 
           and then reaches her hands out to touch Eleanor’s bump.

                                 MIEKO
                        May I?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Of course. Please.

           Mieko lovingly places her hands on Eleanor’s stomach.

                                 MIEKO
                        Have you picked a name?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robert Hicks, Jr. Robbie.

           Hicks puts his arm around Eleanor and beams with pride. Mieko 
           smiles and whispers to the unborn baby...

                                 MIEKO
                        Hello Robbie-san...

           She then begins to SING A JAPANESE LULLABY. 

           When it’s over, Eleanor wraps Mieko in a hug. It’s a sad 
           embrace between close friends who don’t know when, or if, 
           they’ll ever see each other again.

                                 MIEKO
                        I have a gift for you...

           She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a FOLDED PIECE OF 
           ORIGAMI. She lifts the paper to her lips and BLOWS into it, 
           bringing a PAPER CRANE to life. She holds it out to Eleanor.

                                 MIEKO
                        May it bring you luck.

           INT. JEEP - MOMENTS LATER

           Eleanor looks back and watches Mieko and the farm grow small 
           and disappear into the dust kicked up behind her. Hicks, 
           behind the wheel, gives her a sympathetic smile. She forces 
           one back. 

           On her lap is her journal, open to a BLANK PAGE. She stares 
           down, intimidated and unsure of what to write.
                                 HICKS
                        When are you going to let me read 
                        the rest of your story?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Nothing to read really...

           She does her best to disguise her disappointment.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I don’t think I was the right 
                        person for the job.

           With that, she closes her journal and tucks it away. Hicks 
           reaches over and places his hand on the baby bump.

                                 HICKS
                        Me and the Captain here, we believe 
                        in you, Eleanor. Remember that.

           Eleanor smiles, takes hold of his hand and grips it tight.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Fujiko takes hold of Sadako’s hand and offers a brave smile. 
           Sadako smiles back then looks away as... 

           Nurse Satomi pokes an IV NEEDLE in her arm. 

           This begins a MONTAGE of tests and treatments; PILLS, 
           INJECTIONS, BLOOD DRAWN, MORE PILLS, BIGGER INJECTIONS. 

           The whole time the number of PAPER CRANES scattered around 
           Sadako’s bed grows and grows.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Sadako reads a YOUNG GIRLS’ MANGA MAGAZINE with an IV hooked 
           up to her arm. Her eyes wander next to her and she covertly 
           watches Nurse Satomi read a book. She’s a beautiful woman.  

           Nurse Satomi places her hand over her chest, intrigued by 
           something she just read. Sadako mimics the affectation. 

           Nurse Satomi puts down the book and checks on Sadako’s IV.

                                 SADAKO
                        May I ask what you were reading?
                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        Gan by Mori Ogai.

                                 SADAKO
                        What is it about?

                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        A young woman who is forced to 
                        become a moneylender’s mistress. 

           Sadako is shocked.

                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        Forgive me. I should not be 
                        speaking about such things to you.

                                 SADAKO
                        No, I would like to read Gan. Will 
                        you let me?

                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        I don’t know. It’s for grown ups. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Please. I graduate elementary 
                        school in just a few days and I 
                        will be a junior high student. I am 
                        ready to read a novel like Gan. 

           Nurse Satomi considers and smiles. She checks on the IV and 
           then exits the room, leaving the book on the table. 

                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        If anyone asks, I’m saying you 
                        stole it from me.

           Sadako drops her magazine and picks up Gan.  

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - DAY

           Sadako walks with Tomiko down the halls of the hospital. 
           Tomiko is timid and scared to be there, but Sadako is 
           cheerful and does her best to make her friend comfortable. 

                                 TOMIKO
                        Graduation is next week, Sadako. 
                        You have to come.

                                 SADAKO
                        I want to more than anything in the 
                        world, but father says I need the 
                        doctor’s permission.
                                 TOMIKO
                        Chizuko said that Kiyo said that 
                        Nasu said that our Bamboo class is 
                        so boring without you.

                                 SADAKO
                        Did he really?

           Tomiko nods. Sadako is now even more determined. 

                                 SADAKO
                        I will be there.

           As they pass other patients in the hallway, everyone says 
           hello to Sadako and bows. She bows in return.

                                 TOMIKO
                        How do you do it?

                                 SADAKO
                        What?

                                 TOMIKO
                        Get so popular. It’s just like at 
                        school in this hospital. You’ve 
                        only been here a month and you’re 
                        practically the mayor!

           Sadako can’t help but smile. 

                                 SADAKO
                        I think most people are too scared 
                        to speak to each other. But if you 
                        say the first word, everyone loves 
                        a good conversation. 

           Just then, the girls pass an OPEN ROOM: Inside is a boy, 
           KENJI (14). Both girls are awe-struck by the sight of him. 

                                 TOMIKO
                        Have you talked to him?

                                 SADAKO
                        Not yet.

           Kenji looks up. The girls scurry away, giggling as they do.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sadako sits with Fujiko in the cafeteria. She doesn’t have an 
           appetite and just watches her mother SEW A GARMENT.
                                 SADAKO
                        I must attend graduation.

                                 FUJIKO
                        I don’t know, Sadako. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Please. I want to go so badly.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Keep folding your cranes. If it is 
                        meant to happen, it will.

           Determined to make it happen, Sadako tips her pills out of 
           their wrapping and begins to fold another crane...

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Outside the emergency room, Dr. Numata speaks with Sadako’s 
           parents. Sadako listens to them intently from inside. It’s 
           unbearable. She looks to her PAPER CRANES... 

                                 DOCTOR NUMATA
                        Sadako should not be too far away 
                        from the hospital at this time.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Please, doctor, Sadako worked hard 
                        to graduate. She should celebrate 
                        with her friends.

                                 DOCTOR NUMATA
                        It is an unnecessary risk. 

                                 SHIGEO
                        We respect your decision, but feel 
                        strongly it is a risk worth taking.

           Doctor Numata doesn’t like it. Sadako can’t contain herself.

                                 SADAKO
                        Please, please, please Doctor. I 
                        feel much better today. Everyone at 
                        the hospital has done such a good 
                        job helping me! I am well enough!

           Numata cannot say no to this vibrant girl.

                                 DOCTOR NUMATA
                        Very well. But do not exert 
                        yourself. And come straight back.

           She nods joyously. He can’t help but smile.
                                 DOCTOR NUMATA
                        Congratulations on your graduation, 
                        Sadako.

           The doctor leaves and both parents look to Sadako, huge 
           smiles on their faces. Sadako literally leaps from her bed.

                                 SADAKO
                        YES!

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           Sadako enters the house to a GREAT WELCOME from Masahiro, 
           Mitsue and Eiji. She screams in delight and embraces them. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Masahiro! Up for a race later?

           Masahiro breaks off and fakes a painful leg. 

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I wish I could but I got another 
                        leg cramp. Just my luck! 

           They laugh. Fujiko emerges, holding something.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Sadako, we have something very 
                        special for you.

           Fujiko reveals a BEAUTIFUL KIMONO, hand-sewn, white and 
           filled with red cherry blossom patterns. Sadako gasps. She 
           touches the kimono. Her eyes well up with emotion.

                                 SADAKO
                        This must have cost so much money.

                                 SHIGEO
                        You are a young woman now, Sadako. 
                        Every young woman should have a 
                        kimono as beautiful as she is.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Fujiko dresses Sadako. Sadako carefully slides her arms 
           inside the WHITE JUBAN. Fujiko holds out the kimono and 
           Sadako nervously slips herself inside. 

           Fujiko knots the belts around Sadako’s waist and shifts it 
           over to the back. 
           Fujiko stands back to allow Sadako to look at her new image. 
           She can’t believe it. A young woman is looking back at her.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           Sadako lets her family get their first look at her. It’s a 
           moment that brings them together in their happiness.

                                 MITSUE
                        Wow! You look like Misora Hibari!

           A greater compliment could not be said to her. Sadako runs to 
           her father and wraps him in a hug.

                                 SADAKO
                        Thank you, father. Thank you, thank 
                        you, thank you.

           INT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Sadako stands in the center of the room. The GIRLS gather and 
           touch her kimono. Sadako is loving every moment of it. 

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Alright, it is time to give Sadako 
                        her gift.

           Sadako is caught off-guard as Mr. Nomura approaches her with 
           a WRAPPED PRESENT. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Thank you, sensei.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        It’s not just from me.

           She opens the box and finds inside a RED JOURNAL. She lifts 
           up the journal and opens to the first page: IT IS SIGNED BY 
           ALL OF HER CLASS MATES. She loves it. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Thank you, everyone. I will keep it 
                        with me every moment of every day.

           EXT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -  DAY

           A stage has been erected on the field. Students and parents 
           line up for the ceremony.  

           Fujiko, Shigeo, Masahiro, Mitsue and Eiji sit with a CROWD OF 
           FAMILIES and watch proudly. 
           Sadako sits with Tomiko, thrilled as GRADUATION CERTIFICATES 
           are handed out on stage by Mr. Nomura. With each student 
           awarded, the crowd of parents applaud. Mr. Nomura lifts a 
           certificate and speaks in the microphone.

                                 MR NOMURA
                        Sadako Sasaki, Bamboo class.

           Sadako rises to get up on stage. The crowd rises with her. 

           It’s a HUGE STANDING OVATION, a tidal wave of energy. Fujiko 
           and Shigeo, overcome, applaud the loudest. Masahiro cheers. 
           Mitsue and Eiji scream in delight.

           Sadako takes the certificate and bows with a huge smile.

           As she makes her way back to her seat, her eyes fall on a ROW 
           OF FOURTEEN EMPTY CHAIRS ON STAGE with FLOWERS draped over 
           them. Sadako stares at the harsh reminder of her situation.

           EXT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           THE BAMBOO CLASS WAVES goodbye from inside the school gates. 
           Sadako waves back and walks outside with MR. NOMURA. He takes 
           the camera from around his neck.

                                 MR. NOMURA
                        Stand there. I will take your 
                        picture in your beautiful kimono.

           With her school behind her, Mr. Nomura takes Sadako’s photo. 
           It feels like a moment everyone will hold on to forever.

           As Sadako looks back, she is on the verge of tears. Fujiko 
           steps in and takes her by the hand.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Thank you, Sensei. We must get back 
                        to the hospital.

           Sadako struggles to hold it together as she waves goodbye to 
           her beloved school.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sadako folds cranes at a table by herself, the pain from 
           leaving her school behind still very fresh.

           Kenji watches from across the room and finally walks over. He 
           slides beside her.
                                 KENJI
                        You’re a celebrity.

           Sadako is startled.

                                 SADAKO
                        Pardon me?

                                 KENJI
                        “The girl with the cranes.” 
                        Everyone is talking about you.

                                 SADAKO
                        Are you poking fun at me? 

                                 KENJI
                        I’m not poking fun. You’ve got 
                        people excited.

                                 SADAKO
                        Why?

                                 KENJI
                        Look around you.

           He indicates around the hospital cafeteria. 

                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        Not a lot of positivity around 
                        here. You’re all we have. 

           Sadako is flattered.

                                 KENJI (CONT’D)
                        I am Kenji.

                                 SADAKO
                        Sadako.

           Kenji bows. Sadako notices PURPLE BRUISING ON HIS ARM. He 
           leaves with a smile. Sadako nervously smiles back.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Late that night, Sadako sits in bed and writes the FIRST 
           ENTRY in her new journal.

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        My name is Sadako Sasaki. I am 
                        twelve years old. I am from 
                        Hiroshima. My favorite flower is a 
                        rose. My favorite celebrity is 
                        Misora Hibari. I am Hibakusha...
           Sadako pauses and considers what else to write. She looks to 
           A STRING OF CRANES beside her, getting bigger every day.  

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        I am sick. But I will get better.

           A NOTE IS SLIPPED UNDER HER DOOR. Sadako sees the note, 
           puzzled. She crosses the room to pick it up and reads:

                                 SADAKO 
                        What is something that wears many 
                        clothes when it is small, but grows 
                        up to be naked?

           It’s a riddle. Sadako is intrigued. She opens the door and 
           leans into the hallway: 

           Kenji leans his head out of his room and smiles before 
           disappearing back inside. 

           Sadako leans back into her room. She can hardly stand it. Now 
           she must focus on the riddle...

                                 SADAKO
                        Wears many clothes when it is 
                        small, but grows up to be naked?

           After a moment’s thought she gets it...

                                 SADAKO
                        Bamboo!

           She writes down her answer. 

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sadako slips into the hallway. It’s dark and quiet. She 
           tiptoes down the hall to Kenji’s door and slides the note 
           underneath, then runs back to her room.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako lies in bed, an exhausted, but excited smile on her 
           face. She closes her eyes.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET / COERR HOME - DAY

           It’s a beautiful, sunny day. So sunny it’s almost washed out.
           Eleanor walks down the street outside their house, Robbie 
           next to her on his bicycle. He circles around her, laughing 
           and having fun. 

           As they round the corner to their house, Eleanor sees a 
           MILITARY CAR parked out front. Robbie hasn’t seen it yet.

           She hurries up ahead to get a closer look and that’s when she 
           sees them...

           TWO OFFICERS IN FULL, DRESS UNIFORM. A LETTER in one’s hand.

           She knows exactly why they are here... Her husband is dead.

           The officers see Eleanor and SALUTE. 

           She covers her mouth in horror. The tears immediately build 
           in her eyes. She then remembers Robbie and turns--

           He’s frozen in his tracks, tears rolling down his cheeks.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robbie...

           She approaches him but he turns away on his bike and PEDDLES 
           HARD down the street.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robbie!

           Eleanor runs after him, desperate, as fast as she can but 
           she’ll never catch up. 

           The distance between them grows and grows-- 

           SUDDENLY THERE IS A HUGE BURST OF BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. 

           Eleanor is knocked off her feet and has to shield her eyes...

           Robbie becomes SILHOUETTED as the LIGHTS GROWS.  

           Pure, helpless terror consumes Eleanor as a BRUTAL WIND TEARS 
           down the street, getting closer and closer--

                                 ELEANOR
                        ROBBIE!

           INT. COERR HOME - ELEANOR’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Eleanor WAKES FROM A NIGHTMARE in a COLD SWEAT. 

           She struggles to catch her breath as she looks around...
           Wym sleeps peacefully next to her. Everything is fine.  

           INT. COERR HOME - ROBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Still rattled, Eleanor checks on Robbie. He’s sound asleep. 

           Once she’s regained her composure, she pulls the blankets 
           tighter around him and kisses his forehead. As she does, she 
           gives a somber glance to the PHOTOS OF HICKS and his FLAG.

           EXT. COERR HOME - NIGHT

           Eleanor sits on the front porch, a glass of whiskey alongside 
           her, and a blanket on her lap. She looks up at the stars, 
           bright and peaceful overhead. 

           Wym, in his pajamas, comes out of the house behind her

                                 WYM
                        Everything all right?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yeah... Just thinking.

           He sits down next to her and takes a sniff of her glass. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        You want one?

                                 WYM
                        It’s a bit early, or late, for me. 

           Eleanor shrugs and takes another sip.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I received a letter from my old 
                        friend in Japan.

                                 WYM
                        Oh, yeah?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yeah. And it had something in it.

           She holds out the PAPER CRANE. Wym doesn’t quite get it.

                                 WYM
                        Origami. Neat.

                                 ELEANOR
                        And this.
           She hands him Sadako’s story and watches it affect him as he 
           now looks at the origami differently.

                                 ELEANOR
                        When I was in Japan, Bob told me 
                        not to go to Hiroshima. He begged 
                        me not to. He made up reasons, but 
                        I always knew why he didn’t want me 
                        to see it... He didn’t think I 
                        could handle it. And he knew if he 
                        said that, it would only make me 
                        want to go more. 

           Wym smiles as that’s a trait he knows as well. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I never told him, but for all these 
                        years I wished I’d listened to him. 
                        It was truly the most horrific 
                        thing I had ever seen. And then 
                        when I found out I was pregnant 
                        with Robbie, more than anything 
                        else, I just felt this overwhelming 
                        fear, this awful feeling... That I 
                        don’t know how to keep him safe.

           It’s difficult to finally admit that to someone else. Eleanor 
           sucks it up and carries on... 

                                 ELEANOR
                        But there was no stopping me when I 
                        was younger, I knew what I wanted 
                        and I went after it.

                                 WYM
                        What did you want?

                                 ELEANOR
                        No, it will sound so silly now... 

                                 WYM
                        Just tell me, Ellie. 

           Eleanor thinks about it. She’s uncomfortable, embarrassed

                                 ELEANOR
                        I thought I could make a 
                        difference. I wanted to write 
                        something that inspired peace, 
                        whatever that means, but you know, 
                        “make the world a better place.”
                                 WYM
                        I don’t think there’s anything 
                        silly about trying to make the 
                        world a better place.

           He takes her hand. It helps.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I don’t know... Maybe I was just 
                        trying to make myself feel better. 
                        Either way, I’ve spent all this 
                        time since telling myself I failed, 
                        but the truth is I didn’t fail, I 
                        gave up. But this girl Sadako... 
                        It’s still happening, Wym. Over ten 
                        years later, it’s still happening 
                        and people around here have no 
                        idea. That’s not right.

                                 WYM
                        If that’s how you feel, don’t give 
                        up anymore. 

           Whatever she’s about to do, he’s got her back, which is 
           exactly what she needs. Wym kisses her and heads back inside. 

           INT. AMERICAN RED CROSS - DAY

           Eleanor enters the office and approaches the front desk, 
           where a RECEPTIONIST finishes up a phone call.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Welcome to the American Red Cross. 
                        Are you here to volunteer?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Not today. I’m a reporter with The 
                        Post and I was hoping you might 
                        provide me with some information.

           The receptionist is excited and treats the request with the 
           utmost seriousness. She lowers her voice. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m in. What’s the scoop?

           Eleanor plays along with her and leans in.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I need a name. Anyone that might 
                        have worked in Japan over the last 
                        ten years. Preferably Hiroshima.
           The receptionist nods as she writes the bullet points down.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Piece of cake.

           She places a “BACK IN FIVE MINUTES” SIGN on the desk and 
           disappears into a back room. Eleanor hears the sounds of 
           filing cabinets frantically opening and closing before the 
           receptionist steps back out, very casually.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (barely a whisper)
                        Marge Grey. In the donation center.

           She proudly points down the hall.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Exceptional work. Thank you.

           As Eleanor walks away the receptionist excitedly picks up the 
           phone to tell someone about her investigation.

           INT. AMERICAN RED CROSS - BLOOD DONATION CENTER - DAY

           A NEEDLE pokes through skin and BLOOD fills up the tube 
           leading to a BLOOD PACK.

           Eleanor watches closely from the doorway, behind her is a 
           LINE OF PEOPLE waiting to donate blood. 

           MARGE (30s), in a RED CROSS NURSE’S UNIFORM, tapes the needle 
           down on the MAN in the chair. She turns back to Eleanor.

                                 MARGE
                        Sorry lady, but the other nurse 
                        called in sick today and I don’t 
                        even have time for a bathroom 
                        break. You’ll have to find someone 
                        else for your story. Next.

           A man steps forward and Marge is about to lead him inside. 
           Eleanor makes the only move she can think of.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Actually I was next.

           Marge and the donor turn back. Eleanor rolls up her sleeve. 
           Marge shrugs with a smile.

                                 MARGE
                        Right this way.
           INT. BLOOD DONATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The IV is in Eleanor’s left arm so she can still take notes 
           with her right. Marge is on a stool next to her.

                                 MARGE
                        “A very pleasant way to die.” 
                        That’s what they said. That’s what 
                        I expected when I went over. Let me 
                        tell you, there’s nothing pleasant 
                        about radiation sickness. I went 
                        there because I wanted to help 
                        people, but after two years in 
                        Nagasaki, if I can help people 
                        right here in this room that’s what 
                        I’m choosing.

           Marge falters emotionally, just the slightest bit.

                                 MARGE
                        There was one patient, a little 
                        boy, he wasn’t even born yet when 
                        the bomb went off. His mom was four 
                        months pregnant. Ten years later he 
                        gets it.

                                 ELEANOR
                        A-Bomb Disease?

           Marge is surprised she knows the term.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I was in Hiroshima. 

           They share a moment of mutual understanding.

                                 ELEANOR
                        When did you get back?

                                 MARGE
                        Few months ago.

                                 ELEANOR
                        So just to confirm, it is still 
                        like this over there?

                                 MARGE
                        When I left, they didn’t have 
                        enough beds in the hospital.

           As Eleanor writes that down, she gets a little woozy from the 
           blood loss and has to shake it off. 
                                 MARGE
                        When you were there it was scars 
                        and burns, but it’s way beyond that 
                        now. It’s become a crippling fear 
                        that at any moment you or your 
                        children are next. And that fear is 
                        still spreading.

           INT. ELEANOR’S CAR - DAY 

           Eleanor drinks JUICE in her car, a BANDAGE on her left arm. 
           She looks over her notes then finally starts the car and 
           drives off, more determined than ever.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN HOSPITAL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           A CLASS breaks and STUDENTS IN LAB-COATS pour out. 

           Eleanor waits for them to leave and enters to find DOCTOR 
           CROSS (50s) packing up his things. 

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        Office hours are in the morning.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m not a student. I’m a writer for 
                        the District Post.

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        No comment. 

           He grabs his briefcase and walks past her. As he does, 
           Eleanor sizes him up: the shine of his shoe, the press of his 
           pants, the part/crop of his hair. She throws out a Hail Mary:

                                 ELEANOR
                        My late husband was Air Force. 
                        Sixth Night Squadron. 

           Doctor Cross stops. She’s found his weak spot. He checks his 
           watch, and sighs, knowing his obligation. He turns back.

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        I’m sorry for your loss...
                             (checks his watch)
                        You have five minutes.

           She wastes no time, reaching for her notes.
                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m writing about Hiroshima and the 
                        lingering effects of the bomb, 
                        particularly “A-Bomb Disease.” What 
                        can you tell me about it?

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        It’s complicated. “A-Bomb Disease” 
                        is shorthand for what are actually 
                        a variety of diseases caused by 
                        exposure to high levels of 
                        radiation, usually Strontium-90. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m not familiar.

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        It’s a cancer-causing isotope 
                        chemically very similar to Calcium, 
                        so the body confuses the two and 
                        absorbs the radiation from the 
                        environment. Most commonly, this 
                        leads to Malignant Acute Marrow 
                        Leukemia. It’s cancer in the bone 
                        marrow that infects the blood then 
                        rapidly spreads to the organs.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Can it be treated?

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        We can manage pain and delay the 
                        disease for a while, but no, it is 
                        almost always fatal.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I read that patients were healthy 
                        for years then suddenly got sick, 
                        despite there being no traces of 
                        radiation left. Is that possible?

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        No. They’ve been sick all along. 
                        It’s just taken this long for the 
                        symptoms to surface. 

           He turns to the chalk board behind him and draws a DOT with a 
           CIRCLE around it. Then ANOTHER CIRCLE and ANOTHER.

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        They call it the concentric circles 
                        of death. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCTOR CROSS (CONT'D)
                        The distance the patient was from 
                        the epicenter of the bomb directly 
                        correlates to the time before their 
                        sickness manifests.

           He points to the innermost circle and moves outward.

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        One week... One month... One 
                        year... Ten years... 

                                 ELEANOR
                        How far out do the circles go?

                                 DOCTOR CROSS
                        We’re still waiting to see.

           Eleanor is shocked. Her eyes turn back to the “concentric 
           circles of death” on the blackboard.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - DAY

           STRINGS OF PAPER CRANES are now suspended from the ceiling. 

           Sadako has been moved to a private room. It is a much better 
           environment than the emergency room. She sits on the bed 
           while Fujiko brushes her hair and hums a peaceful tune. 

           Nurse Satomi comes in with her morning pills. 

           Sadako excitedly takes the paper and folds another crane. 
           Once it is done, she closes her eyes and restates her wish.

           Fujiko watches her daughter, pained by what she inspired...

           EXT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - DAY

           The cherry blossoms are in bloom. SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHINY 
           BLACK SHOES walk down the pavement towards the hospital. 

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - DAY

           Sadako sits on her bed and folds cranes with Tomiko, Chizuko 
           and the GIRLS FROM SCHOOL.

                                 SADAKO
                        Tell me about junior high-school.
                                 TOMIKO
                        Oh, Sadako, you’ll love it. I mean, 
                        I hate it, but you’ll love it.

                                 CHIZUKO
                        Can you really fold a thousand?

                                 TOMIKO
                        Sadako can do anything.

                                 CHIZUKO
                        You know, Nasu talks about you all 
                        the time. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Nasu is a silly boy.

           The girls can’t understand her indifference. Then there’s a 
           KNOCK at the door. They look over as Kenji enters.

                                 KENJI
                        I didn’t know you had visitors.

                                 SADAKO
                        It’s fine. Come in. These are all 
                        my friends.

                                 KENJI
                        Hello. I am Kenji.

           The girls can’t speak or move. Kenji sets a note by the door.

                                 KENJI
                        I think I’ll get you with this one.

           He smiles and leaves the room. The girls are in awe. 

                                 CHIZUKO
                        The mayor does it again...

           The girls all giggle. Sadako smiles to herself.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - LATER

           Sadako watches from her window as her friends all get to 
           leave the hospital and go back to their homes. It’s so hard.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Fujiko tries to brush Sadako’s teeth, but she’s uncooperative 
           and turns away. Her skin is pale, her lymph nodes swollen.
                                 FUJIKO
                        Sadako, please.

           Reluctantly, Sadako allows Fujiko to part her lips and brush. 
           Sadako spits into the sink. There’s BLOOD from her gums. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        It’s me. I’m brushing too hard.

           Sadako stares at the BLOOD IN THE SINK. She knows...

                                 SADAKO
                        I will never go to junior-high 
                        school.

           Sadako cries. It breaks Fujiko’s heart. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        That is not true, Sadako. You will 
                        get better and you will go back to 
                        school. You just have to keep 
                        folding your cranes. You have got 
                        better already, have you not? The 
                        doctor said so himself.

                                 SADAKO
                        I won’t make it to a thousand! I’m 
                        too slow! My medicine makes me 
                        tired! My hands are swollen! I’m 
                        running out of time...

           Fujiko wraps her in a hug and comforts her.

                                 FUJIKO
                        It’s okay, Sadako. It will be okay. 
                        How many have you folded?

                                 SADAKO
                        Almost five hundred.

                                 FUJIKO
                        You’re half way there! Now is not 
                        the time to feel sorry for 
                        yourself, now is when you fight 
                        harder than ever. 

           Fujiko wipes Sadako’s tears away. Her smile makes Sadako feel 
           better, the way only a mother’s smile can.
           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako holds up a CANDY WRAPPER. It’s very small. Using a 
           NEEDLE, Sadako folds her smallest crane yet. It’s incredibly 
           difficult but she does it, then stops to admire her work.

                                 SADAKO
                        Five hundred.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sadako and Kenji walk together down the hallway. Kenji is 
           weak. The PURPLE MARKS have spread more. 

                                 KENJI
                        If you could do anything right now, 
                        what would you do?

           Sadako doesn’t have to think long.

                                 SADAKO
                        Run.

                                 KENJI
                        Where to?

                                 SADAKO
                        Nowhere. I would just run. Like I 
                        used to. I would close my eyes, 
                        feel the air burn in my lungs and 
                        let my legs take me wherever they 
                        wanted to go.

           They pass a NURSES’ STATION where Nurse Satomi and the other 
           nurses are working. Suddenly, there are SHOUTS from down the 
           hall. DR. NUMATA RUNS PAST THEM.  

                                 DR. NUMATA
                        All nurses! Emergency!

           The nurses dash away, leaving their station empty. Kenji sees 
           an opportunity and darts behind the station. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Kenji, what are you doing?

                                 KENJI
                        Finding my chart.

                                 SADAKO
                        But that is for the doctors. We’re 
                        not supposed to look.
                                 KENJI
                        Why? It is my life. Why can’t I 
                        know how much time I have left? 

           This makes an impact on Sadako. He finds his file and copies 
           the information to a piece of paper.

                                 SADAKO
                        But how will you even know?

                                 KENJI
                        No time to explain, you just have 
                        to answer right now, do you want me 
                        to get yours as well?

           It’s a split second decision. Does she want to know exactly 
           how sick she is? She nods. 

           Kenji flips through the files, finds Sadako’s and copies the 
           numbers down. Then he hurries out and takes Sadako’s hand.

           EXT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Kenji leads Sadako onto the roof. It’s a beautiful night over 
           Hiroshima with the MOON and STARS casting a glow on the city. 
           Kenji has the information he copied down in front of them.

                                 KENJI
                        Our blood is made up of two types 
                        of cells. Red carries oxygen. White 
                        fights disease. To be healthy they 
                        must be in balance.

                                 SADAKO
                        Where did you learn this?

                                 KENJI
                        An old patient. He was a doctor 
                        before he got sick. If your white 
                        blood cell count is over a hundred 
                        thousand, you are very sick.

           This is a huge amount of information for Sadako to process. 
           It scares her. Kenji takes her hand.

                                 KENJI
                        Yours is only thirty thousand, 
                        Sadako. You’ve got lots of time.

           Sadako breathes for what feels like the first time in ages. 

                                 SADAKO
                        What about you?
           Kenji changes the subject as he looks out at the night sky.

                                 KENJI
                        Do you believe that when people die 
                        they become stars in the sky?

                                 SADAKO
                        Yes, I do.

                                 KENJI
                        Me too. I like to look up and think 
                        about which ones are my parents.

                                 SADAKO
                        Did they die in Pikadon?

           Kenji struggles to hold back his emotions. He nods. 

                                 KENJI
                        Ten years, I have been on my own. 

                                 SADAKO
                        You are not on your own, Kenji. I’m 
                        with you.

           Kenji looks over to her. He leans in, as if to kiss her, but 
           simply RESTS HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST HERS and closes his eyes. 

                                 KENJI
                        You will fold your one thousand 
                        cranes, Sadako. You will get 
                        better. You will run again.

           She nods and they turn back to the stars on top of the lights 
           of the city. Sadako rests her head against Kenji’s shoulder. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - DAY

           Eleanor is at her desk, notes piled up in front of her. Jerry 
           steps out of his office and calls out to the room:

                                 JERRY
                        Pitch Meeting! Let’s go!

           Eleanor watches the REPORTERS and SECRETARIES get up from 
           their desks and make their way to the conference room. 

           Using all her courage, she rises from her desk, gathers her 
           notes and joins the crowd headed to the meeting.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           All the reporters sit around a table with Jerry at the head. 
           The secretaries sit in chairs along the walls and take notes. 

           Eleanor is along the wall, waiting for her moment to strike...

                                 REPORTER #1
                        It’s called the GE Telechron-7H241 
                        or “Snooz-Alarm.”

                                 JERRY
                        What does it do?

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Say it’s early in the morning, your 
                        alarm goes off but you don’t want 
                        to get up yet, you just tap the 
                        “Snooz button” and the alarm shuts 
                        up! A few minutes later, it goes 
                        off again and you start your day.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        What if you still don’t want to get 
                        up?

                                 REPORTER #1
                        You just tap the button again!

           An impressed MURMUR fills the room. 

                                 JERRY
                        I love it. “The world’s first 
                        humane alarm clock.” Get a quote 
                        from General Electric and let’s run 
                        with it. Anyone else got anything?

           Nobody wants to follow the “Snooz-Alarm” and Jerry is about 
           to call it... Eleanor knows it’s now or never.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I do.

           Heads turn to the back of the room. The WOMEN around her are 
           the most surprised of anyone. 

           They all then look to Jerry, who begrudgingly allows it.

                                 JERRY
                        Alright Eleanor, what is it?

           She stands up.
                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s been several years since 
                        anyone ran a story about Hiroshima. 
                        I think it’s time we revisited it-- 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Hiroshima? What has that got to do 
                        with anything?

                                 REPORTER #1
                        It’s yesterday’s news.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Yesterday plus a decade. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Tell that to the people building 
                        bunkers in their backyards. Or the 
                        kids hiding under their desks, like 
                        that will do anything if--

                                 JERRY
                        Enough. Okay, Hiroshima... What’s 
                        the angle?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Well, the War Department censored 
                        media reports out of Japan until 
                        1952, but by then most people had 
                        moved on and we never really got 
                        the end of the story. We know that 
                        people were still getting sick 
                        months after the blast, but I’ve 
                        been doing some research and found 
                        that they still are getting sick to 
                        this day. Over ten years later. 
                        Children who were in utero at the 
                        time of the blast are now dying. 
                        Frankly, the fallout is worse than 
                        anyone ever imagined. I think 
                        people deserve to know that. 

           Eleanor, and the whole room, waits anxiously while Jerry 
           considers...

                                 JERRY
                        I think there’s something here. 
                        Good work, Eleanor.

           She can’t believe it...

                                 JERRY
                        Pete, go over Eleanor’s notes and 
                        get started on this right away.
           And her short-lived celebration is over.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Excuse me? Jerry, this is my story.

                                 JERRY
                        And this is my newspaper. How many 
                        times do I have to tell you? I give 
                        the assignments and that’s it.

           She’s furious. He can tell and tries to calm her. Badly.

                                 JERRY
                        Listen, you did a good job and I’m 
                        very impressed. Maybe sometime soon 
                        we can find a nice story around 
                        town for you to get your feet wet. 
                        But right now, it’s time to let the 
                        professionals go to work. Okay?

           He thinks that’s it, everyone does. Except Eleanor.

                                 ELEANOR
                        No. 

                                 JERRY
                        What was that?

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s my story. 

           The whole room is stunned and careful not to get caught in 
           the cross-fire as Jerry is clearly pissed at his authority 
           being questioned.

                                 JERRY
                        Let’s be real here. It’s not like I 
                        can send Dear Lily to Japan... 

           He laughs but that’s exactly what she wants.

                                 JERRY
                        You’re nuts, Eleanor. Anyone ever 
                        tell you that?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Not for a while.

           Their stare-down continues in front of everyone.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s not going to happen, Sweetie. 
                        I’d think long and hard about what 
                        you say next.
           But Eleanor has gone too far to back down.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You know, I must have written a 
                        thousand “Lily” columns by now, and 
                        the funny thing is that the answer 
                        always ends up being some version 
                        of the same advice... When 
                        something isn’t working, it’s time 
                        to make a change. I think it’s time 
                        I finally listened to Lily for 
                        myself... I’m writing my story, 
                        Jerry. The only question is will it 
                        be here or somewhere else?

           All the eyes in the room shoot back to Jerry...

           INT. THE DISTRICT POST - DAY

           Eleanor packs up her things in a banker’s box.

           Jerry watches her from his office, a NOTECARD in his hand. As 
           Eleanor heads towards the door, he intercepts her.

                                 JERRY
                        Here. Don’t say I never gave you 
                        anything.

           He holds out the card, she eyes it suspiciously.

                                 ELEANOR
                        What’s that?

                                 JERRY
                        An old friend... Kind of. If you’re 
                        really going through with this, 
                        you’ll want to talk to him. Best of 
                        luck, Eleanor.

           Eleanor takes the note from Jerry. Her eyes go wide.

           INT. COERR HOME - ROBBIE’S ROOM - DAY

           Robbie lies on his back in bed, throws a baseball in the air 
           and catches it in his glove. Eleanor stands next to him.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Who even is this guy?
                                 ELEANOR
                        His name is John Hersey. He wrote 
                        the definitive piece of journalism 
                        on Hiroshima. He’s someone I have 
                        admired for a very long time and 
                        this is a really exciting 
                        opportunity for me.

           She’s pleading with him. He considers...

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m not going.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes you are.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Well, does the dork have to come?

           OUTSIDE THE ROOM, Wym tries not to be offended. He looks at 
           himself in the mirror. Is he a dork?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes, he does. It will be nice for 
                        us all to spend the time together. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        No thanks. I’ll just stay here.

           He tosses the ball in the air again, but this time Eleanor 
           snatches it. This is no longer a discussion. Robbie throws 
           off his glove in defeat.

           INT. COERR HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Robbie stomps out of his room past Wym. Eleanor comes out 
           behind him and smiles encouragingly.

                                 ELEANOR
                        All set.

           INT. WYM’S CAR - DAY

           Wym drives with Eleanor in the passenger seat. 

           Robbie is in the back, bored out of his mind and still bitter 
           he’s here.

           Eleanor flips through her notes, secretly anxious. Wym motors 
           through some questions, only adding to her nerves.
                                 WYM
                        What do you think he’ll be like?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I have no idea.

                                 WYM
                        What are you going to ask him?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Still figuring that out actually.

                                 WYM
                        What has he been doing--

                                 ELEANOR
                        Wym.

           She places her hand on his shoulder to calm down.

                                 WYM
                        Sorry. Just excited for you.

           Robbie watches them smile at each other from the back seat 
           and he doesn’t like it one bit.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You ask a lot of questions.

                                 WYM
                        Maybe that’s why your mother and I 
                        get along so well. The solution to 
                        every problem begins with someone 
                        simply asking the right question.

           Robbie is unimpressed.

                                 WYM 
                        Give it a shot. Ask me anything.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Anything?

           Wym nods. Robbie looks to Eleanor. She encourages him, albeit 
           with a slight nervousness. Robbie leans in aggressively.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Is “Wym” your real name?

                                 WYM
                        Wymberly deRenne Coerr.

                                 ROBBIE
                        What do you do, Wymberly?
                                 WYM
                        I’m between jobs at the moment.

                                 ROBBIE
                        What was your last job?

                                 WYM
                        For several years I was the United 
                        States Ambassador to Bolivia.

           Robbie looks to Eleanor, confused. She confirms it’s legit.

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s in South America.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Do you speak Spanish?

           Wym rattles off a few sentences in PERFECT SPANISH.

                                 WYM (SUBTITLED)
                        Whenever people ask me if I speak 
                        Spanish, this is what I say because 
                        it sounds impressive and I’ve 
                        rehearsed it many times.

           Robbie has no clue what he said but is clearly impressed.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why did you leave Bolivia?

                                 WYM
                        Revolutionaries attacked the 
                        embassy and I was evacuated after 
                        days of eating only peanut butter 
                        and burning classified information.

           Robbie’s eyes go wide.

                                 WYM
                        Not bad for a dork, huh?

           He smiles at Robbie, who takes it as a challenge. One he 
           accepts...

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why did you and your last wife get 
                        divorced?

           Wym looks back, knowing he can’t back down now.
                                 WYM
                        Sometimes, it’s very easy to think 
                        you love someone you actually just 
                        really like at that moment. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Is that what it’s like with your 
                        kids?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robbie!

           Eleanor is ready to reprimand him, but Wym stops her.

                                 WYM
                        No. When you have kids you find out 
                        what true, undying love feels like. 
                        And it makes you pay attention when 
                        you miraculously find it again.

           Wym affectionately takes hold of Eleanor’s hand. Robbie 
           returns his attention to the window.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m done with this now.

           They all settle into riding in silence. 

           EXT. YALE CAMPUS - DAY

           It’s a grey winter day in New England.

           Eleanor stands outside an OLD TOWNHOUSE, reticent. She 
           finally walks up the steps and hears something... CLASSICAL 
           MUSIC. She reaches the door and KNOCKS. 

           BARBARA HERSEY (40) comes to the door and opens it, the 
           sounds of the music flood out as she does. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Can I help you?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m sorry to interrupt, but I was 
                        looking for John Hersey...

           Barbara looks over her shoulder to the other room.

                                 BARBARA
                        He’s almost done. Would you like to 
                        wait inside?
           INT. JOHN HERSEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Eleanor steps in and Barbara closes the door behind her. She 
           then leads her to the back room where the music originates.

           Eleanor walks through the house and certain things jump out 
           at her: A poster for the film “A BELL FOR ADONO,” a large 
           piece of JAPANESE CALLIGRAPHY, and most impressively, a 
           PULITZER PRIZE displayed on the mantle.

           Then she sees him, JOHN HERSEY (50s) plays VIOLIN in a STRING 
           QUARTET. With him are an OLDER MAN on VIOLA, an OLDER WOMAN 
           on VIOLIN and a FEMALE STUDENT playing the CELLO.

           Eleanor stands with Barbara and watches the beautiful 
           performance reach its grand finale.

           Hersey lights up as soon as the last note is played. He 
           compliments the other musicians then looks back to his wife. 
           He sees Eleanor with her and immediately grows suspicious...

           INT. JOHN HERSEY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The musicians have gone and it’s just Hersey and Eleanor left 
           as he picks up after the performance. He pours himself a 
           glass of scotch. 

                                 HERSEY
                        Drink?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Not when I’m working.

           She pulls out her notepad and pen.

                                 HERSEY
                        Put that away. It’s an awful habit. 
                        Journalists are full of them.

           With a bit of difficulty, Eleanor detaches from her tools. 
           She seems unsure of what to do with her hands now. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m sure you appreciate the irony 
                        of you not liking journalists. 

                                 HERSEY
                        Don’t confuse irony with hypocrisy. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I wish I could write that down.

           Hersey cracks a smile.
                                 HERSEY
                        Why are you here?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m writing an article about 
                        Hiroshima, what it’s like today and 
                        the lingering effects--

                                 HERSEY
                        No, that part I get. I want to know 
                        why you’re at my house. What do you 
                        want from me?

           She’s caught off-guard. It’s a question she asks herself.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Your reporting from ‘45, your 
                        account of the bomb, it inspired 
                        me. I want to expose the reality of 
                        the long-term fallout the way you 
                        exposed the reality of the bomb 
                        itself.

                                 HERSEY
                        Long-term fallout?

                                 ELEANOR
                        People being diagnosed with a 
                        variety of cancers from radiation 
                        exposure that occurred sixteen 
                        years ago. Children who weren’t 
                        even born in ‘45 now getting sick 
                        and dying--

                                 HERSEY
                        Are you a doctor, Eleanor?

           His tone is suddenly hostile. Eleanor doesn’t understand.

                                 ELEANOR
                        No.

                                 HERSEY
                        A scientist?

                                 ELEANOR
                        No.

                                 HERSEY
                        What about a politician? Are you at 
                        least a politician?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Enough. You know what I am.
                                 HERSEY
                        Yes I do. You’re a wannabe 
                        journalist who’s also a wannabe 
                        activist. Neither of which qualify 
                        you to get the job done.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Excuse me?

                                 HERSEY
                        Make a difference, right? That’s 
                        why you’re here. You saw one too 
                        many Cold War broadcasts and 
                        decided you were the one who could 
                        get through the noise. One good 
                        piece of reporting to change the 
                        world! Am I close? 

           Eleanor is speechless. She never expected to find herself 
           under attack.

                                 HERSEY
                        You’re not the first one to show up 
                        at my door. 

           Reeling, Eleanor stands up to leave.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m sorry I bothered you.

                                 HERSEY
                        No bother at all.

           She walks towards the door. Hersey watches her go. She’s 
           almost there when she stops... Her skin thickens and any 
           personal feelings she had wash away. Now it’s just business.

                                 ELEANOR
                        No, actually, I’m not sorry. I just 
                        drove seven hours to get here and 
                        I’m not leaving until I ask you a 
                        couple questions. Now, you’re 
                        completely indifferent to what I 
                        said, which means you’re either a 
                        heartless bastard or you already 
                        knew. Or both. 

           Hersey looks almost glad she turned around.

                                 HERSEY
                        Back then they called it the Atomic 
                        Plague. It’s a living, breathing 
                        nightmare.
                                 ELEANOR
                        Why has no one reported on it? Why 
                        have you not reported on it?

                                 HERSEY
                        There have been reports. 

           Eleanor doesn’t understand.

                                 HERSEY
                        I’m sorry to ruin your expose, but 
                        there is nothing to uncover here. 
                        There are no men in black suits 
                        hiding the truth. This information 
                        is out there. It’s everywhere. The 
                        problem is no one wants to hear it.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        No, the media bans and censorship--

                                 HERSEY
                        Have all been lifted for years. The 
                        government laid the sand, but it’s 
                        the public who choose to bury their 
                        heads in it. Your enemy is not 
                        conspiracy, it’s indifference.

           She’s floored by what she’s hearing.

                                 HERSEY
                        You want to write something down, 
                        here it is: there are no stories 
                        that haven’t been told, only ones 
                        that nobody cares about. It’s not 
                        enough to tell them the facts, you 
                        have to make them care.

           Her desperation grows as she begins to think he’s right...

                                 ELEANOR
                        How?

                                 HERSEY
                        I can’t answer that.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        But you did it!

                                 HERSEY
                             (snaps)
                        What did I do? Huh? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HERSEY (CONT'D)
                        I took note of people’s misery and 
                        suffering, and a lot of people read 
                        it and patted me on the back, but 
                        we’re still just standing around 
                        waiting for the next one to drop! 
                        So, please, tell me what exactly 
                        you think I did because I’m 
                        guessing it sounds a lot better 
                        coming from you.

           His anguish devastates Eleanor. She searches for an answer...

                                 ELEANOR
                        You told the truth.

                                 HERSEY
                        Yeah, and here we are... A couple 
                        pennies at the bottom of a well.  

           Hersey composes himself and finishes his drink.

                                 HERSEY
                        I’m sorry you drove all this way.

           He can’t look her in the eye as he waits for her to leave. 
           This time Eleanor is more than happy to do so.

           INT. WYM’S CAR - NIGHT

           Wym drives and Robbie sleeps in the back. Eleanor stares out 
           at the miles of deserted highway stretching all around them.

           INT. COERR HOME - DAY

           Eleanor stands by the phone, the cord stretched as far as it 
           will go as she paces back and forth.

                                 ELEANOR
                        That’s absolutely unacceptable! It 
                        was half the price in 1946! I don’t 
                        care if it is an airplane! Put your 
                        manager on please, I’ll wait...

           She doesn’t notice Robbie PEEK HIS HEAD around the corner, 
           then when he’s sure she’s distracted, sneak past.

           INT. COERR HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           The wall of Eleanor’s office is a maze of DATES, NAMES and 
           other pieces of information Eleanor has collected. Her desk 
           is just as big of a mess.
           Robbie quietly enters on a mission of curious investigation. 
           The excitement of doing something he knows he shouldn’t 
           pulses in his veins.

           He TAPS a few keys on the typewriter. He flips through her 
           notes. He then sees the PAPER CRANE. He grabs it, intrigued, 
           then sees the flyer about SADAKO SASAKI. He looks at the 
           picture and the ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS that are now attached...

           “SADAKO SASAKI: BORN JANUARY 7, 1943. DIED OCTOBER 25, 1955.”

           The young girl he’s looking at is dead. This rattles him.

           He notices PHOTOS FROM THE BOMB on the desk and looks through 
           them. He gets to an IMAGE OF A CHARRED BODY... 

           He looks back to the photo of Sadako and begins to connect 
           the horrible dots in his mind. Upset, he recoils backwards 
           and BUMPS into the desk. Eleanor’s PAPERS SCATTER EVERYWHERE.

           Terrified by what he saw, and now terrified by what he’s just 
           done, Robbie drops the stack of photos on the floor.

                                 ELEANOR (O.S.)
                        Robbie?

           She enters the room and sees him over the mess he’s made.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m sorry, Mommy. I’m really sorry.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Dammit, Robbie! You know you’re not 
                        allowed in here! What were you 
                        thinking?

           Robbie’s scared and doesn’t answer.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Robert Hicks Jr. I asked you a 
                        question!

                                 ROBBIE
                        I said I was sorry!

           Tears running down his face, he runs away. She hears his DOOR 
           SLAM from across the house. 

           Eleanor immediately regrets that. She bends over to clean up 
           the papers and sees what they are:

           PICTURES FROM HIROSHIMA: BURNS. SCARS. DEVASTATION. TRAGEDY. 
           She sees this all from her son’s eyes. He must be terrified.
           Then she sees Sadako’s story and the origami crane. She gets 
           an idea...

           INT. COERR HOME - ROBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Robbie sits with his back against the door and his knees 
           pulled to his chest. He angrily wipes tears from his cheeks. 

           A SQUARE PIECE OF PAPER slides underneath the door next... 

                                 ELEANOR (O.S.)
                        Make a wish.

           He’s intrigued, but fights his urge to pick it up.

           INT. COERR HOME - NIGHT

           Eleanor leans her back against the door and slides down to 
           the floor, just like Robbie.

                                 ELEANOR 
                        The first time I went to Japan, 
                        when your dad was there, it was one 
                        of the happiest times of my life. 
                        When I found out I was pregnant 
                        with you, my friend Mieko gave me 
                        an origami crane. She said it would 
                        bring us luck... 

           Eleanor trails off for a moment. She picks up a piece of 
           paper she brought for herself.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I think you and I could use some 
                        good luck right about now. What do 
                        you say? Should we give it a shot?

           She hears him PICK UP THE PAPER and smiles. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Listen carefully, okay? Thirteen 
                        steps, twenty-four folds... Step 
                        one: fold the edges together to a 
                        triangle. Then do the same the 
                        other way...

           Eleanor goes through EACH STEP, speaking through the door the 
           whole time and folding her own page to match. 

           As she folds, she gets lost in it. There is power in this.
           The folds become more complicated. She messes up and laughs. 
           If she’s having problems, Robbie surely is as well. But 
           they’re in it together. Eleanor’s crane takes shape...

                                 ELEANOR 
                        Now, the last step is to very 
                        gently pull on the wings as you 
                        blow into the body...

           She blows into the paper and holds the tiny, delicate piece 
           of origami in her hands. 

                                 ELEANOR 
                        And watch it come alive...

           The door opens. Robbie steps out, hands behind his back...

                                 ELEANOR 
                        Well? How did we do?

           He reveals a CRUMPLED BALL OF PAPER that in no way resembles 
           a crane.

                                 ELEANOR 
                        Oh my word. You’re a prodigy.

           Robbie suddenly throws his arms around her.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’ll come back right?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Of course, baby. I promise. I’m 
                        coming right back.

           INT. COERR HOME - LATER

           Wym walks in the door after a long day and sees Eleanor’s 
           office light on. He curiously walks over and sees...

           Robbie asleep, origami cranes scattered around him.

           And Eleanor, at her wall of research, energetically moving 
           around various notes and photos.

                                 WYM
                        Ellie?

           She turns around, mind racing still. His expression begs her 
           for an explanation.
                                 ELEANOR
                        The girl, Wym. Sadako. She isn’t a 
                        part of the story. She is the 
                        story.

           He looks past her to the wall where SADAKO’S PICTURE has been 
           pinned at the epicenter of it all.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - DAY

           STORM CLOUDS gather over the hospital. It begins to rain.   
           The rain drips steadily from the leaves of the maple trees.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - KENJI’S ROOM - DAY

           The rain splatters against the window of Kenji’s room where 
           HIS BED HAS BEEN STRIPPED and his belongings removed. 

           A PICTURE OF KENJI is on the floor outside the room, CANDLES 
           AND FLOWERS beside it.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - DAY

           Sadako is inconsolable. She screams, she cries so hard. She 
           grabs a string of cranes from the ceiling and RIPS IT DOWN. 
           The cranes fall from the string and scatter on the floor. She 
           rips down another and another.

           Fujiko bursts in the door. She finds Sadako on the floor, and 
           falls down with her. Sadako rocks in her mother’s arms.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Fujiko is asleep on a chair in the room. Sadako watches her 
           from the bed. She appears numb after a long day of crying. 
           Convinced her mother is asleep, she creeps out of the room.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sadako stands at the far end of the hallway. She looks down 
           the LONG, DARK TUNNEL, determined. She gets into her RUNNER’S 
           STANCE and takes a few breaths... 

           THEN SHE RUNS.
           As hard as she can, she runs down the hallway. Her breath 
           quickens and her chest heaves. She watches the end of the 
           hall come up fast...

           But then her vision begins to blur. She clutches her chest. 
           Her legs fail her, no matter how hard she wills them not to.  

           The end of the hallway seems suddenly very far.

           Sadako falls to her knees, painfully out of breath. She looks 
           to the end of the hall and her eyes go wide with terror...

           THE WOLF IS THERE. It stands frozen, staring, its big eyes 
           pierce right through her. 

           Sadako FAINTS.

           A voice comes in muffled...

                                 NURSE SATOMI (O.S.)
                        Sadako! Sadako!

           Nurse Satomi runs over and pulls her into her arms. SADAKO 
           OPENS HER EYES. She sees Nurse Satomi, then looks to the end 
           of the hallway. The wolf has gone. 

           Sadako takes in her surroundings as something dawns on her. 
           She looks to the nurse, eyes heavy...

                                 SADAKO
                        Please do not tell the doctor.

                                 NURSE SATOMI
                        I’m sorry, Sadako, but he needs to 
                        know so he can help you.

                                 SADAKO
                        If he finds out, he won’t let me go 
                        home for the weekend and that is 
                        what I need more than anything. 
                        Please, Nurse... I want to go home.

           Nurse Satomi considers...

           EXT. SASAKI HOUSE / BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Sadako, very weak, is helped by Fujiko up to their entrance. 

           Shigeo is inside with a row of CUSTOMERS. He sees her through 
           the window and immediately stops what he’s doing. He runs 
           outside and wraps her into a hug.
           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           Shigeo carries Sadako into the house and sets her down on a 
           cushion in the main room. Mitsue and Eiji run in to welcome 
           her. She’s so glad to see them. 

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sadako’s RECORD plays in the background as the family sits 
           together with PAPER LANTERNS on the ground. A communal bowl 
           of INK is between them and they each have PAINT BRUSHES, 
           which they use to write on the lanterns. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Is it alright if I don’t write 
                        Grandma Matsu on mine?

                                 SHIGEO
                        What will you write?

                                 SADAKO
                        Kenji.

           Shigeo is sad for his daughter’s loss. He nods.

                                 FUJIKO
                        My lantern will be for Kenji as 
                        well. 

           Her mother’s gesture means a lot to her. Sadako dips her 
           brush in ink and writes KENJI on her lantern.

           EXT. MEMORIAL PEACE PARK - EVENING

           The peace park is full of PEOPLE. From all over Japan, they 
           come to pay their respects and remember those lost on this 
           tenth anniversary of the atomic bomb. 

           The Sasaki family walk up to the park with their lanterns. 
           They pass a MAN with BURNS over much of his body. He reads a 
           poem to a SMALL AUDIENCE:

                                 BURNED MAN
                        Give back my father,             
                        Give back my mother...
                        Give grandpa back, grandma back;
                        Give our sons and daughters back.

           Sadako hears the poem and stops. Her family stops with her. 
           She remembers this from school, but it sounds completely 
           different. Maybe it’s the man reading, or maybe it’s her, but 
           now she understands so much more.
                                 BURNED MAN
                        Give me back myself.
                        Give back the human race, 
                        As long as this life lasts,     
                        Give peace back to us,
                        Peace that will never end.

           The man steps down from the soapbox but Sadako doesn’t move. 
           She’s left almost in a trance by the poem. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        Sadako?

           She turns to her mother who waits, her arm outstretched. 
           Sadako takes her hand and the family carries on.

           EXT. OTA RIVER - NIGHT

           The family wait their turn to get to the bank of the river. 
           All around them and in front, PEOPLE PLACE LANTERNS IN THE 
           WATER and watch as they FLOAT AWAY.

           It is finally their turn. Shigeo lights his candle which he 
           then uses to light everyone else’s. Sadako’s lantern is lit 
           and she sees “KENJI” illuminated through the paper. 

           As the rest of her family place their lanterns in the river, 
           she waits until the last moment, then pulls from her pocket a 
           SMALL STRIP OF PAPER. On it, she has written A RIDDLE.

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        What can you always see in the dark 
                        of night, but never in the light?

           Sadako drops the riddle inside the lantern and lets go of it. 
           She watches as “Kenji” floats away... 

           His lantern joins the THOUSANDS drifting down the river.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako is upstairs with her siblings, all sleeping together 
           under the same roof, just the way it used to be. Mitsue and 
           Eiji have already fallen asleep, but Sadako remains awake.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Sadako, are you asleep?

                                 SADAKO
                        No, I don’t want tonight to ever 
                        end.
           Masahiro nods. They lay awake together.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I’m sorry about Kenji.

           Sadako nods in gratitude.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Mother says you stopped folding 
                        cranes. Is that why?

                                 SADAKO
                        It was a childish game, Masahiro. 
                        It was pointless.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I didn’t think so.

                                 SADAKO
                        Well, you’re not me, are you?

           He can see her spirit’s crushed.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Do you remember Pikadon?

                                 SADAKO
                        No. I try to sometimes, but can’t. 
                        Do you?  

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I remember I was inside our house 
                        then I blinked and I was outside in 
                        the garden and I was terrified. It 
                        was so hot and my ears were ringing 
                        and I was lost. It was as if I was 
                        in a different world. Then I heard 
                        you cry. And I remember thinking, 
                        “Sadako is here, I must be home. 
                        Sadako is here, it will be okay.” 

           Masahiro begins to cry. Sadako takes her brother’s hands.

                                 SADAKO
                        Don’t worry... I’m still here.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - DAY

           Sadako stands alone in her room and stares at HER CRANES, 
           scattered across the floor where she ripped them down...

           And begins to HANG THEM BACK ON THE CEILING. 
           Soon, the room is filled with them again. She sits down and 
           admires them with new eyes. She reaches for her morning 
           pills, laid beside her bed in their paper wrapping. 

           After she takes her pills, she begins to fold a new crane...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. IWAMOTO FARM - EVENING

           A CAR pulls down the long road to the farm. 

           It stops outside and Eleanor steps out. The car drives away.

           The PORCH LIGHT turns on and out walks Mieko. 

           Eleanor drops her bag and hurries up to the door. Mieko meets 
           her at the base of the steps and they hug.

           INT. IWAMOTO HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eleanor and Mieko are deep in a bottle of SAKE. PHOTOS OF 
           ROBBIE are on the table, as well as PHOTOS OF MIEKO’S 
           CHILDREN. Mieko now speaks decent English.

                                 MIEKO
                        We did not know why you came. We 
                        assumed you were a criminal.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        If you thought I was a criminal why 
                        did you let me into your house?

           Mieko shrugs.

                                 MIEKO
                        Thirty dollars is thirty dollars.

           They laugh. Katashi emerges from the back, looking angry. 
           With a look he tells his wife all he needs to, but once he’s 
           gone, Mieko pours more sake for them. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        Your English is so good. To think, 
                        there was a time when we couldn’t 
                        speak in any language and now we 
                        have two to choose from.

                                 MIEKO
                        Better late than never.

           The mood softens as they reflect on the past. 
                                 MIEKO
                        I am very sorry to hear about Major 
                        Hicks. He was a good man.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes, he was. A great one. 

           Mieko picks up a PICTURE OF ROBBIE.

                                 MIEKO
                        That must have been very difficult. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        It was... Still is, to be honest.

           Eleanor takes the picture.

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s hard to stay a child once 
                        you’ve experienced loss like that. 
                        He’s different from the other boys 
                        his age. He always will be. I know 
                        that and I love that about him. I 
                        really do... But also, I would give 
                        anything to see him believe in 
                        something wonderful again.

           Mieko understands the desire. 

                                 MIEKO
                        What about you?

                                 ELEANOR
                        What do you mean?

                                 MIEKO
                        Can you believe in something 
                        wonderful?

           Eleanor thinks about it and eventually smiles, unsure.

                                 ELEANOR
                        We’ll see, I guess.

           Mieko smiles. It’s a good start. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        I can’t believe I’m going back. I 
                        said I never would.

                                 MIEKO
                        I will go with you.
                                 ELEANOR
                        I couldn’t ask you to do that. I 
                        know how you feel about Hiroshima. 

                                 MIEKO
                        Feelings change.

           Mieko begins to tidy up. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        All because of Sadako?

           The question gives Mieko pause, then...

                                 MIEKO
                        Japanese value honor above all and 
                        there is no honor in defeat. For 
                        years, Hiroshima and its people 
                        were a reminder of our greatest 
                        shame, when our honor was taken 
                        from us... When I heard about this 
                        young girl who fought until her 
                        last breath and folded her cranes 
                        until her fingers bled, I saw the 
                        spirit of Japan that I grew up 
                        believing in. Sadako died with 
                        honor. And she makes me very proud.

           This is as emotional as Mieko gets. Then she continues to 
           tidy up. Eleanor marvels at her friend from the table.

           EXT. HIROSHIMA MEMORIAL PEACE PARK - DAY

           Eleanor stands at the center of the park, next to a cleared 
           section where something is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 

           The debris is gone. New trees and flowers have been planted. 
           It’s built-up so much from the destruction she remembers. 

           A MONTAGE OF ELEANOR LEARNING ABOUT SADAKO BEGINS -- 

           Mieko helps translate while Eleanor interviews:

           - Sadako’s teacher, MR. NOMURA, in Sadako’s old classroom.

           - TOMIKO, while they walk around the track at the school.

           - At the hospital with DOCTOR NUMATA.

           - In Sadako’s old room with NURSE SATOMI. PIN MARKS remain on 
           the ceiling from where her paper cranes used to hang. There 
           are TWO NEW PATIENTS in the room. They both light up when 
           asked about Sadako.
           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - LOBBY - DAY

           A MEMORIAL OF SADAKO hangs on the wall. Below it are FLOWERS, 
           CANDLES, LETTERS, and PAPER CRANES. 

           ELEANOR’S REFLECTION appears in the glass of the frame.

           She reaches into her bag and pulls out her paper crane and 
           sets it under the picture with the others.

           EXT. BARBER SHOP - NIGHT

           The barber shop is CLOSED UP. The entrance is SHUTTERED. 

           Eleanor stands outside with Mieko who speaks to a NEIGHBOR. 
           The women exchange bows and Mieko solemnly turns to Eleanor. 

                                 MIEKO
                        I’m sorry, Eleanor. She thinks they 
                        went to Shigeo’s family in 
                        Hokkaido, but no one is sure.  

           Undeterred, Eleanor stares up at the lifeless house--

           A GROUP OF BOYS run past her, a BASEBALL being thrown between 
           them. As she watches the boys play in the street, she gets an 
           intense longing for her home...

           INT. WYM’S CAR - DAY 

           Wym drives Robbie to school. The mood is somber, quiet, as it 
           has been since Eleanor left them alone.

           A SCHOOL BUS in front of them makes a turn, but their car 
           keeps going straight. Robbie is confused.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Wym, the school is that way.

                                 WYM
                        You’re not going to school. My 
                        morning meeting was cancelled and 
                        it seems like a rare opportunity to 
                        have some fun, don’t you think?

           This is nuts.

           EXT. CINEMA - DAY

           Robbie walks alongside Wym up to the cinema. The marquee 
           displays the film: GODZILLA. 
           INT. CINEMA - DAY

           Robbie stares wide-eyed up at the original black and white 
           classic on the big screen. He’s never seen anything like it. 

           EXT. COERR HOME - DAY

           Wym and Robbie get out of the car, still excited from their 
           day of playing hookie. Robbie is in a particularly good mood 
           as they walk up to the house.

           He notices an ENVELOPE poking out of the MAILBOX and grabs 
           it. It’s ADDRESSED TO HIM and covered in JAPANESE STAMPS.

                                 WYM
                        Open it already!

           Robbie tears it open and pulls out a LETTER. He looks down at 
           it and reads below “MY DEAREST ROBBIE (AND WYM)...”

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Sadako’s story is even more 
                        remarkable than I imagined. I have 
                        learned so much about her, but 
                        there is one piece missing...

           EXT. YONAGO TOWN - DAY

           A BUS kicks up a huge cloud of dust as it rolls into town. 

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Her family. I’ve been told that 
                        they went to Hokkaido but nobody 
                        knows for sure.

           Eleanor waits alongside Mieko. In her hand is a MAP OF 
           HOKKAIDO with several LOCATIONS CIRCLED.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        I found every elementary school in 
                        Hokkaido and will visit each one. 
                        If the family is there, the 
                        children must be at one of them.

           As the bus approaches, Eleanor and Mieko hug. PEOPLE ON THE 
           BUS stare out the window, but neither of them cares.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        While I hate the idea of staying 
                        away from you any longer, I have 
                        come too far to give up now. 
           INT. BUS - DAY

           Eleanor takes her seat on the bus and waves to Mieko through 
           the window as the bus rolls away.

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        Your continued support has meant 
                        everything to me. I promise to come 
                        home as soon as I possibly can.

           She looks down at the map again. Her search begins...

                                 ELEANOR (V.O.)
                        All my love, Mom (Ellie).

           EXT. JAPANESE CITY/COUNTRYSIDE - DAY/NIGHT

           And takes her from BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE...

           To CROWDED CITY...

           And back into the COUNTRY.

           EXT. CARGO PIER - DAY

           Eleanor talks to a FISHERMAN about getting on a boat. He 
           refuses to take her money and turns his back to her.

           She walks to the next dock where LIVESTOCK is being loaded. 
           She finds the CAPTAIN on the dock and offers him cash...

           INT. BELOW-DECK - EVENING

           Below deck, alongside CRATES OF CHICKENS, Eleanor rolls out a 
           sleeping mat. Home for the night.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Robbie sits on the school bus, surrounded by kids excited to 
           be done with school. He looks out the window as they roll up 
           to the bus stop...

           A CROWD OF MOTHERS wait for their children...

           But Eleanor isn’t one of them.

           EXT. BOAT DECK - MORNING

           Eleanor stares out as they approach HOKKAIDO ISLAND.
           EXT. SMALL CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 

           Eleanor enters the first elementary school, map in hand.

           INT. SMALL CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           She sits with the PRINCIPAL and shows him the Sasaki names. 
           He shakes his head no.

           EXT. INCREASINGLY MORE REMOTE SCHOOLS - DAY 

           Eleanor continues on her journey, but in each school she only 
           receives more rejection with the SHAKING HEADS of PRINCIPAL 
           after PRINCIPAL.

           Eleanor CROSSES OFF one school after another. It’s starting 
           to wear her down and is taking much longer than she had 
           hoped.

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Eleanor enters a guest-house for the night. Her breath is a 
           puff of cold air. She falls to the tatami mat.

           EXT. ROBBIE’S BUS STOP - DAY

           Robbie steps off the school bus in a crowd of kids that 
           immediately run to their parents. 

           Soon enough he’s the only kid left. He puts on a brave face 
           and starts his walk home.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Eleanor steps out of a remote mountain school, SNOW blankets 
           the ground around her.

           In a sudden fit of frustration, Eleanor CRUMPLES HER MAP and 
           tosses it. She throws her bag to the ground, exhausted. She 
           can’t do this anymore...

           A RUSTLING gets her attention and she looks up to see... 

           A WOLF. 

           It stands regally at the edge of the forest ahead of her. A 
           beautiful and powerful animal. It locks eyes with her for 
           several seconds, then runs off, disappearing into the forest. 
           Eleanor catches her breath... Then collects her things and 
           grabs her map before it blows off in the wind. 

           INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Eleanor sits at a desk and stares at her map. There’s only 
           one school left: her last chance.

           INT. OCEANSIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Eleanor TAPS HER FINGERS on the counter at reception. Her 
           nerves are all over the place. 

           An OLD TEACHER comes out carrying a register. 

                                 OLD TEACHER
                        Follow me.

           Eleanor can’t even process what this means. She fights to 
           keep her expectations in check as she is led out of his 
           office into a LONG WOODEN HALLWAY, past CLASSROOMS filled 
           with YOUNG CHILDREN. They stop outside a classroom...

                                 OLD TEACHER
                        Wait here, please.

           Eleanor watches him first speak to the teacher inside then 
           approach a GIRL, who looks almost identical to Sadako. The 
           likeness makes Eleanor gasp. This is actually happening...

           MITSUE SASAKI follows the teacher out to Eleanor in the 
           hallway. Eleanor bows.

                                 OLD TEACHER
                        Mrs. Coerr, this is Mitsue Sasaki.

                                 ELEANOR
                        It is an honor to meet you.

           Mitsue looks from Eleanor to her teacher, completely 
           confused. Eleanor needs the teacher to translate now. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        My name is Eleanor Coerr. I’ve 
                        travelled all the way from America 
                        because I’m writing a story about 
                        your sister, Sadako, and I wish to 
                        speak to your parents. 

           As the teacher translates, Mitsue’s expression changes 
           drastically. Eleanor can’t tell if it’s amazement or despair 
           or something in between. She grabs a LETTER from her bag.
                                 ELEANOR
                        Please, Mitsue, will you deliver 
                        this note to them?

           The teacher translates. Mitsue thinks. Finally, she takes the 
           LETTER and returns to her class. Eleanor is almost there...

           EXT. NEW SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           Mitsue runs home from school and up to a small house with 
           little surrounding it.

           INT. NEW SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           Fujiko is inside sorting the laundry. Masahiro is nearby 
           helping with chores in the house. Mitsue excitedly comes in.

                                 MITSUE
                        Mom! Mom! Look...

           She runs up to her mother, holding out the note to her.

                                 FUJIKO
                        What is it?

           Mitsue hands her the letter from Eleanor. Fujiko is taken 
           aback while she reads.

           Masahiro watches the emotion consume his mother.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Get to your chores, Mitsue.

                                 MITSUE
                        But mother--

                                 FUJIKO
                        Mitsue! Now!

           Mitsue sadly walks away, her excitement extinguished. Fujiko 
           drops the letter from Eleanor and retreats to a back room.

           Masahiro walks over to the letter and reads for himself...

           EXT. OCEANSIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TRACK - DUSK

           Eleanor walks around the track and checks her watch. The sun 
           is setting. The growing disappointment is unbearable...

           But then she sees Masahiro enter the side of the track. He 
           cautiously walks up to Eleanor and bows.
                                 MASAHIRO
                        My name is Masahiro Sasaki. I am 
                        Sadako’s oldest brother.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank you so much for coming. Did 
                        your parents get my note?

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I’m sorry to say they do not wish 
                        to speak to you. It is best for our 
                        family if this is not revisited. 

           Eleanor is clearly gutted.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Of course. I understand.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Did you really come all this way 
                        just to tell Sadako’s story?

           She nods. It’s obvious how personal it is to her. 

           Masahiro smiles, intrigued, and his mind is made up. He 
           reaches into his jacket pocket and retrieves SADAKO’S 
           JOURNAL. He offers it to her.

                                 ELEANOR
                        What is this?

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Sadako’s journal. She always had it 
                        with her. Until the very end. 

           Eleanor can’t believe it. She takes the book and flips 
           through the pages and pages of Sadako’s writing... 

                                 MASAHIRO
                        I believe my sister would have 
                        wanted you to have it.

           She gets to a page at the back where there are TALLY MARKS 
           and runs her fingers over them. They keep going and going.

                                 ELEANOR
                        She folded more than a thousand...

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Yes. One thousand, six hundred and 
                        forty-four.

           Eleanor does her best to mask her disappointment.
                                 ELEANOR
                        Why did she keep going?

           Masahiro considers, still raw from the heartache.

                                 MASAHIRO
                        Because we needed her to.

           Eleanor looks back to the tally marks...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - DAY

           As the SUN RISES through the window, Sadako sits on her bed 
           folding her cranes. Even with her swollen hands, the origami 
           takes shape in an extraordinary way. 

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sadako sits at a table with Fujiko and carefully folds TINY 
           CRANES out of CANDY WRAPPERS, utilizing her needle technique. 

           The PURPLE MARKS on her hands and neck have spread. Sadako’s 
           fingers shake. It is becoming increasingly difficult.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Perhaps you should take a break.

                                 SADAKO
                        I don’t need a break. I need more 
                        paper.

           An OLD WOMAN, a fellow patient, PURPLE MARKS all over her, 
           sits behind them. She overhears the conversation and looks 
           down to the tray in front of her: 

           Next to her food and water are her PILLS. Wrapped in PAPER.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Sadako?

           Sadako and Fujiko look up. The woman holds out THE PAPER HER 
           PILLS WERE WRAPPED IN.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        It would be an honor for me if you 
                        would accept this as a gift. 

           Sadako stands and bows to the woman then accepts the paper. 
           Another PATIENT witnessed what just happened and gets up to 
           give Sadako their paper. Then ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

           Soon, the ENTIRE CAFETERIA has lined up to donate their paper 
           to Sadako, who bows to each and every one of them.

           Fujiko is overwhelmed with gratitude. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL GARDEN - DAY

           Sadako sits in a circle with THREE YOUNG PATIENTS and teaches 
           them to fold paper cranes. Although she is clearly very sick, 
           she laughs and engages with the young children.

           Sadako sees a YOUNG GIRL off to the side, sad and alone. She 
           walks over to her and hands her the crane she just folded.

                                 SADAKO
                        Now you only have nine-hundred and 
                        ninety-nine to go.

           Fujiko sits nearby and watches Sadako lead the girl to the 
           circle with the other children. Her daughter is amazing.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako gets into bed and stares at all her cranes, hanging 
           from the ceiling, littered around the room. Beside her bed is 
           a stack of ORIGAMI PAPER. She grabs several sheets. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Nine-hundred and ninety-seven, 
                        ninety-eight, ninety-nine...

           She lifts the page that will become her one thousandth crane. 
           It’s GOLD colored. She stares at the gold paper then looks to 
           the cranes all around her. 

           Sadako grabs a pencil and writes something on the gold paper. 

           After she’s finished writing, she stares at it and smiles, at 
           peace with her decision.

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - NURSE’S STATION - DAY

           Nurse Satomi is at work behind the desk. Dr. Numata runs by.

                                 DR. NUMATA
                        Quick, nurse! Now!
           Nurse Satomi runs off to the emergency. She follows Numata as 
           he runs INTO SADAKO’S ROOM...

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A CROWD has gathered under the HUNDREDS OF CRANES dangling 
           from the ceiling. All shapes, sizes and colors fill the room. 

           PATIENTS, DOCTORS, NURSES watch from the back. Mr. Nomura and 
           the students from Bamboo class, led by Tomiko, are all there. 

           Sadako’s family are there up against the bed where Sadako 
           sits, dressed in her kimono, holding the golden origami paper 
           in front of her.

           She looks to her family and friends. They are so excited. But 
           as Sadako lifts the paper to fold, her hand trembles. She’s 
           done this so many times before, but for some reason, she just 
           can’t make the folds. 

           The excitement in the room dips as people start to wonder 
           what’s going on.

           Sadako looks to her mother, helpless. But it is too much for 
           Fujiko. She forces a smile, but when Sadako looks away she 
           excuses herself from the room.

           Sadako finally begins to fold.

           The whole room watches in silence as she makes twenty-four 
           perfect seams and creases.

           OUTSIDE HER DOOR -- Fujiko leans against the wall. She takes 
           deep breaths to try and calm down but is losing the fight.

           INSIDE, Sadako lifts the bird to her lips, takes a DEEP 
           BREATH and blows the golden crane to life. She holds it in 
           her hand and turns to the crowd.

                                 SADAKO
                        One thousand.

           Fujiko breaks down. The people inside the room APPLAUD for 
           Sadako, but Fujiko just cries harder. 

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           It is just Fujiko and Sadako left. The day has taken a lot 
           out of Sadako and she is worn out. So is Fujiko as she helps 
           her get from the bathroom to her bed. She glances around at 
           the thousand paper cranes hanging off the ceiling.
                                 FUJIKO
                        You did it, Sadako. Your father and 
                        I are so very proud.

           Fujiko seems weak. Older, tired, never far away from the next 
           attack of emotions. Sadako watches her with concern.

                                 SADAKO
                        Are you alright, mother?

                                 FUJIKO
                        Just a headache. I’ll be fine. 

                                 SADAKO
                        You should lay down.

           Sadako slides over in bed and clears a space for her. Fujiko 
           considers, then joins Sadako in bed. Their heads lay beside 
           each other, looking up at the thousand cranes... But it’s far 
           from the joy of earlier. It’s now profoundly sad. 

           Fujiko can no longer hold it in...

                                 FUJIKO
                        I’m sorry, Sadako. I’m so sorry. I 
                        never should have started this.  
                        You’ve worked so hard and deserve 
                        to have your wish come true. It was 
                        not fair of me to lie to you. I 
                        just didn’t know what else to do--

                                 SADAKO
                        It’s alright, Mother, it’s 
                        alright... My wish will come true. 
                        I know it will.

           Fujiko looks to her daughter, who smiles warmly. For the 
           first time she sees it... There is no delusion here. Sadako 
           knows exactly what is happening and she accepts it bravely. 

                                 SADAKO
                        Thank you. You have given me a 
                        wonderful gift.

           The weight of her guilt is slowly lifted off Fujiko’s 
           shoulders and she becomes exhausted, like she hasn’t slept in 
           months. She can’t keep her eyes open. 

                                 SADAKO
                        It’s okay to rest, Mother. You must 
                        get some sleep if tomorrow is ever 
                        going to come.
           Sadako strokes her mother’s hair and hums to her until she 
           falls asleep.

                                 SHIGEO (V.O.)
                        Sadako continued folding her cranes 
                        until she passed. They were her 
                        passion and her wish. Now, they 
                        must carry her to the heavens so 
                        she may watch over us.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - DAY

           THE PHOTOGRAPH OF SADAKO DRESSED IN THE KIMONO is on display. 

           Shigeo and Fujiko stand at the front of a crowd of MOURNERS 
           with a BOX FULL OF SADAKO’S CRANES.

           Fujiko sees Tomiko in the crowd, crying. She approaches and 
           gives her a crane from the box. It’s hard for her to let go.

                                 SHIGEO
                        Please come forward. Sadako would 
                        want you all to have one.

           EXT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           SNOW falls over Hiroshima. Outside the barbershop, Fujiko 
           brushes away snow with a broom before she heads inside.

           INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Shigeo snips away at a CUSTOMER’S hair while Fujiko sweeps. 
           The door opens and Tomiko excitedly runs in. 

                                 SHIGEO
                        Tomiko--

                                 TOMIKO
                        Sorry, Sensei, but I have news. 
                        Wonderful news. Look at this!

           Out of breath, she holds up a FLYER with SADAKO’S PICTURE on 
           it (Note: this is the same flyer Eleanor received). 

                                 TOMIKO
                        The National Principals’ Convention 
                        was today. Principals from all over 
                        Japan were here in Hiroshima. All 
                        the children at school donated 
                        their allowances and we printed two 
                        thousand of these.
                                 SHIGEO
                        What does it say?

           Tomiko reads out loud.

                                 TOMIKO
                        Our dear friend Sadako Sasaki died 
                        on October twenty-fifth... 

           As she continues to read...

           INT. NOBORICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           The ex-students of BAMBOO CLASS wheel a MIMEOGRAPH MACHINE 
           into their old classroom. They print FLYERS which all have 
           SADAKO’s PICTURE on them. 

                                 TOMIKO (V.O.)
                        She was sick with A-Bomb disease. 
                        And Sadako fought bravely in the 
                        hospital for nine long months.

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER COURTYARD - DAY

           Tomiko and the CHILDREN stand outside the CONVENTION CENTER, 
           armed with the flyers. They wait patiently, determined. 

                                 TOMIKO (V.O.)
                        It was not her war, but she was 
                        forced to pay the price.  

           The doors of the center open and the PRINCIPALS come out. Men 
           dressed sharply in suits, HUNDREDS of them pour out. 

                                 TOMIKO (V.O.)
                        We do not want her death to be in 
                        vain, so we, her classmates wish to 
                        build a statue for Sadako and a 
                        monument for all the children who 
                        died because of Pikadon. 

           The children are surrounded by the throng of principals. They 
           PASS OUT THE FLYERS and BEG FOR THEIR ATTENTION.

                                 TOMIKO (V.O.)
                        We ask you to convey our message to 
                        all our fellow junior high school 
                        students throughout the country. 
                        And encourage them to support us.

           The Principals all read the flyer, all clearly affected. All 
           engage with the children. Some give money immediately.  
                                 TOMIKO (V.O.)
                        We came today to make this plea. 
                        Will you join us? Will you help?

           Soon, the men have left and the children are once again alone 
           in the courtyard. All of the flyers are GONE.

           INT. NOBORICHO SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Campaign headquarters. STUDENTS fly around the classroom, 
           busily producing flyers to raise money for the statue. The 
           walls are filled with posters and leaflets. 

           A ROUGH DRAWING OF SADAKO’S STATUE hangs on the center wall. 

           Tomiko leads Shigeo and Fujiko inside. Fujiko is in a world 
           of her own. Everywhere she turns, there is Sadako. Suddenly, 
           her emotions crash in on her and she has to leave the room.

           INT. SASAKI HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Fujiko sits on the floor next to an open WOODEN BOX. It’s 
           filled with SADAKO’S THINGS...

           A KOKESHI DOLL.

           HER CHERRY BLOSSOM KIMONO.

           She picks up Sadako’s DIARY, filled with pages of Sadako’s 
           beautiful handwriting. Fujiko is awash in painful memory. She 
           closes the diary, and as she does, something catches her eye: 

           Inside the box are the LAST OF SADAKO’S CRANES. Among them 
           the GOLDEN CRANE, number one thousand. 

           There’s WRITING on it. Fujiko pulls out the crane and reads 
           the writing that Sadako left inscribed on its wings... 

           Her face hardens. The crane becomes the focus of all her 
           anguish and she CRUSHES IT in her hand.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Robbie has his head pressed against the window as they pull 
           up to the bus stop. The crowd of mothers are there as usual, 
           but this time...

           ELEANOR IS THERE.
           EXT. BUS STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Robbie steps off the bus, almost in disbelief that she’s 
           there. He seems hesitant to accept it...

           Eleanor tears up at the sight of him. She opens her arms...

           And he runs to her. They embrace and she lifts him off the 
           ground, a feeling of wholeness returning to them both.

           INT. COERR HOME - ROBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The bed is covered with ORIGAMI CRANES. Eleanor and Robbie 
           sit together amongst them, a new closeness between them.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I wish I could have helped her.

                                 ELEANOR
                        What do you mean?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Get to a thousand. Then her wish 
                        would have come true.

           Eleanor opens her mouth to correct him but the words don’t 
           come out... 

           Robbie looks up at her, hope in his eyes...

                                 ROBBIE
                        How many did she fold?

           As she looks at her son’s concerned face, the weight of her 
           reply fully dawns on her. She has only a split-second to make 
           the right choice for her son and speaks from the heart.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        Six hundred and forty-four. 

           He’s disappointed, but the magic of the story is still alive. 
           He begins to do the math in his head, using his fingers to 
           keep count. Eleanor smiles, intrigued.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Three hundred and fifty-six. That’s 
                        how many I need to fold. 

           Eleanor is taken aback by the sentiment. She’s in awe of her 
           son’s compassion for a girl he never met. 
                                 ELEANOR
                        Are you sure? That could take us a 
                        while...

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m sure.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        Alright then, Captain. Let’s get 
                        started.

           Robbie’s enthusiasm falters slightly...

                                 ROBBIE
                        Dad used to call me Captain.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I remember. Do you want me to stop?

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. I like it. 

           They get started on their mission together. 

           And that’s when it hits her. Suddenly she knows exactly what 
           needs to be done...

           INT. COERR HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           The typewriter keys attack the page like a hailstorm; the 
           words flow through Eleanor and onto the page.

           The joy and sadness, tragedy and hope, all coming back to 
           life in the story.

           SADAKO’S JOURNAL is open on the desk beside her... 

           DAYS PASS while ELEANOR TYPES and we see FLASHBACKS OF SADAKO 
           woven with moments of ELEANOR, WYM AND ROBBIE FOLDING CRANES. 

           INT. COERR HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           Eleanor flips through the PAGES OF HER MANUSCRIPT, crossing 
           things out and making notes.  

           Sadako’s journal is near-by, open to the final page with the 
           TALLY MARKS. Eleanor looks to it, contemplative...

                                 WYM (O.S.)
                        Ellie.
           She turns around to see Wym and Robbie with a long STRAND OF 
           CRANES held between them.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Oh my word! They’re beautiful!

           She gets out of her chair and walks over to it, running her 
           hand down the line. She looks to Robbie.

                                 ELEANOR
                        What should we do with them all?

           He clearly has something very important in mind...

           EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

           The sun sets behind a TOMBSTONE decorated with MILITARY 
           MEDALS. The inscription reads: 

           “LT. ROBERT J. HICKS. 1915-1953.”

           Robbie lays his paper cranes on his father’s grave. 

           Eleanor leans down and kisses the top of his head. 

           They stay there for a while, hand-in-hand, mourning their 
           loss but also finding the strength to move forward. 

           When they’re ready, they turn away and walk back to the car 
           where Wym waits for them.

           INT. ELEANOR’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Eleanor picks up her manuscript. Her mind races as she flips 
           to THE LAST PAGE... 

           “IN THE END, SADAKO FOLDED WELL OVER A THOUSAND CRANES...”

           With an inspired smile, she CRUMPLES IT UP.

           A BLANK PAGE goes in the typewriter and Eleanor types out a 
           new ending:  

           “BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP, SADAKO MANAGED TO FOLD ONLY ONE 
           PAPER CRANE. SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR... IT WAS THE LAST 
           ONE SHE EVER MADE.”

           She sits back and looks at what she just wrote, taking her 
           last chance to reconsider... But her mind is made up.
           EXT. COERR HOME - DAWN 

           THE PAPERBOY delivers newspapers along the street. 

           INT. COERR HOME - MORNING 

           Robbie comes out of his room and is surprised to see Wym 
           outside Eleanor’s office looking in. Wym holds his finger to 
           his lips. Robbie walks over and looks inside for himself...

           Eleanor is fast asleep with her head down on the desk. Next 
           to her is a THIN MANUSCRIPT. Robbie reads the title:

           “SADAKO AND THE THOUSAND PAPER CRANES: A CHILDREN’S STORY”

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s a kid’s book?

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. BENTON PUBLISHERS - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Eleanor, dressed as sharp as ever, walks into a large high-
           rise. A SIGN on the entrance reads: “Benton Publishers”.  

           INT. BENTON PUBLISHERS - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Eleanor sits with her PORTFOLIO on her lap. All around her 
           are images of FRIENDLY ANIMALS and SMILING, HAPPY CHILDREN.

           Beside her is a man, TODD, nervously shuffling in his seat. 
           He holds a BIG DRAWING OF A CARTOON MOOSE. Eleanor stares.

                                 TODD
                        His name is Monty Moose. He was 
                        kidnapped from his home in Alaska 
                        and now has to trek across America 
                        to get home. What’s yours about?

                                 ELEANOR
                        A girl who died from leukemia.

           The smile fades from Todd’s face and he looks around him. 

                                 TODD
                        Wait, am I in the right place?

           Eleanor is thinking the same thing.
           INT. BENTON PUBLISHERS - BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Eleanor sits at a long table, opposite MEL BENTON (30s), who 
           has a smile so wide it looks like it hurts. 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t beat around the bush, Mrs. 
                        Coerr, so let me just come out and 
                        say I love this book.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You do? 

                                 MEL
                        Absolutely. Great story. Kids will 
                        love Sadako. Plus all the stuff 
                        with the paper? That’s great stuff. 

           Eleanor thinks she might cry. It’s overwhelming her.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I knew it. This story wants to be 
                        told, it always has--

                                 MEL
                        Hold up one second now...

           The brakes are hit. Eleanor comes back down to Earth.

                                 MEL 
                        I love the story. I love the 
                        writing. But I am a little worried 
                        the book isn’t quite...

           He searches for the right way to say it. It hits him.

                                 MEL 
                        Fitting our brand.

                                 ELEANOR
                        So you don’t want the story?

                                 MEL
                        No, no, I do. Just with a few 
                        changes...

                                 ELEANOR
                        Changes? Like what?

           INT. PUBLISHER #2’S OFFICE - DAY

           Eleanor sits in front of a different man (PUBLISHER #2), but 
           the ART ON THE WALLS and entire office is eerily similar. 
                                 PUBLISHER #2
                        For starters, why does Sadako have 
                        to be Japanese? Why can’t she be an 
                        American?

           Eleanor can’t tell if he’s joking. It becomes clear he isn’t.

                                 ELEANOR
                        There was never a bomb dropped in 
                        America.

           INT. PUBLISHER #3’S OFFICE - DAY

           Another day, another suit.

                                 PUBLISHER #3
                        That’s another thing. Maybe we just 
                        leave out the whole bomb stuff.

           Eleanor is more confused then anything else.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Then how does she get leukemia?

           INT. PUBLISHER #4’S OFFICE - DAY

           PUBLISHER #4 is the least likeable yet.

                                 PUBLISHER #4
                        This is the best part, ready? She 
                        doesn’t. Her pet crane does. Her 
                        pet crane, who can absolutely be 
                        Japanese, was there for the bomb 
                        then flew to America, is the one 
                        that gets sick and dies. Sadako 
                        lives!

                                 ELEANOR
                        But she’s dead...

           INT. PUTNAM PUBLISHERS - DAY 

           MR. WINTON is different from the other publishers, older with 
           more authority, but his message remains the same.

                                 MR. WINTON
                        Look. Mrs. Coerr. My job is to get 
                        our books in front of as many kids 
                        as possible. As it is, this story 
                        is just too dark, too difficult, 
                        and frankly, too real for children.
           Eleanor gathers herself to make her plea. She’s not going to 
           let this go again without a fight.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Mr. Winton, Sadako’s story is 
                        difficult, yes, but that is what 
                        makes it special. Despite her 
                        immense suffering, Sadako somehow 
                        still lived her life filled with 
                        hope. That’s what children pick up 
                        on when they hear this story... 
                        Hope. It’s us, the parents, that 
                        choose to focus on everything else. 

           She’s got his attention now and doesn’t let it go. 

                                 ELEANOR (CONT’D)
                        But we can’t let our fear stop us 
                        from giving our children the 
                        information they need. If you tell 
                        a kid two hundred thousand people 
                        died, they just don’t get it. The 
                        numbers are simply too large to 
                        comprehend. But one little girl? 
                        They identify with that girl. They 
                        feel they know her because she’s 
                        just like them. And they want to 
                        help her. Can you imagine the power 
                        of a generation growing up with 
                        this girl in their hearts? 

           She’s said everything she can. The choice is now his...

                                 TEACHER (V.O.)
                        Children, I want you to give a very 
                        warm and special welcome to Eleanor 
                        Coerr, who has come today to talk 
                        to you about her new book...

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Eleanor stands in front of a CLASSROOM FULL OF CHILDREN. 

           The TEACHER holds up a first edition copy of her book, with a 
           beautifully DRAWN ILLUSTRATION of Sadako on the cover...

                                 TEACHER
                        Sadako and the Thousand Paper 
                        Cranes.
                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank you and hello, everyone. 
                        Today, I would like to tell you a 
                        true story and while I do, I want 
                        to show you how to turn this--

           She lifts up a SQUARE OF PAPER.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Into this.

           She lifts up an ORIGAMI CRANE. The children’s eyes light up.

                                 ELEANOR
                        So what do you say? Do you want to 
                        hear a story?

           The response is an emphatic “yes.” Eleanor beams and begins 
           to tell the class about Sadako and the thousand paper cranes-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ABC NEWS REPORT FOOTAGE: 

           THOUSANDS of copies of ELEANOR’S BOOK roll off a printing 
           press. The ILLUSTRATED COVER then fills the screen.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        You may not have heard of the book 
                        Sadako and the Thousand Paper 
                        Cranes, but the odds are that your 
                        children have. 

           The report cuts to ELEANOR in front of a class of children, 
           teaching them how to fold a paper crane. Eleanor walks around 
           the room while the REPORT CONTINUES:

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The author, Eleanor Coerr, has 
                        spent years travelling to 
                        elementary schools around the 
                        country and telling the story of 
                        Sadako Sasaki, a young Japanese 
                        girl who died of leukemia caused by 
                        the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
                        Sadako took comfort in an old 
                        legend that said if she could fold 
                        a thousand origami cranes then the 
                        gods would grant her wish and make 
                        her well. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She only managed to fold six 
                        hundred and forty-four before she 
                        died, so now Mrs. Coerr invites 
                        children to complete Sadako’s 
                        cranes and make their own wishes. 
                        But what are they wishing for?

           The FOOTAGE cuts to INTERVIEWS with children (REAL FOOTAGE).

                                 CHILD 1
                        My wish is for no more bombs.

                                 CHILD 2
                        We want peace. We don’t want what 
                        happened to Sadako to happen again.

                                 CHILD 3
                        I think that they should think 
                        before they drop bombs. Think of 
                        all the children that should have 
                        the chance to live.

                                 ELEANOR 
                        Children want to do something. But 
                        they think I’m only a child, what 
                        can I do? Folding the paper cranes 
                        allows them a way to express their 
                        feelings and do something to let 
                        the world know they want peace.

           The report cuts to an overhead shot of Hiroshima.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The next stop for Mrs. Coerr is 
                        back to Hiroshima, where the Mayor 
                        has invited her to bring all the 
                        cranes she’s been given over the 
                        years to the statue of Sadako 
                        Sasaki. Just maybe the wishes of 
                        the world’s children can come true 
                        after all...

           INT. AIRPLANE

           In a row of FIRST CLASS SEATS, sit BAGS filled with THOUSANDS 
           and THOUSANDS OF PAPER CRANES. 

           BACK IN COACH, Eleanor sits next to Wym, who is asleep 
           against the window, and ROBBIE (now 18). She nervously checks 
           on her precious cargo ahead.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Nervous?
                                 ELEANOR
                        No, they seem secure up there. 
                        Better be with the cost of the 
                        tickets.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Not about the cranes, Mom.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        What else would I be nervous about? 
                        I’ve been there before.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah, but never with the weight of 
                        thousands of wishes on your back.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I don’t get nervous, dear. You 
                        should know that by now.

           With a smile, he closes his eyes to rest. As soon as he does, 
           Eleanor’s cool exterior disappears. She is so damn nervous. 
           She hears a commotion down the aisle and turns to look...

           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT speaks panicked Japanese with an OLD MAN 
           TRYING TO TAKE OFF HIS PANTS.

                        Sensei, please! We don’t do that 
                        anymore! Leave your pants on!

           Eleanor can’t contain her smile. A lot has changed...

           EXT. HIROSHIMA MEMORIAL PEACE PARK - DAY

           The TREES in the peace park have grown tall and lush, 
           thriving in the rebuilt park. 

           The whole place is abuzz with activity as WORKERS and 
           TOURISTS get ready for the big anniversary ceremony.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - HIROSHIMA - EARLY MORNING

           A traditional Japanese hotel room is filled with BAGS AND 
           BAGS OF PAPER CRANES. They are everywhere. Eleanor writes 
           away at a desk, as she’s done so many times before. 

           Wym exits the bathroom in a SUIT and TIE and joins Robbie 
           who’s been waiting for him. 

                                 WYM
                        Tie or no tie?
           He models the suit with tie look. Robbie considers.

                                 ROBBIE
                        No tie. You look like an 
                        undertaker.

                                 WYM
                        Well, this has been quite the 
                        undertaking.

           Tumbleweeds. Eleanor and Robbie look to each other.

                                 ROBBIE
                        They just get worse.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I know.

                                 ROBBIE
                        We’re going to head down to catch 
                        some of the preparations.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’ll be right behind you.

           Wym kisses her on the cheek as they leave.

                                 WYM
                        Don’t be long now.

           The door closes behind them. Eleanor goes back to her work...   

           A few moments later, A KNOCK at the door interrupts her. 
           Frustrated, she gets up and crosses to the door. 

                                 ELEANOR
                        What have you two forgotten--

           She is stunned to see FUJIKO (50s) in her doorway, stoic and 
           poised. Eleanor knows immediately who it is, and after the 
           initial shock, bows deeply.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        Mrs. Sasaki. It is an honor.

           Fujiko speaks in broken, but serviceable English.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Fujiko, please. May I come in?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Of course.
           Eleanor notices that in Fujiko’s hands is a copy of her book: 
           “SADAKO AND THE THOUSAND PAPER CRANES.”

           Fujiko sees the PAPER CRANES all around the room and notices 
           all the individual wishes written on the cranes.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Where do they all come from?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Everywhere. Children mostly, but 
                        not always. I get more every day 
                        from all over the world.

           Fujiko lifts up a STRAND OF CRANES and admires it. She has to 
           take a seat to collect herself.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I hoped you would be here. I have 
                        something that belongs to you...

           She walks to her suitcase and retrieves SADAKO’S JOURNAL. 
           Fujiko can’t hide the bittersweet emotion of having it back. 
           She walks to the window and looks out over the city.

                                 FUJIKO
                        After Sadako died, I could not 
                        stand the sight of this place. The 
                        house she slept in. The streets she 
                        ran down. The school she loved with 
                        all her heart. 

           Fujiko takes a moment to steady herself. Eleanor offers her a 
           handkerchief, which she uses to dry her eyes.

                                 FUJIKO
                        But a question brought me back. One 
                        answer I need from you, Eleanor. In 
                        your book, you said Sadako only 
                        folded six hundred and forty four 
                        cranes. But that’s not true. She 
                        folded many more and you knew that.

           Fujiko holds up the journal as proof. Eleanor has known that 
           some day she would have to answer for this.

                                 FUJIKO
                        Why did you do it? Why did you lie?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I’m so sorry, Fujiko. I truly am... 
                        But the truth wasn’t good enough 
                        for Sadako. It wasn’t fair. She 
                        earned her wish. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Your daughter showed the power of a 
                        hope so strong that no force in the 
                        world can break it and I saw that 
                        same hope in my son’s face when I 
                        told him her story all those years 
                        ago. You know better than me, a 
                        child’s hope is such a delicate 
                        thing... I was afraid that if he 
                        knew Sadako’s wish didn’t come 
                        true, it would be lost forever. I 
                        had to protect it, Fujiko. I had 
                        to. I had to keep her wish alive... 
                        I hope you can forgive me. 

           Eleanor braces herself for whatever criticism may be coming 
           her way, but to her surprise, Fujiko just smiles. A tearful, 
           wonderful smile. She sees the confusion on Eleanor’s face...

                                 FUJIKO
                        You really had no idea...

           Fujiko reaches into her bag and pulls out THE GOLDEN CRANE, 
           number one thousand, which looks a little worse for the wear 
           over the years. She offers it to Eleanor. 

                                 FUJIKO
                        This is number one thousand. The 
                        crane that was supposed to bring 
                        Sadako’s wish to life.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I can’t take that.

                                 FUJIKO
                        You must. I was never meant to keep 
                        it. It was just too hard to let go. 

           Eleanor finally accepts. With the crane in her hands she 
           feels closer to Sadako then she ever has. It’s then that she 
           notices WRITING ON THE SIDE OF THE CRANE.

                                 FUJIKO
                        I was upset for years that she 
                        changed her wish, but when I saw my 
                        Sadako’s story actually spread 
                        around the world, I finally 
                        understood. Thank you. 

           She bows to Eleanor who returns the gesture. 

           On her way out of the room, Fujiko reaches out and touches 
           the cranes Eleanor brought with her. She runs her fingers 
           from one strand to the next, filled with love and pride for 
           her daughter.
           Once Fujiko has left, Eleanor sits down at her desk. She 
           gently sets Sadako’s Golden Crane in front of her and reads 
           the message on the wing. It just about stops her heart...

           INT. SADAKO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sadako sits on her bed and writes her wish on the GOLD PAPER. 
           She finishes and reflects on her decision...

           A CRASHING SOUND from outside her room startles her. Nervous, 
           she gets out of bed and steps into the corridor...

           INT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           All the lights are off, everything is dark. 

           Sadako walks down the corridor to the nurse’s station and 
           sees it has been RIPPED APART. BUSTED CABINETS and FILES 
           EVERYWHERE. She looks in all directions but sees no nurses.

           She sees HER FILE open on the floor. She closes her eyes, 
           afraid to look at it...

           A SHADOW DARTS behind her. She turns around--

           But sees nothing. She then hears the GROWL...

           She turns back and it’s there... 

           THE WOLF.

           Sadako looks around for help, but she’s alone. 

           The WOLF SNARLS and moves towards her...

           Sadako runs away. To her surprise, she can run like she used 
           to! Fast and powerful. As she realizes she can do it, she 
           gains even more speed.

           But no matter how fast she is, it is not as fast as a wolf. 

           She rounds a corner and sees the STAIRWELL to the roof at the 
           end of the hall. She runs as fast as she can...

           THE WOLF’S SHADOW lines the walls and looms over her... 

           HE IS RIGHT ON HER HEELS... 

           She gets to the stairwell door and SLAMS IT CLOSED behind 
           her. THE WOLF CLAWS AND SCRATCHES. Sadako runs upstairs.
           EXT. RED CROSS HOSPITAL - ROOFTOP - DAWN

           Sadako bursts onto the roof. She frantically looks around. 
           There is nowhere for her to go. Dawn breaks in the sky. 

           Then she hears it... A LOW GROWL.

           She turns to see the wolf on the roof with her. It’s bigger 
           than before. More terrifying than ever. 

           The wolf steps towards her. She backs up until her feet hit 
           the edge. Behind her is just a straight drop to the street. 

           There’s nowhere left for her to go.

           As the wolf continues to inch closer to her, it dawns on her--

           Suddenly, Sadako is filled with courage. She stands tall and 
           locks eyes with the wolf.

                                 SADAKO
                        I am not afraid of you.

           And STEPS TOWARDS THE WOLF. 

           The WOLF STOPS. It stares back at her, confused. 

           Sadako hardens her gaze. 

                                 SADAKO
                        I am not afraid of you!

           Sadako does not relent. She walks right up to the wolf, until 
           they are inches away from each other. She stares it down... 

                                 SADAKO
                        I am not afraid of you anymore!

           And the WOLF SUBMITS TO HER. That’s when she sees it... 
           Something in the wolf’s eyes. Something not scary, but SAD. 

           Sadako suddenly feels immense compassion for the frightened 
           animal. She kneels beside it and reaches out her hand to pet 
           the wolf’s head, but just as her hand is about to touch it-- 

           THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT! THE WOLF SPRINGS IN THE AIR!

           Sadako falls backwards and shields her eyes. Then she sees 
           the wolf has turned into...

           A LARGE, BEAUTIFUL WHITE CRANE, WINGS OUTSPREAD. 

           Sadako is startled with delight. 
                                 SADAKO
                        Have you come to grant my wish?

           The CRANE calls out. 

           The morning sun rises higher in the sky. Sadako’s gaze is 
           drawn out over Hiroshima. The home she loves, the city that 
           has suffered so much. She knows what she wishes for more than 
           anything and turns back to the crane.

                                 SADAKO
                        My wish is peace. Carry it with you 
                        and fly all over the world.

           The crane BOWS then FLIES AWAY, joining a FLOCK overhead. 

           Sadako smiles and watches the cranes circle over Hiroshima.

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        Thirteen steps...

           EXT. HIROSHIMA CHILDREN'S PEACE PARK - DAY

           ELEANOR enters the park and walks past the MEMORIAL CENOTAPH, 
           an open, saddle-shaped concrete structure facing the Genbaku 
           Dome. She takes in the scene around her:

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        ...Twenty-four folds.

           FAMILIES together, life everywhere. It’s come so far from the 
           last time she had been here.

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        The orizuru is the most popular of 
                        all origami.

           A group of CHILDREN run past. Curious, Eleanor follows them 
           deeper into the park until she sees it...

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        In Japan, the crane is believed to 
                        be a magical creature that can live 
                        for a thousand years...

           THE STATUE OF SADAKO SASAKI stands proudly, a beacon at the 
           heart of the Peace Park.

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        A legend promises if a person folds 
                        one thousand orizuru, they will be 
                        granted a wish. This is called 
                        Senbazuru...
           THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PAPER CRANES fill the area around 
           the base and hang from the statue itself.

           She walks up to the statue and touches it... She brushes 
           PAPER CRANES aside to read the INSCRIPTION at the base:

           “THIS IS OUR CRY. THIS IS OUR PRAYER. PEACE IN THE WORLD.”

           Eleanor looks up at the girl who forever changed her life. 

           A LIGHT BREEZE blows past and makes the cranes rustle and 
           sway, as though they are flying. 

                                 SADAKO (V.O.)
                        One Thousand Paper Cranes.

           END CARDS:

           Eleanor Coerr’s Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes became a 
           best selling children’s book all around the world.

           To this day, the book is taught in elementary schools. 

           Through reading the book children learn how to fold cranes 
           and inspire peace.

           The Children’s Peace Monument in Hiroshima receives tens of 
           millions of paper cranes each year folded by children all 
           over the world.  

           They all share in Sadako's final wish...
                     The Children's Peace Statue is a monument for peace to 
                     commemorate Sadako Sasaki and the thousands of child 
                          victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
