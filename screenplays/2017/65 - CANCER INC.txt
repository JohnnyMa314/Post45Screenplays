                               kill the placebo group."

          effect, used as a control in testing new drugs.

           INT. DENDREON HQ (SEATTLE) - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Sitting at the head of a prosaic conference table is DR. 
           MITCHELL GOLD (42), CEO of biotech Dendreon Corp. Mitch’s 
           black hair is cropped as short as his 5'4" frame. He 
           addresses a speakerphone in a monotone that never conveys 
           quite as much enthusiasm as his word choice.

                        35 years ago, when our country 
                        officially declared war on cancer, 
                        it was killing more people per year 
                        than was lost during all of world 
                        war two.

           Surrounding Gold is MARK FROHLICH (41), the bespectacled and 
           nerdy Chief Medical Officer, and the unflappable straight-
           laced MONIQUE GREER (44), Chief of Staff.

                        Yet, the rate of new cancer cases 
                        continues to climb, making 
                        innovative treatments that prolong 
                        life more important than ever.

                        With our drug Provenge, we’ve 
                        succeeded in facing this challenge, 
                        and with today's submission to the 
                        FDA, we at Dendreon now officially 
                        lead the charge into a new era in 
                        the war on cancer.

           Greer nods to Gold, satisfied to hear the words she wrote.

                        I'll take questions.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           We’re behind a blond-haired WOMAN cross-legged on a bed, 
           taking notes as she listens from a Blackberry’s speakerphone.

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE (NYC) - THE SPOTTED PIG - NIGHT

           A Henry James era New York brownstone, now a restaurant. 
           SUPER: West Village - New York

           A drunk MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE waltz in slushy circles on the 
           sidewalk. They descend onto the street. A yellow cab with a 
           backlit Pharma ad SCREECHES to a stop, BLARES the horn.

           The startled couple flip the bird, HECKLE, dance again. The 
           taxi SPEEDS off.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE (NYC) - THE SPOTTED PIG - NIGHT

           The original gastro pub of NYC. For such a trendy creative 
           class haunt, the wannabe ratio remains surprisingly low.

           Upstairs, alone at a cramped two-top sits MARIE HUBER (32). 
           Slightly fidgety with a hyper alertness, she is at once 
           athletic, cerebral, and pretty, with the signature blond 
           locks we’ve already been introduced to.

           Marie window-shops the diners; freely drinks a gin and tonic.

                                 ANDREW (O.S)
                        Marie?

           Marie turns to her Match.com date, ANDREW (33), handsome, an 
           average guy by all appearances.

                                 MARIE
                        Andrew?

                                 ANDREW
                        Nice to meet you.

           Andrew goes in for a hug, but since she's sitting and he's 
           standing, his shoulder shoves against her face. Awkward. 
           There is a transactional speed and efficiency to this chat.

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                            (sitting)
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                 MARIE
                        Actually, you’re slightly more 
                        punctual than others. My average 
                        Match date is 16 minutes and 19 
                        seconds late.

                                 ANDREW
                        You're kidding me, you keep track?

                                 MARIE
                        It's not personal.
                                 ANDREW
                        Kind-a.

                                 MARIE
                        I’ve learned data is the most 
                        reliable promise. The chap before 
                        you was 25 minutes late. I’m 
                        generally lenient, but that didn’t 
                        go well.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m the second guy tonight? 

                                 MARIE
                        Third. But you’re the only dinner. 
                        I’m starved.

                                 ANDREW
                        Wow.

                                 MARIE
                        Why limit ourselves, right? 

                                 ANDREW
                        Is dessert stationed at the bar?

                                 MARIE
                        Only if you screw it up.

                                 ANDREW
                        Wow.
                            (hailing server)
                        I’ll take whatever pilsner you have 
                        on draft. And...?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes please.

                                 ANDREW
                        Another for her.

           The server leaves.

                                 MARIE
                        You're cuter in person. You should 
                        update your photo. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Thanks for the advice.
                            (awkward beat)
                        Are you like one of these people 
                        that always says what they think?
                                 MARIE
                        The truth at all costs, isn't that 
                        what they say?

                                 ANDREW
                        I never met 'they'.

           Andrew wishing his beer were there, drinks water.

                                 MARIE
                        So. Andrew, how was your day?

                                 ANDREW
                        My day? Okay I guess. Same ole, ya 
                        know.

                                 MARIE
                        Not really. We just met. What is 
                        ‘same ole’ in Andrew's world?

                                 ANDREW
                        Uh. Wow. Wake up at 8. Shower. Eat 
                        an apple. Head to work.

                                 MARIE
                        Work. Where do you work?

                                 ANDREW
                        An ad agency. You?

                                 MARIE
                        Midtown?

                                 ANDREW
                        Yeah.

           The drinks come.

                                 MARIE
                        Cheers.

                                 ANDREW
                        Cheers.

           They drink.

                                 MARIE
                        What is your job in advertising?

                                 ANDREW
                        I'm a producer.

                                 MARIE
                        Of?
                                 ANDREW
                        Campaigns mostly.

                                 MARIE
                        Anything I would know? I'm a 
                        terrible consumer, but try me.

                                 ANDREW
                        Um... Lays potatoes? 

                                 MARIE
                        I try to stay away from food-like 
                        things in colorful bags. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Wow. You're tough. I shoulda 
                        guessed from all those heady quotes 
                        on your website.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, come on. A little challenge is 
                        always fun, isn't it?

                                 ANDREW
                        On a date?

                                 MARIE
                        For example, where in your work do 
                        you find the most depth-- the real 
                        gooey stuff?

                                 ANDREW
                        Uh-um. I guess to trick people to 
                        buy shit they don't need?...
                            (changing subject)
                        What about you? You English?

                                 MARIE
                        Half. Mum’s English, Pop was from 
                        Germany.

           Before Andrew can demonstrate compassion:

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking. He was 
                        57 when I was born. He got sick 
                        soon after and passed away before I 
                        entered university.

                                 ANDREW
                        Sorry about that.
                                 MARIE
                        I suppose bathing your father isn’t 
                        a typical teenage experience.

           Awkward drink.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        See, people haven’t much stomach 
                        for the gooey stuff.

                                 ANDREW
                        Uh. Um. What about you? Your work.

           Marie raises her glass.

                                 MARIE
                        I just started a new job. New 
                        career, sort of.

                                 ANDREW
                        Celebrating with three dates?
                            (joke doesn’t land)
                        What job?

                                 MARIE
                        Packing it in, as all my free time 
                        is about to die: a hedge fund 
                        analyst.

                                 ANDREW
                        Whoa. For a second I was feeling 
                        bad about shitty oily chips.

                                 MARIE
                        That's rather simplistic. I’m a 
                        trained scientist, and just like a 
                        scientist, as an analyst my job is 
                        to deal in the truth--  to research 
                        it, to discover it, then to bet 
                        with or against a stock depending 
                        on how full of shit it is, or 
                        isn’t, and how well, or not, the 
                        market understands that. I find 
                        gaps in the market’s knowledge of 
                        the truth and exploit them.

                                 ANDREW
                        Chips still win.

                                 MARIE
                        Do they?
                            (sizes him up)
                        Consumers spend money to obtain the 
                        shitty oily chips, and since the

                        “value” of food is measured in 
                        providing nutritional compounds 
                        that support life rather than 
                        reduce it with disease, the 
                        exchange ends with a loss to the 
                        consumer. In fact, if you factor in 
                        the health costs of eating 
                        carcinogenic food-like things, 
                        every time you sell someone chips, 
                        you are in fact, unbeknownst to the 
                        consumer, transferring their future 
                        wealth into the bank accounts of 
                        health providers and insurance 
                        companies.

                                 ANDREW
                        Whoa! Ok, you win. You’re smart. I 
                        get it. I bet you make a lot of 
                        bank.

                                 MARIE
                        That's a bit crude to just come out 
                        with, isn't it?

                                 ANDREW
                        Isn't it true?

                                 MARIE
                        Anything I have, I made myself.
                            (off Andrew)
                        I smell a nice big “but” coming.

                                 ANDREW
                        My buddy who works at Lehman says 
                        women in finance are lucky if they 
                        make 60 percent as much as men.

           The server arrives to take the dinner order. Marie twists 
           slightly, then on second thought:

                                 MARIE
                        Your “buddy’s” info is a 
                        generalization. I’m going to become 
                        a top Wall Street analyst. I’m not 
                        that demographic of women.

                                 ANDREW
                        But still... Well, I guess cheers 
                        to choosing finance over science.

           Andrew extends his glass. Marie pauses, shakes it off.
                                 MARIE
                        This isn’t going to work on any 
                        long term basis. But your little 
                        show of strength may have earned 
                        you something.

           CHEERS. Wink.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Marie sits in bed with her laptop as Andrew sleeps beside 
           her. She edits her personal website: a simple pastel 
           turquoise page. In its center is an animated-gif of Marie 
           smiling in different profile shots. Beneath the image she 
           types a quote: "Buying more books than you have time to read 
           is nothing less than the soul reaching toward..." 

           She pauses, glances to Andrew, erases "toward" and retypes, 
           "away from boring people."

           A self-reflective frown creases her face. She returns to her 
           website and retypes the end: "...toward infinity." Beneath 
           the quote she adds a link: "Email me."

           INT. JIM’S IRON WORKS (MISSOURI) - DAY

           The workshop of a skilled iron artisan. Heavy machinery, a 
           furnace, hammers, tools organized with efficient placement.

           SUPER: Kansas City, Missouri

           JIM BARTON (72) wears a traditional leather apron and HAMMERS 
           a glowing piece of iron. His large hands have labored heavy 
           metal their entire working life. Dark circles and bags 
           underline his eyes, which emanate kindness and duty.

           KAL (57), the loyal #2, heats iron in the furnace.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        We’re two years out, and she’s 
                        already planning our 50th.

                                 KAL
                        Big party, eh?

                                 JIM BARTON
                        More like an awards dinner.

           They LAUGH and return to work.

           Jim focuses on a piece of hot iron that looks like the 
           beginnings of a bird: a gentle counterpoint to his presence.
           He grabs his favorite hammer as if its an extension of 
           himself, and with PRECISE HITS sculpts the glowing iron. 
           After a few STROKES he suddenly buckles over wincing in pain, 
           as if hit by a shockwave.

           Kal notices:

                                 KAL
                        Okay?

           Jim doesn’t answer. He stands erect; his eyes squeezed shut.

                                 KAL (CONT’D)
                        Jim?

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I hear ya, Kal. Give me a second.

           In a long moment Jim opens his eyes. Better.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        I swear to the Almighty, I’d rather 
                        have my pecker in a vice than these 
                        waves of pain.

                                 KAL
                        I think Mary rather-ya have the 
                        pain.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I think you’re probably right.

                                 KAL
                        You should check it out, Jim.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        If they open ya up, they’ll find 
                        something. And this pain’s new yet.

           Kal raises his eyebrows at that last statement. He regards 
           Jim a thoughtful beat, returns to the furnace work.

           Jim gets back to HAMMERING the iron. 

           INT. PSAM HQ - LOBBY - DAY

           Marie passes through the security turnstiles typical of 
           financial lobbies, and rushes into a crowded elevator holding 
           a small cardboard box and a Wall Street Journal.
           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie’s squished against the button panel, surrounded by 
           sardines in suits. A plasma screen stares her in the face 
           playing JIM CRAMER’S stock-porn show, Mad Money on CNBC:

                                 FEMALE CALLER
                        Booyah from Fort Myers, Florida! 
                        I'm calling about Dendreon. Big day 
                        with the FDA!

                                 CRAMER
                        This stock has captured the 
                        imagination of day traders beyond 
                        reason. We’ll see how the FDA 
                        rules, but I’m not a believer in 
                        Provenge. I sell sell sell!

           Marie glances down at her Wall Street Journal:

           CLOSE ON ARTICLE: “Blockbuster or Dud? Biotech’s Biggest 
           Wildcard Sits Down with the FDA.” Beneath the headline is a 
           stock photo of Mitch Gold.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MAIN OFFICE FLOOR - DAY

           Marie exits the elevator nose down in a WSJ. She circles the 
           Dendreon article before raising her head to see:

           Modern decor. Money here. High-focus energy. Brains at work 
           trying to think as fast, or faster, than the market.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE’S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie’s at her desk unpacking the box; hanging awards and 
           mementos on her cube. 

           1) Certificate: “UK SMART Award 2003. Marie Huber. £80,000.”

           2) A clipping of Marie and former business partners, one much 
           older than her: “Ampere Pharmaceuticals: Dr. James Rothman; 
           Marie Huber; Jit Naraine.” 

           3) Family portrait of Marie (13), her MOTHER, her FATHER.

           She returns to her desk surface and opens the WSJ.

           Marie grabs a yellow marker and highlights select lines. 
           Folds the paper - article face-up - grabs a notebook, gone.
           INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING (D.C.) - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           SUPER: Washington D.C. - FDA Advisory Committee Review of 
           Provenge

           At the end of the COMMITTEE MEMBERS filing into the room is 
           DR. RICHARD PAZDUR (56), Head of Cancer Drugs at the FDA-- 
           autistic, dry, trim-bearded, wireframes. Pazdur and Frohlich 
           intersect before entering:

                                 PAZDUR
                        Mark.

                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        Richard. I’d rather us be on the 
                        links, but I think Monique prefers 
                        an audience.

           The two men slyly regard Greer, who takes a seat inside.

           INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING (D.C.) - CONFERENCE ROOM - TIMECUT

           We’re into the start of the meeting. One oddity is a 
           MAINTENANCE WORKER tending to a leaky ceiling in the corner.

                                 PAZDUR
                        I'd like to welcome you to today’s 
                        review of Provenge, presented by 
                        Dendreon representatives--

           The maintenance worker SLIDES the bucket over with his foot.

           Greer leans over to whisper to Pazdur:

                                 GREER
                        What’s the Vegas spread on this 
                        group?

                                 FROHLICH
                        Gold gives us 2 to 1.

                                 GREER
                        Cake.

                                 PAZDUR
                        --Dr. Mark Frohlich, Chief Medical 
                        Officer, and Monique Greer, Chief 
                        of Staff.

                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        Thank you for having us.
                                 GREER
                        Finally.

           The room LAUGHS, but is interrupted by more CLATTER: a second 
           leak has formed and the worker FINAGLES the bucket to try and 
           fit both streams into the pail-- he’ll need another one.

           INT. PSAM HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           The table in PSAM’s main conference room is spotless glass 
           laid atop polished black metal, designed for 30 people.

           The meeting is led by the firm’s namesake, PETER SCHOENFELD 
           (61), known as Wall Street’s quiet professor; not here to 
           impress. He speaks in a tone long unfamiliar with wonder.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Jess, you’re up.

           JESS JONES (37), opportunist, smart, crude.

                                 JESS
                        Europe’s debt is set to trip like a 
                        English chick on whiskey Wednesday.

           Only the MEN LAUGH. Not Schoenfeld; he never laughs.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Greece goes first. All my trades 
                        are moving to that basket.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        When?

           Jess looks to FEMALE ANALYST #1.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST #1
                        I haven’t found a definitive marker 
                        yet. Early or late summer.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Don’t hedge the entire portfolio 
                        until the analysis is done. 

                                 JESS
                            (sharp-edged)
                        Need help number crunching?

           The analyst glares back, but remains quiet. 

           Marie notes Jess’s aggression, it’s a sport she understands.
                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Marie, you’re up.

           Marie wasn’t expecting that. Schoenfeld doesn’t skip a beat.

                                 MARIE
                            (clears throat)
                        Hi everyone. I’m Marie Huber, the 
                        new healthcare analyst.

                                 MALE TRADER #1
                        You did the Alexion work?

                                 SCHOENFELD
                            (off Marie)
                        We moved on your work.
                            (to the table)
                        That’s how you score a job; show up 
                        with your first assignment.

                                 MALE TRADER #1
                        Nice work.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you. (beat) I’m very grateful 
                        to be here.

           Marie is quick to sense that’s all the “hello” the room, and 
           Schoenfeld, has patience for. Hurrying along...

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I was determined to only listen-in 
                        today. But...okay...

           Marie pauses; it’s time to dive into the ocean. She shoots up 
           out of her chair; a clear break from buttoned-up ritual. 
           Marie circles the team, commands the room:

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s talk healthcare. This year 
                        healthcare spending will be 
                        approximately 16% of America’s GDP. 
                        A humungous sum of money. 

           Marie makes her way to the whiteboard. She draws a chart with 
           a straight diagonal line between the X and Y axes.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        This is healthcare costs per capita 
                        from 2000 to 2006. Makes sense with 
                        total healthcare spending rising, 
                        right?
           She draws another x/y chart with a diagonal, this time in an 
           inverse direction.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Yet, out-of-pocket health expenses 
                        in the same timeframe have dropped.

           Marie rests a hand on her chin, and mockingly asks the group:

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        If out-of-pocket costs for 
                        healthcare are down, yet total 
                        healthcare spending is increasing 
                        massively; where is this money 
                        coming from?

                        Government. The mandate to the FDA 
                        is to get out of the way of 
                        innovation-- that awesome buzzword. 
                        That’s meant more approvals, higher 
                        costs, and removal of the firewall 
                        between business and government. 
                        Pharma, the most profitable legal 
                        business in the world, is becoming 
                        more profitable. Investors are 
                        salivating, but...

           Marie puts the marker down and again circles the group. She 
           grabs the pens from the hands of 80% of the baffled group.

                        by biotech investors.
                            (throws pens in garbage)
                        That leaves just a lucky few to 
                        maybe hit. (beat) VC’s don’t have 
                        the kind of time for most new 
                        medical treatment’s time-to-market, 
                        so a lot of crap goes bust before 
                        it’s had a chance to find itself.

           Marie grabs the remaining pens (even Schoenfeld’s) but one, 
           and gives them all one-by-one to the last-”investor”-
           standing, Female Analyst #1.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Yet, even with this tiny margin of 
                        success, the thirst for a 
                        blockbuster drug guarantees capital 
                        remains fluid and abundant. Clever

                        talent continues to get paid well 
                        and the lucky investor that hits 
                        can have lunch with Warren Buffet.

           The confused analyst has the last of the pens. Marie taps her 
           on the shoulder like a wink.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        It’s more than the day traders; 
                        Dendreon is a battleground stock. 
                        Cohen and Milken are using it as 
                        their war board. More confusion

           Even when she’s fierce, Marie’s words don’t feel personal. 
           Yet, Jess’s expression flattens. He Leaves.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jim Barton eats a meatloaf and mashed potato dinner with his 
           wife, MARY BARTON (68).

           They watch CNN. George W. Bush is speaking...about something.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Paul Thompson needs his order a 
                        week ahead of schedule.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        Will you do it?
                                 JIM BARTON
                        I'll have to talk with Kal.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        We spoke about slowing down.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Paul's been a good customer and 
                        friend for 25-years, dear. I can't 
                        leave him empty-handed.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        That's why everyone loves you, you 
                        never think about yourself.

           Mary rises, kisses her husband on the forehead and walks her 
           plate to the sink. We stay on Jim who's enjoying his last 
           bite of meatloaf until his face suddenly loses color, his 
           expression blanks, and he passes out.

                                 MARY BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Jim! Jim!

           Mary rushes to Jim, shakes him, continues to call his name.

           In just a few seconds Jim comes-to. He's confused, but seeing 
           Mary he realizes something bad happened.

                                 MARY BARTON (CONT’D)
                        I'm calling 911.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Don't make a fuss, Mare.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        I'll call Kim, and if Kim says to 
                        call 911, that's what we're doing.

           Mary dials. Jim drinks some water.

                                 MARY BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Kim! Pop fainted... Yes, just right 
                        here at the table...Hold on...

           Mary puts her fingers over Jim's carotid artery; checks his 
           pulse while counting seconds on her wrist watch.

                                 MARY BARTON (CONT’D)
                        It’s weak...Ok. We’ll see you when 
                        you can get here.

           Mary hangs-up. Dials the famous 3 digits...
                                 JIM BARTON
                        No no. The emergency room? Really, 
                        Mare?

                                 MARY BARTON
                        Hello, I’m Mary Barton, my husband 
                        Jim just fainted here at the dinner 
                        table... Yes, he's come-to... 72 
                        mam. We're at 11 Wood Drive.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ER WING - DAY

           KIM BARTON (41), a spark-plug, a bulldog, goes-to-bat for the 
           team, bursts through the ER doors and navigates the halls as 
           if she knows exactly where she's going.

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - SAME

           Kim enters just as her parents speak with DR. PAUL ARMSTRONG, 
           (65), small town relatable-type of doctor.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG

                        Kim. Oh thank god you're here.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        The general's arrived.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Oh Pop.

           Kim is immediately at her father's side, checking him over 
           first, giving a big hug and kiss second. 

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Before Jim can answer, not to be rude...

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        I'm Kim, Jim's daughter.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                            (shaking hand)  
                        Dr. Armstrong.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        How's he doing?
                                 JIM BARTON
                        Oh geez, Kim. I'm fine. Don't let 
                        her get you riled up Dr. Armstrong.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        The results of the CT Scan will be 
                        in soon. No obvious signs of 
                        anything. Could be overwork.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I've had steel drop on me, a neck I 
                        can barely twist for 15 years. I've 
                        been to the doctor five times in 60 
                        years. Trust me, I'm fine. It's 
                        probably fibromyalgia. I bet that's 
                        what it is. It was just those waves 
                        of pain I sometimes get. This time 
                        it knocked me out is all.

           A NURSE knocks on the door with the scans in her hand.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Excuse me.

           Dr. Armstrong exits the room, leaving the family together. 
           Mary nurtures Jim while Kim checks his vitals on the machine.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Pop, what mess have you gotten 
                        yourself into now?

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I’m tellin you both, it’s nothing. 
                        Will ya just stop fussing, Kimmie?

           Dr. Armstrong re-enters, straight-faced, head slightly dipped 
           in the way people do when they mentally rehearse.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Well, there's no easy way to tell 
                        you this. I never know how, but I 
                        need to, so I'm just gonna come out 
                        and say it. But, you're full of 
                        cancer.

           Jim straightens and releases an instinctive SOUND, as if 
           words wished to escape, but couldn’t.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        How? He’s still going to work every 
                        day. He’s still lifting hundreds of 
                        pounds. There’s no way you’re 
                        reading those scans right.
                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        I'm sorry, Kim. But the scans 
                        aren't lying.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Ok, I usually don’t throw this card 
                        out there, but I’m an RN, and I 
                        want to see his CT Scans.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Of course.

           Dr. Armstrong walks Kim to the lightbox. He wedges the scans 
           over the light panels as Kim wordlessly studies them herself. 
           She scans every pixel of the images, and with each pixel her 
           expression dampens.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Kimmie. What do you see?

           Kim doesn’t respond, but her silence is well understood. Mary 
           cries, constrained, undramatic. Dr. Armstrong observes the 
           family. He's seen this before, and it's never easy.

                        We already know some conflicts of

                        that...In a day we’ll know if the

                        home to my wife two million dollars

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A typical weekday night: Marie sits in bed, CNBC blares in  
           the background, laptop open. She's in post-workout running 
           bra and yoga pants, and hasn't bothered to shower.

           On the screen we see she's researching Dendreon and typing up 
           her findings for the morning’s meeting.

           Her cell phone buzzes: "ANDREW: Hey Marie!"

           She browses to InvestorVillage.com and searches for "DNDN". 
           Search results pull up 25,210 message threads.

           She opens a thread: “If the FDA fucks this up, they’ll feel 
           the full wrath of this board.”

                                 MARIE
                        Day trader activists. Lovely.

           Her cell phone buzzes: "ANDREW: There?"

           Marie snatches the phone: "MARIE: I think it’s best we stay 
           friends."

           She drops the phone, but a second later: "ANDREW: Can I come 
           over?" 

           Marie’s not amused, shuts her phone off. Back to work. 

           She surfs to the FDA website and skims for a link titled: 
           “Provenge Advisory Committee Meeting Minutes.” CLICK.

           A PRINTER FIRES UP beside her.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - TIMECUT

           Marie’s marking up notes on the printed documents. She FLIPS 
           to a new page and reads the transcript:

           INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING (D.C.) - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           We’re back in the Provenge meeting. The two WATER STREAMS 
           DRIP throughout, attendees must speak over it. Frohlich’s at 
           the head of the room, wrapping up his presentation:

           Greer removes gum from her mouth and squishes it on the 
           corner of a paper.

           Frohlich addresses a suspiciously simple chart on a screen. 
                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        Provenge is revolutionary in its 
                        design to use the patient's own 
                        immune system to fight the cancer. 
                        Our patients averaged 4.5 months of 
                        prolonged life; quite extraordinary 
                        for this stage of prostate cancer. 

           Frohlich moves from the projector screen to his seat; it’s 
           now time for the selected committee members to ask questions.

           ROBERT SAMUELS (69), an African American patient rep begins:

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Thank you Dr. Frohlich. I represent 
                        a large section of the patient 
                        community. I'm a survivor myself. 
                        I'm doing hormonal therapy, and at 
                        some point it's going to fail; I 
                        know that. I look around and ask, 
                        “what will I do next?” But I hear 
                        4.5 months of survival and that 
                        scares me. Is that all? Because I'm 
                        understanding the potential cost is 
                        being discussed at (looks at his 
                        notes) near six figures. At this 
                        price, many in my community won’t 
                        be able to afford this.

                                 GREER
                        It’s a big number for this group of 
                        patients, Mr. Samuels. We’ll make 
                        sure to have our team sit down with 
                        your group. To the point of price, 
                        Provenge should be made available 
                        regardless of a patient’s ability 
                        to pay.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                            (to Pazdur)
                        Government assistance?

                                 PAZDUR
                        One review at a time.

                                 GREER
                        We’re certainly aiming for medicare 
                        approval, but we can only get there 
                        with this committee’s blessing.

           Samuels seems satisfied with that. Moving on...

           BACK WITH MARIE:
           Marie circles “government $$” on a pre-drawn flowchart titled

           DR. MAHA HUSSAIN (53), brainy, petite.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                            (increasingly dubious)
                        All you mention here is survival 
                        data, yet this trial wasn’t powered 
                        to measure survival. It was powered 
                        to measure how long it took a 
                        patient showing no symptoms, to 
                        start showing symptoms again. 

           BACK WITH MARIE:

           Marie does a double-takes to that.

           BACK WITH FDA:

                                 DR. HUSSAIN (CONT’D)
                        You also mentioned (checks notes) a 
                        new study underway; is that trial 
                        now powered to measure survival? 

                                 GREER
                        Yes, Study 3 is powered to 
                        survival. We're targeting 500 men.

           BACK WITH MARIE:

           Marie makes a note: “Phase III trial, 500 men”.

           BACK WITH FDA:

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        And where is that now? When do you 
                        expect the results to be available?

                                 GREER
                        It could be 6 to 12 months.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        I see. Not to sound antagonistic, 
                        but why are we here then?
                                 GREER
                        We’re here because men do better 
                        with our treatment than without it.

           BACK WITH MARIE:

           Marie makes a note: “Dr. Hussain = skeptic”.

           BACK WITH THE FDA:

                                 PAZDUR
                        Moving on. Dr. Woo.

           DR. SAVIO WOO (48), southern California healthy.

                                 DR. WOO
                        Did you measure any anti-tumor 
                        effects?

                                 GREER
                        No. None other than the differences 
                        in survival-- which we believe is 
                        exciting and significant for this 
                        community.

                                 DR. WOO
                        With no tumor shrinkage those 
                        survival numbers are head-
                        scratching unless there’s another 
                        factor I’m not understanding.

           BACK WITH MARIE:

           Marie makes a note: “No tumor shrinkage”.

           BACK WITH THE FDA:

                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        The results speak for themselves 
                        Dr. Woo. The treatment has shown to 
                        prolong survival.

           A piece of ceiling SPLASHES INTO THE BUCKET. The maintenance 
           worker shines a small flashlight to check if more’s coming. 

           COMMITTEE LOBBYIST #1 (53), business-man, interjects:

                                 COMMITTEE LOBBYIST #1
                        Are we gonna make it out of here?

           All LAUGH, but for the embarrassed meeting chairman.
                                 COMMITTEE LOBBYIST #1 (CONT’D)
                        So, Dr. Hussain and others who seem 
                        on the fence here; I wanted to just 
                        think about what we're doing. We're 
                        not reviewing a grant, we're not 
                        reviewing a manuscript, we're 
                        trying to figure out whether needy 
                        patients who don't have anything 
                        available can benefit from this. 
                        Personally, I think the data are 
                        persuasive. It's not a perfect 
                        study, but we have evidence that it 
                        works, and I urge the committee to 
                        think about it very carefully 
                        before they vote.

           The room digests his words. Many members seem to agree.

           Another MAINTENANCE WORKER enters for a bucket switch.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie pauses suspiciously. As she makes a note to the 
           transcript, we read a summary of everything we’ve already 
           seen, plus: “strong survival data” “massive potential”.

           We see the flow chart she had created and it’s obvious their 
           business model is nearly 100% dependent on Uncle Sam.

           BACK WITH THE FDA:

                                 COMMITTEE LOBBYIST #1
                        At this point I'm not entirely sure 
                        how to answer this question. I 
                        mean, it's really very absolutely 
                        phrased. I can’t say this is 100 
                        percent proven, but-

                            (making up for it)
                        -like is it a reasonable doubt, or, 
                        shadow of a doubt?

           LAUGHTER.

                                 PAZDUR
                        The regulatory standard is in fact 
                        a bit looser, so, let’s reword. 
                        Rather than 'establish', is there 
                        “substantial evidence” that it 
                        works?
                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                            (disbelief)
                        Excuse me?

           BACK WITH MARIE:

           Marie bites her pen at this last point.

           She then glances at the voting chart: she has two columns 
           labeled “VOTE” and “RE-VOTE”, each with the same list of 
           names and ‘YES’ and ‘NO’ next to them. In the first column 
           the votes stopped at the tenth name, and we can see they are 
           mostly ‘NO’, but in the second column all the names have a 
           vote listed and we can see all but four are ‘YES’.

           We trace her eyes from left to right, where what were mostly 
           ‘NO’ votes changed to ‘YES’ votes.

           She then puts down the pen next to a clock that reads 2:11AM. 
           She sits back in the desk chair, runs her fingers through her 
           hair, then NAVIGATES to her website to a section where she 
           can read the visitor statistics: “This Week: 11 visits.”

           A slight frown crosses her face.

           INT. RICHARD PAZDUR'S OFFICE - DAY

           Pazdur is on the phone, reading a long email on his screen.

                                 PAZDUR
                        I see your point here, Maha.

           INT. MAHA HUSSAIN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Dr. Hussain talks with Pazdur. Alternate between both:

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Richard, I don’t raise objections 
                        like this unless I feel strongly. 
                        The committee’s recommendation is 
                        irresponsible at this stage.

                                 PAZDUR
                        We’ve discussed your email all 
                        morning.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        I know you’re friendly with Dr. 
                        Frohlich.
                                 PAZDUR
                        Stop there. No one in this business 
                        is immune to scrutiny, even you. I 
                        don’t compromise my job.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        You’re right. Thanks Richard.

           Pazdur hangs-up.

                                 PAZDUR
                        Fuck. There’s gonna be hell.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jim, Mary, and Kim eat dinner in silence. Kim hadn’t packed a 
           suitcase and wears the same cloths as last time we saw her.

           The dinner is quiet because the life of the party, Jim, is 
           consumed by bigger things. Kim intermittently glances in her 
           parents direction, but also remains quiet.

           The silence ends abruptly as Jim’s fork CLAMORS on the floor:

                                 MARY
                            (shooting up)
                        Stay there!

           Mary’s old bones BEND too fast as she gets the fork.

                                 KIM BARTON
                            (rising)
                        Mom!

                                 JIM BARTON
                        It’s just a fork!

           It’s instant commotion as the women operate with the urgency 
           of nurses in a war zone: Kim tails Mary to the sink and takes 
           over CLEANING FORK duty as Mary GRABS a new one.

           Mary returns a fresh fork to Jim. 

           Kim TURNS OFF the faucet, dries the fork, places it in the 
           silverware tray, and returns to the table.

           After a long beat, Kim shoots a quick glance at her father, 
           who’s struggling to respectfully stay silent. In a moment...

           Jim extends both of his hands, one each to the woman next to 
           him. The women each clasp Jim’s hands and finally look at 
           him. Then Mary and Kim hold hands.
           We WIDEN and stay with them. Strong family.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY

           Marie exits her doorman building with a Wall Street Journal 
           tucked in her armpit. Sunglasses on, knapsack slung over her 
           shoulder. Weird mix of fashion and utility. 

           At the corner coffee-cart:

                                 MARIE
                        Hi Sam.

           SAM (69), the Turkish cart owner smiles back genuinely.

                                 SAM
                        Good morning, Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Same as usual.

           Marie preemptively puts a dollar on the cart as Sam pours the 
           coffee. She then turns to the business section of the WSJ.

           INSERT: “FDA defies Advisory Committee’s Recommendation: 
           Provenge delayed until next trial completes.”

                                 SAM
                            (pours black coffee)
                        Make some money for me, today, eh?

                                 MARIE
                        Hmmm. That just got massively 
                        interesting.

           INT. PSAM HQ - PETER SCHOENFELD'S OFFICE - DAY

           We enter mid-conversation on Marie, the professional:

                                 MARIE
                        The FDA won’t release the data 
                        until the drug has been approved, 
                        or rejected; so I've only been able 
                        to partially touch the science. But 
                        the potential is tremendous, 
                        because instead of using the PAP, 
                        prostatic acid phosphatase, to 
                        train the cells.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Marie. I’m not a scientist.
                                 MARIE
                        Right. Sorry about that. There are 
                        no options right now for the men 
                        this drug targets. It could give 
                        them more life. But even more, with 
                        the general approach they’re taking 
                        one could in theory target all 
                        sorts of cancer, such as breast 
                        cancer. It opens up future 
                        treatment and revenue options. But, 
                        that’s if it works. As an 
                        investment, it's currently trading 
                        around $10, so it leaves enough 
                        room to short if its true north is 
                        failure.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        And the risk?

           Marie passes a folded WSJ to Schoenfeld with the Dendreon 
           article face-up.

                                 MARIE
                        As today showed, it’s clearly 
                        regulatory. Going against the 
                        advisory committee’s recommendation 
                        is something the FDA does only 7% 
                        of the time.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                            (he knows more than her)
                        Mitch Gold is an operator, like 
                        Waskil at ImClone. This is a street 
                        fight. The stock is also flush with 
                        insider trading. This is one of 
                        those companies that can quickly 
                        become politically symbolic, 
                        regardless of its merit.

                                 MARIE
                        It's a cancer drug. The government 
                        won’t allow a treatment that 
                        doesn’t work on the market.

           Schoenfeld LAUGHS, not mockingly, more admiring her naivety.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Chemotherapy is still the leading 
                        treatment for cancer-- it's a 
                        1950's technology. Tell me another 
                        industry that could thrive on that 
                        business model without thick 
                        government integration? I hope this

                            (studies Marie, then...)
                        This is good work. As with all our 
                        investments, I want every ‘i’ 
                        dotted, every ‘t’ crossed. I want 
                        the science. I want the market 
                        strategy. I want operational 
                        analysis-- "can they feasibly 
                        handle demand"? Look under every 
                        rock to understand their product 
                        and business.

           Marie beams; set on a direction of her own making.

                                 MARIE
                        Wonderful.

           Marie scurries out. Female Analyst #2 immediately enters.

           Schoenfeld resets, as he does one-hundred times a day.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MAIN OFFICE FLOOR - DAY

           Marie confidently marches to her desk. Jess intercepts.

                        No. They delayed it.

                        We need to disclose our trades to

           Jess hands her a spreadsheet.

                                 JESS
                        Yes, we do. Not me. Mitch Gold, the

                        Not a precise vote of confidence,

           Marie sits, puts headphones on, digs in. Jess amused, leaves.

           INT. HOTEL - CONVENTION HALLWAY - SAME

           Mitch Gold marches with Greer in tow. We walk with them on a 
           steadicam throughout the winding halls.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                            (on phone)
                        Yes sir. It’s a setback. We thought 
                        we had this locked. The FDA rarely 
                        contradicts the committee 
                        recommendation.

           Mitch motions to Greer to take a note:

                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        Yes, we’re doing well with the 
                        patient advocacy groups. That’s 
                        what tonight’s for...

           INT. GREENWICH MANSION - SAME

           We’re behind the LEAD INVESTOR as he strolls through a 
           hallway covered in priceless 20th century art. An ASSISTANT 
           approaches with a note; he stops at a Pollack drip painting. 
           He nods and the assistant leaves.

                                 LEAD INVESTOR
                            (off Pollack)
                        We’ll need more than the standard 
                        patient advocacy groups. We’ll need 
                        chaos. Look to the day traders.
                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Understood.

                                 LEAD INVESTOR
                        Remember Mitch, it’s not just about 
                        what you do, but about how many 
                        tentacles work on your behalf.

           BACK WITH GOLD:

           Mitch hangs up.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        I want everything we know, and 
                        more, to flood the InvestorVillage 
                        boards. No fingerprints. We’re 
                        stirring the pot. For us it's 
                        business as usual, the public 
                        message stays positive-- “giving 
                        new options to sick men. Pioneers 
                        in a new era of cancer treatment.” 
                        We stick to the advisory approval 
                        and draw skepticism to corrupt 
                        politics.

                                 GREER
                        Consider it in-motion.
                            (hands Gold a sheet)
                        Here’s the final draft of your 
                        speech.

           Gold scans it as he walks.

                        I’ll make sure you have face time 
                        with Senator Kerry as well.

           They reach the end of the hallway as Mitch still reads. We 
           can hear a SPEECH emanating from behind the door.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        How's enrollment on Phase 3?

                                 GREER
                        Higher than anticipated. Mark’s 
                        expecting a quick trial.
                            (off Mitch)
                        Just learned.

           Greer goes for the speech, but Mitch tucks it in his pocket.

                            (straightening tie)
                        I’ll improvise.
           Tie straightened, checks his watch. Nearly showtime.

           INT. HOTEL - BALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Samuels, from the FDA advisory panel, addresses a room of 
           nearly 500 ATTENDEES: prostate cancer advocates, patients, 
           congress reps, journalists, and doctors. 

           SUPER: Prostate Health Education Network, Washington D.C.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        It took some time, but I’m 
                        convinced, working with men like 
                        Dr. Mitchell Gold makes me believe 
                        the war on cancer can be won.

           More APPLAUSE. Mitch enters the stage. Hand-shake. Smile. 
           Face the audience.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Thank you Robert. You remember the 
                        last time we spoke? I have some 
                        news.
                            (to the crowd)
                        Tonight I'm happy to announce that 
                        not only is our Phase Three Impact 
                        Trial fully enrolled, but it's 
                        already well underway. I don't want 
                        to get myself in trouble (laughs), 
                        but interim results are extremely 
                        positive.

           APPLAUSE. Preaching to the choir is second-nature to Gold.

           Greer, stage left, raises an eyebrow at Gold: “that’s not 
           quite what I said.” He returns a big toothy smile.

                                 SCOTT RICCIO
                        I'm an admirer. Outside 
                        Morningstar, I've led action 
                        committees against government 
                        policy on cancer patients, even for 
                        Provenge.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Oh? We need more of that.

                                 SCOTT RICCIO
                        I’m active on the boards. We’re on 
                        the verge of a grassroots movement.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        I’m happy to hear that.

           Mitch sizes-up Riccio, then hands him a business card.

           INT. TREATMENT CENTER - LAB ROOM - DAY

           Marie interviews DR. REDFERN (45), boyish, who drinks from a 
           sports water bottle and works at a wheeled standup-terminal.

                                 MARIE
                        You were a big enrolling site for 
                        Provenge trials, right?

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        Yes, the second largest. We’ve 
                        worked with Dendreon since 2001.

                                 MARIE
                        Did you help with the data analysis 
                        given to the FDA?
                                 DR. REDFERN
                        We make suggestions on what data to 
                        put in, what not to put in, but 
                        really it’s the company that does 
                        the analysis.

                                 MARIE
                        So you help them through your own 
                        raw data?

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        No, not really, cause they don’t 
                        unblind the data until years and 
                        years later. So, in the trials we 
                        have an agreement that only 
                        Dendreon has access to raw data.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, I was hoping to have a peak 
                        under the hood, as you Americans 
                        say.

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        Just like me, you’ll need to wait 
                        until after the FDA decision to get 
                        access.

                                 MARIE
                        That’s curated data.

                                 DR. REDFERN
                            (smirks)
                        Hoping to get a leg up on the 
                        market? The company holds onto 
                        their data extremely closely. The 
                        FDA never sees raw data. 

                                 MARIE
                        Yeah, I heard that. (beat) I’m 
                        wondering how you think the FDA 
                        will eventually look at this thing?

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        I wish I could tell you.

           Marie regards him, then reads the work on his screen.

                                 MARIE
                        You may want to make a small 
                        adjustment here...

           Marie takes over the bewildered doctor’s terminal.
                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                            (typing)
                        This. And this. Your standard 
                        deviation was entirely too high.
                            (off his astonishment)
                        Pardon. Bad habit.

           Dr. Redfern’s on the verge of kicking Marie out, but then he 
           reads her adjustments...she’s right. He takes a moment, then:

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        There is one thing I could tell 
                        you: Dendreon’s running a new test.

                                 MARIE
                        Yes, the Phase III trials.

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        No, this is different. We’re 
                        enrolled in that trial too. But now 
                        they’re testing dosage.

                                 MARIE
                        Dosage? But they’ve already filed 
                        for approval.

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        It is a bit backwards, yeah. 
                        They’re not saying it, but my guess 
                        it’s because the optics are forcing 
                        them to. There are a lot of reasons 
                        to bang your head about this drug. 
                        Tumor reduction is the standard of 
                        success in this type of cancer, and 
                        they didn’t show any.

                                 MARIE
                        That’s bothering me too. (to self) 
                        But the survival data is strong.
                            (beat)
                        Does this test need to be reported 
                        to the FDA?

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        Only if the results are beneficial 
                        will you ever hear of this.

                                 MARIE
                        Do you mind if I check back on it?

                                 DR. REDFERN
                        Not at all.
                                 MARIE
                        You’ve been very helpful.

           Marie scurries off.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DR. ARMSTRONG'S OFFICE - DAY

           Jim Barton, Mary, and Kim sit across from Dr. Armstrong.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        The important thing is to be 
                        supportive of each other. It’s not 
                        just one tumor that we can go in 
                        and remove. I recommend radiation 
                        therapy.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        There’s not much hair left anyhow. 
                        Might as well take it.

           Jim has his charm back, yet the room falls to an 
           uncomfortable silence.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Fine. I’ll ask. How long do I have?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Jim, there are no concrete numbers 
                        here, just ranges.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I’ll take a range then.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Your stage of prostate cancer 
                        ranges between 12 to 30 months. 

           Mary bows her head gently. Jim gently clasps her hand. 

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Does age impact those numbers?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        At this stage, age is not a factor. 

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Some men are more bull than others. 
                        Right, Mare?

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Pop!
                                 MARY BARTON
                            (tough to get joke out)
                        I never met em.

           Jim forces a LAUGH. Dr. Armstrong graciously returns a wide 
           smile. Jim’s LAUGH silently fades to contemplation. 

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Humor is healthy.

                                 JIM BARTON
                            (after a moment)
                        Mare and I’s 50th anniversary is on 
                        the horizon. That range you gave, 
                        at its best, puts me right at the 
                        edge. I’ll do whatever you tell me 
                        to do, just so I can have that 
                        dance with my wife.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        We’ll advance the date.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        No, Mare. That ain’t the right way.

           Kim regards her parents with love and determination.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                            (points to Kim)
                        You have a great asset here, Jim. 
                        Listen to her. Let her help.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I know it.

           INT. RICHARD PAZDUR'S OFFICE - DAY

           Richard Pazdur holds a landline to his ear as he scrolls his 
           computer screen.

                                 PAZDUR
                        Allison. I’m looking at today’s 
                        Cancer Letter. Do you know what I’m 
                        reading? (doesn’t wait) I’m reading 
                        Maha Hussain’s confidential emails 
                        about Provenge...Someone leaked 
                        them!

           INSERT: The Cancer Letter flyer with an image of Dr. Hussain 
           beneath headline, “Provenge Dissenter: Leaked Emails Show Dr. 
           Maha Hussain Pushed the FDA Away From Provenge.”
                                 PAZDUR (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. Tell her I’m unavailable. 
                        This is a shit storm...What? Yes, 
                        put him through...(his boss) Sir. 
                        Yes, I know. I’m reading it 
                        now....Yes, I know, this was 
                        obviously designed to rile up the 
                        crazies.

           Pazdur listens, his expression steadily dampening.

                                 PAZDUR (CONT’D)
                        Right sir. I’m sorry. I’ll see what 
                        I can do.

           Pazdur SLAMS the phone. Defeated, overwhelmed.

           INT. KERRY DONAHUE'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           DAYB TRADER #2 (KERRY DONAHUE) is on the phone and watching 
           Cramer’s show.

                                 DONAHUE
                        When Uncle Sam declares a war on 
                        anything: Iraq or cancer, it’s all 
                        the same-- a license to print a 
                        shit ton of money. You see the 
                        leak? Now these bastards want to 
                        fuck us.

           We see pinned on Donahue’s corkboard: "lawsuits - fda" to a 
           cork-board labeled "BATTLE PLAN". We glance other cards: 
           "attack geraldo rivera", "what’s obama's policy?", and 
           another card with its text crossed-out: "incorporate CTL".

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE'S DESK - DAY

           Marie highlights a document titled "Provenge 9901B Trial 
           Design". She pauses, straightens her back, reads closer.

           She picks up her office line, dials:

                        Jit Naraine, please...Jit!
           INT. O'MALLEY'S IRISH PUB - AFTERNOON

           Marie slides into a pub booth across from a thin, buttoned-up 
           friend, JIT NARAINE (38).

                                 MARIE
                        Hi. Thanks for taking this lunch.

                                 JIT
                        You’re late. I need to be back in 
                        27 minutes. Tell me.

                                 MARIE
                            (kindred spirit)
                        Oh, I missed you. 

                                 JIT
                            (impatient)
                        So?

           Marie shows Jit a marked-up page of the Dendreon document.

                                 MARIE
                        I need you to confirm something.

                                 JIT
                        Context?

                                 MARIE
                        I don’t see enough evidence to 
                        support their proposed mechanism. 

                                 JIT
                        Who?

                                 MARIE
                        Dendreon. They’re using ACI to... 

                                 JIT
                        ACI?

                                 MARIE
                        Active Cellular Immunotherapy--
                            (he still doesn’t get it)
                        Live cells to re-engage the 
                        patient's own immune system. You’re 
                        the cancer biologist.

                                 JIT
                        Are you here to insult me, or ask a 
                        question?

                                 MARIE
                        Question! Sorry. I missed you so!
                                 JIT
                        Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Trial design: is it possible to run 
                        a double blind experiment if the 
                        placebo group is treated 
                        differently than the drug group?

                                 JIT
                        Now who’s stupid? (beat)
                        This place smells like pork.

                                 MARIE
                        Of course it’s ‘no’, but here:
                            (points on paper)
                        Can you decipher if the doctors 
                        knew they were giving the placebo 
                        patients a different infusion?

           Jit grabs the paper and looks closer; engaged. While reading:

                                 JIT
                        These are indeed different. Hard to 
                        say why though.
                            (after several long beats)
                        Clever bastards.

                                 MARIE
                        What is it?

                                 JIT
                        They stored the infusions in two 
                        different containers. The doctors 
                        had to know which was which.

                                 MARIE
                        So, no way they didn't know.

                                 JIT
                            (after a few beats)
                        Of course they knew. This is a 
                        bogus double blind.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you.

                                 JIT
                            (checks watch)
                        Okay. This place has shit service. 
                        I must bail.

                                 MARIE
                        One more thing.
           Jit rolls his eyes. Again, Marie’s unfazed.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        The men in the placebo group also 
                        had their white blood cells 
                        removed. Is that a real placebo?

                                 JIT
                        That's not supposed to harm them.

           Marie squints; that didn’t stick.

                                 MARIE
                        Not supposed to? Or doesn’t?

                                 JIT
                        The words that come out of my mouth 
                        aren’t accidental. 

                                 MARIE
                        Right. Of course.

           Jit is up and putting his jacket on.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, that was splendid.

                                 JIT
                        I always saw you leading a biotech. 
                        But you always did like to swim 
                        with sharks.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s a boys club, just like 
                        science. Makes winning more fun.

                                 JIT
                        Mundane motives. 
                        Be careful what you wish for. 

                                 MARIE
                        I--

                                 JIT
                        15 minutes and still no server.
                            (walks away)
                        See you. Meet me and James for a 
                        drink sometime.

                                 MARIE
                        Yes! Thank you.

                                 JIT
                        Good luck.

           Marie at desk on phone, interviewing, referencing documents.

           Marie overwhelms Female Analyst #1 at the water cooler.

           Marie shows Jess her work. His interest cements.

           Marie observes Jess and a two MALE TRADERS high-five after a 
           big trade. She puts nose back in the work, determined.

           INT. MARIE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie burns the midnight oil. We see charts, equations, 
           diagrams.

           The apartment is noticeably more luxurious than last we saw.

           Marie looks at the Cancer Letter with Hussain’s leaked email.

           TV SCREEN: Dr. Hussain is being led through an ANGRY MOB on 
           TV. The screen reads: “THE NEW WAR ON CANCER: DESPERATE 
           ADVOCACY GROUPS THREATEN DOCTOR’S LIFE.”

           EXT. FDA HQ - DAY

           Dr. Hussain and a BODYGUARD scuttle past an angry mob of a 
           dozen PROTESTORS. A VIDEOGRAPHER documents the scene.

           SIGNS READ: “My husband needs treatment!” “You’re going to 
           kill me!”

           Another DOZEN PROTESTORS focus on Donahue on a megaphone. WE 
           HEAR HIS VOICE OVER THE MUSIC:

                                 DONAHUE
                        How many American men will die in 
                        vain waiting for Provenge? We will 
                        stand up for them. Will you?  

           The crowd RA-RAs, pumps fists and signs in the air.

           Hussain runs through a revolving door. The protestors are 
           blocked by guards.
           INT. RICHARD PAZDUR'S OFFICE - DAY

           Pazdur is handed a stack of manilla envelops. He opens them 
           one by one to reveal:

           INSERT: Plaintiff: Care to Live. (over and over)

           Defeated.

           INT. CNBC TV STUDIO - DAY

           Mitch Gold persuades and charms his INTERVIEWERS.

           INT. DENDREON PATIENT CENTER - DAY

           Mark Frohlich dictates over the phone a data chart titled: 
           PHASE III IMPACT TRIAL. We see in the background the frail 
           leg of a PATIENT uncovered on a bed.

           INT. DENDREON HQ - MONIQUE GREER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Greer listens intently and transcribes Frohlich’s notes.

           INT. DENDREON HQ - SCOTT RICCIO’S CUBICAL

           Scott Riccio admires his surroundings; hangs his name plate 
           outside his new cubical; places a photo of his perfect 
           American family beside his monitor.

           INT. RADIATION THERAPY TREATMENT ROOM - DAY

           Jim Barton undergoes radiation therapy. Mary plays copilot to 
           Kim, who’s in command and taking over the NURSES duties. 

           We lapse through three of Jim’s sessions until he is 
           eventually bald, thin, and ashen. Intercut all with:

           INT. JIM’S IRON WORKS - DAY

           Jim works, but is progressively weaker. Kal helps despite 
           Jim’s proud protests.

           MUSIC DOWN:

           Jim’s fits his bird, a DOVE, on the crown of an iron gate. 
           It’s an elaborate and skilled display of artisanship.
           He LIGHTS a BLOWTORCH and welds the dove to the post. There’s 
           no visor to remove after the work’s done-- old school.

           AT THE FRONT ENTRANCE
           A car PULLS UP. In a moment, Kim and Mary get out.

           KIM POV on Jim and Kal
           Jim glances at them, then focuses back on his work with a 
           sense of theatrical annoyance.

           The women regard one another with light disapproval. 

           BACK WITH JIM

                                 JIM BARTON
                        My sanctuary’s been foiled.

                                 KAL
                            (to the women)
                        Is that Kim!

           Kim and Mary reach the men. Kim and Kal embrace:

                                 KAL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t mind him. He’s an old bull in 
                        a china shop. (beat) Hey Mare.

           Kal and Mary embrace.

                                 KAL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been doing my best to calm him 
                        down, but you know...

                                 JIM BARTON
                        She doesn’t need instigation.

           Jim walks to the other end of the shop. Kim follows him 
           leaving Kal and Mary behind.

                                 MARY BARTON 
                        How’s he holding up?

                                 KAL
                        I tell ya, that man upstairs seems 
                        to be watching him pretty good. 
                        Works as hard as ever.

           WITH KIM AND JIM:

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Pop.

           Jim polishes the dove, his back to Kim as they talk.
                                 JIM BARTON
                        Hiya Kimmie.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        You know we can get ya an extra 
                        hand around here.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        No, we can’t. The co-pays on these 
                        treatments are sucking us dry. 
                        Besides, me and Kal are doing fine.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        You need your strength to fight 
                        this thing.

           Jim stops, turns.

                                 JIM BARTON
                            (stern)
                        Kimmie.

           A beat as they regard each other eye-to-eye.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                            (softens)
                        I’m sorry, dear.

           Jim EXHALES, resets, addresses his daughter:

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Kimmie, look at my hands.

           Kim looks at her father, confused.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious.

           Kim looks at her father’s Atlas-like hands.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        My whole life is drawn on these 
                        hands. Not just all the iron 
                        they’ve twisted, but...

           This is not easy for Jim, much less to find the right words.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Carrying your little body as a 
                        baby; holding your mother every 
                        night still for 49 years. These 
                        hands are, I... I don’t know how to

                        Laying in bed all day saves my 
                        energy for what? To just lay 
                        longer? Is that me, Kimmie? 

           Kim respectfully listens. Tragic to her, but she understands.

                                 JIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        We can’t live forever, darling.

           Tears well in Kim’s eyes but rest on her lids; as tough as 
           her old man. They embrace.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie’s in pajamas with her hair up, BRUSHING HER TEETH as 
           she scrolls through Dendreon’s InvestorVillage boards.

           INSERT: “Pazdur, commish, Hussain, Woo, Scher, who else needs 
           to be clobbered?”

           INSERT: “Cramer and anyone else on wall street who tries to 
           fuck us.”

           She clicks to her digital calendar, we see two days ahead:

           INSERT: “Dr. Hussain” “Jit and James”

           INT. MAHA HUSSAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Hussain’s on the phone. She dresses elegantly, giving off a 
           self-assured aura sprung from good life decisions.

           Marie enters the doorway and KNOCKS politely. Hussain smiles 
           courteously to Marie as she finishes up the call:

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        The FDA better reimburse for the 
                        security...We can discuss when I’m 
                        home. I have to go now.

           Hussain hangs up and stands to greet Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Dr. Hussain. It’s a pleasure to 
                        meet you.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Thank you. Have a seat.
                            (they sit)
                        I have to confess, I’m unsure 
                        exactly what you do?
                                 MARIE
                        I’m a healthcare analyst for a 
                        hedge fund.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        And you’re here for insight on 
                        Dendreon? To invest?

                                 MARIE
                        Not directly. We would trade in the 
                        public market.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        You do understand my position with 
                        Dendreon?

           Hussain motions to a huge stack of letters on her desk.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN (CONT’D)
                        All of them are racist. Half are 
                        death threats. Two are subpoenas.

                                 MARIE
                        That must be terrible. I’m sorry. 
                        And, yes, I do know who you are; 
                        I’m quite up-to-date on the whole 
                        fiasco.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Why are you interested in such a 
                        mess?

                                 MARIE
                        Well, that isn’t precisely a bad 
                        thing for investors.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                            (unimpressed)
                        I see. (beat) I took this meeting 
                        because I saw you had a serious 
                        science background. I thought if 
                        anyone on Wall Street could 
                        understand what’s really going on, 
                        it’s the scientists. But, if you’re 
                        here for help to make your case for 
                        Dendreon, I’m afraid you’ve 
                        traveled for nothing.

                                 MARIE
                        I certainly respect that, 
                        especially given the grief you’ve 
                        been subjected to. But Dr. Hussain, 
                        whether I’m in a lab, writing a 
                        business plan, or doing due 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                        diligence on a biotech, I follow 
                        the scientific process.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Fair enough; what do you want to 
                        know?

                                 MARIE
                        Until the full data is released, 
                        I’m forced to reserve judgement. 
                        But, are there any factors the 
                        public’s missing? It’s very rare 
                        that something that’s not supposed 
                        to work, continues to work. 

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        There aren’t any I could find, nor 
                        a few discerning colleagues.

                                 MARIE
                        Did the FDA do their own 
                        statistical analysis?

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Yes.

                                 MARIE
                        Can you reveal what it said?

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        I cant disclose anything that isn’t 
                        public, but...it was compelling.

                                 MARIE
                        But nothing substantial enough to 
                        persuade the committee?

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        The vote was headed toward a clear 
                        ‘no’ until the wording of the 
                        question was changed.

                                 MARIE
                        I saw that.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Yet you still seem surprised by how 
                        this works. All I can say is that a 
                        smart company has ways of having 
                        the right unqualified people in the 
                        room. The same will be true for the 
                        next vote.
                                 MARIE
                        Clever.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                            (put off)
                        What exactly do you believe, Ms. 
                        Huber, about Dendreon?

                                 MARIE
                        I’m withholding--

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        --judgement. I know. 

                                 MARIE
                        The question I’m answering is 
                        bigger: whether the company will 
                        succeed or fail. 

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        That’s the bigger question? 

                                 MARIE
                            (gets the point)
                        That’s an oversimplification. 
                        However, I will say that unless 
                        Trial 3 shows something drastically 
                        different, I don’t see how the FDA, 
                        and Medicare - if it makes it that 
                        far - can approve this.

           Hussain smiles, again a show of more “knowing”.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN
                        Ask any cancer scientist what’s an 
                        easier proposition; receive funding 
                        to search for a cure, or develop a 
                        new treatment that may, if it’s 
                        lucky, extend life 2 or 3 months?

           Marie processes, gets the point.

                                 DR. HUSSAIN (CONT’D)
                        Dendreon is as much a creature of 
                        your world as it is of my world. 
                        When the science is published, it 
                        may be ugly. And I wonder, what 
                        your bigger question will be then.

           Marie regards Hussain a long beat; the armor chinked.
           INT. BAR - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Marie, Jit, and DR. JAMES ROTHMAN (61), Marie’s former 
           business partner, share a pint at a local dive bar.

           Rothman is the approachable genius professor-type, and 
           obviously the esteemed of the crew.

                                 JIT
                        Vesticles?

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Yes, vesticles. They’re like a 
                        beautifully diligent ant army in 
                        the cells, doing all sorts of 
                        molecular functions.

                                 MARIE
                        Little birds tell me you’re up for 
                        the Noble Prize?

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Talk talk talk.

                                 JIT
                        ...is cheap.

                                 MARIE
                        Not that talk.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Yale’s pushing it. I have nothing 
                        to do with it.

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        Hi Marie.

           Andrew walks by. Marie waves. Jit and Rothman are curious.

                                 MARIE
                        Match date. 

                                 JIT
                        How boring.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, it’s good fun. Plenty of 
                        reasonable options to keep 
                        satisfied.

           The men glance at each other. Marie’s liberated spirit never 
           quite clicks comfortably amongst her male friends.
                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Find love. Best decision of my life 
                        was getting married.

                                 MARIE
                        I don’t know how to find anything 
                        unless there’s some clue it’s 
                        already there.

                                 JIT
                        She wants to win at Wall Street.

                                 MARIE
                        That is part of it, yes. Working 90 
                        hours a week doesn’t leave time to 
                        invest in “the search for love”.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        How is investment?

                                 MARIE
                        I love it. As complex problem-
                        solving as anything I’ve done.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        You break my molecular heart.

                                 MARIE
                        Though, I always seem to defend it.

                                 JIT
                        Deservedly.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        I bet they have you on healthcare.

                                 MARIE
                        Yes. Pharma and biotech.

                                 JIT
                        You should hear some of this 
                        nonsense. Tell him.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s nothing crazy. It just seems 
                        like a biotech has tried to 
                        outmaneuver the FDA.

                                 JIT
                        Bogus double blind experiments.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s fine.
                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        On a long enough timeline the 
                        market corrects, like the human 
                        body snuffing out a disease.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Human beings rarely have the luxury 
                        of long timelines. How long can it 
                        live with disease?

           Marie thinks long and hard; obviously toiling with demons. 
           Then as much to herself, as the men:

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Tonight, we have a special 
                        announcement. Interim results for 
                        our Phase 3 trial are in: a large 
                        pool of our patients have died and 
                        we saw a medium survival benefit of 
                        4.1 months. That got the FDA’s 
                        attention, and at our insistence, 
                        and with the support of patient 
                        groups, we have been granted fast-
                        track status. They’re voting next 
                        week!

           APPLAUSE.

                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        This is the critical moment, the 
                        boiling point. We’re on the 10-yard 
                        line, we’re in the red zone, and 
                        we’ve got to punch it into the end 
                        zone!

           APPLAUSE. Gold raises his arms high and CLAPS with the 
           raucous crowd. We stay on Gold.
           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie’s sits on her bed and talks on the phone while browsing 
           Match profiles.

                                 MARIE
                        Hi, Dr. Redfren?.. Yes, it’s Marie 
                        Huber. We spoke in person about a 
                        month ago or so...Yes, the Provenge 
                        girl... I am just calling to follow 
                        up on that extra study Dendreon 
                        ran. It’s just that they got fast-
                        track status by the FDA and I was 
                        wondering if the results helped 
                        that...Oh? The extra test showed no 
                        change in tumor shrinkage? 
                        Interesting...Right. Well, thank 
                        you very much for this.

           Marie hangs up; intrigued enough to forget about Match.com.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie FLIPS ON the light, exposing a tidy kitchen with 
           starter-appliances. She checks the wall clock: 1:47.

           MOMENTS LATER Marie takes a seat next to a stack of documents 
           (always working) and wraps her hands around the warm cup. She 
           drops in a sugar cube, takes a careful sip.

           INT. LUISE HUBER'S HOME - KITCHEN (LONDON) - EARLY MORNING

           LUISE HUBER (63), drinks tea and eats toast in her house-
           robe. A working-class woman with an equally humble kitchen. 

           The cordless phone on the table RINGS. *Alternate locations. 

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Hello... Marie!... Not at all dear. 
                        I've just sat to drink my tea. It’s 
                        such a pleasure to hear your voice.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, I missed having tea with my 
                        Mum.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        How are you, dear?

                                 MARIE
                        Great actually.
                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Any lucky men?

                                 MARIE
                        I think they felt more lucky than I 
                        did.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Marie!

           They LAUGH.

                                 MARIE
                        I wanted to ask you something about 
                        Dad.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Sure, what is it?

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - KITCHEN

           Kim and Mary sit at the kitchen table working on a stack of 
           medical paperwork.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Mom, can you find the bill from 
                        April 23?

                                 MARY
                        Lemme see here.
                            (finds it)
                        Here you go.

           Mary hands Kim a long receipt with a ton of itemized lines.

                                 KIM BARTON
                            (to herself)
                        The co-pays keep rising.

                                 MARY
                        I’m gonna give it to them tomorrow.

           INT. MARIE’S KITCHEN / LUISE’S KICTEN - SAME

                                 MARIE
                        Was there anything you wouldn’t 
                        have done to keep Dad alive? Any 
                        cost you wouldn’t pay?

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Anything dear.
                            (long pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUISE HUBER (CONT'D)
                        But that just made it harder for 
                        him. What’s this all about?

                                 MARIE
                        Just work stuff. Big happening 
                        tomorrow. But tell me about you.

           We slowly pull back on Marie as she listens, until we feel 
           she’s in a world bigger than her.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           The women work on the receipts and paperwork. It’s obvious 
           there’s a long night ahead, and this is something they’ve 
           done often of late. It’s an image of commitment and the extra 
           lives needed to support a sick loved-one.

           EXT. FDA HQ - DAY

           Outside the FDA headquarters, D.C. PLAYERS stream thick 
           through revolving doors.

           SUPER: Day of the Decision

           INT. FDA HQ (D.C.) - CONFERENCE ROOM

           Pazdur and an ANONYMOUS GROUP OF 10 FDA OFFICIALS listlessly 
           enter the room. It’s impossible to tell the level of 
           expertise present in the group.

           INT. PSAM HQ - KITCHEN - DAY

           Marie pours herself a mug of coffee. She seems more 
           preoccupied and introspective than usual.

                                 JESS (O.S.)
                        Big day.

                                 MARIE
                            (glances at clock)
                        Yes.

           INSERT: CLOCK READS 7:34am

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                            (turns to Jess; you again)
                        6 hours and 26 minutes.
                                 JESS
                            (checks time)
                        Where are you?

                                 MARIE
                        I’m reserving judgement.

           Jess drops a hard “don’t be boring and ordinary” stare.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                            (reluctant)
                        Their pricing model is problematic. 
                        It requires the total cost upfront, 
                        which means they have no prayer 
                        without Medicare. But even so, 
                        Medicare will only cover 80 percent 
                        of the cost. $20,000 in cash is a 
                        lot of money for this patient 
                        group. 

                                 JESS
                        Families always find a way. The 
                        whole industry’s built on that 
                        assumption.

                                 MARIE
                        True. I can attest to that.
                            (beat)
                        On the manufacturing side, they’re 
                        grossly under-capacity.

                                 JESS
                        You’re leaning to short it.

                                 MARIE
                        I’m reserving judgement.

                                 JESS
                        Humility is not a virtue in this 
                        business.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s called integrity, and it’s 
                        audacious, not humble.

                                 JESS
                            (reads Marie)
                        I see. Smart. You’re a big boy now.

                                 MARIE
                        Pardon?

                                 JESS
                        You want the FDA to approve this.
                                 MARIE
                        As far as I can tell, the drug 
                        doesn’t belong on the market, let’s 
                        be clear. That’s cynical.

                                 JESS
                        But you want the FDA approval and 
                        then for Medicare to deny it. Much 
                        bigger short. (beat) How long 
                        between today and then?

                                 MARIE
                        Two months.

           Jess’s eyes narrow. The blood seeking shark is activated.

                                 JESS
                        What miraculous factors can get it 
                        through today?

                                 MARIE
                        The most miraculous: the human 
                        factor.

           Jess holds a long pause, computing the big picture. He grabs 
           a napkin from the kitchen.

                                 JESS
                        Pen?

           Marie hands him a pen.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                            (writing)
                        Keep me in the loop, if you don’t 
                        mind. Call anytime.

           Jess hands Marie his phone number. He smiles, and is gone.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE’S DESK

           Marie works more distracted than usual; glances at the wall:

           INSERT: CLOCK READS 1:49pm

           Marie’s back straightens. We can feel her heart rate flutter 
           with anticipation. She twirls her hair a beat, stops. Works.

                                 PETER SCHOENFELD (O.S.)
                        Marie?

           Marie, borderline startled, is surprised to see Schoenfeld.
                                 MARIE
                        Sorry. I’m so keen on this Dendreon 
                        decision.

           Schoenfeld glances at the clock.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        11 minutes.

                                 PETER SCHOENFELD
                        We have enough time.

                                 MARIE
                        Of course. Sorry.

           INT. PSAM HQ - PETER SCHOENFELD’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Marie takes a seat, glances at the clock before readdressing 
           her attention to Schoenfeld, who extends a sheet of paper.

                                 MARIE
                            (taking it)

                        with you later to go over the

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 PETER SCHOENFELD
                        Five minutes to spare.

           Marie glances at the wall clock:

           INSERT: CLOCK READS 1:55

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you.
           Schoenfeld puts his attention back to work; Marie takes the 
           cue, and leaves. 

                                 PETER SCHOENFELD (O.S.)
                        Dendreon recommendation in two 
                        weeks. No more.

           Marie mouths “fuck” to herself as she exits frame.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE’S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie returns to her desk, studies the check, can’t believe 
           what she sees. She glances at the clock again:

           INSERT: CLOCK READS 1:58

           She fires up the FDA website...Glances at her check again.

           INT. FDA HQ (D.C.) - CONFERENCE ROOM

           The FDA officials file out of the room as listlessly as they 
           entered. Pazdur, sheepishly files out last with the paper 
           results of the meeting loosely held by his side.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE’S DESK - DAY

           Marie peers at her screen.

                        ...of 4.1 months longer than those

                        results, and other positive safety 
                        factors, the FDA has approved 
                        Provenge to be marketed for 
                        treatment.

                                 MARIE
                        Bloody amazing!

           Marie twitches as if she’s repressing anger, an unexpected 
           reaction because this was her desired outcome.

           Marie hangs up, determined.

           INT. MITCH GOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

           Gold, surrounded by Frohlich and Greer are all hugs, high-
           fives, and Blackberry thumb madness. Gold even lets fly a 
           Howard Deanesque WAR CRY.

                            (watching his monitor)
                        Look at er’ go!

           The Execs RA-RA, salivating over it all: the victory, the 
           money, the culminating moment of ten years of effort, the 
           knowledge their lives just turned a major corner.
           INT. SLACK MEDIA HQ - SAME

           Mike Kearney is ecstatic. Hits the investor board: "This is a 
           proud day for all of us! Truth and freedom have prevailed."

           Immediately, Kearney's message thread lights-up with a flood 
           of responses; all equally heroic, Herculean, self-delusional 
           proclamations advocating for the life of patients.

           INT. KERRY DONAHUE'S HOME - OFFICE - SAME

           Donahue responds to Kearny’s message.

           INT. SCOTT RICCIO’S DESK - SAME

           Riccio responds as well.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE’S DESK - SAME

           Marie browses to the FDA website for the Provenge docs.

           INSERT: Status: Unreleased (Refresh) Status: Unreleased 
           (Refresh) Status: Released. Download all documents.

           Marie's excitement is intense. She clicks, the download 
           window opens, and we see an immediate download of the files:

           INSERT: Download window: Downloaded Files 1.. 22.. 67.. 123..

           Marie plugs a USB Flash drive into her work computer, 
           transfers the downloaded documents, packs her bag, grabs the 
           flash drive, and bustles away.

           Marie scurries alongside Female Analyst #1 through a narrow 
           lane between cubicles. They part like a wishbone. 

           Near the exit is Jess. Marie raises the flash drive:

                                 MARIE
                        I won't be sleeping the next 48 
                        hours.

           Jess makes a phone hand-signal on his face. Marie nods.

           We stay on Jess as he watches Marie disappear into the 
           elevator. Then he walks out of frame, leaving us as voyeurs 
           into the prosaic rhythms of a hedge fund office.
           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EVENING

           The room is abuzz as the mouth of a PRINTER SPITS OUT floods 
           of material. Marie is nose down in documents: circling, 
           crossing-out, skimming, highlighting.

           We’re over her shoulder as she marks up specific parts of the 
           documents and handwrites her conclusions (we don’t need to 
           understand everything): “STILL NO TUMOR SHRINKAGE.” “HAZARD 
           RATIO < 1.” “4.1 MN OVERALL SURVIVAL DIFFERENCE. NO 
           EXPLANATION OTHER THAN TREATMENT.” “DOUBLE BLIND IMPOSSIBLE.”   

           Marie skims through several more pages; there is a 
           substantial amount of redactions throughout.

                                 MARIE
                            (stumped)
                        How the fuck is this working?

           Marie sits befuddled in a pile of documents. A document 
           catches her eye. She picks it up, inspects, puts in down.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                            (softly)
                        Bullocks.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marie LIGHTS a kettle on the stove; grabs a mug from the 
           cupboard; RIPS OPEN a tea bag from the wrapper and drops the 
           tea bag in the mug-- habitual and methodical movements to 
           help structure her thoughts. She hovers above the kettle as 
           the water boils, staring closer and closer at the steam hole. 
           Just before steam begins to rise she abruptly SWITCHES OFF 
           the burner and bolts out of the room.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie reaches for the last document she looked at:

           INSERT: Chart titled “Sub Group Analysis”. It clearly shows 
           two groups: Under 65, and Over 65. Each age group shows the 
           months of survival split between Provenge and the placebo 
           group. Under 65 there is less than 1 month difference in 
           survival. But Over 65 there is 11 months difference.

           Marie’s focus is piercing. It’s as if she is double, triple, 
           quadruple-checking the numbers and her conclusions.

           Marie grabs her cell, dials, paces vigorously.
           INT. JIT’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Jit is asleep in bed. His cell phone RINGS and the screen 
           lights up. He rustles awake, reaches for his phone.

                                 JIT
                            (see’s Marie’s name)
                        Un-fucking-believable.

           He picks up.

           Back to Marie. *Remain on her most of the conversation.

                                 MARIE
                            (pacing)
                        Jit. Sorry to call this late.

                                 JIT
                        What.

                                 MARIE
                        I need to confirm something.

                                 JIT
                        I’m hanging up. It’s too late for 
                        this nonsense.

                                 MARIE
                        Is age prognostic with late stage 
                        prostate cancer?!

                                 JIT
                        You think I’m Google or something 
                        because I’m Indian.

                                 MARIE
                        Please.

                                 JIT
                        Of course it’s not. You know that.

                                 MARIE
                        Thanks.

                                 JIT
                        Stop calling me. Call one of the 
                        doctors who wrote it.

                                 MARIE
                        Brilliant!

           Jit hangs up. We’re left with Marie holding the chart, 
           regarding it as if it’s the first thing that makes sense; but 
           also thinking of what Jit last said, which is a good idea.
           She makes another call she feels obviously hesitant about:

           INT. BAR - MEATPACKING DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Jess is chatting up TWO BRIDGE AND TUNNEL GIRLS with his 
           overdressed FINANCE FRIEND.

           Jess’s cell vibrates. He doesn’t recognize the number. 
           Excuses himself to a quieter corner. *Alternate between both.

                                 MARIE
                        They tweaked the data specifically 
                        for Medicare.

                                 JESS
                        Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes. Older men had longer survival 
                        than younger men. That shouldn’t 
                        happen with this patient group.
                        Even an idiotic panel of experts 
                        would sniff through the bullshit. 
                        Dendreon’s delusional.

                                 JESS
                        Can you verify it?

                                 MARIE
                        Not yet.

                                 JESS
                        You need to. (beat) Why don’t you 
                        meet me out?

                                 MARIE
                        Where are you?

                                 JESS
                        Cielo.

                                 MARIE
                        Could use a good dance.
                            (thinks)
                        You’re a colleague. Not a good 
                        idea. Bye for now. Work to do.
           Marie has hung up. Jess looks at his phone screen. Amused at 
           Marie’s oddness. Jess walks back to his group.

                                 JESS
                            (to his friend)
                        Maybe a big play in the pipeline.

           That got his friend’s attention.

           MUSIC UP:

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We timelapse through the night and alternate between the wall 
           clock, and a series of images, the majority of which feel 
           pessimistic. We're confronted with positive findings and 
           wordings in the document: "4.1 months median survival", 
           "severe side effects in just 4% of patients", "safe", charts 
           that correlate data in Provenge's favor.

           Chinese food containers are open and the papers, now marked 
           up in different inks, are strewn all over the room, but in 
           fanned-out piles; an active research process. 

           The sun has finally come up. The clock reads 6:42am.

           We settle on Marie making notes on her computer with a stack 
           of papers on her lap. The sun streaks across her face from 
           the open blinds. The glare’s unwelcome; she SHUTS the blinds.

           MUSIC STOP:

           Marie is obviously seeking something specific. A text message 
           from Jess pops up:

           Jess: "Eureka?"

           Marie: "Bullocks"

           Marie: “Everything redacted”

           Jess: “U have same info Medicare will have. Get inside their 
           head”

           Marie: “Something’s off”

           Jess: “Figure it out”

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - TIMECUT

           Marie jams on her laptop at her desk, which is full of 
           material and trails of sticky notes. Her phone receives an 
           ALERT: “New Match.com Message.” Marie ignores it. A Jim 
           Cramer interview runs in the background:

           INT. THESTREET.COM'S STUDIOS - DAY

           Jim Cramer and associate, GEORGE MORIARTY, are engaged in a 
           comparatively subdued discussion segment:

                                 MORIARTY
                        Dendreon had a big win last Friday, 
                        didn't they?

                                 CRAMER
                        As Adam reported, tremendous 
                        insider selling almost immediately. 
                        I think that was indicative of 
                        people inside their own company 
                        shocked at how high their stock 
                        went. But let it pull back. Let it 
                        pull back.

                                 MORIARTY
                        Yes, even the CEO, Mitch Gold, came 
                        out and sold 2.2 million shares, 
                        and that shocked the bulls.

                                 CRAMER
                        Yeah, ya know. That gives me a poor 
                        taste in my mouth. I think he nets 
                        $27 million in a day, selling 72 
                        percent of his stock.

           This gets Marie’s attention. She stops and regards the TV, 
           it’s SOUND slowly drowned out by her thoughts and intensity.

           EXT. NASDAQ - STREETS - DAY

           Mitch Gold is amidst a photo-op outside NASDAQ after the 
           celebratory ringing of the bell. He stands with a group of 
           patient ADVOCACY LEADERS, including Robert Samuels, as well 
           as a FAMILY comprised of a MOTHER and TWO SONS, noticeably 
           without the father. Frohlich and Greer are also present.

           A REPORTER from CNBC approaches Gold:

           polished DOVE Jim had been working on.

           Pulling back we Jim and Kal lowering the heavy gate into 
           place. Although the older men are both strong, it feels like 
           this is the job of younger bodies.

           The HOMEOWNER, male (50s), watches uncomfortable to be just a 
           spectator; we can imagine a conversation 5-minutes ago when 
           Jim wouldn’t allow him to help.

           Jim’s hands slowly start to shake as he tries to steady the 
           heavy gate into place. After a moment Kal feels the 
           wobbliness and glances at Jim, who’s stoically trying to 
           overpower his body’s malfunction. But it’s not working:

           The Homeowner notices something’s off, the gate’s not going 
           anywhere, and Kal increasingly directs his attention to Jim.

           Jim’s hands are shaking up a storm.

           The Homeowner sees what’s coming and rushes over just in time 
           to take Jim’s place as his hands loss grip.

           The Homeowner and Kal quickly fix the problem, finishing in a 
           matter of seconds, before turning to Jim.

           Jim looks on timidly. There’s really not much to say, and no 
           one does say anything.

                                 MARIE
                        Hi, is this Doctor Shore?

           INT. NORTH SHORE PULMONARY - NEIL SHORE'S OFFICE - SAME

           DR. NEIL SHORE (53), dressed in a suit, not a lab coat, has 
           his Harvard MD certificate on the wall. *Alternate locations.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Yes, this is Neil Shore.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you for taking my call.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        You wanted to know about Provenge?

                                 MARIE
                        Right. That’s me.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        You work at a fund?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes. You were one of the authors on 
                        the main study findings?

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Yes. That’s right.

                                 MARIE
                        Great. Excellent. So you had access 
                        to all the data. Could you-- 

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        The data they gave me to write my 
                        findings, yes.

                                 MARIE
                        Right, could you answer a few 
                        questions?

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Yes, that’s fine.

                                 MARIE
                        I’ve been going through the FDA 
                        documents and there were a few 
                        items I was trying to understand.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                            (grabs the FDA stats)
                        I guess just to get to the point, 
                        I’m confused by one table of data  
                        in the FDA’s statistical analysis: 
                        it shows that men in the placebo 
                        group who were over 65 lived much 
                        shorter than the men under 65. 11 
                        months.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Uh. Um. I'm sorry, make that 
                        statement again? 

                                 MARIE
                        In trying to understand why the men 
                        in the placebo group who were under 
                        65 lived nearly 11 months longer 
                        than the men over 65.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        The issue about age, I think, is 
                        just a non-issue because it 
                        strictly relates to small numbers. 
                        I think the majority of the trial 
                        patients were over 65.

                                 MARIE
                        Hmmmm---

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        ---I..I'm not really clear what 
                        you're saying. You're saying the 
                        patients who were under 65 lived 11-
                        months longer than those over 65?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes, just in the placebo group. 
                        Under 65 was 28-months, and over 65 
                        was 17-months, in just the placebo 
                        group.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        In just the placebo group?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes.

           SILENCE. 

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Hmmm. Well, um, I would...I don't 
                        have the data in front of me right 
                        now. But I would have to go back 
                        and look at that. 
                                 MARIE
                        I thought you would have been aware 
                        of that...

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                            (fumbling, searching)
                        Uh. Well. I think I have heard this 
                        issue addressed and I think my 
                        understanding, uh, is it was 
                        statistically non-significant.

                                 MARIE
                        Right. It may be nothing. But I 
                        figured you would know.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        I..I suspect it's small numbers.

                                 MARIE
                        Well, it's actually a couple 
                        hundred.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                            (defensive)
                        And you're the first person to 
                        really be dwelling on it. I never 
                        heard anybody, including the FDA, 
                        including the New England Journal, 
                        have that much concern for this 
                        because of such a small number 
                        we're talking about. But I'll 
                        certainly look into it.

                                 MARIE
                        It was about 200 patients.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        It wasn't a couple hundred 
                        patients. The whole trial was 512 
                        patients. It's not a couple 
                        hundred; you're way off.

                                 MARIE
                        It was 183 men. 

           SILENCE.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        183 patients over 65?

                                 MARIE
                        Just in the placebo group.

           SILENCE.
                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I'm fascinated by it. Given that 
                        it's not mentioned in the paper, I 
                        wonder if the authors were even 
                        aware of it?

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                            (bullshit)
                        The authors, we know about it. It 
                        wasn't an issue. But I will be 
                        having dinner with Mark Frohlich, 
                        tomorrow night; I will ask him.

                                 MARIE
                        I appreciate that. It’s probably 
                        nothing, but I’m trying to 
                        understand it for our analysis.

           Dr. Shore hangs up, finger-taps his office phone, then dials.

                                 DR. NEIL SHORE
                        Mark Frohlich please...Tell him 
                        it’s Dr. Shore...Tell him it’s 
                        important... Mark.

           BACK WITH MARIE.

           Marie jots notes. After a moment she pauses, as if she caught 
           herself in a personal debate.

           Jess approaches, snaps her out of it.

                                 JESS
                        How we looking?

           The “we” makes Marie frown, but she moves on.

                                 MARIE
                        The doctors who wrote the report 
                        don’t even know what’s in the data. 
                        I think Dendreon is number-fudging 
                        everyone, not just the government. 
                        I can’t fathom how this slipped 
                        past the FDA.

                                 JESS
                        Government.

                                 MARIE
                        Corruption.

                                 JESS
                        When do you present to Peter?
                                 MARIE
                        Two days.

                                 JESS
                        You still need to figure out how 
                        they got these numbers.

           Already moving, Marie grabs some documents and marches away.

                                 MARIE
                        I know.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           A DESK LAMP IS TURNED ON

           Marie sits at her desk. The entire stack of FDA printouts is 
           in front of her. She wears fitness cloths, and now ties her 
           hair back as if she intends to go through the stack sheet-by-
           sheet. FLIP. Scan. FLIP. Scan. FLIP. Scan. FLIP.

           The camera pans up to the lamp, holds a few beats, then pans 
           back to Marie FLIPPING through the stack. Half the stack is 
           completed. One leg is propped up on her chair. Her attention 
           isn’t showing wear; she’s a machine.

           We stay with her now: she scans a page, FLIPS it. The next 
           page is read as any other, until a frown creases her brow and 
           she instinctively holds her breath; her mind needing maximum 
           body function. She inches her face closer, re-reading.

           Marie raises the paper from the pile and holds it eye-level.

           INSERT: A redacted chart with three neat columns titled “CELL 
           EXTRACTION IN 3 ROUNDS OF LEUKAPHERESIS”.

           Marie fully extends her arm to regard the chart. Suddenly it 
           clicks, but it’s not the same excitement as her last 
           discovery. There’s a growing dread in the room. 

           Marie digs into the nearby pile of already read pages and 
           quickly pulls out 3 papers. Grabs scissors. Thumbtacks.

           Marie stands at her white wall:

           1) Cuts out the redacted chart showing three distinct columns 
           for each round of blood extraction the patients underwent.

           2) Cuts a column from one page, places it over redacted 
           column 1-- it fits perfectly.

           3) Repeats for column two.
           4) Repeats for column three.

           5) The finished chart shows a series of glyphs that require 
           training to completely understand, but our understanding is 
           transferred from Marie's reluctance to believe what she sees.

           She steps back and stares at the chart. 

           She grabs her phone:

           Marie: “Eureka?”

           Jess: “Asking me or telling me?”

           Before answering she stares at the chart. Then:

           Marie: “Asking myself”

           Jess: “?”

           Her arm drops to waist level.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - TIMECUT

           On Marie's screen we read the google search she enters: 
           "Immunosenescence: aging of immune system". 

           Among the first results are the "Trudeau Institute New York." 
           Marie pops upright, she's found something.

           INT. MRI WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Jim and Mary sit in a middle-class waiting room. An ELDER 
           MALE PATIENT reads a People Magazine in the far corner, while 
           a MIDDLE-AGED FEMALE PATIENT sits across from Jim and Mary.

           Mary’s writing a list on a small spiral notepad. Jim 
           noticeably presses one hand over the other.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        We need to give at least 9-months 
                        notice to the guests who fly in.
                            (off Jim)
                        Don’t roll your eyes at me.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        You know I don’t like all this 
                        fuss, Mare.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        Too bad.
                                 JIM BARTON
                        How many are we cramming in the 
                        yard?

                                 MARY BARTON

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Can we fit that many?

                                 MARY BARTON
                        It’s not that many, Jim.
                            (off Jim)
                        Jim, what’s wrong?

           Jim searches for the right way to say that he doesn’t even 
           know where he’ll be tomorrow; that he’s afraid he’ll 
           disappoint everyone by not making it. But...

           A NURSE approaches.

                                 MRI NURSE
                        Mr. Barton?

                                 JIM BARTON
                            (getting up)
                        That’s me. (to Mary) Just do what 
                        you think is best, Mare.

           Mary watches Jim’s body disappear through a door to the back. 

           INT. MRI ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jim, dressed in a gown, lays on a MRI bed as it moves his 
           body forward, feet-first to scanning area.

           DR. LAURA HAYNES writes on a notepad. Marie enters while 
           knocking politely on the open door.

                                 MARIE
                        Dr. Laura Haynes?
                                 LAURA HAYNES
                            (friendly)
                        That’s me.

                                 MARIE
                            (extends hand)
                        Marie Huber. (off Laura) Healthcare 
                        analyst.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        Right. The one who emailed at 3:30 
                        this morning.

                                 MARIE
                        Some things just can’t wait.

           Haynes lowers her chained eyeglasses, amused.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        What can I do for you. You 
                        mentioned you’re trying to 
                        understand the mechanism of a new 
                        treatment.

                                 MARIE
                        Yes. To be honest, it’s been like 
                        surfing in a house of mirrors. 

           Marie PLOPS her knapsack down and produces her paperwork. She 
           finds the right page and offers it to Haynes.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m trying to understand this 
                        chart, and its implications.

           Haynes reads; after a beat she peers closer.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Can immunosenescence can shed light 
                        on this?

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                            (to herself)
                        This can’t be right.
                            (studies closer)
                        Yes. I think so. And these men...

                                 MARIE
                        ...were over 65 years old and had 
                        late stage castrate-resistant 
                        metastatic prostate cancer. 

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        Are you sure this is correct?
                                 MARIE
                        Yes. The blood count charts were 
                        available separately. A little 
                        puzzle work.

           INT. ONCOLOGY TREATMENT ROOM - DAY

           STERILE GREEN GLOVES insert an IV into an elderly arm. The IV 
           line traces to a high-tech COBE Spectra Apheresis System. The 
           power button is PRESSED ON, the machine's interface fires up. 
           The room is overtaken by a low mechanical HUMM.

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        In only three to four weeks, ALL 
                        their white blood cells were 
                        removed three times.

           Blood passes through the IV and into the machine, then 
           quickly exits from a different line connected to a second IV 
           in the Patient.

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        I keep hearing that removing white 
                        blood cells doesn’t effect the body 
                        because they reproduce so fast.

           At the back of the machine a third line passes a mellow-pink 
           liquid extraction into an Eluctra Cell Separation System.

           A NURSE in pink scrubs moves to a computer terminal. She 
           positions the cursor to enter the Patient's name; 12th on a 
           spreadsheet titled "PROVENGE PHASE 3 - D9901".

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        That’s not true. After humans reach 
                        their mid-60s the body changes and 
                        its white blood cell production and 
                        health is very different: a slow 
                        deterioration of the immune system 
                        and its defenses to disease, 
                        tumors, cancer, infection, 
                        everything. This process will 
                        devastate these men.

                                 MARIE
                        Past tense.
                            (off Laura)
                        All the men in this trial have 
                        died. 

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        Anything strong they had left, was 
                        removed.
                                 MARIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        Yes.

                                 MARIE
                        This was the placebo group.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        This was not a sugar pill. It was 
                        poison.

                                 MARIE
                            (getting more determined)
                        There’s more-- (Marie grabs a 
                        second paper) 

           INT. DENDREON MANUFACTURING PLANT - DAY

           A TECHNICIAN in a lab coat, yellow gloves, medical mask, 
           grabs half the plasma and places them in an incubator; the 
           other half are put into in a refrigerator marked “Placebo”.

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        The placebo men had 1/3 of their 
                        cells put into the fridge-- not a 
                        proper incubator. The temperature 
                        most probably killed, or at least 
                        severely damaged, the cells...

                                 LAURA HAYNES (V.O.)
                        ..Yes..

           A Nurse hangs the refrigerated plasma to an IV line; slips 
           the IV line under the elderly man’s skin.

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        ...then they reinfused these cells 
                        into the men. That just CANNOT be 
                        good?

           BACK WITH THE WOMEN:

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        No, the older bodies would suffer 
                        significant damage; inflammation 
                        would skyrocket, risk of infection 
                        increases, tumor suppression 
                        declines. This essentially lifted 
                        the brakes on the cancer.
                                 MARIE
                        Oh my.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        It's selective harm...

                                 MARIE
                        ...not selective benefit.
                            (full realization)
                        They didn’t fudge the numbers. 
                        They’re real. 

           Marie grabs the age-data chart and shows it to Laura Haynes.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        The older men in the placebo group 
                        really did die early.

           The two women stare at each other. This feels like a crime. 
           Haynes hands the papers back to Marie.

           Marie packs up her bag and starts to leave.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                            (disturbed)
                        Thank you for your time.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        What are you going to do with this?

           Marie stares Laura Haynes in the eyes, but won’t disclose an 
           answer.

                                 MARIE
                        I really appreciate this.

                                 LAURA HAYNES
                        You’re a good scientist.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you.

           Marie leaves. We stay on her expression as she walks out. 

           INT. HALLS OF TRUDEAU INSTITUTE - MINUTES LATER

           Marie marches through the halls. She got what she needed.

           To her right is a small window on a door labeled: “Treatment 
           Room 5”. She passes the doorway, stops, then doubles back to 
           peak through the window. Just as she gets to the window the 
           door OPENS and hits her head. A NURSE carts a ELDERLY MAN on 
           a gurney through the door.
                                 TRUDEAU NURSE
                        Oh! Excuse me.

                                 MARIE
                        Not the smartest idea to plant your 
                        face against a door.

           The nurse and the man have made it fully into the hallway. 
           The man glances at Marie-- his eyes a dimmed life-force, his 
           body even more so. Marie engages the him, nonetheless:

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        How are you?

           She grabs his wrist, then rubs his arms. Tactile. More 
           knowledge of what the ill need. Retains eye contact. Smiles. 
           We can see this is familiar and natural to Marie.

           The Nurse is happy to see Marie’s care.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Good day to you.
                            (to the Nurse)
                        Bye now.

           The Nurse smiles, then carts the patient down the hall back 
           in the direction Marie came from. Marie’s gaze follows them 
           and she’s surprised to see Dr. Haynes standing outside her 
           doorway, apparently having witnessed the entire moment.

           Marie and Haynes regard each other, as continuation of their 
           last moment. Marie looks deeper this time. Haynes holds her 
           gaze, then nods politely and disappears back into her room.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie opens her laptop and watches the CURSER pulse on her 
           memo: red text, green text, underlines, bolds; it's an active 
           document to say the least. She titles it:

           INSERT: “PROVENGE: AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION”

           EXT. MARIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Through a cafe window we see Marie exit her building.

           UNKNOWN POV watches Marie rush across the street with purpose 
           until she disappears into the throngs. A man’s half comes 
           into frame and places a phone call. It’s an eerie feeling.
           INT. PETER SCHOENFELD'S OFFICE - DAY

           We're at the end of a meeting between Marie and Schoenfeld:

                                 MARIE
                        The operational shortcomings 
                        combined with the high price will 
                        create a supply and demand problem 
                        that I think points ultimately to 
                        failure. But, there’s more. When we 
                        get to the science and ask the 
                        fundamental questions: does this 
                        treatment really work?; will 
                        Medicare approve it?; I think the 
                        answers across the board are “no”, 
                        and we should short the stock.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Go on.

                                 MARIE
                        I’ve had this corroborated by 
                        leaders in the field, and the 
                        evidence clearly shows that the 
                        survival benefit claim is bogus. 
                        It’s fairly simple to debunk.

           Marie hands Schoenfeld her document.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        An alternative explanation?

                                 MARIE
                        It’s a document I put together to 
                        wrap my head around everything.

           Schoenfeld reads.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        These are big claims to just slip 
                        through; even for the FDA.

                                 MARIE
                        It starts with them really. The 11 
                        person committee that approved the 
                        treatment was simply not qualified. 
                        They had ZERO prostate cancer OR 
                        immune system experts-- the two 
                        most important areas of expertise 
                        needed to understand a drug that 
                        uses the immune system to treat 
                        prostate cancer. 
                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Government.

           Schoenfeld ponders it.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s almost as if the fix was in.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Remember what I told you about your 
                        worldview.

           Schoenfeld returns the document to Marie and thinks to 
           himself a moment. Finally:

                                 SCHOENFELD (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to make the bet.

                                 MARIE
                        Sir?

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        I have no faith Medicare won’t 
                        approve. Then it can linger around 
                        and it’s hard to predict for how 
                        long. That’s a big bet. All your 
                        work should still hold in 6-months. 
                        We’ll consider then.

                                 MARIE
                        I understand.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        So what’s next?

           Marie isn’t prepared for that.

                                 MARIE
                        I’ve been obsessed with this. I’m 
                        empty-handed.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Not good. Find something in Pharma 
                        or Biotech. You’re great there. 
                        Also, I want one of our analysts to 
                        head to ASCO.

                                 MARIE
                        ASCO?

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        The biggest oncology conference in 
                        the world. Lot’s of players. Your 
                        friend Mitch Gold will probably be

                        there. I’m asking you so you can 
                        get your feet wet. But, the same 
                        week there’s also a biotech 
                        conference in England, at 
                        Cambridge, your alma mater. You 
                        have a week to decide.

                                 MARIE
                        I see. Thank you for extending the 
                        option.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                            (off Marie’s silence)
                        What is it, Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        Do you mind if I continue with this 
                        alternative explanation document?

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Why?

                                 MARIE
                        Because this drug should never see 
                        the light of day.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                            (considers)
                        I can see its important to you. In 
                        your own time.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you sir. Also, I’d like to 
                        post this to the Medicare public 
                        boards before the drug review.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        You’d would need to disclose you 
                        work for an investment company. We 
                        can’t allow our name on it.

                                 MARIE
                        I understand.

           Marie rises.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Marie.

           Marie turns back to her boss.

                                 SCHOENFELD (CONT’D)
                        Despite how it makes us feel, here 
                        we don’t do things for the world,

                        we do them for investors and 
                        ourselves.

                                 MARIE
                        I understand.

           Schoenfeld’s look says, “be careful.” Not an idiot.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE'S DESK - LATER

           Marie hacks away at her memo, she's sculpting it like art as 
           much as science.

           INSERT: Marie’s screen: "This memo was written by an investor 
           who may or may not have financial interest in..." 

           Marie contemplates that disclosure. 

           INSERT: Marie’s screen: The cursor pulsates, then the entire 
           disclaimer passage is highlighted, and deleted.

           We sense, as much as Marie probably does, that this decision 
           may have a second life.

           INT. PSAM HQ - JESS’S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess works with headphones, removes them as Marie approaches. 

                                 JESS
                        So?

                                 MARIE
                        He’s not betting.

                                 JESS
                        Fuck. The stock price is 31. You 
                        realize how huge this short is? We 
                        can go 20, 30 to 1.

           Marie does the calculus.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. I’m going for it anyway.

                                 MARIE
                        Is that legal?

                                 JESS
                        Sure. I mean, it’s against the 
                        spirit of the rules, but if the 
                        firm doesn’t hold a position, 
                        there’s no conflict of interest.
                                 MARIE
                        I see. (beat) 30 to 1?

                                 JESS
                        If you’re right.

                                 MARIE
                        It doesn’t work. I can’t imagine 
                        they’ll fuck up and pass it.

                                 JESS
                            (considers)
                        Okay. I’m doing it. You should too.

                                 MARIE
                        I want this drug off the market.

                                 JESS
                            (already at it)
                        Capitalizing on their bullshit will 
                        sweeten it, no?

           Marie considers, agrees, then extends her arm and turns her 
           hand, opens palm:

           INSERT: A USB flash drive rests in the center of her palm.

           Jess turns to Marie. Snatches the flash drive. Studies it. 
           Raises an eyebrow.

                                 MARIE
                        You share you die. Check the 
                        analysis yourself before you bet. I 
                        don’t want to see this on 
                        Medicare’s public forum before the 
                        vote. 

           Marie bustles away. We can feel he's not sure if she did what 
           he thinks she just did. Nevertheless, serpent-like he plugs 
           in the drive. When the Finder pops up, we see its contents: 

           INSERT: Thumb Drive Explorer: “VIP Contact Info", "Draft 
           Email", “Provenge - An Alternative Explanation".

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marie sits in bed on her laptop, reading up on white blood 
           cells. A chat window pops up on her screen: JESS JONES. 

           JESS: “Read memo. Doing it now.”

           MARIE: “How much?”
           JESS: “$100k”

           MARIE: “Wow”

           JESS: “You?”

           The question lingers as the cursor pulsates.

           MARIE: “100k”

           JESS: “Badass. Forecast tomorrow = rain”

           MARIE: “:)” 

           Jess signs off. Marie closes the chat window and stares at 
           her screen. After a beat she opens her online investment 
           account. Logs in. Hesitates a moment on her next action. Then 
           she executes: TRADE > SHORT > DNDN > $100,000, hesitates, 
           erases, retypes new number $236,000 > SUBMIT.

           Marie dials a number on her cell phone.

                                 MARIE
                        Hi mum...Did I wake you?

           INT. LUISE HUBER'S KITCHEN (LONDON) - EARLY MORNING

           Luise Huber drinks tea and eats her morning toast.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Not at all dear. I'm already on my 
                        second Earl Grey...Hm...Ahhum...You 
                        know I don't trust these things, 
                        Marie.

           Back in Marie's Room. *Alternate between both.

                                 MARIE
                        This will be good for you. And I’ll 
                        guarantee it with my own savings.

           Luise takes a long pause: decisions like this are completely 
           antithetical her mindset, but, she loves her daughter.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        That’s out of the question. (beat) 
                        Well, how much do you want to use?

                                 MARIE
                        The investment account we set up.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        All of it?
                                 MARIE
                        Trust me, mum. This will be good.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        It’s not that, it’s just... I can’t 
                        find the words.

                                 MARIE
                        It’ll be okay. Love you. Enjoy your 
                        morning.

                                 LUISE HUBER
                        Bye Marie.

           Luise Huber hangs up the receiver, obviously uncertain.

           INT. MITCH GOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

           Gold drinks his morning coffee and scrolls through a document 
           on his computer; his concentration intensifies. 

           INSERT: The cell-loss chart Marie stitched together.

           Gold lifts the phone receiver, dials.

           Gold SLAMS the phone.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MARIE'S DESK - MORNING

           Marie’s on her computer. She browses to the Medicare website; 
           CLICKS on “Provenge Public Boards”. The page loads, we see a 
           list saturated with activists urging and threatening Medicare 
           to approve. But then she notices something else: “Alternative 
           Explanation.” She CLICKS on the link and we CLOSE ON her 
           frowning face, but it’s hard to read what she feels.

           INT. PSAM HQ - JESS'S DESK

           Jess studies the charts on his terminals. Marie approaches.
                                 MARIE
                        I saw something very familiar on 
                        the Medicare boards this morning.

                                 JESS
                        Oh?

                                 MARIE
                        A Jonathan White, apparently a man 
                        who created a near identical memo 
                        to mine, posted his to the forum.

                                 JESS
                        Great. Will it help the vote?

           They exchange a knowing glance.

                                 MARIE
                        The vote shouldn’t need help.

           Jess lowers his eyes, as if “don’t play this game.” Marie 
           holds his gaze, almost as if to establish the narrative.

           Marie scurries away. Jess smirks, returns to his work.

           EXT. CMS HEADQUARTERS (BALTIMORE) - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           An artless American structure of concrete and glass.

           SUPER: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Baltimore

           INT. MEDICARE HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A GROUP OF 11 HEALTH BUREAUCRATS, many trained physicians and 
           scientists, are at the tail-end of Provenge's 9-hour Medicare 
           approval session. Frohlich represents Dendreon. The energy 
           has a sense of drudgery, yet light. 

           DR. GOODMAN (50s), tall, thin, taciturn, tries to wrap it up:

                                 DR. GOODMAN
                        Is there something that should have 
                        been said that would be relevant to 
                        the work of this Medicare panel? 
                        Anyone?

           DR. BART CLASSEN (42), a serial patent enforcer, objects:

                                 DR. CLASSEN
                            (Marie’s memo in his hands)
                        Did you improve survival or did you 
                        really just reduce life in your 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. CLASSEN (CONT'D)
                        placebo men? We learned that with 
                        AIDS that removing white blood 
                        cells will decrease survival rate.

                                 DR. GOODMAN
                        Doctor, we got your point.

                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        I'd like to respond to that.

                                 DR. GOODMAN
                        Go ahead, Dr. Frohlich.

                                 DR. FROHLICH
                        The number of white cells removed 
                        were just 2 percent of the entire 
                        body's white blood cell count. It's 
                        statistically insignificant.

                                 DR. CLASSEN
                        2 percent of the body but 95 
                        percent of the blood’s!

                                 DR. GOODMAN
                        Point noted Dr. Classen. (beat) 
                        Anyone else wish to speak before 
                        this board rules on coverage?

           All abstain from more talks.

                                 DR. GOODMAN (CONT’D)
                        Very well. We're at the end and I 
                        think I'm allowed more than a 
                        couple semicolons, though I'll be 
                        brief. (beat) Medicare cares about 
                        reasonableness and necessity. We're 
                        seeing in this current environment 
                        a lot of innovations that could 
                        potentially benefit a lot of 
                        patients, but it still requires 
                        trying to satisfy evidence 
                        requirements. We can't forget that.

           Frohlich doesn't know yet where this is going.

                                 DR. GOODMAN (CONT’D)
                        It's not an easy thing to do, so we 
                        thank Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
                        and their close work with Dendreon 
                        for supplying this office with that 
                        evidence. Had you not done that, I 
                        am not sure where this panel would 
                        be today. 
           A BLUE-CROSS REP, woman (50s), nods her head in acceptance.

                                 DR. GOODMAN (CONT’D)
                        So, I say, and I think my 
                        colleagues would agree, that we 
                        have not seen anything here today 
                        to prevent us from contradicting 
                        the FDA's decision.

           Frohlich’s anxiety immediately decompresses.

                                 DR. GOODMAN (CONT’D)
                        We still have to determine the 
                        exact parameters for who qualifies 
                        and who doesn't, but I can say as 
                        Chairman of this panel, we will go 
                        forward.

           APPLAUSE. Frohlich glows as if he just saved his job.

           INT/EXT. PSAM HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON a CNBC website: “Provenge Gets Medicare Approval”.

           Marie and Jess have their heads bowed.

                                 MARIE
                        I just lost $236,000 and my Mum’s 
                        entire investment account.

                                 JESS
                            (surprised by number, but:)
                        You fucked up. Big time.

                                 MARIE
                        How can they approve this bloody 
                        treatment. It doesn’t work!

           Jess barges out while disparaging himself. He SLAMS the door. 
           Marie’s cell phone rings: “Mum”. 

           Marie bows her head, takes a deep breath, answers the call.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Mum?

           We move outside the conference room and regard Marie on the 
           painful call; eventually she breaks down and cries. 
           Colleagues walk by but don’t bother to enter and console her.

           Back inside the conference room: Marie hangs up. She stands 
           straight and wipes her eyes dry of tears. Personal 
           humiliation and grief have gotten their fix, now she must 
           recover and face the world.

           INT. PSAM HQ - MAIN OFFICE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Marie exits the conference room and stops: the energy of the 
           office hits her-- the competitive humm of finance. Around her 
           are trading terminals, busy bees, serious people who crave 
           the anxiety of high risk transactions. She can hear her own 
           breath, shallow and quick, echo in her eardrums as if her 
           head’s underwater. She slowly plugs into the world around 
           her, letting the office rhythms become her own until her 
           breathing reaches a deeper and stronger pace; until she snaps 
           out of it and marches the opposite direction of her desk, 
           averting the side-glances from witnesses of her breakdown.

           INT. PSAM HQ - PETER SCHOENFELD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Schoenfeld’s in his office alone, door’s open. Marie slips in 
           without knocking.

                                 MARIE
                        Sir.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Hi Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        I want to go to ASCO.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        An email would have sufficed.

           Marie stays in the doorframe.

                                 SCHOENFELD (CONT’D)
                        Something else?

           Schoenfeld removes his glasses. A moment of unspoken 
           understanding passes between them.

                                 MARIE
                        No sir.

           Marie leaves. Schoenfeld returns to his work without a 
           further thought.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DR. ARMSTRONG'S OFFICE - DAY

           The face of Jim Barton, thin and weak, yet dignified.
           Kim, Mary, and Jim sit solemnly, as if across from a priest, 
           expecting no satisfactory answers to their biggest questions.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        The cancer's spreading, Jim. At 
                        this point, as your doctor, I want 
                        us to think with one mind on this: 
                        I want us to think only about 
                        prolonging your life with as little 
                        pain as possible.

           The family silently exhale a collective breath of whatever 
           hope they had left.

           A bow of tear-liquid rests on Jim's lower eyelids. His voice 
           has a slight quiver.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I know I can't run from this 
                        forever. Well?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        There's a new option for men in 
                        your situation. And you meet all 
                        the criteria. It's called Provenge.

           Kim’s attention perks.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        You won't be able to go on other 
                        treatments until 6-months after.

           Kim shifts in her seat.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        Jim, Mary, Kim, what I'm suggesting 
                        is that you think hard on this one. 
                        And please ask any questions.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        How long will it give me?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Every patient's immune system is 
                        different, Jim. You’re strong. But, 
                        you know we can't say.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        What about the trials?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Trials reported an average of 4.1 
                        months prolonged survival.
                                 JIM BARTON
                        4 months.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        And side effects?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        Minimal.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        Honey, what do you think?

                                 JIM BARTON
                        It won't make me useless?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        From everything I have read, and 
                        spoken with the company about, it's 
                        nothing close to chemotherapy, 
                        which would be your only real 
                        option at this point-- and I don't 
                        want to do that to you.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        What do you think Kimmie?

           Kim hesitates, torn and ill-equipped to form an opinion.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        If it doesn't hurt you, Pop, and 
                        Dr. Armstrong recommends it, I 
                        think we should consider it.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        What will this cost us?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        It's expensive: $93,000 plus other 
                        fees. It comes in around $100,000.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Excuse me?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        This price is where treatments are 
                        headed. But, our first step would 
                        be to get the Medicare application 
                        in-- for which Jim is a great 
                        candidate. Then, we see if Jim's 
                        insurance will cover the extra 20 
                        percent of the cost.
                                 JIM BARTON
                        $100,000. Lord.
                            (thinks on it)
                        4 months gets me to our golden 
                        date, Mare. (thinks) Let's get to 
                        it. Kimmie and Mare will fill out 
                        whatever you need.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Do you have any other patients in 
                        treatment?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        One other who started last week. 
                        But more are asking.

           Dr. Armstrong hands the clipboard and thick application 
           across the desk to Kim. On top of the application is an 
           expensive Dendreon brochure presenting images meant to show 
           empathy and care. Kim, like anyone, doesn't know how to parse 
           her feelings. She'll do anything to prolong or cheat the 
           inevitable; she'll take the bet, despite its cloudiness.

           INT. MITCH GOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

           Gold is mid-interview with an executive-level candidate, IAN 
           CLARK (50s).

                        I'm excited to learn more. What's 
                        the current marketing strategy?

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        We've been very successful with 
                        patient outreach, mainly through 
                        advocacy groups. A new focus is

                        doctors. We see a real opportunity 
                        with urologists. They feel the 
                        oncologists have had all the fun

                        consider Provenge for their 
                        patients. The incentive is simple:

                        extend life with minimal side

           INT. ONCOLOGY TREATMENT ROOM - DAY

           Jim Barton is upright on an intricate clinical bed. A NURSE 
           completes the final wrap-up procedures; detaching an IV tube 
           from a catheter. Mary and Kim Barton are there too. 

           The Nurse returns with bandages to secure the catheter, but  
           Kim takes the nurse aside while Mary stays with Jim.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        You're leaving the catheter in?

                                 BARTON NURSE
                        It's mandatory for the treatment.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Why?

                                 BARTON NURSE
                        They don’t say why.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        You're taking all these white blood 
                        cells. He could get infected.

                                 BARTON NURSE
                        I’m sorry, Ms. Barton. You should 
                        talk to Dr. Armstrong. We do 
                        provide all the dressings necessary 
                        to keep the area clean.
           The Nurse hands over a pre-packaged dressing kit and exits 
           the room, but not before a forced smile.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We cut into a high-tension situation: Jim Barton's in bed 
           with his undershirt pulled up. Mary’s at his side while Kim 
           moves between the bed and bathroom. A HOUSE NURSE (GLORIA), 
           (40s), Hispanic, helps too. Kim is the general.

           SUPER: After Two Extractions

           Kim reaches the bed and the three of them inspect Jim's 
           wound. His catheter, a permacath (two color-coded tubes sown 
           with a few stitches right above the nipple, giving direct 
           access to a vein) is infected, badly. 

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Gloria, get me the prep-pads in the 
                        bathroom. Top drawer.

           Gloria’s on it.

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Mom, lemme see the bandage.

           Mary hands Kim the used-dressing. Kim studies it, then lifts 
           it near her nose: it stinks; bad sign. Tosses it.

           Gloria returns with the alcohol dipped prep-pads. Kim puts on 
           sterile gloves and gently dabs the pads on the infected area. 

           Jim Barton flinches a bit, but never complains or makes them 
           feel bad for what they're doing.

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Gloria, help him get comfortable.

           Gloria moves to the other side of the bed and repositions the 
           pillow so Jim's full back is supported. Mary tenderly rubs 
           Jim's arms and legs. Kim applies betadine.

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                        Ok Pop, we're almost there.

           Kim works diligently on the infection.

                                 MARY BARTON
                        Can you speak with Dr. Armstrong?

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Dr. Armstrong and I are going to 
                        have a conversation as soon as I 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIM BARTON (CONT'D)
                        finish this dressing. Just. Right. 
                        Now.

           Kim completes the new dressing and exits.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim dials a cordless phone.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Dr. Armstrong?... Hi, it's Kim 
                        Barton... Yes it’s late. We're 
                        having problems with Jim's 
                        permacath... Yes, it's still on, 
                        and that's the problem. He’s got an 
                        acute infection... I know we have 
                        another treatment. I just don't 
                        understand why we can't replace the 
                        catheter?... But he's going to get 
                        sepsis. What good is the treatment 
                        if it kills him?... His body barely 
                        can fight the infection... Ok. I’ll 
                        try... Goodnight.

           Kim hangs up. Takes a moment to herself. It's obvious she 
           needs nothing more than to cry, and she fights that volcano 
           until just the subtlest CREAK from upstairs sets her 
           instinctively back on the treadmill of duty.

                                 KIM BARTON (CONT’D)
                            (without thinking)
                        I'll be...

           The words can’t leave her mouth: in a swell it’s all about to 
           come out and she can’t stop it. Kim rushes to the couch, 
           smothers her face with a pillow and BALLS profoundly.

           We leave her alone and peer from afar into the kitchen until 
           we eventually land on the empty dinner chair of Jim Barton.

           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Marie sits at her laptop and browses to her website. Her 
           homepage is the same as we saw at the beginning of the film. 

           INSERT: A cheesy spinning envelop icon “New Message”.

           She reads the message. There’s an image of a handsome man 
           that accompanies it. “Jason Gibson”.
                                 MARIE
                            (to herself)
                        Go on, Marie.

           Marie TYPES a reply. SENT.

           She clicks on an ADMIN button and surfs to where website 
           owners check page-view stats. Something catches Marie's eye.

           INSERT: "Top Hosts Visiting MarieHuber.com:” “1- Dendreon 
           Corporation” “2- Kroll Private Investigators"

           Marie releases an audible GASP.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DR. ARMSTRONG'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Armstrong seats the Barton's on his office couch, then 
           sits adjacent to them.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        How are you, Jim?

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I've been better. But you tell me.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        I wish I had better news. Your PSA 
                        levels are way up. In fact, it's 
                        the same for my other patients. I 
                        put 10 men on this-- this is not 
                        working the way it was supposed to. 
                        I’m taking all of them off it.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        It hasn't worked for anyone?

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        I'm sorry, Kim. No one. 

                                 JIM BARTON
                        I not doing chemo, Paul.

                                 DR. ARMSTRONG
                        I know.

           The spark of hope that Provenge had lit is whiffed out.

           INT. NYC RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Marie enters the bar, pauses, scans purposefully. Her gaze 
           lands on one MAN, then advances. 
           The man is handsome and well-dressed. Seemingly a good match 
           for our distressed heroine.

                                 MARIE
                        Jason?

                                 JASON
                        Jason. You must be Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 JASON
                        You too.

           Marie goes for a shake, but Jason delivers a hug.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Drink at the bar, or at our table?

                                 MARIE
                        Dinner?

                                 JASON
                        I'm a gentleman, and in a 
                        conversational mood.

                                 MARIE
                        Hmmm.

                                 JASON
                        On me. Come on.

                                 MARIE
                        Alrighty.

           INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DINNER TABLE - LATER

           Marie seems good, relaxed even. This is going well.

                                 MARIE
                        This is so nice. I haven't felt 
                        relaxed in months.

                                 JASON
                            (as if he’s just visiting)
                        This city's not designed for that.

                                 MARIE
                        It's not New York. I love New York.

                                 JASON
                        Work?
                                 MARIE
                        In a manner of speaking, yes. You 
                        know what, we should talk about a 
                        less depressing subject.

                                 JASON
                        Come on. I want to hear.

                                 MARIE
                        No. On this one I'm pretty sure I'm 
                        right. It's a long story and I 
                        don’t want to end up alone at the 
                        bar with him later.

           Marie points to a BRIDGE AND TUNNEL GUIDO. They both LAUGH.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I think I want you to stick around 
                        longer.

                                 JASON
                        You think?

                                 MARIE
                        I think.

                                 JASON
                        Cheers to sticking around.

                                 MARIE
                        Cheers.

           They cheers and drink.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t absorb more 
                        disappointment right now.

                                 JASON
                        Only you could disappoint yourself, 
                        Marie.

           Pause.

                                 MARIE
                        I don’t like how that made me feel.

                                 JASON
                        It's actually real simple. Let me 
                        be clear about this. But first, 
                        let's have a shot.

           Jason waves a WAITRESS over.
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Two shots of Tequila? (scans Marie) 
                        Yeah, she’s a tequila girl.

           Before Marie can speak...

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Let's wait for the shots first. 
                        This will be fun, I promise.

           The waitress returns with two shots, two limes, and salt.

           Jason raises his shot glass, waits for Marie to follow. She 
           does. They CLINK.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        To writing a bunch of horseshit and 
                        putting your nose where it don't 
                        belong.

           Jason fires down the shot, bites the lime, winces.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!

           Marie is frozen... shaken.

           Jason stands, puts his jacket on, leans close to Marie; so 
           close she smells the tequila on his breath.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        You're so cute.

                                 MARIE
                        Look at me.

           They're eye-to-eye.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        There is nothing about you that 
                        scares me. Do you understand what 
                        that says about who you are, and 
                        about who I am?

           They’re locked-in.

                                 JASON
                        Hubris. All you types. You’ll get 
                        your’s.

           Jason erects himself, leaves. Marie subtly shakes, tears well 
           in her eyes but she holds herself together. A new anger and 
           determination build in her. She grabs her bag and leaves.

           watches, Fendi clutches, ambitious eyes.

           The lights are dim, and the tail-end of a Dendreon promo 
           video plays. Mitch Gold finishes delivering the company’s 
           value prop in a professionally lit interview:

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        We hope we will forever inspire 
                        people to do great things for 
                        patients with cancer.

           The video ends with the titles: "Patients 1st" cross-fading 
           into the "Dendreon" logo. The lights lift, and at the lectern 
           is the PRESIDENT OF THE CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE (61):

                                 PRESIDENT OF CRI
                        Tonight we're here to celebrate Dr. 
                        Mitchell Gold for his role in 
                        steering Dendreon through 
                        regulatory review and approval of 
                        the first FDA approved therapeutic 
                        cancer vaccine. The approval has 
                        been hailed as a major advance for 
                        the field. It gives me great 
                        pleasure to present the recipient 
                        of the Oliver R. Grace Award to the 
                        Chief Executive Officer of 
                        Dendreon, Doctor Mitchell Gold.

           APPLAUSE. Gold enters stage right, shakes the President's 
           hand, takes the lectern. The microphone is too tall. An 
           initial instinct to rise on his feet is imperceptibly 
           thwarted, and he tilts the microphone down.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Wow. (waits for applause to settle) 
                        First off, let me say what a 
                        tremendous pleasure to be in a room 
                        with so many esteemed immunologists  
                        tumor biologists, and leaders of 
                        oncology. My work is built from 
                        your dedication. Let's take a 
                        moment to really recognize this 
                        magnificent event.

           Gold leads a round of APPLAUSE.  

                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        For me, as you saw from the video, 
                        cancer is personal. I had a very 
                        painful event in my life when my 
                        mom died of breast cancer. She was 
                        26. I was just 4. How many people 
                        in this room, raise your hand, if 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        you have a direct relative in your 
                        family who's been affected by 
                        Cancer? Raise your hand, keep it 
                        there for a moment.

           Gold scans the room, his hand raised high. Marie’s hand is 
           raised.

                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        Keep it up. Keep it up. Look around 
                        the room. 

           Nearly the entire room has their hands raised.

           INT. HILTON GRAND BALLROOM - TIMECUT

           It's post-dinner, the majority of guests are boozed by now. 
           The atmosphere is electric with cajoling, deal-making, 
           networking, scoring illicit affairs: business.

           We spot Panzur and a group of PHARMA EXECS chatting it up.

           Marie interrogates a FEMALE REP and MALE REP of a Biotech.

                                 MARIE
                        Our earliest focus are companies at 
                        least in a phase 3 trial period. 
                        There's enough data to make 
                        informed analysis; that is of 
                        course, if you’re willing to share.

           They all LAUGH; inside baseball for Big Pharma and the 
           Street. The group exchange cards and say their good-byes.

           Marie turns to the crowd. She notices Dr. Hussain engaged in 
           lively conversation, and comically/tragically, an obvious 
           BODYGUARD hovers behind her. Hussain catches Marie. They wave 
           to each other. Just as Marie moves to approach Hussain, Mitch 
           Gold, charming a group of DOCTORS, enters her eye-line. 

           Marie holds her breath, exhales, fluffs her hair and slithers 
           to her table, ear shot of Gold.

           Marie opens her clutch; grabs a pocket mirror. We see Gold 
           shaking hands with the doctors. His non-verbal communication 
           feels fairly apparent: his eyes remain on the doctors, but 
           his body already tilts toward Marie.

           Marie applies lipstick with the help of a pocket mirror. She 
           twists the mirror subtly to the group of men to spy on Gold, 
           but he's not there. She turns to scan, but just as she does a 
           pleasant surprise awaits her: Mitch Gold stands before her.
           Gold extends his hand.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Mitch Gold.

                                 MARIE
                            (they shake)
                        Hi, I'm Marie Huber. 
                        Congratulations on your award.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Thank you very much. Who you with?

                                 MARIE
                        A New York firm.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Which one?

                                 MARIE
                        I don't like to say until I’m 
                        certain I want to know more about 
                        you.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        You’re an analyst?

                                 MARIE
                        How'd you guess?

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        All the cute girls in New York 
                        finance are analysts.

                                 MARIE
                            (brushing it off)
                        I actually like to think of myself 
                        as a scientist; the best weapon to 
                        puncture through to the heart of 
                        anything.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Puncture the heart? Now I know 
                        you’re a hedge fund girl.

           Marie takes a sip of her drink, smiles widely at Gold.

                                 MARIE
                        I've been coming to conferences 
                        like this for years. Never once has 
                        the CEO of a company ever 
                        introduced himself to me. You're 
                        the vaulted-class, you have your 
                        backs to the wall and accept 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                        handshakes like the Queen of 
                        England. You don't need to pretend 
                        anymore that you don't know who I 
                        am. You should tell your private 
                        investigators to conceal their 
                        digital trail better.

           Gold just smiles-- continuously; great pearly whites on him.

                            (suddenly jumps)
                        Don’t shoot!

           Marie jumps. She’s not amused. Mitch LAUGHS holding his 
           stomach. When he settles we can see he’s serious; a mix of 
           charisma, intelligence, and steeliness.

                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny. Reading your memo, I 
                        thought, “this person really 
                        believes she’s a scientist.”

                                 MARIE
                        Every day more patient boards light 
                        up with desperation. Your stock is 
                        plummeting. The science is right.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        There isn’t a cancer patient board 
                        in the world that isn’t desperate. 
                        As for your science, just post-hoc 
                        analysis rubbish.

                                 MARIE
                        Your entire survival data was post-
                        hoc analysis.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        You know nothing of what it takes 
                        to bring a drug to market.

                                 MARIE
                        You mean bring to market through 
                        intimidation? By coercing and 
                        rallying the spirits of day traders 
                        to pose as patient advocates?

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        It’s a free country.

                                 MARIE
                        But that’s not the real crime. The 
                        real crime is that you treated men 
                        like lab mice. Obfuscate the truth

                        all you want, I know what you did 
                        and I’m confident my version of the 
                        truth will come out.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Your version of the truth? Did I 
                        miss something? Who are you? You’re 
                        just an analyst who makes money for 
                        a living. You have no seat at this 
                        table.

                                 MARIE
                        The truth has a seat at every 
                        table.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                            (laughs mockingly)
                        Are you pretending you didn’t have 
                        a personal stake in Dendreon?

           Marie’s taken back. Gold looks through her.

                        Come on, Marie. We know. I know.

                            (off Marie; patronizing)
                        Marie, you’ll be disappointed how 
                        this story ends. Your life could be 
                        in a very different place soon. 
                        Mine will be too. Then we’ll surely 
                        be different. As the world talks 
                        about immunotherapy for the first 
                        time in a 100 years, ask yourself, 
                        what did Marie Huber contribute to 
                        the world?

           That hurt. Marie holds her ground, but Gold senses blood.

                        You don’t understand human beings. 
                        You expect the public to 
                        deliberately seek truths that 
                        threaten their inherent need to

                        Your memo is tainted, tainted by 
                        you. That is how this chapter will 
                        end. We’re entering a period of the 
                        world where transnational 
                        corporations are more powerful than 
                        nations; where nations are nothing 
                        more than logos slapped over 
                        corporate interests, markets, and

                        infrastructure. Oncology is part of 
                        that system: a trillion dollar 
                        network comprised of millions of 
                        buzzing bees devoted to treating 
                        cancer, to study it, to care for 
                        those afflicted by it, and to 
                        search for a cure. An ecosystem of 
                        objectives all dependent on one 
                        factor: the human body's continued 
                        vulnerability to develop cancer. 
                        Nothing you or I do can effect the 
                        power of that. What happens if we 
                        stop getting cancer, or if we cure 
                        it? What if that cure is cheap, or 
                        free? What happens to the trillions 
                        of dollars in transactions? The 
                        hospitals and treatment centers 
                        built; the doctors, nurses, 
                        scientists; the lobbyists; the 
                        regulators; the multinationals? No 
                        industry can fall on its own sword; 
                        it must exist.

                                 MARIE
                        What an overwrought depiction of 
                        the world. Nothing can live 
                        forever. Cancer should teach you 
                        that. It’s a cell that’s attempted 
                        immortality, and look what happens 
                        to its host?

                        You make it sound like it’s some 
                        biological imperative for things to 
                        continue existing on some 
                        treadmill. You personally netted 
                        thirty million dollars off men’s 
                        early death at your hands. I did 
                        nothing wrong. I represented the 
                        truth fairly and I fought the right 
                        fight. Betting on my own beliefs 
                        doesn’t make me feel the slightest 
                        sliver of guilt. You tell yourself 
                        your work is good; you embrace 
                        whatever myth works for you no 
                        differently than the delusional 
                        sheep who wish to bury their heads 
                        in the sand than face the hard 
                        truth. But in the end, all you do 
                        is corrupt what’s important. 
                        Everything is for sale in your 
                        world. Even human life.
                                 MITCH GOLD
                        And what’s important, Marie? The 
                        truth? Your’s? Mine? The FDA’s? The 
                        patients? The truth with a capital 
                        “T”? Which one?

           Gold takes a long drink. Pivots. Sincere.

                        When I was a kid I vied that one 
                        day I’d become a doctor to rescue 
                        my Mom. I promised my father I’d 
                        bring her back. 
                            (reliving it)
                        She didn’t.

           A long beat passes between them.

                                 MARIE
                        So what happened?

           The question lingers. Mitch ruminates on it, looks around at 
           the wealthy guests-- some of who watch them speak.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        I woke up.

           Marie twitches. They remain face-to-face until Gold turns, 
           leaves as if the conversation never happened.

           MARIE POV ON GOLD as he joins a conversation with a group 
           that includes Mr. Samuels.

           Marie studies Gold a while and looks at the faces of the 
           guests. When she’s ready, she grabs her clutch and stridently 
           walks towards the brass-edged revolving exit doors.

           We're behind Marie as she walks through the revolving doors.

           INT. PSAM HQ - DAY

           Marie exits the elevator with a directive guiding her. She 
           reaches her desk, but before she can put her bag down 
           Schoenfeld is there.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Marie...How was ASCO?
                                 MARIE
                        I don't quite know how to answer 
                        that. We need to talk.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        We do. Come to my office. (off 
                        Marie) No note pad needed.

           They exchange a mutually knowing look.

           INT. PSAM HQ - PETER SCHOENFELD'S OFFICE - DAY

           Marie and Jess sit with Schoenfeld and MARCO EPSTEIN (58), 
           the PSAM Attorney; the type who smiles while he destroys you.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        The SEC has filled a subpoena 
                        against both of you. 

                           MARIE
                                                          JESS
           What?
                                              Fuck.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        No one here is interested in long-
                        winded explanations. We already 
                        have a good idea of what happened.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        The firm is protected from this 
                        memo, but we need to hear the facts 
                        from you both. Did either of you 
                        have bets against Dendreon?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        How much?

                                 MARIE
                        $236,000. I lost it all.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        Mr. Jones.

                                 JESS
                        I don’t need to answer that.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        That’s your right.
                            (to intercom)
                        Please bring security in. (to Jess) 
                        You're fired.
           Two well-dressed SECURITY GUARDS enter; escort Jess away.

                                 SCHOENFELD (CONT’D)
                            (to Marie)
                        You're not fired, yet. As far as we 
                        can tell you didn't break any laws 
                        even if you betrayed my trust.

                                 MARIE
                        To talk absolutely plainly, the 
                        money hurts, a lot. But I care 
                        about something more. Sir, I’d like 
                        to ask for a leave from the firm 
                        while I pursue getting this drug 
                        off the market. This is what I want 
                        most, and I don’t want to burden 
                        you with that.

           Schoenfeld considers it.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        None of this has unraveled how I 
                        imagined.

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        You can’t have it both ways. Choose 
                        a side or you end up with nothing.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        We suspect the SEC knows 
                        everything. 
                        We’re obliged under law to pay the 
                        legal fees, but if a deal is on the 
                        table we’re taking it unless you 
                        want to fund your own defense.

                                 MARIE
                        I understand.

           Marie lowers her head. Schoenfeld regards her, softens:

                                 SCHOENFELD
                        Marie, everyone in this industry, 
                        from us down to day traders, 
                        fantasize and plot to create 
                        volatility in our favor; to rig a 
                        bet that makes us rich. And 
                        sometimes we can; we certainly try. 
                        But in truth, the market is an 
                        expression of a much bigger world; 
                        you can never uncover and 
                        mathematically model all the 
                        factors of why things are the way 
                        they are. And you can get hurt. 
           Marie raises her head; she appreciates his leniency.

           INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - LATER

           Marie, with Epstein beside her, is questioned by BRIAN 
           FITZSIMMONS, a thick-necked Irish American policeman’s son.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                        I have the testimony here from Mr. 
                        Jess Jones. You’re here to tell me 
                        that you did not know, or assume, 
                        whether or not Mr. Jones would send 
                        that memo out? 

                                 MARIE
                        I cannot possibly speak to 
                        someone’s intentions or 
                        motivations.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                        But you thought that a disclosure 
                        saying,"I'm Marie Huber. I work for 
                        a hedge fund. I'm holding short 
                        positions" would have distracted 
                        people from your thesis?

                                 MARIE
                        I think disclosing a financial 
                        stake lowers the probability of 
                        being taken seriously. And there 
                        are a very large number of people 
                        out there, not the least of which 
                        are Dendreon shareholders holding 
                        $5 billion worth of stock, who 
                        would wish to distract attention 
                        away from the science and to turn 
                        the focus exclusively on a 
                        perceived conflict of interest as a 
                        way to obfuscate from the science.

           Marie sticks to her guns, but we get a sense she’s shooting 
           herself in the foot.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                        The SEC is charging you as an 
                        accomplice in the leak. We’re 
                        handing down a $25,000 fine and a 6-
                        month suspension from any 
                        securities work. You have a right 
                        to appeal and are under no 
                        obligation to accept this offer. Do 
                        you understand?
                                 MARIE
                        This is bollocks. You’re letting 
                        them off.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                            (ignores her)
                        Do you understand?

                                 MARIE
                        Do you understand what you’re 
                        doing? By suspending me, the 
                        voracity of evidence that 200 men 
                        were essentially killed off like 
                        lab mice will be washed over.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                        Again, I ask, do you understand?

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        Marie?

           Marie works to control her anger. Marie nods.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        As a representative of Ms. Huber, 
                        these terms are accepted.

                                 FITZSIMMONS
                        We’re done here.

           Fitzsimmons closes his binder and leaves. Marie sits silently 
           as Epstein wraps up his things.

                                 MARCO EPSTEIN
                        It’s a good deal.

           He leaves. Marie sits alone.

           Gold stands at the window with his hands in his pockets. His

                        Right. The head statistician at

                        in the world says, 'Here's a great 
                        way to get your drug approved: kill

           INT. GREENWICH MANSION - GALLERY ROOM - DAY

           The Lead Investor, who we still never see, holds a cell phone 
           to his ear while overseeing the final stage of a CREW OF 5 
           installing a large rectangular installation in the center of 
           the room. The installation is draped in a black cloth like an 
           oversized coffin.

           He gives up on the call; lowers his phone.

           The cloth is pulled off revealing Damien Hirst’s tiger shark 
           suspended in formaldehyde, The Physical Impossibility of 
           Death in the Mind of Someone Living. 

           The crew leave. The Lead Investor is breathless for a beat. 
           He then walks in front of the face, kneels, regards it, and 
           remains there as we peer into the mouth of the shark.

                        Thanks Katie.

           Katie is half-way out the door...
                                 MITCH GOLD (CONT’D)
                        Katie...do you like this view?

                                 KATIE
                        It's a view people dream of.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                        Is it?

                                 KATIE
                        The American dream.

                                 MITCH GOLD
                            (thinks it over)
                        Thank you, Katie.

           Katie exits. Gold stares out the window for a long time.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jim Barton gingerly descends the stairs; the railing is his 
           best friend these days. Loose-fitting pajamas and a wedding 
           ring are all that adorn his body.

           Jim steps into the living room. On a pull-out sofa to his 
           right, fast-asleep is Kim. In front of him, Mary is asleep in 
           a large armchair. She doesn’t seem comfortable, but we sense 
           she’s living with the kind of exhaustion that takes whatever 
           rest she can get.

           Jim walks to the mouth of the kitchen and regards his and his 
           family’s life in objects: FRIDGE MAGNET PHOTOS, MUGS, STAINS, 
           A COFFEE MAKER, IMPERFECTIONS OF CABINETRY, HIS WIFE’S CHAIR, 
           HIS CHAIR-- the breadcrumbs of human lives.

           Jim turns to his wife sleeping in the chair. He watches her 
           closely. Then he looks closely at his daughter.

           Jim approaches Mary, bends and gently kisses her on the 
           forehead. Mary’s eyes open. In half a beat Jim’s smile 
           removes her immediate call-to-action response.

                                 JIM BARTON
                        Dance with me, Mare.

           Mary regards her husband a long breath, parsing its true 
           meaning: he doesn’t think he’ll make the party. She holds his 
           gaze until she joins him in accepting that.

           Jim extends his hand, Mary takes it. She rises... they 
           embrace... they remain embraced... their heads side-by-side 
           on the other’s shoulder... their hands on their backs... Jim 
           lifts his right foot and steps to the side... then he lifts 
           his left foot and steps between Mary’s legs... They dance.

           MUSIC UP: “Nostalgia” by Mulatu Astatke, slowly comes to us. 
           *The song plays till end credits at varying intensities.

           On the couch Kim’s eyes are open. She remains respectfully 
           quiet and still.

           KIM POV
           Mary and Jim dance, their bodies remain embraced.

           INT. JAMES ROTHMAN’S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s a cocktail party of SCIENTISTS. We’re on Dr. Rothman, 
           who accepts congratulations. He excuses himself and crosses 
           the room to meet Marie and Jit in conversation.

                                 MARIE
                        Now I get to put “Dr. James 
                        Rothman, former business partner 
                        and Noble Prize winner” on my CV.
                            (embracing)
                        Congratulations are in massive 
                        order.

                                 JIT
                            (shaking hand)
                        Seriously. Amazing.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        It’s a prize. It doesn’t actually 
                        produce science!

           They all LAUGH. Dr. Rothman turns his attention to Marie.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN (CONT’D)
                        Marie, I’m sorry. Jit told me what 
                        happened.

                                 MARIE
                        It hurts, but I’m going to stick 
                        with this. I suppose you aren’t 
                        looking for a new employee?

           It’s said in jest, but there is much truth in jest. Dr. 
           Rothman smiles widely; it feels like a gentle ‘no.’

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        You deliver the hard truth so 
                        gently.
                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        I always say, if it's the truth and 
                        it hurts; it's you that is hard, 
                        never the truth.

                                 JIT
                        Clever.

                                 DR. ROTHMAN
                        Human life, Marie. Focus on making 
                        it better.

           Marie’s PHONE RINGS. She doesn’t recognize the number.

                                 MARIE
                        Pardon gentleman. (takes call) This 
                        is Marie.

           INT. THE BARTON’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Kim Barton sits at the kitchen table. She has printouts in 
           front of her, but holds Marie’s memo in her hand.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Hi Marie. My name is Kim Barton. 
                        I’m the daughter of a patient who 
                        went through Provenge treatments. 

           Marie straightens her back.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh?

           We’re back to Kim when she was on the couch week’s earlier, 
           peeking over the blanket’s edge watching her parents dance.

                                 KIM BARTON (V.O.)
                        I came across your memo on the 
                        internet. I have to confess I found 
                        your contact information on those 
                        forums. What a crazy situation.

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        Thank you for that. This has all 
                        taught me a lot.

                                 KIM BARTON (V.O.)
                        I’m a registered nurse and our 
                        family’s experience with Provenge 
                        was an absolute nightmare. Our 
                        doctor took all his patients off 
                        it.
           Back with Marie, who walks through the crowd.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh my.

           Back with Kim in the kitchen.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        I just called to tell you that I’m 
                        a believer. Your science made 100% 
                        sense to me. And I know it’s 
                        probably hard for you, but I just 
                        wanted to encourage you to keep 
                        going. You’re doing important work, 
                        and you should know you’re making 
                        an impact. It made me feel like I’m 
                        not crazy, and now families can 
                        find the information themselves 
                        before choosing treatment.

                                 MARIE
                        That’s such a sweet thing to say. 
                        And it really couldn’t have come at 
                        a better time. I’m feeling a bit 
                        lost.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Keep going Ms. Huber. You’re making 
                        a difference.

           Marie straightens. Takes a deep breath. Wipes aside a small 
           bow of tears that’s emerged on her eyelid.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you. I needed this.

                                 KIM BARTON
                        Come visit anytime. I’d be happy to 
                        show you everything we have.

           Marie now reaches the door, looks back at the amused men, 
           smiles. They wave. She opens the door.

                                 MARIE
                        That actually sounds wonderful. Do 
                        you have his chart readings?

           EXT. 5TH AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie exits the building onto 5th Avenue.

                                 MARIE
                        I’ll see you in Kansas City!
           She hangs up her phone and dials a new number.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Haynes? Marie Huber...Yes, you 
                        remember me...Want to write a 
                        scientific paper? 

           A smile emerge across Marie’s excited face. 

           We go high on Marie as she marches down 5th Avenue, weaving 
           through the crowd: on fire, back in the game.

           MUSIC RISING

           We switch back to Kim on the couch, her eyes still peeking 
           over the edge of the blanket. Tears well in them now. We see 
           reflected on her eyeballs her parents dancing.

           INT. THE BARTON'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Kim hangs up the phone. We’re now with her at the time of 
           Marie’s call.

           Kim exits the kitchen. Her mother sits on the couch watching 
           the television. Behind her a golden balloon floats on a 
           string attached to a wedding photo of Jim and Mary. 

           Kim sits beside her Mom. Now we see what they see:

           On TV is an old VCR tape of Jim and Mary's wedding from 50 
           years earlier, that day. It's a grainy video from an era of 
           fairytale-like dignity, where everyone dressed the part and 
           had straight backs. The newlyweds waltz in circles in languid 
           motion. Their faces are lined with nothing but love and 
           celebration of the fully-embraced decision to be there for 
           one another as the centerpiece of their lives.

           As the song progresses, the figure of Jim slowly erases as he 
           dances with his bride. We stay and witness the beloved erased 
           from memory until we feel in our bones that this is the 
           fragility that we fear most: all that is real, is fleeting.

           When the realization hits, when the image of the woman 
           dancing alone brings us fully home, we...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           The music continues over END TITLES, all of which are 
           accompanied by found footage:

           TITLE 1: “Marie Huber, Dr. Laura Haynes, and experts 
           published a paper in the Journal of the National Cancer 
           Institute, outlining Marie’s science.”
           INSERT: The JNCI Publication “Interdisciplinary Critique of 
           Provenge as Immunotherepy in Castration-Resistant Prostate 
           Cancer”

           TITLE 2: "Because of Marie’s efforts and reports from doctors 
           and patients that it didn’t work, Dendreon was ultimately a 
           failure.”

           TITLE 2b: “In 2014 it filed for bankruptcy, yet was rescued 
           from bankruptcy in 2015 by Valeant Pharmaceuticals."

           TITLE 2c: “Valeant also supported this guy.” 

           INSERT: PHOTO of the smirking schmuck, Martin Shkreli.

           TITLE 3: "Mitch Gold now runs a hedge fund, and is a multi-
           millionaire several times over."

           TITLE 5: "Marie Huber hasn’t been able to get a job again in 
           finance, but will not quit her crusade until Provenge is 100% 
           off the market."

           INSERT: MARIE leading lectures about Provenge.

           TITLE 6: "In 2012, 12 new Cancer drugs were approved, 9 of 
           which had no survival benefit, and only 2 extended life no 
           more than 2 months. The average cost of each of these 
           treatments is between $70,000 to $115,000 annually."

           TITLE 7: "Despite being labeled quackery by the establishment 
           100 years ago, authentic immunotherapy treatments are being 
           heralded as the next age of cancer treatment, and have 
           already cured many forms of the disease."

           TITLE 8: “In 2011, health care spending in the United States 
           was estimated at $2.7 trillion dollars; alone as large as the 
           6th largest economy in the world and larger than the entire 
           national budget of France.”

                                         THE END
