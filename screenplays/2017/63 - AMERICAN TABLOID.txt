           EXT. PLAYGROUND - 1940 - DAY

           SCHOOL KIDS watch a fight: GENE POPE JR, 8, a rich know-it-
           all who never gives up, gets his ass KICKED by a SCHOOL 
           BULLY, who SITS on Gene, PUNCHING him.    

                                 SCHOOL BULLY
                        You think you’re so smart? You 
                        think you know all the answers. 
                        Raise your hand now!

           He PUNCHES Gene again. Gene looks to his brothers in the 
           crowd: FORTUNATO, 11, and ANTHONY, 9.

                                 GENE
                        Are you just gonna stand there?

                                 SCHOOL BULLY
                        Your brothers ain’t helping you. 
                        Now, you gonna fight back or just 
                        piss yourself like a sissy?

                                 GENE
                        Call me a sissy again.

                                 SCHOOL BULLY
                        Sissy!

           Gene PUNCHES him, ROLLS on top, gaining the upper hand. The 
           BULLY tries to cover his now BLOODY FACE from Gene’s 
           relentless PUNCHES. The victim has become the villain...

                                 GENE
                        Who’s the sissy now?

           FREEZE FRAME ON GENE’S FIST ABOUT TO LAND ANOTHER BLOW... 

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        There are two kinds of people in 
                        the world: those who fight back and 
                        those who take it up the ass. I’ll 
                        give you one guess which one I am.

           Gene SMASHES his FIST into the BULLY’S FACE.

           INT. POPE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The Pope family has money and a LOT of it. GENEROSO POPE SR, 
           45, a man of morals, CATHERINE, 42, an old school Italian 
           matriarch, Fortunato, Anthony, and, of course, Gene dine. 
           They’re fast -- TALKING over each other as they SLURP down 
           their food. It’s not classy, but it looks fun.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        High society calls us wops -- loud, 
                        dirty Italian immigrants who dared 
                        to come to this country, make a 
                        fortune, and live on Park Avenue.

           EXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

           Generoso Sr, dressed for work, exits his fancy building with 
           little Gene Jr trailing behind him. A SNOBBY WOMAN, wearing a 
           mink stole, GASPS as Generoso Sr NODS and TIPS his hat. 

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        But we didn’t care what those 
                        motherfuckers whispered behind our 
                        backs. Papa single-handedly built 
                        an empire and we were goddamned 
                        proud of it. 

           EXT. LITTLE ITALY - DAY

           The Italian owned and operated area of New York. Generoso Sr 
           talks to the LOCAL MERCHANTS, helps UNLOAD DELIVERIES. Gene 
           Jr does the same. Like father, like son.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        Too many Italian immigrants 
                        couldn’t speak or read English, so 
                        they were at the political mercy of 
                        those who did. Papa said, “Well, 
                        we’ll just see about that.”

           INT. IL PROGRESSO - NEWSROOM - DAY

           OFFICE GIRLS rush around. Telephones RING OFF THE HOOK. 
           REPORTERS TYPE furiously at their typewriters.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        Enter Papa’s crown jewel: Il 
                        Progresso. The largest Italian 
                        language newspaper in New York. It 
                        had a circulation of 200,000 and 
                        gave the Italian immigrants a 
                        chance to be informed about the 
                        world around them.

           Gene Jr listens intently as his father shows him the layout. 
           Then FRANK COSTELLO, 58, a tough son of a bitch, enters.
           Generoso Sr GREETS him, clearly old friends.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        And looky here: my godfather 
                        stopped by to say hi...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           A COUPLE of THUGS DRAG a SCREAMING MAN toward Frank -- he’s 
           got his SLEEVES ROLLED UP -- a pair of PLIERS in his hand. 

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        You know Frank Costello, the head 
                        of the New York mob. I’m one lucky 
                        son-of-a-bitch to have him looking 
                        out for my moral guidance.

           Using the pliers, Frank YANKS TEETH from the MAN’S MOUTH.

           INT. POPE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

           Gene tries to SCURRY AWAY as Catherine GRABS him.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        Not that my current moral guidance 
                        was anything to brag about.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I told you to clean that room of 
                        yours, you dumb son-of-a-bitch!

           We FREEZE ON Catherine RAISING her hand to HIT Gene.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        See, Ma hated me. I think it was 
                        because I’m too much like Papa and 
                        she was forced to marry him back in 
                        Italy -- like that was my fucking 
                        fault. But whatever, Ma! I’m ready!

           Catherine FULL ON SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A TEACHER points to a MAP of the United States. Gene RAISES 
           his hand, while others SLUMP in their chairs.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        But the prick at the beginning was 
                        right: I did know all the answers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It’s because I did my fucking 
                        homework. And because I did...

           INT. M.I.T CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Gene’s all grown up now, still RAISING HIS HAND before the 
           TEACHER can even get the question out.

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        I got into M.I.T and not because I 
                        was good, which I was and don’t 
                        fucking forget it, but cause those 
                        silver spoon fat cats didn’t know 
                        the first thing about hard work.

           INT. IL PROGRESSO - NEWSROOM - DAY

           Gene’s now going over the layout with the STAFF. He’s in his 
           element, he’s good at this, he’s respected...

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        After graduation, Papa wanted to 
                        retire and chose me to take over Il 
                        Progresso. I put in the time, I put 
                        in the work, and now it was my turn 
                        to find my place in the sun.

           Finished, Gene leans back in his chair and CRACKS OPEN the 
           latest edition, fully satisfied with himself.

                                       The Big Idea

           An old school LIGHT BULB turns on, growing BRIGHTER and 
           BRIGHTER until it EXPLODES -- SHATTERING GLASS toward us.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

           It’s springtime in 1950s Manhattan: BUSINESS MEN, with their 
           POMADE HAIR and DAPPER SUITS, and WOMEN, clad in SWEATER SETS 
           and PEARLS, CHATTER as they hurry off to work. 

           Gene buys a copy of Il Progresso from a VENDOR when a 
           PUBLICITY PHOTO BLOWS into him. Gene looks up to see the same 
           flustered, much less polished woman - PATTY MCMANUS, 
           desperately gathering up her scattered PHOTOS and CLIPPINGS.
                                 GENE
                        Are you okay? Need some help?
                             (picks up a CLIPPING)
                        What’s this?

                                 PATTY
                        Nothing. Have a nice day.

           Patty SNATCHES it back, hurries off. Gene CHASES after her.

                                 GENE
                        Hey, hey, hey. Where’s the fire?

                                 PATTY
                        I’m late for an audition is all.

                                 GENE
                        Ahhh so you’re an actress?

                                 PATTY
                        Is that all right with you?

                                 GENE
                        Well sure! Here your beautiful face 
                        blows right into mine and then I 
                        look up to see you in a tizzy, hair 
                        wild like a banshee--  

                                 PATTY
                        -Is this your way of making a pass 
                        at me? Because if you are, you’re 
                        really, truly bad at it.

                                 GENE
                        What can I say? I’m ensorcelled. 
                        You’re smart, clearly driven. And 
                        we both know I’m a catch: from a 
                        good family, not terrible to look 
                        at, not one filling in this mouth 
                        if you can believe it.

                                 PATTY
                        And humble. Don’t forget humble.

                                 GENE
                        Plus, I run my own newspaper.

                                 PATTY
                        You run a newspaper?

                                 GENE
                        Mostly, kinda. I can tell you all 
                        about it over drinks.
                                 PATTY
                        No, thank you.

                                 GENE
                        Give me one reason why not.

                                 PATTY
                        I’ll give you three: you’re too 
                        young, I don’t drink, and I’ve had 
                        too many men distract me from what 
                        I’m supposed to be doing here.

           Patty approaches the revolving doors of a building

                                 GENE
                        Anni, amori, e bicchieri di vino, 
                        nun se contano mai.

                                 PATTY
                        What does that mean?

           She continues inside -- PUSHING the REVOLVING DOOR and he 
           takes her question as an opening to go around with her.

                                 GENE
                        It means meet me at The Stork Club 
                        tonight. 8 o’clock.

                                 PATTY
                        Sure. Just let me get my ball gown 
                        back from the cleaners.

                                 GENE
                        Hey my tux is there now! We can 
                        pick them up together!

           She steps out -- he stays, HOLDING the REVOLVING DOORS -- to 
           the great impatience of PEOPLE trying to come in.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not leaving till you say yes.

                                 PATTY
                        You don’t give up, do you?

                                 GENE
                        Never once in my entire life.

                                 PATTY
                        I--I don’t even know your name.

                        tonight, Patty McManus.

                        How did you know my--

           Gene WINKS at her - TAPS the file of CLIPPINGS before JOGGING 
           across the street. Patty considers him, then SHAKES her head, 
           takes a DEEP BREATH, and heads into her audition.

           INT. IL PROGRESSO - NEWSROOM - DAY

           Gene SWEEPS in as CATHY, an older by the book office manager, 
           hands him a file. They weave through the chaos.

                                 CATHY
                        You’re late. We need to approve the 
                        layout for the weekend edition, 
                        print a clarification about the

                        We said he died in 1887.

                        back to the house. You didn’t say 
                        it was Carnegie Hall.

           he brought his thuggish BODYGUARDS with him.

                        You talking about the paper? Nah. 
                        Papa already decided. Plus the will 
                        reading’s next week. It’ll be fine.

                        And use a preservativo with that 
                        one. She’s fertile. I can tell.

                        I should go.

                                 GENE
                        Nah. My brother’s just drunk. We’re 
                        gonna step outside for a minute.

           Gene GRABS his arm. 

                                 FORTUNATO
                        You think I’m leaving a shtate in 
                        the house unsupervised? Forget it. 

           Fortunato PUSHES him off. Catherine sees what’s happening -- 
           steps in to settle this.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What is this? What is this??? I 
                        will not have a scene at your

                        Patty McManus. I’m a friend of 
                        Gene’s. I’m really very sorry for 
                        your loss, Mrs. Pope.

                                 CATHERINE
                        That’s kind, but this is strictly a 
                        family affair. You understand.
                                 PATTY
                        Oh, of course, I--

                                 GENE
                        -Ma, come on. I need her here--

                        -Non e italiano, Generoso.

           That’s the end of that.

           EXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - EVENING

           Patty hurries into a cab as Gene RACES after her. He KNOCKS 
           on the window. Reluctantly, Patty ROLLS it down.

                                 PATTY
                        Why did you bring me here? If 
                        that’s what your mother is like why 
                        did you bother?

                                 GENE
                        She never behaved like that before.  
                        I’m sorry. I just wanted to spend 
                        time with you. Funeral be damned.

                                 PATTY
                        That’s not... the worst answer in 
                        the world.

                                 GENE

           PRESSES churn out papers for the morning edition. STEAM emits 
           from them as NIGHT WORKERS monitor the progress. Gene enters 
           with Patty. She takes a look around, impressed.

                                 GENE
                        I got it, boys. Have a good night.

           The NIGHT WORKERS exit. It’s just Gene and Patty now.

                                 PATTY
                        Do you bring all your girls here?

                                 GENE
                        Who says I get girls? I wasn’t 
                        always this charming, you know.
                                 PATTY
                        Who says you’re charming now?

                                 GENE
                        Yeah, well no one likes the 
                        smartest kid in school and it’s not 
                        like I could keep my mouth shut.

                                 PATTY
                        You? Never.

                                 GENE
                        But then I’d come here and Papa 
                        would show me the presses, teach me 
                        the integrity of journalism. It was 
                        better than being at home.

                                 PATTY
                        At least you have a family. Mine 
                        practically disowned me when I 
                        moved here to act.
                             (then)
                        What’s this?

           Gene WHIPS a sheet off an old machine -- like a magic trick.

                                 GENE
                        Manual printing press from 1886. 
                        Papa liked having it around. Said 
                        remembering where you came from 
                        keeps you humble. I like that.
                             (she DODGES a kiss)
                        What are you doin’ to me? I’m 
                        working here.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah you are. Using the memory of 
                        your dead father to get to first 
                        base? I don’t think so.

                                 GENE
                        First base? Who are you kidding? I 
                        hit home runs all day!

                                 PATTY
                             (DODGES another kiss)
                        What’d you say in Italian that day?

                                 GENE
                        Anni, amori, e bicchieri di vino, 
                        nun se contano mai.

                                 PATTY
                        Translation?
                                 GENE
                        Years, lovers, and glasses of wine, 
                        these are things that should never 
                        be counted.

                                 PATTY
                        You’re a real slick one, Gene Pope.

                                 GENE
                             (closing in on her)
                        I’ve been called worse.

                                 PATTY
                        Why are you even bothering with me? 

                                 GENE
                        Because you’re the only good person 
                        I have in my life.

           Finally, Gene KISSES her. It gets heated quickly. 

           INT. IL PROGRESSO - PRESS ROOM - LATER

           Gene STRETCHES out on the press, naked, watching Patty dress.

                                 PATTY
                        I can’t believe we did that. 
                        Someone could’ve come back in here.

                                 GENE
                        That’s not going to happen. I’m the 
                        boss. Mostly.

                                 PATTY
                        Will you put your clothes on?

                                 GENE
                        What? I’m not allowed to be naked 
                        in front of my future wife?
                             (that STOPS Patty)
                        I’ll make a good husband. I’ll take 
                        care of you.

                                 PATTY
                        You’re crazy.

                                 GENE
                        That’s true.

                                 PATTY
                        And I hardly know you.
                                 GENE
                        Also true.

                                 PATTY
                        You’re in an emotional state since 
                        your father just died.

                                 GENE
                        I am devastated. 

                                 PATTY
                        Plus your mother hates me.

                                 GENE
                        Hates me too. You’re in good 
                        company. I’m serious. Marry me. 
                        Everything else is just details!
                             (Patty smiles, relenting)
                        Is that a yes? Is that a yes?!?

           Gene COVERS her in kisses. Their affection is palpable. 

                                 PATTY
                        I must be crazy.

                                 GENE
                        Two psychopaths.

           INT. CARLO GOLDONI’S OFFICE - DAY

           Catherine, Fortunato, Anthony sit on one side of the table 
           with Gene and Frank on the other. CARLO GOLDONI sits at the 
           head of the table, going over the will.

                                 GOLDONI
                        The boys are to receive a cash 
                        payout of $15,000. All else goes to 
                        Catherine. The stocks, bonds, the 
                        apartment, everything.

                                 FORTUNATO
                        What about the paper?

                                 GOLDONI
                        Catherine, you own the paper, but 
                        there’s a board. You can’t make any 
                        changes without their approval. 

                                 FORTUNATO
                        This is ridiculous. The paper is 
                        losing money--
                                 GENE
                        -No it’s not. I’ve been workin’ 
                        there since I was--

                                 FORTUNATO
                        -getting your ass kicked on the 
                        playground? Yeah, I remember.

                                 GENE
                        This is what Papa wanted. Why this 
                        is even a discussion is beyond me. 

                                 FORTUNATO
                        Things change.

           Gene HANDS a FILE to Catherine and Goldoni.

                                 GENE
                        The Board agrees with Papa’s wishes 
                        to have me stay on as editor. If 
                        you want a job, I’ll train you--  

                                 CATHERINE
                        -Train him? You’d steal your 
                        brother’s birth rite like this??

                                 GENE
                        Steal??? I’m letting you sit back, 
                        relax, and collect checks. I’m good 
                        at this and I’ll make the paper 
                        even more successful. You’ll see.  

           Catherine gets up and leaves. Fortunato and Anthony follow. 
           Gene hangs his head in disgust. 

           EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

           Gene HURRIES, relieved to find Patty waiting for him. He 
           TAKES her hand. Patty BEAMS at him.

                                 GENE
                        You ready to do this?

           INT. CITY HALL - DAY

           Gene and Patty exchange RINGS -- KISS. They’re officially 
           married. Neither of them could be happier.
           INT. IL PROGRESSO - NEWSROOM - DAY

           Gene TWIRLS the OFFICE GIRLS as they congratulate him. Gene 
           TURNS -- comes face to face with Anthony. Uh oh.

           INT. IL PROGRESSO - GENE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Anthony tosses down a section of The New York Times. It’s a 
           wedding picture of Gene and Patty. Gene SHRUGS.  

                                 GENE
                        What can I say? I’m a man in love. 
                        How pissed is Ma?

                                 ANTHONY
                        You’re going to be a man without a 
                        family. She forbid all of this.

                                 GENE
                        Are you hearing yourself? I’m an 
                        adult and, by the way, so are you. 
                        You could’ve had my back at the 
                        will reading. I know you don’t want 
                        to work here.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I don’t, but you know how she is.  
                        She gets an idea in her head and 
                        that’s it. She thinks the paper is 
                        Fortunato’s birthright. And then 
                        you go and marry this girl--

                                 GENE
                        -Her name is Patty.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It was salt in the wound, Gene.  
                        Can’t you see that?

                                 GENE
                        All right, all right. You got any 
                        bright ideas in that head of yours?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Come to the house for Sunday 
                        dinner. Bring Patty. Play nice.

           The door BURSTS open and in walks Frank, all smiles.

                                 FRANK
                        Your father’s been dead less than a 
                        month and you’ve already got his 
                        office? I like it.
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                             (to Anthony)
                        Good to see you, Tony.

                                 ANTHONY
                        You too, Frank.
                             (to Gene)
                        I’ll see you Sunday.

           He heads out, closing the door. Frank hands him an ENVELOPE.

                                 FRANK
                        A little something for the wedding.

                                 GENE
                        You really don’t have to--

                                 FRANK
                        -Shut up and take it. Send best 
                        wishes to Miss What’s her name.

                                 GENE
                        Mrs. Generoso Pope.

                                 FRANK
                        Mrs. Generoso Pope, Jr. Don’t let 
                        you mother hear you saying that.

                                 GENE
                        Good point. What can I do for you?

                                 FRANK
                        Saw you got appointed to the New 
                        York Board of Education. A lot of 
                        congratulations coming your way.
                             (Gene NODS)
                        A friend is looking to fill one of 
                        those seats coming up. A good word 
                        from you would go a long way.

           Gene understands the gravity of this -- keeps SMILING.

                                 GENE
                        Consider it done.

           He CLEARS his throat -- a little uneasy.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MOVING BOXES line the walls. PAINTINGS aren’t hung. It’s 
           nice, but not lavish. Gene and Patty have sex.

                                 PATTY
                        You remembered the wine?
                                 GENE
                        I got the wine.

                                 PATTY
                        What about the flowers? You said

                        You’re right, I’m sorry.
                             (Gene FUCKS her, then:)
                        It’s just the last time I was in  
                        her home, she threw me out of it.

                        I’m allowed to be nervous. This is 
                        important.

                                 GENE

                        I’M NOT--I have the flowers, I have 
                        the wine. We’re gonna go, I’ll kiss 
                        the ring and it’ll be fine. Okay?

                                 PATTY
                        That’s all I needed to hear.

           Patty RESUMES SEX, but Gene STOPS her - erection gone. 

                                 GENE
                        Fuck. We better get ready anyway.

           He DISAPPEARS into the bathroom. Patty pulls a PILL BOTTLE 
           out of the NIGHT STAND, POPS one, and SWALLOWS it down.

           INT. POPE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mid-dinner: Catherine, Fortunato, Anthony, Gene, and Patty 
           eat in silence. Patty nervously glances at Catherine.

                                 PATTY
                        Dinner is wonderful, Mrs. Pope.
                                 CATHERINE
                        My cook spent all day preparing it.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh. Well, your cook is wonderful.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Why, thank you, Mrs. Pope.

           Patty shifts, uncomfortably. The doorbell RINGS. A MAID 
           enters with a WRAPPED PARCEL. She sets it on the buffet and 
           hurries out. More silence.

                                 GENE
                        Okay Ma, can we get to it already? 
                        I’m sorry. I’m in love.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I spoke to Father Castiglia. He 
                        said an annulment is possible.

                                 GENE
                        No, Ma. Patty isn’t going anywhere.  
                        We’re married. End of story.

                                 CATHERINE
                        This is how you speak to me? Your 
                        father passes and you think you can 
                        sit at my table, make demands, 
                        embarrass me in front of lawyers--

                        -I am not finished. You are my son.  
                        This is your family and you will do 
                        as you are told.

                        Which means?

                        You’ll have this marriage annulled--

                        -Ma!
                                 CATHERINE
                        You will do this, Generoso.

                        That’s it. We’re outta here.

           Gene THROWS down his napkin and stands. Patty follows suit.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I got you a wedding gift. It’s the 
                        morning edition.

           That stops Gene. Seriously? Catherine goes to the WRAPPED 
           PARCEL on the buffet. She UNWRAPS it -- HANDS out COPIES.

                                 GENE
                        The morning edition doesn’t come 
                        out for another few hours.

           Gene’s in his underwear as Patty CLEANS his wounds.

                                 PATTY
                        I’m sorry. This is all my fault.

                                 GENE
                        You’re damn right it is. And don’t 
                        think I’m gonna forget it.

                             (mocking)
                        Oh, really?

                                 GENE
                        Yes, really. I’m out of a job and a 
                        family all because I can’t keep my 
                        prick in my pants. Why do you have

                        I’ll work on that.

                                 GENE
                        Good. And ship Ma back to the old 
                        country while you’re at it, will 
                        ya?

           All joking aside, Patty’s clearly hurt by this.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, look at me.
                             (she won’t)
                        Look at me, Patty.
                             (finally, she does)

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        You sure you still want me now? 
                        Even though I got nothin’?

                                 PATTY
                        You wanted me when I had nothing.

           That melts Gene’s heart. He takes a deep breath, allowing his 
           silver-lining self to return again.

                                 GENE
                        It’s not the end of the world. I’ll 
                        find work or you’ll just have to 
                        become a big huge movie star. 

                                 PATTY
                        Not sure that’ll be happening any 
                        time soon. I’m pregnant.

                        See? You aren’t out of a family 
                        after all.

           This hits Gene like a ton of bricks. He PULLS her to him, 
           trying to hide the fear in his eyes.

                                 GENE
                        Don’t you worry. Not one bit. I’m 
                        gonna fix this. You’ll see.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Gene PASSES a newsstand selling The Times with that DAMNING 
           HEADLINE. Gene moves on to a rundown area of town. He STOPS 
           outside of a seedy restaurant. Deep breath. He goes inside.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dark. Dirty. Nothing legal happens here. 

           It’s empty save for Frank playing CARDS, SIPPING wine. His 
           BODYGUARDS are at a nearby table. Sweating, Gene APPROACHES.

                                 GENE
                        I want to apologize. From the 
                        family. I should’ve listened to 
                        you. All this shit, it’s about me. 
                        Not you.

           He goes to sit down. The BODYGUARDS stand -- Frank WAVES THEM 
           OFF, still focusing on the cards as Gene sits.
                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t mean disrespect.
                             (no response)
                        I don’t want nothing to happen to 
                        them.

           Frank SNEERS. He FLIPS over the table -- sending the cards 
           FLYING. Frank SMASHES a BEER BOTTLE and SHOVES Gene down onto 
           a tabletop -- the JAGGED BOTTLE at his throat.

                                 FRANK
                        You come in here, talking about 
                        respect? Is that what you’re doing?

                        None of your fucking business is 
                        what’s wrong.

                        I... I owe you. I can help. 

                                 FRANK
                        And how the fuck are you gonna do 
                        that?

                                 GENE
                        I dunno. But we’re family, Frank. 
                        We’re family.

           Frank playfully SLAPS Gene’s face -- TOSSING the bottle over 
           his shoulder. It SMASHES into a LIGHT BULB above the bar. 
           Gene sits up, righting himself as Frank picks up his cards.

                        wouldn’t ask if there was any 
                        other... I’m only in this position 
                        because you asked for my help. Now 
                        I know I should’ve listened to you, 
                        but I’m trying to fix this. Patty’s 
                        pregnant and I need--

                                 FRANK
                        -I’ll loan you the money. But it 
                        ain’t free. 
                             (Gene knows)
                        Go on. Buy your paper. I’m sure 
                        you’ll make it a huge success.

           Gene NODS -- gets the hell out of there.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Gene EXITS the restaurant -- EXHALES and WIPES the SWEAT from 
           his face. He doesn’t get a few steps when his STOMACH TURNS. 
           Gene BOLTS into the nearest bar possible.

           INT. BAR - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Gene VOMITS his guts out. He takes a couple of breaths to 
           steady himself -- WIPES his mouth and goes into the...

           BAR - CONTINUOUS
           If the restaurant was seedy, this is downright filthy. A RED 
           LIGHT SHINES from the ceiling. Gene SADDLES up to the bar.

                                 GENE
                        Can I get a bourbon?

           The BARTENDER POURS the drink -- Gene DOWNS it. 

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Again please.

           The bartender OBLIGES. Gene DOWNS it again, finally seeming 
           to catch his breath -- SIGNALS for another.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        You keep that up, you’re gonna make 
                        some bad decisions...

           Gene TURNS to KENNY CROSS, 31, a stylish, flirty man who 
           doesn’t let anyone run him, sitting near him at the bar.

                                 KENNY
                        ...unless that’s what you’re after.

                                 GENE
                        It’s been a rough few days. You 
                        ever feel like your whole world’s 
                        about to come apart and no matter 
                        what you do, you won’t be able to 
                        fix it?

                                 KENNY
                        Every minute of my fucking life.

                                 GENE
                        I’m starting a new job and if I 
                        screw it up, I’m pretty sure I’ll 
                        end up dead.

           That gets Kenny’s attention. He PASSES his drink to Gene.

                                 KENNY
                        Quite the femme fatale are you. 
                        Maybe retirement’s in order.

                                 GENE
                        I’ve got too many responsibilities 
                        for that.

                                 KENNY
                        What a pity. You know, they got a 
                        room in the back. You can lay down, 
                        relax. I bet I can make you forget 
                        about all those responsibilities.
                                 GENE
                        Wait. What?

                                 KENNY
                        Sometimes people like to watch, but 
                        it’s pretty private.

                                 GENE
                        I think you got the wrong idea.

                                 KENNY
                             (PUSHES a $20 to him)
                        Does that change things?

                                 GENE
                        No, it doesn’t. I’m married.

                                 KENNY
                        Bad boy. Don’t worry, I can pop you 
                        off nice and good in under 20 and 
                        get you home in time for Lucy.

                                 GENE
                        You don’t give up, do you?

                                 KENNY
                        Never once in my entire life.

           That sounds vaguely familiar to Gene.

                                 GENE
                        Not for nothin’, but if you keep 
                        talkin’ like that, someone’s gonna 
                        punch you in the mouth.

                                 KENNY
                             (LAUGHS)
                        Not here. Unless some idiot wanders 
                        in off the street and doesn’t 
                        realize where he is.

           Gene looks around. All FIT MEN in TIGHT SHIRTS. Realizing...

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. We were raided last 
                        night. The police never come here 
                        two nights in a row.

                                 GENE
                        That’s very comforting. Thanks for 
                        listening. And the drink.

           He DOWNS his drink. Kenny WATCHES as Gene goes.
           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patty’s getting ready for bed. She POPS a PILL as the FRONT 
           DOOR SHUTS. She quickly HIDES the PILL BOTTLE. Gene comes in.

                                 PATTY
                        How’d it go?

                        I got the loan. See? I told you 
                        everything would be okay. 

                                 PATTY
                        You sure did.

                                 GENE
                        How’s the little one doing?

                                 PATTY
                        Excited to meet his Papa. Or her 
                        Papa. Haven’t decided which.

                        Is that camera for personal or 
                        professional use?

                                 KENNY
                        Why? Do you have something in mind?

                                 GENE
                        No, but before you make another 
                        pass at me, there’s something I 
                        should probably tell you.

           DING! They step out onto the fifth floor, right in front of a 
           door with a sign that reads: The New York Enquirer.

                                 KENNY
                        I already know you’re married. How 
                        much worse can it get?

                                 GENE
                        Much worse. I work here.

                                 KENNY
                        No, you don’t. I work here.

                                 GENE
                        I told you I was starting a new 
                        job. It’s my first day.

                                 KENNY
                        That could theoretically be 
                        possible, except that we’ve been on 
                        a hiring freeze--

                        -Because circulation was down?

                        Uhh, yeah. How did you--

                        -Which meant that advertisers

                        So nervous, in fact, that she sold 
                        your paper in the darkness of night 
                        and skipped town without so much as

                             (Gene ROLLS his eyes)
                        I came here from Ohio because 
                        people weren’t that nice to me 
                        there. I wanted to sing and dance 
                        but it turns out everyone wants to 
                        do that here. But then I found this 
                        job, built a life, and I’d like to 
                        keep it that way.

                        So I think it would be unfair of 
                        you to hold my propositioning you 
                        for sex against me.

           A little later, the entire staff has gathered. It’s pretty 
           packed in here. Gene enters. Everyone immediately quiets. 

                                 GENE
                        Good morning. In case you haven’t 
                        heard, Mrs. Griffin has sold the 
                        Enquirer. I’m Gene Pope, Jr. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENE (CONT'D)
                        I ran Il Progresso for the past 
                        three years and am excited to be 
                        here.
                             (a beat)
                        Any questions?

           DONNA LEE, 36, talks like she’s chewing her face, speaks up.

                                 DONNA
                        How many of us is getting laid off?

                                 GENE
                        Nobody. I will be evaluating the 
                        staff, but right now my focus is 
                        righting the ship.

           NORMAN DUPREE, 48, fat, balding, and pissed, speaks up.

                                 NORMAN
                        And how are you going to do that?

                                 GENE
                        I’m not going to write a bunch of 
                        key words on the blackboard like 
                        some goddamned asshole. I have two 
                        responsibilities: to create a good 
                        product and then sell the shit out 
                        of it. Changes will be small 
                        because I like that you report on 
                        local politics and social issues. 
                        That’s the heart and soul of this 
                        place and I want to keep that 
                        intact. We may be the little guy, 
                        but The New York Enquirer is going 
                        to be known for two things and two 
                        things only: quality and 
                        journalistic integrity. 
                             (the Staff CLAPS)
                        You’ll see. It’s gonna be great!!!

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Patty (now 9 months pregnant) COOKS breakfast while Gene 
           CIRCLES stories in The New York Times. He gets into the deep, 
           back pages with the CRIME, ACCIDENTS, and BURGLARIES. He 
           CIRCLES them FASTER and FASTER as he goes.

                                 GENE
                        Paper of record. Bullshit.

                                 PATTY
                        I don’t know why you bother reading 
                        it. It only makes you angry.
                                 GENE
                        I have to. If they cover something, 
                        we gotta cover it too or else we 
                        look like their ugly stepsister.

           Patty turns on the sink. The faucet EXPLODES -- SHOOTING 
           WATER everywhere. Gene gets under the sink to turn it off.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you called the super. 

                                 PATTY
                        I did. They sent someone over last 
                        week and said nothing was wrong.

                                 GENE
                        The understatement of the century.

           The water STOPS. Gene stands. He’s SOAKED from head to toe.

                                 PATTY
                        My hero.

                                 GENE
                        Call the super again, will ya?

           They KISS. Patty TOSSES a TOWEL at him as he goes back to his 
           paper, picking up where he left off.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t even name their sources 
                        properly. Listen to this! Union 
                        bosses say a strike is imminent. 
                        Who the hell are these union 
                        bosses? I dunno. Could be my Aunt 
                        Ester. And here...   
                             (he BLANCHES)
                        Oh fuck me.

                                 PATTY
                        What is it?

                                 GENE
                        The strike. It’s the goddamned 
                        newspaper delivery men.

           He GRABS his coat -- HURRIES out. Patty wipes SWEAT from her 
           face. She sits down, exhausted.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING

           A MOB FLOODS the street with STRIKE signs. They CHANT as Gene 
           SQUEEZES his way through, HURRYING inside his office.
           INT. THE NEW YORK ENQUIRER - MORNING 

           Gene -- still wet -- stalks through the newsroom. He’s 
           quickly joined by Kenny, who’s more than a little panicked.  

                                 KENNY
                        What the hell happened to you? 

                                 GENE
                        Home repairs. 

                                 KENNY
                        Home repairs have you looking like 
                        the creature from the black lagoon?

                                 GENE
                        Only if I get to drown the person 
                        closest to me. How did we not know 
                        about this?

                                 KENNY
                        Only the top papers in the city 
                        were invited to the negotiations.

                                 GENE
                        And all they want is two more bucks 
                        a week? My livelihood is being 
                        threatened over two bucks?

                                 KENNY
                        People need to pay their bills and 
                        you’re not exactly helping out in 
                        that department. 

                                 GENE
                        Kenny--

                                 KENNY
                        -You came in here with your big 
                        speeches and it’s been six months 
                        and nothing has changed.

                                 GENE
                        I’m still evaluating.

                                 KENNY
                        Oh really? Are you still evaluating 
                        whether you want to pay your staff?  

                                 GENE
                        Shit Kenny. You try getting 
                        disowned and sink your life savings 
                        into a fledgeling enterprise.
                                 KENNY
                        I get it, but there are only so 
                        many bounced checks you can write 
                        before you start bleeding staff. 
                        Then it won’t matter who is or 
                        isn’t striking because you’re not 
                        going to have a paper to put out.

                                 GENE
                        I’ll take care of it. And you can 
                        be nicer to me.

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, this is me being nice.

                                 GENE
                             (to SECRETARY)
                        Can you get Frank Costello for me? 
                        His number’s in the Rolodex.

                                 KENNY
                        You know Frank Costello? Like the 
                        Frank Costello?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Gene, line one.

                                 GENE
                        You got Frank?

                                 SECRETARY
                        No. It’s the police.

           INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           Gene talks with an OFFICER while Patty sits nearby, nervous.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        We found her in the park. She was 
                        lost and didn’t know her name or 
                        where she lived. We found these in 
                        her purse when we asked for her 
                        identification. Is there any 
                        history of mental illness? 

           The OFFICER hands over a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Gene examines it. 
           Hiding his embarrassment, he STUFFS them in his pocket.

                                 GENE
                        No. And fuck you very much.

           He goes to Patty and gets her the hell out of there.
           INT. CAB - AFTERNOON

           Patty rests against the window, falling asleep.

                                 GENE
                        You scared the shit out of me. What 
                        the hell is going on?

                                 PATTY
                        I just got confused, that’s all.

                                 GENE
                        Confused? How do you get confused 
                        about where you live?

                                 PATTY
                        Gene, I’m tired...

                                 GENE
                             (re: PILL BOTTLE)
                        And what the hell are these?

                                 PATTY
                        They’re for my nerves. You know me.

           They pull to a STOP. Patty gets out. Gene follows, not even 
           close to being done with this conversation.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Patty enters, lays down on the sofa. Gene’s right behind her.

                                 GENE
                        Are they safe for the baby?

                                 PATTY
                        They’re from a doctor.

                                 GENE
                        I didn’t ask if they were from a 
                        doctor, I asked if they were safe.

                                 PATTY
                        I wouldn’t hurt our baby, Gene.

                                 GENE
                        Yeah, but now you’re wandering the 
                        streets acting like a crazy person 
                        and I wanna know what’s going on.

                                 PATTY
                        It’s fine. Really. Can we talk 
                        about this later? I’m tired.
                                 GENE
                        You’re carrying our child. You have 
                        to be more careful. You’re the most 
                        important thing in the world to me.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah. Me and the paper.

                                 GENE
                        What is that supposed to mean?
                             (no response)
                        I’m heading out for a bit, but I 
                        won’t be long. Do you want to grab 
                        a late dinner?

           But she’s already asleep.

           EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           Frank and Gene walk along the Hudson, deep in conversation. 
           The BODYGUARDS trail behind them.

                                 GENE
                        Circulation isn’t budging and with 
                        the strike, I can’t pay the rent, 
                        the staff. I’m about to have a baby 
                        and Patty isn’t herself. It’s like 
                        I had both hands tied behind my 
                        back before I even got started.

                                 FRANK
                        How much more do you need?

                                 GENE
                        Ten grand. If we stay afloat while 
                        the other papers are dark, we can 
                        gain a subscriber base. Then I’ll 
                        be able to pay you back.

                                 FRANK
                        How do you suggest getting striking 
                        drivers to deliver your paper?

                                 GENE
                        Do I gotta say it?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, Gene. You gotta say it.

           Fuck.

                                 GENE
                        Take care of it. Just not too bad.
                                 FRANK
                        There’s no such thing as not too 
                        bad. The bad is what gets it done. 
                        I’m leaving town for awhile, so 
                        you’re going to be on your own.

                                 GENE
                        What’s going on, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        Immigration wants to deport me back 
                        to Sicily.

                                 GENE
                        I’m sorry. Anything I can do?

                                 FRANK
                        My guy will contact you. Tell him 
                        what you need. It’ll get done. I’ll 
                        get you the rest next week.

           Frank hands over an ENVELOPE OF CASH -- heads off. Relieved, 
           Gene counts the cash as Judy Garland’s GET HAPPY plays...

           Gene SWEEPS through the office, PAYROLL CHECKS in hand. He’s 
           in his own tap-dance, musical comedy as he passes them out.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - SAME

           A TRUCKER checks tire pressure. A THUG approaches him -- a 
           CROWBAR lowers from his sleeve.

                                 THUG
                        William Scott?

                        Do we have Donna Lee in the house?

           The Thug BEATS William -- BASHING him in the stomach, the

                        lucky son of a bitch?!?

           Gene GRABS Kenny by the LAPELS, PULLING him close.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - SAME

           The Thug pulls William close to him by his LAPELS.

                        -And make your dreams come true.

           He gives him a SLOPPY KISS. The STAFF SPRAYS CHAMPAGNE.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Patty SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she gives birth. Gene CHEERS 
           her on. A DOCTOR KNEELS between Patty’s legs.

                                 PATTY
                        Get it out of me!

                                 DOCTOR
                        1, 2, 3, push!!!

           Patty PUSHES HARD. We hear CRYING. The DOCTOR hands the BABY 
           to Gene. Proud, he SHOWS Patty their baby.

                                 GENE
                        Here he is. Our boy.

                                 PATTY
                        I can’t right now... I’m so tried.

           Patty TURNS away. Gene stands there, stunned.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Gene holds his SCREAMING son, trying to comfort him. The 
           phone RINGS. Gene FUMBLES to answer it.

                                 GENE
                        Yeah?

           Kenny WINCES at the baby’s SCREAMING is right in his ear.

                                 KENNY
                        That’s one happy newborn.

                                 GENE
                        What can I do for you, Kenny?

                                 KENNY
                        We need you to approve the layout.

                                 GENE
                        Sorry, Patty’s not feeling well.  
                        Messenger it over. I’ll make notes 
                        and send it back.

                                 KENNY
                        Is this how it’s going to be now?
                                 GENE
                        What do you want from me, Kenny?

                                 KENNY
                        We just got ourselves on solid 
                        ground. We need you here.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It’s dark and quiet in here. Gene DRAGS his tired ass into 
           bed next to Patty.

                                 GENE
                        I thought we were going to do this 
                        together. I can’t look after him 
                        and run the paper, Patty. I can’t.

                                 PATTY
                        I don’t want to be like this, but 
                        all he does is cry and I don’t know 
                        what to do.
                             (a beat)
                        I don’t think I like him.

                                 GENE
                        Sometimes I don’t like him either.

                                 PATTY
                        You don’t???

                                 GENE
                        Of course not. He pees and poops 
                        and throws up -- that is, when he’s 
                        not screaming at the top of his 
                        lungs. But he’s our son. And our 
                        son needs to get baptized. What if 
                        we had a little party? Everyone’s 
                        dying to meet him.  

                                 PATTY
                        I don’t think I’m up for that.

                                 GENE
                        I’ll take care of everything. All 
                        you gotta do is show up.

                                 PATTY
                        I’ll try. Can I ask you something? 
                             (Gene NODS)
                        What did you name him?

           That breaks Gene’s heart.

                        Generoso Pope, the third.

           She NODS, goes back to sleep. Gene’s at a loss for words.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tons of GUESTS have gathered -- drinking, laughing, and 
           enjoying food. Gene answers the door to find Kenny.

                                 GENE
                        Hey, hey! Get in here already!

                                 KENNY
                        Thanks for the invite.

                                 GENE
                        Funny how ya missed the actual 
                        ceremony.

                                 KENNY
                        I’m not setting foot in an actual 
                        church. Now where’s the screamer?

           Patty, barely paying attention to the BABY in her arms, 
           PASSES her son to Gene, FANNING herself as if she’s relieved 
           to be rid of it. Gene PRESENTS his son to Kenny.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Ooooo, I want one. Not really, but 
                        if I did, I’d steal yours.
                             (re: Patty)
                        What’s going on with Patty?

                                 GENE
                        Nothing. She’s fine.

                                 KENNY
                        She looks like she’s seen a ghost. 
                        Or maybe an alien. You ever heard 
                        of Grooms Lake at Area 51?

                                 GENE
                        No. And what is it with you and all 
                        this nerd shit? 

                                 KENNY
                        It’s not nerd shit.

                                 GENE
                        Fine. Geek shit.
                                 KENNY
                        It’s not when you’re talking about 
                        a massive government conspiracy to 
                        hide the truth about what’s really 
                        out there. Irregardless, I’m 
                        telling you, Patty looks sick.

                                 GENE
                        Give my wife a break. The woman 
                        just gave birth. Let’s get you some 
                        of my famous baked ziti before I 
                        punch your lights out.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Oh god! Gene! The faucet!

           Gene hands the baby back to a reluctant Patty. He and Kenny 
           hurry off. Patty GULPS some water, FANNING herself.

           KITCHEN - SAME

           Water SPRAYS everywhere. Gene’s under the sink again while 
           Kenny tries to stop the EXPLOSION of WATER with a rag.  

                                 GENE
                        I got it.

                                 KENNY
                             (gets SPRAYED in the face)
                        Doesn’t feel like it.

           One more TWIST and the water dies. Gene gets up. Both he and 
           Kenny are soaked. He LAUGHS -- TOSSES a TOWEL at Kenny.

                                 GENE
                        Two creatures from the black

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The men come in, drying off with their towels.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Patty, I thought you said you 
                        called the super...

           But he notices Patty’s nowhere to be found. Neither is the 
           baby. He sees some movement out on the balcony. Gene PUSHES 
           his way past GUESTS wanting to congratulate him. 

           Wind PLAYS havoc with the CHIFFON CURTAINS, further OBSCURING 
           Gene’s view. He WHIPS them away and goes out on the...

           BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
           And finds Patty STEPPING OVER the railing holding the BABY!!!

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        NO!!!

           Gene RACES over, trying to get the baby away from her.   

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Give him to me! Give him!
                             (she doesn’t respond)
                        NOW, Patty! Give me my son!!!

           Patty HANDS the BABY over. Gene’s YELLING has brought Kenny 
           and other GUESTS out on the balcony. Gene HANDS the BABY to 
           Kenny -- turning his attention back to Patty.  

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to help you back over, 
                        okay? Careful. Be very careful.

           Gene HOLDS her while Patty climbs back over, COLLAPSING into 
           his arms. They SINK to the ground -- adrenaline pumping.

                                 PATTY
                        I was so hot, so hot, the baby and 
                        I were so hot...

           Still wet from the sink, Gene LOOKS UP at all the WORRIED 
           FACES staring at him. Fuck.

           INT. GENE’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Kenny drives. He GLANCES in the rearview mirror -- sees Gene 
           comforting a sleeping Patty in the back.

           EXT. EDGEWOOD STATE HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON 

           Gene HELPS Patty into the hospital. Once they’re out of 
           sight, Kenny pulls The New York Times from the backseat. 

           The headline reads: Pope’s Wife Tries to Leap to Her Death -- 
           Baby in Arms

           INT. EDGEWOOD STATE HOSPITAL - OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Gene signs some papers, passing them back to DR. CLIFTON, 
           40s, a man with kind eyes.

                                 GENE
                        She was taking these pills. She 
                        said they were safe...
                                 CLIFTON
                        Unfortunately, there are quack 
                        doctors who’ve lost their licenses 
                        and will do anything for money. 
                        Those pills weren’t safe, or legal. 
                        Your wife is very ill. 

                                 GENE
                        How long will she have to stay?

                                 CLIFTON
                        That’s up to her. Costs will be 
                        considerable, but I’ll do 
                        everything I can to help Patty.

           INT. EDGEWOOD STATE HOSPITAL - HALL - AFTERNOON

           Gene finds Patty sitting in the hall, waiting. He KNEELS down 
           to KISS her goodbye.

                                 GENE
                        I have to go, but you’re going to 
                        stay here for awhile. If you need 
                        anything, you can call me. You know 
                        the numbers, right? The house and 
                        the office?
                             (she nods)
                        I love you. You’re going to get so 
                        much better. I promise.
                             (she nods again)
                        You used to fight with me. You used 
                        to fight with me all the time.  

                                 PATTY
                        I’m tired.

           Gene walks away.

           TITLE CARD:

                                         Step #3:
                                     The First Draft

           We LOOK DOWN at the top of a BALD HUMAN HEAD. A SCALPEL CUTS 
           away the top of the skull REVEALING a THROBBING BRAIN. The 
           SCALPEL then CUTS into the brain, SPILLING BLOOD.

           INT. GENE’S CAR - EVENING

           Kenny drives as Gene studies the newspaper article. Annoyed, 
           he TOSSES it in the back as they SLOW to a stop. Gene CRANES 
           his neck to get a better look as to what’s going on.
                                 KENNY
                        You see anything?

                                 GENE
                        An accident, maybe.

           Gene and Kenny INCH along far enough to see a MASSIVE TWO-CAR 
           WRECK on the side of the road. Everyone STOPS and STARES.

                                 KENNY
                        Jesus. Bunch of looky-loos.

           Gene looks back and forth between the TWISTED METAL and 
           MANGLED BODIES and the MOTORISTS unable to look away.

                                 GENE
                        Do you have your camera?

                                 KENNY
                        I always have my camera.

                                 GENE
                        Pull the car over.

                                 KENNY
                        What?

                                 GENE
                        You heard me. Pull over.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kenny SWERVES, PARKS. Gene RACES over to the accident. Kenny 
           follows, SNAPPING pictures. FLASH!!!

                                 GENE
                        Get closer.

                                 KENNY
                        Any closer and we won’t be able to 
                        see the cars. It’ll just look like 
                        a bunch of blood and guts.

                                 GENE
                        Just do it.

           Kenny OBLIGES, continues to SNAP pictures. FLASH FLASH!!!

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Get in there--

                                 KENNY
                        -But--
                                 GENE
                        Get the fuck in there!

           Gene pushes Kenny to where he’s practically inside the car 
           with the VICTIMS. It’s dark and bloody -- BONES stick out in 
           VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. FLASH FLASH FLASH!!!

           RED and BLUE LIGHTS of a police cruiser FLASH over them. Gene 
           and Kenny HAUL ASS back to their car and SPEED AWAY.

           INT. GENE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Gene PULLS OVER in front of Kenny’s apartment.

                                 KENNY
                        What was all that about back there?

                                 GENE
                        I don’t know. Maybe we’ll run a 
                        special crime section or something. 
                             (a beat)
                        Thanks for today.  

                                 KENNY
                        If you need me, I’m up late. And 
                        not like that. I’m over you. Unless 
                        you’re switching teams now that 
                        your wife is locked up in a mental 
                        institution, cause then--

                                 GENE
                        -Get out of my car.

           Kenny OBEYS. Gene DRIVES off.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Gene ARRIVES home to find SALLY, 28, a sweet, mousey thing, 
           gently ROCKING his son. She hands the baby over.

                                 GENE
                        Sorry I’m late.

                                 SALLY
                        It’s fine. I lost track of time 
                        looking at this little one.

                                 GENE
                        Can we make this a full time thing? 
                        I need someone and he likes you.
                                 SALLY
                        Uhhh, maybe. I’ll have to check 
                        with the agency.

                                 GENE
                        Fuck the agency. I’ll pay you a 
                        hundred dollars a week.

                                 SALLY
                        A hundred??

                                 GENE
                        You play hardball, huh? Fine. Two 
                        hundred.

                                 SALLY
                        I’ll... I’ll start Monday.

           Sally heads out. Gene RUBS his son’s back, soothing him.

                                 GENE
                        Looks like it’s just you and me.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gene ROLLS around in bed, tormented by a dream.

           FLASH FLASH FLASH!

           Two cars SMASH into each other in a head-on collision.

           A MOTHER DROWNS her baby in a bathtub.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Gene BOLTS up, COVERED in SWEAT. He THROWS off the covers.    

           INT. KENNY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           There’s a POUNDING at the door. Kenny, WRAPPED in a SHEET, 
           answers. Gene STORMS right in -- BABY in his arms.
                                 GENE
                        You said you stay up late. I have 
                        an idea I need to talk through.

                                 KENNY
                        So you brought your son?

                                 GENE
                        Nanny doesn’t start till Monday.

           Kenny gets back into bed with a SHIRTLESS hunk, MARCO. They 
           both sit up, listening to Gene as he rants.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        I tried to sleep, but I kept having 
                        this dream about people doing these 
                        terrible, violent things. And then 
                        I thought about the car accident 
                        and how everyone couldn’t look 
                        away. There’s a never-ending public 
                        thirst for tragedy.

                                 KENNY
                        And you have evidence of this?

                                 GENE
                        You mean besides my being front 
                        page news when my family disowned 
                        me and my wife tried to jump off 
                        the balcony with our child?
                             (the baby cries)
                        It’s okay, buddy. Papa’s here.

                                 MARCO
                        Man, that sounds rough.

                                 KENNY
                        This is not the group participation 
                        portion of the evening.

                                 GENE
                        No, he’s right. He’s absolutely 
                        right. Hi, I’m Gene Pope Jr. Nice 
                        to meet you.
                             (back to Kenny)
                        I think we need to put the car 
                        wreck on the front page.

                                 KENNY
                        The front--Gene, we can’t.

                                 GENE
                        Why not?
                                 KENNY
                        Because there was tons of blood, 
                        broken bones sticking out every 
                        which way, smashed skulls--

                                 GENE
                             (snaps fingers)
                        -Exactly!!!

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, it’s late. You’re not 
                        thinking clearly. It’s too graphic.  

                                 GENE
                        You want to talk about graphic? I 
                        could have you two Judys arrested 
                        for what’s going on in here.

                                 MARCO
                        That’s my cue.

           Marco stands to leave. Gene waves him off.

                                 GENE
                        Sit down. Your ass is safe.  
                             (back to Kenny)
                        I think we need to rebrand.

                                 KENNY
                        As what?

                                 GENE
                        People need to know how the world 
                        works. Not this Candyland, Leave It 
                        To Beaver bullshit the powers that 
                        be shove down our throats. We’re 
                        going to give the people the truth.  

                                 KENNY
                        Exactly what kind of truth are you 
                        talking about?

                                 GENE
                        The kind that real Americans face 
                        every day. I’m talking about rapes!  
                        Murders! Teenage mothers who twist 
                        off their baby’s heads!!!

                                 MARCO
                        That’s my cue again.

           Marco SCRAMBLES away as Gene sits on the bed with the baby. 
           Kenny’s in complete and utter shock.
                                 KENNY
                        Can you hand him to me?

                                 GENE
                        Why?

                                 KENNY
                        I’d feel more comfortable having a 
                        conversation about dead babies if 
                        you weren’t holding a live one.

                                 GENE
                        It won’t just be dead babies. We’ll 
                        do train accidents and suicides 
                        too. You wanna toss grandma down 
                        the stairs for your inheritance? 
                        We’ll give you an exclusive.

                                 KENNY
                        No, no, no, no--

                                 GENE
                        -Why not? It’s news.

                                 KENNY
                        It’s not news. It’s... gore!

                                 GENE
                        We’d be telling the truth. Isn’t 
                        that why we got into this business?

                                 KENNY
                        Yeah, but--

                                 GENE
                        -Who else is bringing this kind of 
                        news to the public? We can be 
                        leaders of a movement!!!

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, we’ll lose all respect and 
                        credibility--

                                 GENE
                        -At first, maybe--

                                 KENNY
                        -We report on local issues, world 
                        affairs. If we do this, we will--

                                 GENE
                        -Fold!

           That came out harder than Gene intended.
                                 KENNY
                        I thought we were doing better. We 
                        got paid.

                                 GENE
                        It was a band-aid. I need to make a

                        Maybe it could be a warning of 
                        sorts. Like the accident could be 
                        us cautioning the public against 
                        driving without seat belts.

                        Better! Not only did you invoke 
                        tragedy, but you also alerted us to 
                        an important issue regarding the 
                        training of New York City bus 
                        drivers. But we need to work on 
                        that headline. We need something a 
                        little bit... splashier. Norman,

           Gene CLAPS his hands, excited. He ERASES “man” and REPLACES 
           it with “retired vet.”

                                 GENE
                        Yes! Do you know what you did? You 
                        added context for the victim! Now 
                        that we know he’s a retired vet, 
                        you know what we do? We care. But 
                        we can do better! Donna, juice up

                        by the bus was he, Donna?
                             (no response)

                        Yes! He was! Yes!

           Gene ERASES “hit” and REPLACES it with “pulverized.” The 
           STAFF is starting to get into this.

                        what’s wrong with this headline?

           Kenny LOOKS at all the EXPECTANT FACES. Deep breath...

                        Yes! Finish it off for me!
                             (ERASES “bus”, waits)
                        Kenny? You blanking, buddy?

                             (horrified)
                        You actually do that? Does it work?

                                 CLIFTON
                        Sometimes it helps relieve 
                        pressure, but I wouldn’t recommend 
                        it for Patty. She has to come out 
                        of this on her own.

           INT. THE NEW YORK ENQUIRER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The STAFF has doubled in size. The office looks nicer too. 
           Everyone CHEERS to the news Gene’s just revealed.

                                 GENE
                        The rebrand was a huge success! 
                        Stanley, give them the good news.

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        The good news?

                                 GENE
                        The numbers, Stanley. People like 
                        numbers. Fork ‘em over.

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        Last month we averaged 74,000 
                        readers.

                                 GENE
                        That’s great!
                             (realizing, to Stanley)
                        What the fuck?! The last issue you 
                        told me we were at 78,000.

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        That was five weeks ago.
                                 GENE
                        Five weeks and we dropped 4,000 
                        readers? What? Did they move? Drop 
                        dead of a mysterious illness?

                                 LORETTA JONES
                        I actually did have a couple 
                        friends move.

                                 DONNA LEE
                        You did? So did I.

                                 GENE
                        No you didn’t. When? Where? Why? 

                                 LORETTA JONES
                        One of those housing developments 
                        upstate. They said it was safer 
                        than living in the city. 

                                 GENE
                        That’s horseshit. This city is 
                        perfectly safe.

                                 KENNY
                        Have you read our paper lately?

                                 GENE
                        You’re blaming us? Every story we 
                        run is 100% factual.

                                 KENNY
                        And 100% terrifying if you want to 
                        raise a family here.

                        culture and human migration, Judy.

                                 KENNY
                        All I’m saying is it wouldn’t kill 
                        us to tone it down a little. We can 
                        go back to the way things were--

                                 GENE
                        -Go back? Are you out of your mind?

                                 KENNY
                        We have a solid subscription base, 
                        we don’t have to write stories like 
                        these anymore.

                                 GENE
                        Stories like these are what sell.
                                 KENNY
                        Tell that to your 4,000 readers.

                                 GENE
                        Well they can’t run and hide. We’re 
                        going to put our paper in every bar 
                        or barber shop or whatever the hell 
                        they have out there and not only 
                        will we get our readers back, but 
                        our circulation will soar. Now 
                        who’s with me?
                             (no response)
                        Let’s try this another way: who 
                        wants to have their job on Monday?

           Everyone’s hands SHOOT UP.

           A COPY OF THE PAPER gets TOSSED into a waste paper basket. 
           Someone UNZIPS their FLY and PISSES all over it.

           EXT. SUBURBIA - DAY

           ROWS of IDENTICAL HOUSES line the streets. KIDS skip down the 
           street. Birds CHIRP. Dogs PLAY. Sun SHINES from the heavens.

           INT. GENE’S CAR - DAY

           Gene drives. Gloria’s in the front. Donna, Loretta, and Kenny 
           sit in the back, annoyed. Kenny LIGHTS a joint.

                                 GENE
                             (sniffs, pissed)
                        Is that grass? Are you smoking 
                        grass? In my car?

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, it’s Saturday. On Saturdays, 
                        I get stoned and have anonymous 
                        sex. I will not have my life stolen 
                        from me.

           He OFFERS it to Loretta. She accepts, TAKES a hit -- PASSES 
           it to Donna, who does the same. Donna COUGHS horribly.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Gloria? Gene?
                                 GENE
                        No! No one else is getting stoned. 
                        We need to focus. Without subways, 
                        there are no news stands. Without 
                        news stands, there are no papers. 
                        And I haven’t seen a single bakery 
                        or butcher shop since we left the 
                        city. Where the hell do these 
                        people shop? 

           Gene TURNS and comes to a SCREECHING HALT. Everyone’s eyes GO 
           WIDE as they behold the SITE BEFORE THEM... 

           A SUPERMARKET.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        What. The fuck. Is that?

           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           It’s another world in here: CLEAN, SPARKLING, and NEW. Aisles 
           upon aisles of PERFECTLY LINED FOOD. Gene, Kenny, and the 
           women stand in the middle of it all, mouths AGAPE, as 
           CUSTOMERS shop like this is normal.

                                 LORETTA JONES
                        That’s it, I’m moving.

                                 GLORIA IGLOWITZ
                        They literally have everything.

                                 DONNA LEE
                        I can get a roast, a loaf of bread, 
                        and hair spray? I’m never leaving.

                                 LORETTA JONES
                        Is this even legal?

                                 GENE
                        Ladies, focus. Yes, it’s legal. 
                        Yes, it’s revolutionary. But you 
                        know what they don’t have?

                                 KENNY
                        Oh they have rubbers. I checked.

                                 GLORIA IGLOWITZ
                             (off that)
                        Be right back.

                                 LORETTA JONES
                        Plus we’re running out of paper 
                        towels at home.
                                 DONNA LEE
                        And the kids would never forgive 
                        me. Soda’s on sale!

           The WOMEN run off.

                                 GENE
                        See? This is what happens when you 
                        take women shopping. Kenny, go grab 
                        a copy of the paper from the car.
                             (Kenny doesn’t move)
                        What?

                                 KENNY
                        I don’t remember where we parked.
                             (off Gene’s glare)
                        I’ll find it.

           Kenny casually walks off. Gene STOPS a STORE EMPLOYEE.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           Gene PITCHES to WAYNE, 50, a gruff and portly manager, who 
           doesn’t seem to be enjoying these city-folk.

                                 GENE
                        You’ve got a great gig going here. 
                        Really. Hat’s off to you.

                                 WAYNE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 GENE
                        But there’s a product you don’t 
                        have -- one that I can offer you.

                                 WAYNE
                        Yeah? What’s that?

           Kenny returns. He PRESENTS the PAPER with a headline that 
           reads: Man Eats Dogs: He Hammers Them, Boils Them, Eats.

                                 GENE
                        A cutting edge newspaper from 
                        Manhattan. Like I said, you’ve got 
                        a great thing going, but it’s not 
                        reality. You and me, we know this. 
                        This is a bubble and that’s fine. 
                        But when you live in a bubble, it’s 
                        fun to see what goes on outside the 
                        bubble. Know what I mean?
                                 WAYNE
                        No.

                                 KENNY
                        What Mr. Pope means is it’s not fun 
                        for the Princess to live in the 
                        palace her whole life.

                                 WAYNE
                        What?

                                 KENNY
                        You know? The Princess in the 
                        tower? With the servants?

                                 WAYNE
                        I’m confused. Are we talking about 
                        bubbles or Princesses?

                                 GENE
                        Neither. The people need news and 
                        you don’t sell the news. You sell 
                        literally everything else, but no 
                        news. Put The New York Enquirer at 
                        the cashier and I guarantee you, 
                        it’ll fly out of here faster than a 
                        pot roast on Sunday.

           Gene and Kenny give him their best smile. Wayne glances at 
           the paper -- and that headline.

                                 WAYNE
                        Are you two on drugs?

                           GENE
                                                          KENNY
           No.
                                              Yes.

           Gene glares at Kenny.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        He asked.

                                 WAYNE
                        I appreciate you boys stopping by, 
                        but I can’t have shit like that in 
                        my store. Women shop here.

           He NODS toward Loretta, Gloria, and Donna who now have 
           GROCERY CARTS full of FOOD. They WAVE.

                                 GENE
                        Oh, those aren’t women. They’re my 
                        staff and they approve every inch 
                        of this paper.
                                 WAYNE
                        It’s a murder rag.

                                 GENE
                        No it’s not!

                                 WAYNE
                        Men hammering their dogs? What the 
                        hell do you call it?

                                 KENNY
                        A public service announcement about 
                        the dangers of animal cruelty!!! 

           Wayne’s had about enough of this -- gets in Gene’s face.

                                 WAYNE
                        Take your queer friend, your cheap 
                        women, and your piece of shit paper 
                        back to the city where it belongs. 
                        You get me, Guido?

           That’s when they notice Kenny is PISSING ON WAYNE’S LEG! Gene 
           and Wayne are too shocked to react. After ZIPPING UP...

                                 KENNY
                        I think we’re done here.

           INT. GENE’S CAR - DAY

           The women sit in the back with their BAGS OF GROCERIES. 
           Kenny’s in the front, MUNCHING on a bag of POTATO CHIPS.

                                 KENNY
                        Want some?

           INT. GENE’S CAR - DAY

           The RADIO plays as Loretta gets out of the car. It’s just 
           Gene and Kenny now. Gene TURNS OFF the radio as he drives.

                                 GENE
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 KENNY
                        It’s possible I smoked too much 
                        pot, but I stand by my choices.

           Kenny TURNS it back ON. A RADIO ANNOUNCER comes on.
                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...was found dead by her 
                        housekeeper early this morning in 
                        her Brentwood home...

                                 GENE
                        If we can’t get into those 
                        supermarkets, we’re going to go 
                        under. Don’t you get that?

           Gene TURNS OFF the radio.

                                 KENNY
                        Yeah, okay.

           Kenny TURNS the radio back ON.

                                 GENE
                        What? You don’t believe me?

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...she was found nude in her bed...

           Gene TURNS IT OFF. Kenny huffs.

                                 KENNY
                        I see the same numbers you do. We 
                        are doing just fine. We don’t have 
                        to be everywhere. And that guy was 
                        a dick, so...

           Kenny TURNS the radio back ON.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...an empty bottle of pills were 
                        found near the bed...

           Gene TURNS it back OFF.

                                 GENE
                        I know! But you don’t seem to know 
                        what I’m dealing with here. Patty’s 
                        counting on me.

                                 KENNY
                        I just love when you deputize your 
                        ailing wife as a defense of action.

           Kenny TURNS it back ON.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...was an empty water glass in what 
                        is believed to be an apparent 
                        suicide...
           Gene FLIPS it OFF.

                                 GENE
                        I don’t do that.

                                 KENNY
                        You don’t--I want one day where you 
                        don’t complain about the penthouse 
                        you were thrown out of, the paper 
                        that was stolen from you, or how 
                        your crazy wife doesn’t remember 
                        who you are anymore.

           He FLIPS the radio back ON.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...the world begins its mourning...

                                 GENE
                        You’re goddamned lucky I don’t 
                        punch you in the mouth.

           Gene FLIPS it OFF -- PARKS the car.

                                 KENNY
                        Will you stop?!? This is a big 
                        fucking deal!

           Kenny FLIPS the radio back ON.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...for our beloved movie star, 
                        Marilyn Monroe, dead at 36.

           Now Kenny TURNS IT OFF -- gets quiet for a moment.

                                 KENNY
                        Why can’t you be happy with what 
                        you have?

           Kenny gets out - SLAMS THE DOOR - leans through the window.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        No one cares about your tragedies, 
                        Gene. You’re not famous enough. 

           Gene WATCHES as Kenny walks off.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gene, once again, ROLLS around in bed. A nightmare consumes 
           him. FLASHES of MOVIE STARS in the midst of their tragedies.  
           SLAPS, DIVORCES, AFFAIRS. Gene wakes up with a start. 
           INT. KENNY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kenny gets BUTT-FUCKED by ETHAN, an even hunkier stud than 
           Marco, when Gene BARGES right in with his son in his arms.   

                                 GENE
                        I know how to get The Enquirer into 
                        supermarkets.

           Ethan FREAKS out -- PULLING A SHEET OVER HIM.

                                 ETHAN
                        Jesus! Who the fuck are you!?!

                                 GENE
                        Don’t worry. I’m Kenny’s boss.

                                 ETHAN
                        Who’s Kenny?

                                 KENNY
                        I am!
                             (to Gene)
                        And you brought your son. Again.

                                 GENE
                        What was I supposed to do? Leave 
                        him at home unsupervised?

                                 KENNY
                        No that would be irresponsible. How 
                        did you even get in here?

                                 GENE
                        Your door was unlocked. Did you 
                        redecorate? It looks great.

                                 KENNY
                        I did. Thank you. And no, the door 
                        wasn’t unlocked. This is New York.

                                 GENE
                        I may have stolen a key last time. 
                        Doesn’t matter.

                                 KENNY
                        Doesn’t matter???

                                 GENE
                        You were right before. No one cares 
                        about my problems. When we saw the 
                        accident that night, we saw 
                        tragedy, right?
                                 KENNY
                        And blood, guts, and gore, yeah.

                                 GENE
                        If you take away the blood, guts, 
                        and gore, that leaves us with...

                                 KENNY
                        Tragedy?

                                 GENE
                        Exactly! But tragedies of people we 
                        feel we already know. People 
                        already in the news. Celebrities!

                                 KENNY
                        You want to turn us into a fan 
                        magazine?

                                 GENE
                        No, no, no.

                                 KENNY
                        Thank god.

                                 GENE
                        I want us to write about their 
                        abortions!!!

           Kenny’s eyes GO WIDE. He tries to speak very calmly.

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, hand me the baby.

                                 GENE
                        No. He’s mine.

                                 KENNY
                        Listen carefully: I need you to sit 
                        down. You’ve had a stroke--

                                 GENE
                        -Just hear me out--

                                 KENNY
                        -An explosion in your brain-- 

                                 GENE
                        -This is real. And it won’t just be 
                        about celebrity abortions.

                                 KENNY
                        Oh well in that case, pizza for 
                        everybody!
                                 GENE
                        We’ll also cover breakups, spousal 
                        abuse, mental breakdowns, 
                        alcoholism, homosexual perversion--

                                 KENNY
                        -Hey!

                                 GENE
                        Sorry to say it, Kenny, but news is 
                        news and this will get us into the 
                        supermarkets. Staff meeting at 
                        10am. It’s going to be huge!
                             (leaves, comes back)
                        By the way, he’s way better looking 
                        than the last guy. Well done you.

           The baby GIGGLES. Gene leaves. Ethan TURNS to Kenny, pissed.

                                 ETHAN
                        Who was the last guy? What’s his 
                        name? Do I know him?

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Sally comes in as Gene RACES around to leave.

                                 GENE
                        You’re here. Great. I’ve got a big 
                        day ahead of me. Wish me luck.

                                 SALLY
                        I actually wanted to talk to you.

                                 GENE
                        Can it wait? I’m late.

                                 SALLY
                        No, it can’t. I have to turn in my 
                        two weeks.

                                 GENE
                        Wait, what? Really? Why? Do you 
                        need more money?

                                 SALLY
                        No, no. I’m getting married. Ben’s 
                        in the Army and they’re 
                        transferring him to California.

                                 GENE
                        Well, I can’t lose you. We have to 
                        find a way to work this out.
                                 SALLY
                        How? You gonna call the Army?

                                 GENE
                        Maybe. No, that’s nuts. What if I 
                        marry you?

                                 SALLY
                        What???

                                 GENE
                        I’d make a great husband. I can 
                        take care of you. Little Gene loves  
                        you. You’ll see. It’ll be great! 

                                 SALLY
                             (pained)
                        I’m not that kind of girl, Gene.

                                 GENE
                        No, I know. So you’re marrying Ben! 
                        Congrats on that. I was only 
                        kidding before. Mostly. It’s fine. 
                        I’ll find someone.

                                 SALLY
                        You’re going to be late for work.

           INT. THE NEW YORK ENQUIRER - MORNING

           Gene writes on the chalkboard as he talks to his staff.

                                 GENE
                        From now on, we are going to focus 
                        on four things. Number 1: any and 
                        all things involving celebrities.
                             (turning to them)
                        Just because someone’s famous, we 
                        automatically think their lives are 
                        perfect. They’re gorgeous, 
                        talented, rich. They can’t possibly 
                        be suffering like us. But they do. 
                        We’re going to lift the veil -- 
                        show that, yes, celebrities are 
                        just like us. They have the same 
                        hopes, the same dreams, and the 
                        same failures.

                        Hardly. There are tons of doctors 
                        who’ve lost their licences, but are 
                        still technically doctors, so their 
                        medical opinions mean just as much 
                        as practicing physicians. One such 
                        doctor friend of mine just told me 
                        that eating a well done steak was 
                        the medical equivalent of smoking

                        There is no shame in this. He’s an 
                        influential public figure. His 
                        garbage could be a matter of

                        slightly different definitions of 
                        what is and what is not legal.

                        I’m pretty sure impersonating a

                        saw this truck crash. There were 
                        all these blood-soaked bodies in 
                        the road. It was real intense.

                                 KENNY
                             (sighing)
                        Please... please stop talking.

                        It’s my truth, man. It was the 
                        first time I tasted fear. I could 
                        see my own death. And it’s soon.

           A NATIONAL ENQUIRER FLIES TOWARD US with the headline: Jim 
           Morrison Fears He’ll Die Young.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

           CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES POP. The BAND plays. The LAUGHTER grows. 
           Everyone APPLAUDS as Gene TAKES the mic. It’s showtime.

                                 GENE
                        The National Enquirer would like to 
                        thank the National Convention of 
                        Grocery Store Owners for having us. 
                        We’ve gone through a painstaking 
                        reinvention to please you. Well, 
                        that and an unlimited bar tab.
                             (polite LAUGHTER)
                        Our paper is new and improved and 
                        I’m not the only one who thinks so. 
                        Gentlemen, let me introduce our 
                        celebrity guest of the night, Ms. 
                        Jayne Mansfield!!!

           JAYNE MANSFIELD steps on stage. The men CLAP and CHEER and 
           WHISTLE. Jayne’s wearing a virtually SEE-THROUGH dress with 
           her TITS practically spilling out of the top.

                                 JAYNE
                        Oh my goodness! Thank you! You’re 
                        so sweet. I have been a big fan of 
                        The National Enquirer and I hope 
                        you are too.

                                 JAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Now Mr. Pope has promised me that 
                        if you agree to have his paper in 
                        your stores, it will be classy and 
                        something that you can be proud to 
                        have next to the cash register. 
                        Plus, I’d be very, very grateful.

           Jayne LAUGHS and SHAKES her tits at the DROOLING MEN.

                                 JAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Now, who’s with me?
                             (the men CHEER)
                        I can’t hear you!

           She SHAKES her TITS some more, egging them on.

                                 JAYNE (CONT’D)
                        That sounds like a yes, Mr. Pope.  
                        That sounds like a yes!!!

           OFF STAGE: Gene CLAPS and WHISTLES too.

                                 KENNY
                        This makes me nervous. It all feels 
                        too good to be true.

                                 GENE
                        Why don’t you sing, Judy?  

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, I’m trying to talk to you--

                                 GENE
                        -And I’m trying to give you your 
                        dream. There’s a band right there! 
                        That’s why you came to New York.

                                 KENNY
                        Yeah, but I gave up on all that.

                                 GENE
                        Did you?

           Gene STEERS Kenny toward the huge CHEERING CROWD. It’s too 
           intoxicating for him to resist.  He instructs the BAND LEADER 
           as to which song to sing and steps center stage.

           The BAND LEADER plays Judy Garland’s THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY. 
           Kenny takes a DEEP BREATH and SINGS.

                                 KENNY
                        The night is bitter 
                        The stars have lost their glitter 
                        The winds grow colder

                        Suddenly you’re older  
                        And the dreams you dreamed have all 
                        gone astray

           While Kenny sings, Gene MINGLES amongst the crowd. He SMILES, 
           SHAKES hands. A schmoozing dynamo. But then he spots EDITH 
           MOORE, 35, a woman who looks like a million bucks and knows 
           it. She ADVANCES. Gene SWALLOWS hard.

                                 EDITH
                        You’re the guy with the paper.

                                 GENE
                        That’s me.

                                 EDITH
                        My date’s drunk and got a little 
                        handsy with Ms. Mansfield over 
                        there. A couple of your big tough 
                        guys had to take him out back and 
                        beat the crap out of him.

                                 GENE
                        Sorry about that.

                                 EDITH
                        Don’t be. He smelled like spearmint 
                        and pig fat. I owe you.

                                 GENE
                        It’s on the house.

           He starts past her. Edith STOPS him -- a HAND on his arm.

                                 EDITH
                        Doesn’t have to be.

                                 GENE
                        I’m married.

                                 EDITH
                        Whaddya know. The one honest guy in 
                        the room. I better go find the pig 
                        fat man.

           She SASHAYS past him. Gene can’t keep his eyes off her. 

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Quite the party, Mr. Pulitzer.

           He TURNS and comes face to face with Frank. Gene HUGS him.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Your paper is everywhere I look. 
                        What’s your circulation at?

                                 GENE
                        We’re doing okay. Hovering under 
                        100,000.

                                 FRANK
                        Nipping at your father’s heels is 
                        better than okay. You got dealt a 
                        rough hand and really turned into 
                        something. All on your own.
                             (teases)
                        Or almost.

                                 GENE
                        What can I do for you, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        You sound so serious, Gene. This is 
                        a social visit.

                                 GENE
                        I owe you. I know that. Just tell 
                        me what I can do.

                                 FRANK
                        This business with the immigration 
                        people, it bled me dry. 

                                 GENE
                        That why your dogs are gone?

                                 FRANK
                             (nods)
                        Run the numbers for me. In the back 
                        with the classifieds. No one will 
                        even know it’s there.

                                 GENE
                        That’s it? Consider it done.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah?

                                 GENE
                        I can’t say no to you, Uncle Frank. 
                        And thanks for supplying Jayne. 
                        She’s a big hit.
                             (Frank hands him an 
                              ENVELOPE)
                        I’ll run them in the next edition.
           They CHEERS, DRINK. Frank moves on. Kenny’s killing it on 
           stage. Gene gives him an APPROVING SMILE.

                                 KENNY
                        That great beginning 
                        Has seen it’s final inning  
                        No more that all-time thrill 
                        For you’ve been though the mill 
                        And never a new love will 
                        Be the same

           Gene SIPS his drink. A WAITER brings a phone over.

                                 WAITER
                        Phone call, Mr. Pope.

                                 GENE
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. EDGEWOOD STATE HOSPITAL - DR. CLIFTON’S OFFICE - SAME

                                 CLIFTON
                        Mr. Pope, do you have a minute?

                                 GENE
                        I can’t hear you.

                                 CLIFTON
                        It’s about your wife. It’s 
                        important.

                                 GENE
                        Is she okay?

                                 CLIFTON
                        She’s gone.

                                 GENE
                        What? She left?

                                 CLIFTON
                        No. I’m sorry, Gene--

                                 GENE
                        -I still can’t hear you-- 

                                 CLIFTON
                        -She’s dead, Gene!
                             (softening his tone)
                        She hung herself in her room.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLIFTON (CONT'D)
                        You’ll need to come in, make 
                        arrangements. Gene? Are you there?

           Gene HANGS UP.  He looks around his party in full swing.  
           Kenny’s bringing it home -- singing his heart out.  

                                 KENNY
                        The road gets rougher 
                        It’s lonelier and tougher

           Edith GLANCES over at Gene -- sees instantly that something’s 
           wrong. She STRIDES over to him.  

                                 EDITH
                        Are you all right?

           Gene breaks down. Edith HOLDS him, letting him cry as 
           everyone else dances around them.

                                 KENNY
                        There’s just no let up the live-
                        long night and day 
                        Ever since this world began 
                        There’s nothing sadder than 
                        Looking for the one that got away

           TITLE CARD: 

                                         Step #5:
                                        The Polish

           A STAR gets PLACED on top of a fully decorated Christmas 
           tree. It looks nearly perfect... until one of the lights 
           CATCHES fire and the tree soon is ENGULFED in FLAMES.

           INT. EDGEWOOD STATE HOSPITAL - DR. CLIFTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Gene SIGNS the necessary paperwork -- hands it over.

                                 GENE
                        Did she say anything? Leave a note?  
                        Something?

                                 CLIFTON
                        No. I really am very sorry.

           INT. WOODLAWN CEMETERY - DAY

           Gene’s alone, unable to take his eyes of Patty’s CASKET as a 
           PRIEST reads from the bible. When he’s finished...
                                 PRIEST
                        Anything you’d like to say?

           Gene SHAKES his head no. He LIGHTS a cigarette -- walks away.  

           INT. THE STORK CLUB - NIGHT

           Gene sits alone. He SPOTS Edith checking her mink -- quickly 
           stands -- PULLS OUT her chair as she approaches. They sit.

                                 GENE
                        I didn’t think you’d make it.

                                 EDITH
                        It’s not every day a girl gets an 
                        invitation to The Stork Club.

                                 GENE
                        I’ll be better company this time.

                                 EDITH
                        Did you have a service?

                                 GENE
                        Not really. She hadn’t been well in 
                        awhile. No family or friends.

                                 EDITH
                        I really am sorry.

                                 GENE
                        Me too.

                        To new beginnings.

                                 EDITH
                        You’re not supposed to make a toast 
                        with water. It’s bad luck.

                                 GENE
                        Screw it. We’ll make our own luck. 
                        You hungry? They have the best veal 
                        in town.

           He DRINKS. They open their menus when Anthony walks in.  He’s 
           agitated and panicked as he STALKS over to them.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Gene, I need to talk to you.

                                 GENE
                        I don’t have anything to say to 
                        you. Now, if you’ll excuse me--

                             (to Edith)
                        Did you find something you liked?

                                 ANTHONY
                        The paper’s going under.

                                 GENE
                             (to Edith)
                        You must be hungry.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Did you hear me? Papa’s paper is 
                        going under. You have to help us.

                                 GENE
                        I don’t have to do anything.

                                 EDITH
                        I can give you two a minute alone.

                                 GENE
                        It’s fine. You must be hungry.

                                 ANTHONY
                        You won. Don’t you see? You did.    

                                 GENE
                        I haven’t won.  

                                 ANTHONY
                        Why’s that?

                                 GENE
                        Because you’re still standing here.

                                 ANTHONY
                        They’re going to auction off all 
                        our things. You’d let your family 
                        go bankrupt?

                                 GENE
                        You’re doing that all by 
                        yourselves. Please leave. You’re 
                        embarrassing me. And yourself.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Jesus. Papa’d be real proud of the 
                        greaseball you turned out to be.

           Gene LEAPS up. He PUNCHES Anthony before SMASHING his head on 
           the table. GUESTS GASP as Anthony SLUMPS to the floor. Gene 
           takes his seat -- WIPES some BLOOD off his cheek.  
                                 GENE
                        You still hungry?

                                 EDITH
                        No. Thirsty.

           INT. GENE & PATTY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mad, raw FUCKING. Gene and Edith climax -- their sweaty 
           bodies falling onto the mattress. Gene’s chest heaves.

                                 EDITH
                        Did I ever tell you I was a game 
                        show hostess?

           Edith SMILES, coyly, KISSING her way down Gene’s body.

                                 GENE
                             (straining)
                        No. No, you didn’t.

                                 EDITH
                        It was my job to keep the 
                        contestants happy even when they 
                        lost a lot of money.

                                 GENE
                        I bet you were pretty good.

           She starts BLOWING him. He can’t take it anymore.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        By any chance, do you like kids?

           Edith looks up at him, confused.

           INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

           The Il Progresso auction. Catherine, Fortunato, and Anthony 
           sit up front as their things are auctioned away.

           Catherine, Fortunato, and Anthony TURN (as does everyone 
           else) to see Gene in the back of the room. 

           LATER

           Cautiously, Gene APPROACHES Catherine and his brothers.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Ma. How are you?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m auctioning off my family’s 
                        belongings. How do you think I am?

                                 GENE
                        I’m sorry about that. I’ve made 
                        some mistakes, I know that, but...
                        I don’t know if you heard, Patty 
                        passed away... I’m getting married 
                        again, so that’s happening. Little 
                        Gene is growing up fast. I’m sure 
                        he’d love to meet his family. Maybe 
                        you could come to the wedding if 
                        you wanted.
                             (re: Anthony’s FACE)
                        I’ll be on my best behavior. Hand 
                        to god. Whaddya say, Ma? Can we 
                        bury the hatchet? 

           Catherine STANDS -- looks him DEAD in the EYE.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I should’ve aborted you when I had 
                        the chance.

           She LEAVES. The brothers FOLLOW. Gene stands there, stunned.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           SNOW has fallen outside. Inside, Gene and Edith have just 
           been married. Gene kisses his bride. Their guests APPLAUD.     
           INT. CENTRAL PARK CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT

           The reception. Everyone fawns over Edith’s GIANT DIAMOND 
           RING. Gene gets a drink at the bar, watching her. He smiles 
           to himself -- so proud. Frank comes up, PATS him on the back.

                                 GENE
                        Frank!

                                 FRANK
                        I finally made it to one of your 
                        weddings. Was sorry to hear about 
                        Patty. That’s a real shame.

           Gene NODS, a little nervous as Frank ushers him away.

                                 GENE
                        Did you get everything squared away 
                        with the immigration people?

                                 FRANK
                        They’re letting me stay for now. 
                        You know Walpurgis Nacht? You must. 
                        You had a first class education. 

                                 GENE
                        It’s German, means Witch’s Night.

                                 FRANK
                        When the demons come out to play. 
                        Ever notice things go to shit 
                        anytime you throw a party?

                                 GENE
                        Frank, listen, I’ve been meaning to 
                        ring you about the numbers--

                                 FRANK
                        -What’s your circulation up to 
                        these days?

                                 GENE
                             (downplays)
                        302,000.

                                 FRANK
                        302,000. That’s really something. 
                        You’ve eclipsed your old man.

                                 GENE
                        I haven’t eclipsed anyone--
                                 FRANK
                        -No, no, no. This is a red letter 
                        day. Your brothers’ business is 
                        bankrupt, you eclipsed your father, 
                        and you just married Miss Tits on a 
                        Stick over there.   

                                 GENE
                        Frank, I was gonna run the--

                                 FRANK
                        -You’re living the high life. Who 
                        gives a fuck about the rest of us 
                        who got you there?

                                 GENE
                        I’m sorry. Things have been crazy 
                        with Patty dying and--

           Frank full on SLAPS GENE ACROSS THE FACE.

                                 FRANK
                        That dying wife shit may work on 
                        other people but it don’t work on 
                        me. Who do you think you are???

           Frank STRAIGHTENS Gene’s TIE, BRUSHES his JACKET clean, and 
           SMOOTHS out Gene’s hair. Terrified, Gene doesn’t move.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Now, you’re gonna be a good little 
                        boy, go back to the office, and run 
                        the numbers like Uncle Frank asked 
                        you to do the first time. 
                             (Gene NODS)
                        See, it’s so much better when we 
                        can just enjoy each other’s company 
                        and be friends.
                             (hands him an ENVELOPE)
                        A little something for you and the 
                        great pair of tits. Don’t make me 
                        cut ‘em off. 

           Gene WATCHES as Frank leaves. Shaken, Gene goes to the bar.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Everything all right, sir?

                                 GENE
                        Yeah. Is there a phone I can use? 
                        It’s an emergency.

           The Bartender hands him a phone. Gene waves the Bartender 
           away to have some privacy -- DIALS a number.
                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey... That thing we talked about, 
                        we’re a go for tonight. He’s 
                        staying at the Majestic... Yeah, it 
                        has to be tonight. Thanks.

           He HANGS UP -- and immediately VOMITS in a forgotten ICE 
           BUCKET. He WIPES his mouth just as Edith SNEAKS UP behind 
           him. She THROWS her arms around his waist. Gene JOLTS.

                                 EDITH
                        You okay?

                                 GENE
                        Just had to make a work call. I 
                        believe I owe you a dance.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - SAME

           Frank walks home in the snow. A SHADOW crosses in front of 
           him. Frank pauses, but there’s no one there. He continues on.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK CLUBHOUSE - SAME

           Gene TWIRLS Edith away -- pulls her back to him.

           INT. THE MAJESTIC HOTEL -  LOBBY - SAME

                        This is for you, Frank!

           Frank TURNS in time to GLIMPSE a GUN BEING FIRED.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK CLUBHOUSE - SAME

           Gene KISSES Edith. It’s tender, sweet. Gentle.

           INT. THE MAJESTIC HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME

           Frank FALLS to the floor, blood GUSHING from his head. A 
           HOTEL CLERK rushes over. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK CLUBHOUSE - SAME

           The song reaches its CLIMAX. Gene DIPS Edith.  APPLAUSE 
           abounds as he RAISES her to him, kissing her.
           INT. THE MAJESTIC HOTEL - SAME

           LIFELESS BODY from the hotel.

           INT. KENNY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Gene, frenzied, tries opening Kenny’s door but it’s CHAINED.

                                 GENE
                        The chain’s on, Kenny. Why’s the 
                        chain on?

           Kenny, in a t-shirt and underwear, UNCHAINS the door.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have company, do you?

                                 KENNY
                        No, it’s just me. What’s going on?

                                 GENE
                        I think it’s time we moved. Spread 
                        our winds. Expand.

                                 KENNY
                        Like to a new office?

                                 GENE
                        Like to a new state.

                                 KENNY
                        What? Why?

           Gene PULLS out a suitcase -- TOSSES Kenny’s clothes in it.

                                 GENE
                        I know you like it here, but it’s 
                        so cold. I feel like we need 
                        someplace warmer. Florida, maybe.

                                 KENNY
                        What brought this on?

                                 GENE
                        Nothing. But sometimes you’ve got 
                        to take life by the balls and make 
                        a move. Also Frank was shot.

                                 KENNY
                        He what?!?
                                 GENE
                        Tonight. At his hotel. In the head. 
                        But the old man won’t die. Know 
                        what I mean? It’s crazy!

           He keeps hurriedly STUFFING clothes in Kenny’s bag.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, you’d think a bullet to the 
                        head would do the trick. But no! 
                        Hey, why weren’t you at my wedding?

                                 KENNY
                        I wasn’t invited.

                                 GENE
                        You wouldn’t have had fun anyway. 
                        Do you need all these clothes?

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, stop. I need you to look at 
                        me and tell me the truth.

                                 GENE
                        I can do that.

                                 KENNY
                             (dead serious)
                        Do we need to move?

                                 GENE
                        I’m thinking maybe. Actually, yes.  
                        Absolutely. There’s a cab waiting 
                        downstairs to take us on a red eye.

           Immediately, Kenny helps him pack.

                                 KENNY
                        Jesus, Florida, what are you doing? 
                        Leave the sweaters. Pack the tank 
                        tops, shorts, and cute underwear.

                                 GENE
                             (re: Kenny’s outfit)
                        Wait, what’s cute underwear? That?

           Kenny covers his junk.

           EXT. PALM BEACH - DAY

           The sun’s shining. The palm trees SWAY in the wind as ocean 
           waves CRASH against the shore. It’s the good life here.
           INT. GENE & EDITH’S HOUSE - DAY

           A sprawling mansion. Much nicer than anyplace Gene’s lived in 
           before. He’s made it. Edith THROWS open the SLIDING GLASS 
           DOORS that lead out to the BEACH and STUNNING OCEAN VIEW. 

                                 EDITH
                        This is ours?!?

                                 GENE
                        It’s a rental, but for now, yeah.

                                 EDITH
                        Does it have a pool?

                                 GENE
                        You want a pool? You’ve got the 
                        whole ocean right there!

           He GRABS her -- kisses her. Gene III STUMBLES in, TRIPS, 
           FALLS -- SCREAMING at the top of his lungs.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                             (heads for the door)
                        On that note.

                                 EDITH
                        And where do you think you’re 
                        going? This is our honeymoon.

                                 GENE
                        I know, babe, but I’ve got a paper 
                        to get out. We’ll celebrate later.

           Edith scowls as Gene SHUTS the door.

           EXT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A MASSIVE COMPOUND with a BIG ASS FUCKING GATE. In the center 
           of the compound, a GIANT CHRISTMAS TREE is being erected. 
           Gene leads the staff meeting outdoors. 

                                 GENE
                        I’m sorry for uprooting your lives, 
                        especially around the holidays, but 
                        we outgrew New York. As a symbol of 
                        my appreciation -- in addition to 
                        your relocation fees and Christmas 
                        bonuses -- there will be gifts for 
                        the entire staff under this Douglas 
                        fur that stands 125ft tall. It’s 
                        going to be an adventure here.

           INT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Gene Sr’s PRINTING PRESS has been delivered. The rest of the 
           staff files in as well, setting up their desks. Gene notices 
           that Loretta now has CORNROWS, Gloria has a NOSE-JOB BANDAGE.

                                 GENE
                        What’s with Gloria?

                                 KENNY
                        What do you mean?

                                 GENE
                        Her face. Did she get mugged or hit 
                        with a tennis racket or something?

                                 KENNY
                        No. I think the relocation money 
                        you gave went straight to her nose.

                                 GENE
                        That’s wasteful. She’s a writer. No 
                        one cares about her face.

                                 KENNY
                        She does. But why do you?

                                 GENE
                        It shows bad judgement. Fire her.

                                 KENNY
                        Excuse me???

                                 GENE
                        And Loretta too.

                                 KENNY
                        Loretta didn’t get a nose job.

                                 GENE
                        No, but those things in her hair 
                        freak me out.
                                 KENNY
                        The cornrows? Gene, you can’t go 
                        around firing people because you 
                        don’t like their hairstyle. We’ll 
                        have no one left.

                                 GENE
                        There will always be someone as 
                        long as the money doesn’t run out.
                             (to Loretta/Gloria)
                        Loretta, Gloria, you’re fired.
                             (to Kenny)
                        See? Easy.

           INT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER HQ - GENE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kenny FOLLOWS Gene into this office.

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, what is wrong with you?

                                 GENE
                        Nothing. I just like my business 
                        run a certain way.

                                 KENNY
                        You were never like this before.

                                 GENE
                        I didn’t have anything to lose 
                        before. Things were different back 
                        in New York. I let everyone have 
                        their say on every decision I made 
                        because I thought that’s what a 
                        good boss did. That ends now.

                                 KENNY
                        This is insanity.

                                 GENE
                        See, this is why we have a problem.  
                        You think this is an acceptable way 
                        to talk to your boss. It’s not.  
                        It’s disrespectful. I’m who signs 
                        your checks. I’m not your friend.

                                 KENNY
                        You’ve broken into my apartment--

                                 GENE
                        -That was for a business meeting.
                                 KENNY
                        You watched me have sex--

                                 GENE
                        -an unfortunate by-product of said 
                        business meeting.

                                 KENNY
                        You took me to commit your wife to 
                        an insane asylum! You’re telling me 
                        all THAT doesn’t equal friendship?!  

                                 GENE
                        I needed a driver.
                             (a beat)
                        Look, you do a good job. I need 
                        you. But you’re also replaceable. I 
                        set the course. You can get in line 
                        or get out. Either way, I’m getting 
                        more respect around here.

                                 KENNY
                             (defeated)
                        I’ll make sure Gloria and Loretta 
                        are gone by the end of the 
                        business.

                                 GENE
                        Good boy. Now, I want to talk to 
                        you about our celebrity death 
                        coverage. It stinks.

                                 KENNY
                        What’s wrong with it? We cover them 
                        all: Betty Grable, Bobby Darin, 
                        Edward G. Robinson, Joan Crawford.

                                 GENE
                        Anyone can cover a funeral. I want 
                        us to go the extra mile. Our 
                        readers expect something extra.

                                 KENNY
                        Like what? A dead body?
                             (off Gene’s look)
                        Gene, no! You cannot steal a dead 
                        celebrity!  

                                 GENE
                        I’m not stealing a dead “anything” 
                        yet. This is all theoretical.
                                 KENNY
                        It’s not theoretical when someone 
                        could look at this conversation and 
                        call us conspirators.

                                 GENE
                        People can’t conspire if it hasn’t 
                        happened yet. We’re just talking.

                                 KENNY
                        That’s exactly what conspiracy is! 
                        My god, I really need to know every 
                        letter of the law with you.

                                 GENE
                        Kenny, I’m fucking with you. I 
                        don’t want to steal a dead body, 
                        but you failed my test miserably. I 
                        set the course. Remember?

                                 KENNY
                        Right. Sorry. Force of habit. I’ll 
                        work on that.

                                 GENE
                        I appreciate it. Steal a dead body. 
                        How crazy do you think I am?

                                 KENNY
                        I don’t know what I was thinking. 
                        It was pretty crazy.

           The men both start LAUGHING -- it’s a RELEASE of all that 
           tension. But Gene’s LAUGHTER suddenly STOPS.

                                 GENE
                        I want a photo of a dead celebrity 
                        in their coffin.

                                 KENNY
                        You want what?

                                 GENE
                        The next time a celebrity dies, I 
                        want a picture of them in their 
                        coffin. It’s for the cover. It’s 
                        never been done before.

                                 KENNY
                        I can’t imagine why not.

                                 GENE
                        Clearly, you’re not a visionary.
                                 KENNY
                        You’re right. But why stop there? 
                        We can have me buried with a 
                        celebrity and get a first hand 
                        account of how their body rots!

                                 GENE
                        Now you’re talking! We won’t have 
                        to wait long. Stars are dropping 
                        like flies nowadays. Fingers 
                        crossed someone has a wild weekend. 
                        Have your camera ready.  

           Gene EXITS. Kenny BANGS his head into the wall over and over.  

           EXT. GRACELAND - DAY

           Thousands of FANS are outside of Graceland with pictures of 
           Elvis, flowers, candles. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Nearly 80,000 fans of the late 
                        Elvis Presley have gathered to pay 
                        respects to the King who passed 
                        away on Tuesday afternoon from an 
                        apparent drug overdose. The singer 
                        had been struggling in recent 
                        months to complete his touring 
                        obligations. Recently, Presley was 
                        having trouble singing, dancing, 
                        speaking, or even standing... 

           The FANS SCREAM as a procession of BLACK LIMOS pass them, 
           followed by a HEARSE, which gets let in through the gates.

           OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE

           Gene and Kenny CLIMB a fence. They remain hidden, keeping in 
           the bushes as they make their way toward the main building 
           where Elvis’ FRIENDS and FAMILY have gathered. 

                                 GENE
                        There. That’s Elvis’ cousin.

           Gene nods toward BOBBY MANN, 38, a sly son-of-a-bitch who’s 
           having a cigarette near the back entrance. Gene heads over.  

                                 KENNY
                        Where are you--Gene!

           Kenny has no choice but to follow his boss. He finds Gene 
           bumming a cigarette from Bobby Mann.
                                 GENE
                        Well this is a shit show.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Yeah, man. That’s what I’m saying. 
                        It’s weird to look at him like 
                        that. All fat. He looks sweaty even 
                        when he’s dead.

           Gene takes a drag off his cigarette, considering.

                                 GENE
                        That’s a damn shame. A damn shame.  
                        But I’m sure you and your entire 
                        family will be taken care of.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Elvis? None of the family is gonna 
                        see shit. Especially me.

                                 GENE
                        That’s not fair. What if you could 
                        earn a little cash? After all, 
                        you’re in a very powerful position 
                        at the moment.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        I am? How?

                                 GENE
                        Access. You want to earn ten grand?

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        For what?

                                 GENE
                        All you gotta do is take a picture.  
                        One picture.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        You’re seriously gonna pay me ten 
                        grand for a picture of the funeral?

                                 GENE
                        No. I want Elvis. In his coffin.

           Bobby STARES them down as he smokes. Kenny swallows hard.  
           Gene doesn’t back down. Not for one second.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        I want twenty.

                                 GENE
                        Fifteen.
                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Eighteen, motherfucker, or I start 
                        screaming.

                                 GENE
                        Will you take a check?

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Cash is king. The only king.

           Gene smirks to himself. He FILLS out a check. Gene TEARS it 
           off -- HANDS it over.

                                 GENE
                        I own The National Enquirer. I’m 
                        sure you’ve heard of it.

           Bobby Mann takes the check, EXAMINING it.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                             (smiling)
                        Yeah, I know it.

                                 GENE
                        Then you know that check is as good 
                        as gold.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        I don’t got a camera.

                                 GENE
                        Kenny?

           He motions to Kenny and the CAMERA that’s AROUND HIS NECK.  
           Kenny’s eyes go wide. But Gene isn’t fucking around. The look 
           on his face says, “Give it to me now, or die.” Reluctantly, 
           Kenny HANDS the CAMERA over to Bobby Mann.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Ride or die, right?

           Bobby Mann DISAPPEARS inside. Kenny can’t even look at Gene.

                                 GENE
                        It was the only way.

           Kenny says nothing. They wait another minute. Finally, Bobby 
           Mann returns -- GIVES the CAMERA back to Kenny.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Did you get it?

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        I don’t know. Did I?
                                 GENE
                             (bluffing)
                        Hope so. We can have that developed 
                        before you cash that check.

                                 BOBBY MANN
                        Can you?

           Bobby FLICKS away his cigarette and WALKS off.

           EXT. RAMADA HOTEL - DAY

           A RENTAL CAR comes to a SCREECHING HALT. Gene and Kenny RACE 
           out of the car and up the steps.

                                 GENE
                        How many did he take?!?

                                 KENNY
                        Four.

           They burst into a...   

           HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Norman and Stanley are there, waiting.

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        Turn out the lights! Cover the 
                        windows!

           Kenny TRANSFORMS the hotel: RED LIGHTS go on, CHEMICALS get 
           mixed in trays, the film gets BLOWN UP on developing paper...

                                 GENE
                        How much longer?

                                 KENNY
                        Give it a minute!

                                 GENE
                        I paid eighteen thousand dollars 
                        for that picture and I’m not about 
                        to be buttfucked by some hick, so 
                        show me the goddamned--

           The IMAGE comes to life before their eyes.  

           IN THE DEVELOPING TRAY: A perfect picture of Elvis, dead, in 
           his coffin.

           Gene can’t believe what he’s looking at. TEARS FILL HIS EYES -
           - like a kid on Christmas morning.
                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        It’s perfect. It’s the most perfect 
                        thing I’ve ever seen.

                                 KENNY
                        He actually does look sweaty.

           A phone RINGS. Stanley answers.

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

           Gene TURNS to Kenny -- HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS.

                                 GENE
                        Do you have any idea what this 
                        means?  

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        Gene--

                                 GENE
                        -Every man, woman, and child is 
                        going to buy this.  

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        Hey Gene--

                                 GENE
                        We are going to have the largest 
                        paper in the history of the world.

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        Gene--

                                 GENE
                        -The King is dead. You hear me? The 
                        King is dead!!!

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        Gene!!!

                                 GENE
                        What?!?

                                 STANLEY FARRELL
                        We’re being sued.

           INT. GENE & EDITH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Gene’s finishing in the shower. Edith comes in -- pissed as 
           he gets out, dries off, and gets dressed.
                                 EDITH
                        Gene, when did you get back? 

                                 GENE
                        20 minutes ago. I have to run to 
                        the office. There’s an emergency.

                                 EDITH
                        There’s always an emergency.

                                 GENE
                        This is different. We’re being 
                        sued.

                                 EDITH
                        Gene, all I do is fuck you and take 
                        care of your kid. What the hell 
                        kind of marriage is that?

                                 GENE
                        A normal one?

                                 EDITH
                        I did not marry you so I could be a 
                        babysitter to two babies.

                                 GENE
                        That’s a low blow, babe. And in all 
                        fairness, you’re the best paid 
                        babysitter in the state.

           She SLAPS him. Gene doesn’t react.

                                 EDITH
                        I want a divorce.

                                 GENE
                        Yeah, ok. I get it.
                             (a beat)
                        Any chance you want custody of the 
                        kid?

           INT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The staff has gathered. It’s become increasingly more WHITE 
           and MALE with Gene’s firings. Gene stands before his STAFF -- 
           the king in front of his subjects.

                                 GENE
                        This lawsuit is bullshit. I know 
                        that. You know that. But this is 
                        real now.

                        We’ve never been sued before, so 
                        how we conduct ourselves in the 
                        coming days and weeks will 
                        determine the future of these 
                        nuisance suits. Let go over this 
                        together. Kenny, take it away.

                                 KENNY
                        In March of this year, the 
                        following article ran with the 
                        title: Carol Burnett and Henry K in 
                        Row. It read: In a Washington 
                        restaurant, a boisterous Carol 
                        Burnett had a loud argument with 
                        another diner, Henry Kissinger. 
                        Then she traipsed around the place 
                        offering everyone a bite of her 
                        dessert. But Carol really raised 
                        eyebrows when she accidentally 
                        knocked a glass of wine over on one 
                        diner and started giggling instead 
                        of apologizing. The guy wasn't 
                        amused and accidentally spilled a 
                        glass of water over Carol's dress.
                             (a beat)
                        Carol Burnett is suing for a 
                        million dollars over those 67 
                        words.

                                 NORMAN
                        Why? Because she was drunk off her 
                        ass and got in a screaming match 
                        with the secretary of state?

                                 KENNY
                        Because the article implies she was 
                        drunk while dining at Rive Gauche 
                        restaurant. In fact, Carol doesn’t 
                        drink and is very sensitive to this 
                        as both her parents are alcoholics.

                                 GENE
                        And a million dollars is sure to 
                        ease her pain and suffering.  

                                 KENNY
                        I think we should settle.

                                 GENE
                        You do?

                                 KENNY
                        It sends a strong and clear message 
                        that we take this seriously.

                        We made a mistake, we are 
                        rectifying it, and we won’t be 
                        doing it again.

                                 GENE
                        See, I think settling sends a 
                        different message: That we’re 
                        fucking guilty.

                                 KENNY
                        Which would matter if we were, you 
                        know, actually innocent.

                                 GENE
                        Hey, I’m not going round for round 
                        with Carol Burnett over what does 
                        and does not imply intoxication.

                                 KENNY
                        Actually, that’s exactly what a 
                        lawsuit is. They’re going to haul 
                        you in to go “round for round” over 
                        every single thing we do here.

                                 GENE
                        We do good news work.

                                 KENNY
                        No, we do work. And all she has to 
                        do is prove actual malice.

                                 GENE
                        You’ll have to explain what actual 
                        malice is, because, as you know, I 
                        am incredibly stupid.

                                 KENNY
                        I didn’t say you were--

                                 GENE
                        -I don’t hate Carol Burnett nor did 
                        I publish an article willfully 
                        knowing it was false.

                                 KENNY
                        Did we behave with reckless 
                        disregard for whether or not the 
                        story was true? They can show we 
                        did by establishing a pattern of 
                        behavior with previous stories.

           Gene BURSTS in, about to throw up, but doesn’t. Somehow, he

           It’s a formal office building. Gene strides down the hall,

           CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gene sits across from one lawyer: SIMON CRAIG, 43, who’s just 
           as ready for action as Gene is.

                                 SIMON
                        Mr. Pope, do you know why you’re 
                        here today?

                                 GENE
                        Yes. Carol Burnett is an idiot.

           Gene LIGHTS a cigarette, BLOWING smoke right in Simon’s face.

                                 SIMON
                        There’s no smoking in this 
                        building, Mr. Pope.

                                 GENE
                        But there’s an ashtray right there.

                                 SIMON
                        So?
                                 GENE
                        So why’s a fucking ashtray sitting 
                        there if I can’t smoke?

                                 SIMON
                        I’m sure I don’t know. Can you 
                        please put it--

                                 GENE
                        -I mean, would you leave a syringe 
                        filled with heroin on the table and 
                        then get aggravated when I wanted 
                        to shoot up?

                                 SIMON
                        I understand your metaphor--

                                 GENE
                        -I didn’t use a metaphor. A 
                        metaphor would be me saying I’m 
                        making your blood boil, which by 
                        the color of your face might be 
                        accurate. What I suggested was 
                        hyperbole: an exaggerated claim 
                        that’s not meant to be taken 
                        seriously. But I wouldn’t expect 
                        you to know that. Stanford is a 
                        fine institution if you’re into 
                        that sort of thing.  

                                 SIMON
                        How do you know where I went to 
                        school?

                        Your client doesn’t have any 
                        brains. Why should her lawyer?  

                                 SIMON
                        My client is one of the biggest 
                        stars on television.

                                 GENE
                        I’m going to stop you right there.

                        going to help you out. Don’t ever 
                        say that out loud in public again.

                        Mr. Pope--

                        -Since when does being a star 
                        automatically mean you’re smart?
                                 SIMON
                        Well, I imagine you have to have a 
                        certain amount of--

                        -No. See, this is where Stanford 
                        failed you. You can’t start off an 
                        argument with “I imagine.” But 
                        sure, we’ll go with your idiotic 
                        supposition that if you reach star 
                        status, you must be of moderate 
                        intelligence... or at least have a 
                        damn good agent.

                        Yes, you do. Everyone does. And 
                        that’s okay. Enquiring minds, 
                        right? We build them up so we can 
                        tear them down. It’s primal. I’m a 
                        living example of it and you don’t 
                        see me complaining. But here’s the 
                        real truth: I turned a no-nothing 
                        local paper with a press run of 
                        about 15 into The National 
                        Enquirer, a cultural phenomenon 
                        with a weekly circulation of 3 
                        million. So, if you’re going to 
                        come for me, you better start with 
                        more than a basic understanding of 
                        the English language, baseless 
                        accusations of libel, and a piece

           at the defense table with Kenny by his side -- while CAROL 
           BURNETT sits with the PLAINTIFFS. A FOREMAN stands.

                        titled action, guilty of libel and 
                        defamation of character against 
                        Carol Burnett. 

           Everyone CHEERS. The reaction is THUNDEROUS. Kenny wants to 
           crawl under the table and die, while Gene sits and listens to 
           the Foreman intently.

                        million in punitive damages.

                        you can call them that -- they lied 
                        and they hurt me. Maybe with a 
                        judgement like this, they’ll think 
                        twice about reporting false

                        diamond ring and then donate the 
                        rest to charity.

           Gene and Kenny slink out the side exit.

                        They’re going to keep suing us. 
                        Don’t you get that? This isn’t 
                        going to stop!  

                                 GENE
                        Exactly.
                             (Kenny doesn’t understand)
                        Let. Them. Sue. Do you really think 
                        I’m going to pay that has been $1.6 
                        million dollars?

                                 KENNY
                        You were ordered to.

                                 GENE
                        And not being someone who’s ever 
                        run a business, a household, or 
                        from what I can tell, a marathon, I 
                        wouldn’t expect you to understand 
                        the delicate inner workings of the 
                        legal system, let alone the court 
                        of appeals. A court of which -- I 
                        can assure you -- I will take full 
                        advantage of. And in the end, 
                        Burnett won’t get but a fraction of 
                        that 1.6 million and I’ll get free 
                        publicity the entire time. God, I 
                        love this country.

                                 KENNY
                        No, Gene. You can’t do this. 

                                 GENE
                        Can’t? Who do you think you are?

           He stands up -- towering over Kenny. Gene SMACKS Kenny’s head 
           -- not as playful as it once was.

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Who? Tell me.

           He SMACKS Kenny’s head again. Kenny’s trying not to cry.

                                 KENNY
                        I’m just trying to--
                                 GENE
                        -Make demands, embarrass me in 
                        front of the staff? Who the hell 
                        are you?!?

           He SMACKS Kenny’s head again -- it’s getting violent.

                                 KENNY
                             (crying now)
                        Your employee--

                                 GENE
                        -You’re a fucking faggot! You would 
                        have never made this paper what it 
                        is. I did!

           Gene HITS Kenny over and over and over again. Kenny tries to 
           fight back, but Gene TOWERS over him.

                                 KENNY
                        Gene, stop! Please!!!

           Gene’s hands are BLOODY now. Chest heaving, he backs away 
           from Kenny who SPITS some BLOOD on the floor.

           Kenny PULLS himself up -- comes face to face with Gene. The 
           men STARE at each other for a long, hard moment.    

           But then Kenny TURNS AWAY -- WALKS out. Gene FOLLOWS.

                                 GENE
                        And where the hell do you think 
                        you’re going, huh? 
                             (Kenny doesn’t respond)
                        You’re not going to talk to me now? 
                        The faggot finally shut up. I bet I 
                        can make you talk.

           Gene GRABS Kenny’s prized CAMERA -- BASHES it on his father’s 
           PRINTING PRESS. The camera SHATTERS. Even though he’s CRYING, 
           Kenny doesn’t dare look back. He HURRIES down the spiral 
           staircase, ignoring Gene’s taunts as he follows after him.  

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        A million people can do what you 
                        do. All I have to do is wave some 
                        dirty cash and you sissies will 
                        come running to dig through trash 
                        and report on your favorite stars 
                        to keep your fancy lives going. I 
                        built this. Me! And no one’s going 
                        to take it from me. Not you. Not 
                        fucking Carol Burnett. Nobody!  
           But Kenny’s made it to the bottom of the stairs. He pushes 
           his way out of the building and into the night.

           Gene goes back into the office -- sits at his desk, which is 
           full of PICTURES to be published in the newspaper. He puts 
           his hands over them -- his most prized possessions.  

                                 GENE (V.O.)
                        That’s how it all began. Don’t 
                        believe me?

           Pat Benatar’s Hit Me With Your Best Shot plays as a...

           MONTAGE BEGINS:

           It’s all of the famous National Enquirer pictures and 
           headlines that came after this moment in time. They include:

           Madonna and Sean Penn marry, Michael Jackson marries Elvis’ 
           daughter, JFK Jr’s plane crashes, Princess Diana dies, OJ 
           Simpson murders Nicole and Ron, UNA Bomber strikes, Bill 
           Clinton hugs Monica Lewinsky, Tom Cruise sues gay wrestler, 
           Oprah loses weight again, Richard Gere gets a blowjob in the 
           ocean, Hugh Grant gets caught with a hooker, JonBenet Ramsey 
           is murdered, Nancy Kerrigan screams “Why me?” The Menendez 
           Brothers kill their parents, Amy Fisher shoots her lover’s 
           wife in the face, Lorena Bobbitt cuts off her husband’s 
           penis, Melanie Griffith gets Antonio Bandaras hard on a boat, 
           and Elvis comes back from the dead.

           It’s all so much fun as the song reaches its CLIMAX. Then:

           INT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           It’s deathly quiet in here. Dark too. 

           We PUSH IN on Gene back at his desk, completely alone, 
           working hard on the latest edition. Finally, he looks up, 
           STARES DIRECTLY AT US.  

                                 GENE
                        You’re welcome.
