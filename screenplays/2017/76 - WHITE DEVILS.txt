           BLACK. 

           DRIVING RAIN. Sounds of CAR pulling to a stop. 

           Only the WINDSHIELD WIPERS now. 

                                 WOMAN
                        It’ll be fine. 

                                 MAN
                        Yeah.

           A hard TAPPING sound. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. SUV - NIGHT

           From the backseat, we see the Woman and Man, and two baby 
           boys. It’s dark, we can’t make out faces. 

           The driver’s window is open. The Woman sits in the driver’s 
           seat. The sound of the window ROLLING DOWN. The rain is even 
           LOUDER. 

           A BEAT. 

           A Police Officer appears. 

                                 OFFICER
                        License and registration. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Sure... Anything wrong? 

                                 OFFICER
                        That’s why I stopped ya.  

           He walks off.  

                                 MAN
                        He’s gonna find something. Watch. 

                                 WOMAN
                        We’re fine. 

                                 MAN
                        You see how he looked at me? He 
                        gon’ find something. 

           MOVEMENT, shifting. 

                                 WOMAN
                        What? You’re really doing the most. 
           The Man pulls out his cell phone starts recording. 

                                 MAN
                        No sense having his word versus 
                        mine. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Hey. You’re scaring them. 

                                 MAN
                        They need to know--

                                 WOMAN
                        That’s enough. 

           FOOTSTEPS returning. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Step out of the car ma’am. 

           She CLICKS her seatbelt free. 

                                 MAN
                        ...no. Why? For what? 

                                 OFFICER
                        I’m talking to the driver, sir. 
                        Stay where you are. 

           A BEAT. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am? 

                                 WOMAN
                        Ok. 

           She opens the car, slams the door. From the backseat--

                                 A CHILD
                        Mommy. 

           The Man opens his door, steps out. 

           Through the windshield, distorted with rain, we see the three 
           figures ahead. SOUNDS of an argument. Frenetic. The voices 
           blending, rising. 

           YELLING now. Posturing. One of them reaches... Then--

           POP. POP. POP. 

           Gunfire, deafening and final. 
           One figure drops, another bends low over it.

                                 OFFICER
                        JESUS. FUCK... AHH. 

           SOBS. Anguished SCREAMS. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t listen... FUCK! 

           Silence. 

           The RAIN and WIPERS the only sounds. Then... 

                                 CHILD
                        Daddy? 

                                                               CUT TO:

           BLACK. 

           CHOPPING. Something hard struck by something harder. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           CLOSE on small log, SPLIT with an axe. Another replaces it. 
           The axe falls again. 

           Pull back to reveal the man swinging it. 

           Powerful, sinewy. Bald, a wild, nappy beard from ear to ear. 
           He grits his teeth with each swing, this is almost therapy. 

           This is CASSIUS, 42, dark skin, furious eyes. 

           Cassius nearly splits the ground he’s chopping on. 

           He stands, catching his breath... but the CHOPPING continues. 
           Cassius clutches his axe, looks over to the sound.

           REVERSE to see a spindly young man with soft curls and a 
           determined face. 

           He places planks on a stump, positions a LARGE UTILITY KNIFE 
           on top, then hammers down with another log. 

           More splitting. 

           After a few, he lays the knife aside. 

           Wrings his hands, shaking off pain from the shock of 
           hammering the logs. 
           Cassius locks eyes with him. The boy stares back, defiant for 
           a moment. Then, slowly, he picks up the knife again, 
           positions a new log. 

           This is MALCOLM, 14, ruddy cheeks, ashy skin, not to be 
           pitied. 

           He goes back to hammering logs. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Toughen up them hands. 

           Malcolm grunts. Hammers. 

           EXT. POND - DAY

           Malcolm and Cassius stand on the bank of green-ish pond, 
           fishing from the shore. 

           Another, younger boy squats in the sand fiddling with his 
           lure. He fixes a sinker and pauses. He sets his gaze on a 
           pail of worms nearby. 

           This is MANDELA, 11, gentle, with big brown Disney-eyes. 

           Malcolm looks over sees him. He nods toward the bucket. 
           Mandela hovers there for a second, but finally withdraws. He 
           shakes his head at Malcolm. 

           Malcolm looks back at Cassius, who scans the trees and slowly 
           rolls in his reel, dragging the water. 

           Malcolm motions to Mandela, hands the younger boy his reel. 
           After the exchange, Malcolm baits the boy’s hook. 

           They switch reels. 

           Cassius looks over just after they do. Mandela steps away and 
           CASTS his reel out. 

           Cassius watches a few moments. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...they’re bait-stealers. Run the 
                        hook all the way through. 

           Malcolm nods. Mandela nods too. 

           Cassius runs his hook through a worm, SLINGS out his line, it 
           ZIPS and PLOPS into the water. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A campfire CRACKLES. 

           A few fish lean above the fire, suspended on sticks dug into 
           the ground. 

           A stack of already roasted fish sit in an old iron skillet on 
           the ground. 

           Malcolm, Cassius and Mandela chow down, picking fish from 
           bones.  

           Mandela happily licks his fingers and tosses a tail into the 
           brush behind him. He crawls toward the skillet reaches for 
           another piece. 

           Cassius grabs his hand, tight. 

           He glares at the boy. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Next time, bait your own hook. 
                        ...you don’t work, you don’t eat. 

           He releases. Mandela pulls back with the fish. He nibbles at 
           it, avoiding Cassius’ gaze. Malcolm cuts a look at Cassius, 
           who is unmoved. 

           Cassius goes for another piece, bites it in half. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           A modest, weathered wooden cabin amongst a smattering of 
           skinny red and white pines. Small. Utilitarian. 

           The only home the boys have ever known. 

           Malcolm sits against a wall as he fletches arrows. He holds 
           one up to examine the shaft. Looks past it. 

           He finds Mandela, sitting on his knees in a pen cordoned off 
           by a four feet high barbed wire fence staked into the ground. 
           Mandela picks through the dirt with a spade, gathers bulbs, 
           leaves and fruits from his garden. 

           He waters the plants carefully, prunes leaves. 

           Malcolm stares. Mandela is happy amongst the flowers. 

           Beauty in a cage. 

           Malcolm grabs another arrow. 
           EXT. CABIN - LATER

           Cassius wears a boxing body protector, punching mitts and 
           protective headgear. 

           He throws punches at Malcolm, who dodges and returns, 
           circling. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...two, three, slip, hook, roll... 

           Malcolm, a step behind the commands, comes at Cassius with 
           speed and precision. 

           His punches are swift. Hard. He’d do real damage, if not for 
           the pads.

           This is routine. Not fun, work. 

           Mandela watches nearby, wearing his own gloves and shorts.

           Cassius throws a hook for his head, Malcolm ducks it, comes 
           back with a jab, straight, and two hard knees. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (slapping mitts together)
                        Good. 

           Malcolm heaves, catching his breath. He nods, pleased. 

           Cassius wheels to face Mandela, starts throwing jabs without 
           warning. The boy is on his heels, dodging, stumbling. He hits 
           the dirt.  

           Malcolm starts to move to him, suppresses it. Cuts his eyes 
           to Cassius, who hovers over Mandela. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Come on... get up. 

           Mandela stands, dusts himself. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Work. 

           He closes in again. Mandela slips blows. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela follow Cassius, running through the woods 
           with a stopwatch. 

           Cassius comes to a stop. 
           The boys rest. 

           Malcolm looks over, spots a tree with a WHITE SYMBOL painted 
           on the trunk. Something mysterious about it. 

           He STARES.  

           Cassius offers him a water bottle. Malcolm accepts, averts 
           his eyes from the tree. Cassius sees it. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Cassius stands over the boys as they hold plank position. A 
           LONG beat. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...down. 

           The boys do a push-up. Then hold their planks again. Cassius 
           looks down on them. 

           Their arms squirming with the effort... 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (holding)
                        ...rest. 

           The boys drop, face down into the dirt. They breathe, heavy 
           and deep. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           The boys fill bottles and drink. Mandela splashes his face. 
           Cassius stands behind. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (watching)
                        I’m going out again. Tonight.  

           Malcolm rises. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Alone? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Safest way. Be back before the 
                        hunt. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        “Safest”. 
                                 CASSIUS
                            (cutting him a glance)
                        ...ain’t no place out there for 
                        black boys. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...but it’s ok for you? 

           Cassius stares into him. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Finish up. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Early light. Malcolm stands near the front of the cabin 
           looking out into the woods. Mandela emerges from inside, 
           rubbing his eyes sleepily. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Where’s daddy? 

           Malcolm just stares out into the trees. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Supposed to be back by now. 

           Malcolm nods, concerned. Mandela sits in the dirt next to 
           him. 

           A BEAT. 

           Cassius appears, emerging from the trees with a trail pack on 
           his shoulders. 

           Mandela stands and moves to him. 

           Malcolm SIGHS, relieved. Follows.

           EXT. TIP-UP MOUND - DAY

           A large fallen ASH TREE. The root system has been ripped up, 
           forming a wall of dirt, roots and rock. A lean-to has been 
           built up against it. 

           ...and a pair of legs poke out. 

           INT. LEAN-TO - CONTINUOUS

           Mandela is lying down inside. Laid out on the ground above 
           his head -- A tarnished silver compass. A plastic hairbrush. 
           A weathered copy of a book about Anansi the legendary spider 
           spirit. A simple gold band. 

           Mandela plays with the compass a moment, in his own world. 

           He takes the book, reads a hand written note on the inside. 
           Lingering on the cursive. 

           For whatever reason, he beams. 

                                 MALCOLM (O.S.)
                        Man-man! 

           Mandela gathers the items, shoves them into an old leather 
           purse, pushes them into the back of the lean-to. 

           EXT. TIP-UP MOUND - DAY

           Mandela crawls out of the shelter. He runs up over a ridge, 
           finds Malcolm calling, looking in another direction. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Hey. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We gotta hunt. 

           Mandela nods, sweating a bit. Malcolm notes it. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        You ok? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Yes... I’m... just not good at it. 
                        Not like you. 

           Malcolm considers it. Softens. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Know what dad says? 

                                 MANDELA
                        “...it’s called hunting, not 
                        killing..” 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding, smiles)
                        You’ll get better. Come on. 

           Mandela walks ahead, Malcolm looks back where the boy came 
           from. 
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela follow Cassius. He carries a shotgun, 
           slung over a shoulder. 

           Malcolm carries a recurve bow. 

           He reaches a fork in the path. Nods to one direction. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Take that side. 

           He turns back to face the boys. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Check the snares. Check your 
                        targets. Don’t cross “the line”. 
                        Back by sunset. 

           The boys nod. He lingers on that last bit. He walks away from 
           them. Malcolm watches, turns back to Mandela. 

           EXT. RIDGE - LATER

           Mandela lays on the ground, staring out at the clearing 
           below. 

           Malcolm leans against a tree, bored. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Nothing out here. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You gotta be patient. 

           LEAVES CRUNCH softly below. Mandela looks up. Reverse to find 
           a young BUCK wandering casually through the path. He stops to 
           snack at a berry bush. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (whispered)
                        Hey. 

           Malcolm shifts to his feet. Moves to his brother. He SMILES. 
           Rubs Mandela’s head. The younger boy grins. 

           Malcolm stands, raising his bow, sets his sights low, aiming 
           for the Buck’s heart. 

           He pulls the string taut. Breathes in. Mandela shifts, 
           SNAPPING a stick. The animal turns on the sound. 

           Malcolm let’s it FLY-- 
           But the Buck is already spooked. The creature disappears into 
           the woods. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Damn it. 

           He kicks the leaves.

           Malcolm hustles down the ridge, Mandela follows. 

           EXT. DEER TRAIL - DAY

           The sun dropping low. 

           Malcolm walks, searching for tracks. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Are we going the right way? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (not looking up)
                        ...saw a deer bed a while back... 
                        stream leads up this direction. 
                        He’ll be around.

           Mandela nods. They walk further. Malcolm stops, he sees a 
           thicket ahead. The brush is turn and drooping. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        There! He must’ve come this way. 

           Malcolm starts forward, Mandela pulls him back. He points up 
           to thick tree trunk at their flank. 

           There is a large white “X” spray painted on the tree. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...forget about it.  

           Malcolm stares at it, willing himself to move. Malcolm looks 
           back at his brother. Then turns around, heads back the way 
           they came. 

           Mandela follows. 

           EXT. WOODS - FORK - DAY

           The sun dropping low in the sky. 

           The meeting spot. Malcolm and Mandela waiting for Cassius. 
           Malcolm sits against a thick tree. 
                                 MANDELA
                        There he is... 

           Malcolm stands, spots Cassius walking down the path. He has a 
           half dozen or so dead squirrels strung together on a line. 

           He stops near the boys. Lays his kills on the ground. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (stretching, looking)
                        Nothing? 

           The boys exchange looks. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        The traps? 

           Mandela dithers. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We didn’t check. 

           BEAT. Cassius drinks water from a tin bottle.

                                 CASSIUS
                            (shaking his head)
                        ...and if I hadn’t caught anything? 

                                 MANDELA
                        --He almost had a buck. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Almost? 
                            (gloating)
                        ...Can’t eat ‘almost’.

           Mandela looks at his feet. 

                                 MANDELA
                        I--

                                 MALCOLM
                        I scared it off. Too loud. Before 
                        the shot. 

           Cassius nods, superior.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Would’ve had him, but he went past 
                        the tree line.

           Cassius whips around. Closes in on him.   
                                 CASSIUS
                            (eye to eye)
                        Then what? You gon’ ask him to 
                        stand still for a second shot? 

                                 MANDELA
                        --it’s getting dark. 

           A BEAT. Cassius backs off. He spits in the dirt. Grabs his 
           water bottle. Turns back for home. Thinks better of it. 

           He moves back to the pile of dead squirrels, picks them up. 

           SHOVES them into Malcolm’s chest. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You don’t kill, you carry. 

           Malcolm catches them. Stands there holding the kill. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The interior of the cabin is austere. Three small bedrooms. A 
           cramped kitchen. A living room anchored by a stone hearth. 

           Furniture is mismatched, discolored. The few appliances are 
           tarnished. Tin teapot, cast iron pots and pans. 

           Noticeably, no TV, no laptop, no modern tech. 

           Mandela stirs a pot of stew as Malcolm leans against a 
           cabinet. Mandela scoops out a spoon full, tastes it.  

                                 MANDELA
                        Can you give me the salt? 

           Malcolm hands him a nearby shaker. Mandela sprinkles up high, 
           slowly mixing it in. 

           His movements are practiced, skilled. There is pride in it. 

           Malcolm watches. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        You wanna taste?

                                 MALCOLM
                            (trying it, pleased)
                        How you know what to put in there? 

           Mandela smiles, shrugs. 
                                 MANDELA
                        Practice. You might get better if 
                        you practice...  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I don’t wanna get better at this. 

           Mandela looks away, offended. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Hey... I mean--

           Cassius enters. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        How is it? 

           Mandela nods toward the pot Cassius scoops up a spoonful. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Mm-mm. That is good. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (beaming)
                        I picked the potatoes and onions. 

           Cassius takes another spoon. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Mm. You got a gift son. Your 
                        grandma used to make squirrel like 
                        this. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Really? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Close my eyes, could be her recipe. 

           Mandela seems to bloom from the praise. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Is it good as mom’s? 

           Malcolm suddenly stands erect. Cassius puts the spoon down. 

           Mandela shrinks. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...you boys set the table.

           Cassius walks out. 
           INT. CABIN - LATER

           Malcolm, Cassius, and Mandela eat stew at the table. A pall 
           over the meal. 

           Only the sounds of SPOONS on bowls. Cassius rips into a piece 
           of bread. 

           INT. CABIN - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Malcolm and Cassius play dominos. Mandela reads a book across 
           the room. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (playing a domino)
                        How’s that bow? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Pullin fine. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Hard to hunt recurve. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Can you get me a gun? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...you’re gettin’ better, but you 
                        ain’t ready for that.  

           Malcolm nods, plays. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (baiting him)
                        Master the little things. Start by 
                        not spooking your dinner. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (cringing)
                        Yeah. 

           A BEAT. Cassius nods. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Stickin’ with that story?

           Malcolm tries to interject. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (silencing him)
                        Good. Looking out for your brother. 
                        I can respect that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        But you oughtta remember-- sooner 
                        or later, everybody’s gotta walk 
                        alone. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Like you... and the raids. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (nodding)
                        You do what you have to for your 
                        people. Family. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (deliberately)
                        Even if you gotta leave the woods?

                                 CASSIUS
                            (intuiting)
                        The tree line? That’s different. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You know why. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I never been out there... just 
                        wanna see for myself.   

           A BEAT. Cassius nods, Malcolm has his point. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (final)
                        One day you might get your wish. 
                        When I’m gone. You’ll see... ain’t 
                        nothing out there for you, boy. 

           INT. CABIN - MALCOLM’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Not much decoration save for the hunting bow, hung 
           prominently on a wall. 

           Malcolm in bed, fast asleep. 

           He JOLTS awake. Cassius is sitting on the foot of the bed. He 
           admires the bow. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I gotta go back. 

           Malcolm is still groggy. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        Hm? 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (turning to him)
                        I’m going out again. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (sitting up)
                        Why? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Storm coming. Big one. It’ll scare 
                        away the game. Maybe overflow the 
                        stream.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...the garden... 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (shaking his head)
                        Floods would wash it away. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        This is two times. In just a week. 
                        And it’s almost dawn... 

           Cassius searches for an answer. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...look after your brother. I’ll be 
                        back. 

           Malcolm suppresses the urge to want him to stay.  Cassius 
           gets up, heads out. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela go through their routine. Malcolm CHOPS. 
           Mandela tends the garden. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm leads Mandela, running the trail. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Malcolm COUNTS OFF push-ups. Mandela struggles. They rest. 
           Malcolm looks up, the sun is high, the day running away.
           INT. LEAN-TO - DAY

           Mandela reads the Anansi book. 

           EXT. LEAN-TO - DAY

           PULL BACK to find Malcolm watching. He’s discovered his 
           brother’s hide away. He starts toward Mandela, thinks better 
           of it. He turns back toward the cabin. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Mandela cooks dinner, Malcolm sets the table. 

           The rumbling of THUNDER brings to--

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Malcolm peeking out, up at the sky. Clouds gathering. Mandela 
           nudges him from behind. Malcolm nods. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Time to get some sleep. 

           INT. CABIN - VARIOUS - LATER

           The storm RAGES outside. The cabin is still. 

           Mandela lies awake in his room. 

           Malcolm sits up on his bed. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           The earth is muddy and damp. Leaves full and green. Malcolm 
           toys with his bow string, more nerves than purpose. 

           He perks at the sound of COUGHING. 

           Malcolm turns back to find Cassius dragging himself toward 
           the side of the house. He’s WHEEZING, wet, and his leg is CUT 
           and BLEEDING. 

           Malcolm hesitates, the sight is shocking. Cassius collapses. 

           Malcolm races to him. 
                                 MALCOLM
                            (hoisting Cassius)
                        Mandela! MANDELA! 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           The door flies open. Malcolm helps Cassius to his room. Lays 
           him down. 

           Cassius MOANS through each motion. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Where the hell is your broth-- AH!

           Malcolm looks down at the leg, a bloody mess. 

           Mandela races in. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad?

                                 MALCOLM
                        He’s hurt...

           Mandela looks over it, suddenly alive. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        He’s been out there all night... 
                        went to get some supplies... 

                                 MANDELA
                        Get some water. 

           Malcolm freezes up. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                            (grabbing him)
                        We have to clean it. Get some warm 
                        water, and towels. 

           Malcolm heads to the kitchen. Mandela heads to his room. He 
           returns with a small plastic first aid case. 

           Malcolm comes in with towels. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Lift up his leg... 

           Malcolm lifts it. Cassius SCREAMS. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Put it down, put it down... 
           Mandela feels Cassius’ head, gingerly slips his boot off. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        It might be broken. He’s running a 
                        fever. Might be in shock. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What does that mean? 

                                 MANDELA
                        He’ll be ok. We just gotta clean 
                        it, set it--

                                 CASSIUS
                            (sweating, pained)
                        ...where... where were you? 

           Mandela dithers. Cassius sits up. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Hm? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        --I sent him to check the wires. 
                        Set new snares before the rain...

           Cassius looks to Mandela. After a moment, he lays back, 
           closing his eyes. Slowing his breath. Mandela stares. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Hey. What’s next? 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...the water. 

           Malcolm heads out. 

           INT. CABIN - CASSIUS’ ROOM - LATER

           Cassius is resting. Mandela sits by his side. Refreshes a 
           towel on his head. 

           The leg is now wrapped and splinted. 

           Malcolm enters. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (looking Cassius over)
                        Will it heal? 

                                 MANDELA 
                        I think so. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        He looks... weak. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Fever is breaking. He should eat. 
                        Something hot. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I got some lunch ready. 

           Cassius stirs.

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad... don’t move too much. 

           Mandela reaches out with a few aspirin. Cassius bats it away. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...don’t want that... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Here... drink. 

           Malcolm holds a glass of water to his lips. Cassius drinks, 
           slowly. 

           Mandela watches them, soaking in their rapport.

           Wishing. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...I wanna tell you somethin... 

                                 MANDELA
                        What is it? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I wanna tell him somethin...

           Mandela is struck. He stands, leaves. Malcolm watches. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (wincing)
                        GODDAMN IT. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You can’t move so much... 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...i’m gonna be out for a while...

                                 MALCOLM
                        We’ve been doing everything like 
                        normal... we’ll be ok. 
                                 CASSIUS
                        I-I should’ve told you before... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We can hunt and--

                                 CASSIUS
                        NO. LISTEN to me.   

           Cassius grabs his son, a sudden energy. Malcolm is all ears. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Train, work. Look out for each 
                        other. Always. But... 
                        White men... they won’t hesitate, 
                        son. They’ll kill you. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Out there... survival. War.   

           Malcolm sits, the weight of it leveling on him. Cassius lies 
           back. 

           Just outside the room, Mandela is eavesdropping. 

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           Malcolm thumbs through the cupboards, all but bare. No food. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela stand over the remnant of the garden. The 
           plants and vines ripped and scattered. 

           Mandela stoops down to examine the damage. 

                                 MANDELA
                        The roots were too shallow, season 
                        barely started. 

           Malcolm shakes his head. Looks off into the woods. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Pft. If this was winter we’d have 
                        something saved. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad can’t hunt. Not on that leg. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        None of us’ll last more than a few 
                        days without food. 

           Malcolm gives his brother a look. 

                                 MANDELA
                        He doesn’t want us to go... it’ll 
                        be more dangerous without him. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        So you won’t. I’ll go alone. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Malc--

                                 MALCOLM
                        We need food. Unless you can grow a 
                        crop in three days... I’ll go. You 
                        stay. Look after dad. 

           Mandela doesn’t like it, but they don’t have a choice. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Malcolm approaches the water, his father’s rifle slung over 
           his shoulder. He wears a backpack, fills a bottle with water, 
           takes a long drink as he stares up the path. 

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Malcolm moves through the woods, following the stream bed. 
           The trees now looking unfamiliar, even threatening. 

           He finds a hill, lays prone, rifle at his side. 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Mandela cares for Cassius, floating in an out of 
           consciousness. Giving his father the last bits of food in the 
           house.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm all but asleep, clutching the rifle. RUSTLING, off-
           screen. He lifts his head, spots a DOE near the bank of the 
           stream. 

           SLOWLY, he positions the rifle, lying prone, taking aim. 
           The Doe lifts her head, ears pent. 

           Malcolm takes a breath, pulls the trigger--

           BLAM. 

           He stands, the Doe ROCKETS for the trees. Malcolm curses, 
           watches her go. 

           He heads down to the stream. Stops. 

           Bends down, grabs a leaf. 

           It’s SPRAYED with hot red blood. He’s hit her. 

           Malcolm is buoyed. 

           EXT. DEER TRAIL - LATER

           Malcolm stalks his prey. Moving slowly, his rifle raised. 
           Something familiar to him about this stretch... 

           He stops. Finds BLOOD on the trunk of a Maple. 

           Then looks up to see the same white X emblazoned on a nearby 
           tree. He stares for a moment, dithering, deciding. Finally, 
           he shakes his head. 

           Takes off the backpack, reveals a very long rope. He takes it 
           out, ties it to the bloody tree. 

           Resolved, he stomps past the blood and the blaze. 

           He’s going after the deer. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

           Malcolm steps into a barren area. A strong storm has passed 
           through. It’s wet and skeletal. The trees left standing are 
           leafless below the forest canopy. 

           He spots the Doe, motionless by a sloping hill. It’s bled 
           out.  

           He approaches. Stands over it. A BEAT. He pulls the large 
           wood-chopping knife. 

           Hesitates. 

           He shakes his head, clearing it. Kneels, JABS the blade into 
           the earth nearby. 
           Grabs the rope, ties it around the deer’s hind legs. 

           He picks up the knife again. 

           Raises it. JABS it into the doe--

           A WEAK MOAN... a RUSTLING in the leaves... and Malcolm 
           stumbles back, tripping onto his butt. He scrambles to grab 
           his rifle. 

           He aims at the doe... it’s lifeless. 

           Swallows, stands. 

           He looks around. Spots something. Moves to it. Across the 
           desolate space. More and more certainty in his stride. He’s 
           sure of it... Suddenly he comes to a stop. 

           WIDE as we see what he’s been looking at-- 

           A spindly WHITE GIRL, 15, apple-cheeked and battered by the 
           elements. Her breaths are labored. She’s been out here a long 
           time, but she won’t last much longer. 

           Malcolm stares a long while... he’s never seen a woman in 
           person... much less... a white woman. 

           His mind races. 

           He lowers his head, turns to go... she’s not his problem...

           The Girl COUGHS. Shivers, nearly convulsing. 

           After a moment, fighting himself, looks back at her. Moves to 
           the doe, rips the blade out. 

           He moves back to the girl, hangs there. Grips the blade, 
           staring at her. Pats the sheath on his palm, smearing the 
           blood, and presses his hand against the tree above her. 

           Takes off his jacket, lays it over her. He retrieves his 
           backpack, takes out the water bottle -- considering. He lays 
           the bag by her side. 

           Covers her in leaves. 

           He moves back to the doe, never taking his eyes off the girl, 
           begins to gut the carcass. 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           The Sun nearly gone. 
           Mandela spots Malcolm approaching the cabin, dragging the 
           dear behind him. He sweats, every muscle aching. 

           He stops a good distance from the house. 

           Mandela comes out, marveling. 

           Malcolm drops into the dirt, spent.  

                                 MANDELA 
                        HA! Dad’s gonna go crazy! A whole 
                        deer!

           Malcolm GASPS. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        W-Water.

           Mandela races inside comes back with a bottle.  

                                 MANDELA
                        Long as you were out, I knew you 
                        had to find something out there... 

           Malcolm gulps down his water, looks back at the trees, his 
           mind on the girl.

           Mandela finally sees the distance in his brother’s gaze. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Malcolm? 

           Malcolm looks up. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your pack? And your jacket? 

           Malcolm gulps the last of the water. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding to the doe)
                        ...we gotta... string her up. 

           Mandela stares at Malcolm, the older brother still huffing. 
           Malcolm stands moves back to the cabin. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Something happened? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I went past the mark. 

           Mandela rises. 
                                 MANDELA
                        ...What? Why? What did you see?

           Cassius CALLS from inside. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Not now.

           Mandela doesn’t budge. Malcolm relents. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll show. I swear. But not now... 
                        not him... And. I need your help. 

           Cassius YELLS again. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (nodding)
                        Ok. 

           Mandela moves back to the house. Malcolm stands alone with 
           the carcass. 

           PRE-LAP, the sound of CRACKLING WOOD-- 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           A campfire blazing. Mandela tends it. Malcolm helps Cassius 
           lope to the door. 

           Cassius, still fevered, looks out past the fire. 

           The doe is flayed at the breastbone, strung up over a heavy 
           branch by it’s feet. 

           Cassius pushes off of Malcolm, leans against the door jamb. 
           He admires the dead animal. He looks back at Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...I... went out. We needed the 
                        meat.

           A BEAT. Cassius looking over his son. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Good kill. 

           Malcolm nods, miles away. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        You field dress her? Drag her all 
                        the way here? 
           More nods.  

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (impressed)
                        Coyotes’ll come round soon. 
                        Merciful thing. Better than leavin’
                        her out there. Alright. Get on with 
                        it. 

           Mandela hands Malcolm a knife, a knowing look between them. 
           Malcolm stands before the hollowed deer. 

           He starts to STRIP her hide. 

           Mandela looks away.

           INT. CABIN -- DAY

           Morning. Mandela and Malcolm lace shoes, prep for a hike. 
           They take pains to be silent. 

           Malcolm moves for the door. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Barely sunrise. 

           Mandela turns to see Cassius, reclined on the couch, groggy. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Where you going this early?

                                 MALCOLM
                        You were right. I heard coyotes 
                        last night. From the doe. We’ve 
                        gotta move the hide and the guts... 

           Cassius looks toward Mandela, who is clearly uncomfortable. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I’m bringing him. So he can see how 
                        to do it. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (satisfied, fading)
                        Don’t take too long. Still got 
                        training...

                                 MALCOLM
                        We won’t. 

           Malcolm heads out. Mandela still sweating, follows. 
           EXT. WOODS - DAY 

           Malcolm and Mandela hike the path toward the girl. They reach 
           the mark.

                                 MALCOLM
                        There. I came in right under the 
                        sign. 

           He starts past, stops. Turns back. Malcolm is frozen on the 
           path, kicks the dirt. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 MANDELA
                        I don’t know... Dad says--

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad says a lot of things.

                                 MANDELA
                        You’re saying he’s a liar? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No... But... maybe he doesn’t know 
                        everything. 

           Mandela shakes this off.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        So how you know there’s not a whole 
                        other world out there? Other kids 
                        like you? Or other cabins?

                                 MANDELA
                        I like our cabin. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I know. But, where do you think he 
                        goes? And why not ever bring us? 

                                 MANDELA
                        You know it’s dangerous. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s dangerous in here too, more, 
                        cuz you don’t see it. 

           Mandela SCOFFS. 
                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        But maybe there’s something out 
                        there besides that. Don’t you wanna 
                        know? 

           Malcolm turns, walks past the boundary. He turns back, 
           gesturing to his brother. See, I’m fine.

           Mandela hangs there a moment, then follows. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela step into the clearing. Mandela marveling 
           at the desolation of it. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        How come... the other trees? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Sometimes small storms are worse 
                        than the big ones.

           Malcolm searches for the blood marked trunk. He spots it, 
           approaches, but there is no sign of the girl. 

           His jacket lays on the ground. His backpack emptied. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (approaching)
                        What happened? You leave it? 
                        Wolves? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...a girl. A... woman. She was 
                        right here. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (struck)
                        Like mom? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No. She was white. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Her skin? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Yes. Mostly yeah. Kinda pink. 
                        Must’ve been out here for a while. 
                        Maybe two days. Looked sick.

                                 MANDELA
                        Maybe the wolves got her. 
                                 MALCOLM
                            (searching, moving)
                        No blood. 

                                 MANDELA
                        So maybe she left. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        She was in bad shape. 

                                 MANDELA
                        So... ok. Where is she? 

           Malcolm doesn’t answer, he searches. 

           Mandela stands over the spot where she was found. Something 
           pulling his gaze. He squats down. 

           A small CIRCULAR EMBLEM, half-covered in dirt. A PATCH-- 

           A White Wolf with open jaws. Lightning bolts on either side 
           of it’s face. The animal’s eyes are sharp and cruel.  
           Something... Terrifying in it.  

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Malcolm...

           Malcolm turns-- in a flash The White Girl SPRINGS from behind 
           a tree SNATCHES Malcolm into a hold, presses a sharp rock to 
           his neck. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...shit! 

                                 MANDELA
                        MALCOLM! 

           She squeezes tight, coiling her arm around Malcolm’s neck. 
           Her eyes are feral. She grits her teeth, HISSES at Mandela.  

           Malcolm looks down, notices she’s still favoring a dark, 
           bloody gash on her side. She sees it, frantic, yanks at him. 

           Mandela picks up a rock, approaches. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (choking)
                        Stop. 

                                 MANDELA
                        What? NO! 

                                 MALCOLM
                        STAY BACK. Man-man. She’s scared. 
           Mandela freezes. Eyes fixed on the girl. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (slowly)
                        Is that right? You’re scared? 

           She never takes her eyes off Mandela. Pulls back. Mandela 
           closes again. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Stop it. Stop. I found you 
                        freezing. Hurt. I gave you the 
                        jacket, and the water and food. 

           The White Girl considers this, shakes it away. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I wanna help you... that’s why we 
                        came back. 

           Mandela cuts his eyes at Malcolm. 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Bullshit. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s true... I found you. I want to 
                        help you... I swear. ...I swear on 
                        my mother.  

           This seems to strike a chord. She casts a sidelong glance at 
           Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        My brother can help fix you up... I 
                        can build you a fire. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        Malcolm--

                                 MALCOLM
                        Man-man. Put that down. 

           Mandela stares at The White Girl, anger in his eyes. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        MANDELA! 

           Mandela tosses the rock away. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (to the White Girl)
                        There. See? 
           She gives Mandela one more look, releases Malcolm. He grips 
           his throat, catching his breath. 

           Mandela races to his side. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        Are you ok? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding)
                        I’m fine. 

           Malcolm stands, Mandela still seething. They both look back 
           to the White Girl. She stands against tree, still clutching 
           the rock. 

           She no longer masks the pain of her injury, clutching her 
           side, barely standing. 

           Malcolm steps toward her, fearless. Mandela follows. 

           She swells, points her makeshift blade. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (stopping)
                        That looks bad... 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                            (never dropping her eyes)
                        Make the fire. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - LATER

           Malcolm puts another branch on the fire. He sits back down 
           next to Mandela. Stares across the fire at the White Girl. 

           She still clutches her rock, further away from the flames. 
           Malcolm’s jacket on her shoulders. She searches the ground 
           frantically for... something-- 

           Mandela watches as well. He thumbs the Wolf emblem in his 
           palm, suspicious.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        How you think she got here? 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...when is she leaving?

           Malcolm looks to Mandela. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        She’s probably lost... We gotta 
                        help her. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (incredulous)
                        No we don’t. She tried to stab 
                        you...  

                                 MALCOLM
                        What would you do if you woke up 
                        with two strangers standing over 
                        you? 

                                 MANDELA
                        She’s the stranger. She shouldn’t 
                        be out here.

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’re scared?  

                                 MANDELA
                        No.

                                 MALCOLM
                        You are. Cuz daddy says so. All 
                        white folks are dangerous. Well... 
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Mal... She tried to kill you. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding)
                        --she didn’t know me then, though. 

           He moves to the other side of the fire, the White Girl 
           tenses. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        You don’t wanna move closer? 

           No answer. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need to stay warm. Get some 
                        sleep. Tomorrow, I can come back 
                        with some medicine, maybe some 
                        bandages. My brother’s better with 
                        that stuff, but... he’s... shy. 

           Mandela stares daggers at the White Girl from across the 
           flames. 
                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. Just... stay warm. We 
                        gathered plenty of wood. Should 
                        last through the night. There’s a 
                        stream on the other side of the 
                        clearing. Water’s clean. 

           He turns to leave. She shifts to her feet. Malcolm turns 
           back. She doesn’t want him to go. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll come back tomorrow. Promise. 

           She looks him over a moment, then extends the jacket. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (shaking his head)
                        Keep it. It’ll be cold tonight. 
                        I’ll try to sneak some blankets. 

           She nods to him. Malcolm SMILES. He walks back to Mandela, 
           takes his pack, the boys head out. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Cassius eats dinner, laid out on the couch. The boys sit in a 
           chair and on the floor. 

           Cassius alternates biting and wincing from his leg.

           Finally, sets the plate aside, trying to find comfort. His 
           eyes on the boys, separated. All too quiet. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (leaning back)
                        ...what I miss? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Hm? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I’m laid up here like an invalid. I 
                        want to know what’s happening 
                        outside. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Nothing. 

           Cassius weighs it out. Looks to Mandela. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        What did your brother teach you 
                        today? 
           Mandela looks to Malcolm, Cassius spots it. Sits up. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Same th--

                                 CASSIUS
                            (eyes on Mandela)
                        I’m asking him. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...we just... did the normal stuff. 

           A BEAT. Cassius, mulling this.  

                                 CASSIUS
                        Stuff.  

                                 MANDELA
                        Yeah. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Training. Running. Cooking. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        That all? 

                                 MANDELA
                            (wary)
                        Yes. Dad. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...okay. 

           The boys go back to eating, trying hard not to look guilty. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        And... getting rid of the guts. 

           Malcolm SPUTTERS, drops his fork. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Yes.  

                                 CASSIUS
                        You forgot that. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        --he didn’t touch them. I just 
                        showed him where to put it all.
                            (to Mandela, leading)
                        Remember? 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...by... the stream. 
           The stream near the White Girl. Malcolm didn’t expect that. 
           Mandela looks back to his food. 

           Malcolm watches a beat longer, then looks purposefully away 
           at his plate. 

                                 CASSIUS
                         Good and far. 

           Neither boy looks up. Cassius can see the daylight between 
           them. 

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           The boys clean the dishes, Cassius in his bedroom, SNORING. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (drying a plate)
                        ...you had to say the stream? 

                                 MANDELA
                        No. I could’ve said the clearing. 

           Malcolm turns Mandela around by the arm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What’s your problem? 

                                 MANDELA
                            (shrugging)
                        Nothing... 

           SILENCE. 

           Malcolm, exhausted with it. Mandela goes back to the dishes. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        She’s out there alone. I just... I 
                        want to help her stay alive.  

                                 MANDELA
                        And hear what else is out there 
                        while you’re doing it?

                                 MALCOLM
                        What’s wrong with that? 

                                 MANDELA
                        What’s wrong with here? 

           Mandela, more stung than he thought, shakes his head. Goes 
           back to the dishes. 
                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Know what’s coming up?
                            (off the silence)
                        Momma’s birthday. 

           Malcolm swims in thought. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I just want to see it, Man. I 
                        wasn’t gonna leave. I’m not 
                        leaving. 

           SILENCE. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        She’s hurt now. But you saw her. 
                        Just a few scrapes. In a couple 
                        days she could hike. Less than a 
                        week. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Then she’ll be gone?

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...then it’ll be just us. Before 
                        mom’s birthday. We can still have 
                        our thing. If you help me... 

           Mandela stops, hands dripping. 

                                 MANDELA
                        You swear? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Swear. 

           Mandela smiles, nods to his brother. Malcolm rubs his head. 
           They go back to their work. 

           INT. CABIN - CASSIUS’ ROOM - SAME MOMENT

           Cassius, breathing heavily, awake. Who knows what he’s heard. 

           EXT. WOODS - FORK - DAY

           Malcolm approaches The White Girl, who is barely standing, 
           wincing with every step.  

           He looks around quickly, then races to her side. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What are you doing out here? 
           He moves to help her to her feet. She shoves him away. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name? 

           She looks at him, then away. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I’m Malcolm. 

           She barely acknowledges this. 

           She struggles, gulp breaths through the pain. Malcolm just 
           hangs there watching. Even in pain, dirty and frustrated he 
           can see--

           She’s pretty. 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                            (noticing his look)
                        What? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Huh? 

           Finally to her feet, she leans toward him. Opens her eyes 
           wide, cartoonishly. Mocking.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (quickly)
                        I’m not staring. I’m looking. 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Why? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I’ve never seen a girl... like you 
                        before.

           Malcolm looks away, evading.  

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Where are we? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        The woods. 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        I mean... What’s close to here? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Don’t know. 

           She looks through him a minute, puzzled by this. 
                                 WHITE GIRL
                        You got... clean clothes, you don’t 
                        sleep out here. Where do you go? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Home. But... I grew up here. I 
                        don’t know that much about any 
                        other woods... 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Much? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Nothing.

                                 WHITE GIRL
                            (Final)
                        Shit.  

           A BEAT. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Where’s your home? 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Nowhere close to yours. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’re lost... Where were you 
                        going? 

           She shields her wound, favoring her side. 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        Hm? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        When you got lost? 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                            (hesitating)
                        ...I was with my Dad. Storm kicked 
                        up. I bumped my head. That’s all.  

           Malcolm considers this, an odd story.   

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s not safe out here. You gotta 
                        stay off the trail. 
                            (sudden)
                        Oh! You need a shelter. 
                                 WHITE GIRL
                            (wary)
                        Why?  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I wanna help. And... I wanna see 
                        where you come from.  

           She looks him over, measuring. 

           PRE-LAP, Cassius SCREAMS in pain... 

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           Cassius grips a ratty couch cushion, racked with pain. 
           Mandela is attempting to clean his leg wound. 

                                 MANDELA
                        --it’ll get infected. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        FUCK! 

           Malcolm enters. Cassius shoves Mandela to the ground hard, 
           overcome by pain. 

           Mandela gets up, some hint of defiance in him. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (to Malcolm)
                        He’s gotta sit still. If it get’s 
                        infected he could lose it...

           Cassius catches his breath, sweating hard on the couch, every 
           move seeming to pain him. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                            (sotto)
                        See? It’s getting worse. He needs 
                        medicine. His cut is dirty and it 
                        needs to close.

                                 MALCOLM
                        What can we do? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Hold him. 

           Mandela looking up at Malcolm. In unison, the brothers dive 
           on top of Cassius, Malcolm weighing down his torso. Mandela 
           pouring VODKA on his open leg wound. 
           Cassius BUCKS, CURSES and SCREAMS. The boys struggle to hold 
           as Mandela splashes the bottle onto the gash. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                            That’s it!

           Finally, Malcolm relents, a second before Mandela. Cassius 
           kicks the younger boy away. Malcolm helps him up. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You pour liquor on my goddamn leg?! 

                                 MANDELA
                        We don’t have anything else.  

                                 CASSIUS
                            (raging, reeling)
                        Fuck... FUCK. Don’t EVER do that--

           Malcolm stands in front of Mandela. Cassius tries to get off 
           the couch, but the pain is too great. 

           Malcolm watches a moment. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (not turning away)
                        The leg? 

                                 MANDELA
                        I... I don’t know... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Man-man. Hey. Look at me. 

           Mandela does. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        The leg? 

                                 MANDELA
                            (eyes on the wound)
                        It’s better. The liquor kills the 
                        germs, but it won’t close... not by 
                        itself. W-we need guaze and... I 
                        don’t know maybe he needs stitches 
                        Malcolm.

           Cassius GRUNTS, lunges again. Malcolm shoves Mandela out of 
           the way. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        --too soft to be a fucking nurse?  
           Mandela scrambles to his feet. He’s fuming, caught between 
           rage and tears. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Get the gauze.  

           Mandela runs outside.

                                 CASSIUS
                            (growling)
                        Get me some aspirin or something... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We don’t have it. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        In the cabinet. Got it last time I 
                        left...

           Malcolm moves to the kitchen, searches the cupboards. 
           Finally, finds a bottle of painkillers. 

           He moves to the fridge, pours water into a mug. Hands the 
           water and pills to Cassius. 

           Cassius gulps them down. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (looking out the door)
                        He’s trying to look out for you.  

           Cassius looks Malcolm up and down. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        One leg under me and he’s still 
                        trembling. 

           Malcolm frowns. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        And you? Can’t stand up, so you 
                        stand in for him. 

           Cassius gulps a few more pills. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t the one needs looking out 
                        for... Soon as I get back on this 
                        leg. You’ll see. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’re tired. 
                                 CASSIUS
                            (drifting)
                        Heh. Yeah. 

           Malcolm turns to go. 

                                 CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You get to those snares yet? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (whipping around)
                        What? 

           ...But Cassius is out. Malcolm watches him for long minute, 
           then runs off.  

           EXT. TIP-UP MOUND - DAY

           Malcolm moves through the trees toward Mandela’s hideaway. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (calling)
                        Man-man. 

           No answer. 

           Malcolm reaches the lean-to. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Mandela. 

           Not even a rustle. Finally, a WHIMPER. Malcolm sits down, 
           next to the mound. 

           The WHIMPERS morph into soft SOBS. 

           Malcolm plays with leaves on the ground, uncomfortable. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t mean none of that. He’s 
                        just hurtin’... You know? 

                                 MANDELA (O.C.)
                            (muffled, from inside)
                        Mm huh. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You comin out? 

                                 MANDELA 
                            (softly)
                        No. 
           Malcolm SIGHS. Rolls to his hands and knees, crawls toward 
           the shelter, inside. He lays on his side as Mandela huddles 
           in the back of the space. 

           He wipes at his tears. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You built all this? 

                                 MANDELA
                        I’m not useless... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        --I know. I know you’re not. 

                                 MANDELA
                        How’d you find me? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I followed you here a while ago... 
                        We’re brothers. You don’t need 
                        secrets from me.  

           Mandela looks away. Busies himself with the same items from 
           before. Malcolm watches him. 

           Mandela singles out the book. He reads and re-reads his 
           mother’s journal. 

           Malcolm sees the words. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I thought all her stuff was gone.

                                 MANDELA
                        I only have a few things. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        She write that? 

           Mandela nods. 

           SILENCE falls, the boys reveling in thoughts of their mom. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Do... you miss her? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (mulling)
                        I don’t know. 

                                 MANDELA
                        I miss her. 
                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding)
                        Things would be different. Dad 
                        would be different. 

           Mandela starts to tear up. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Hey. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (looking up)
                        Hm? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I won’t leave you alone like that 
                        again. With him.    

           Mandela nods, not totally convinced. Malcolm sits up, about 
           faces to crawl out. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Dry your eyes, and come on back. We 
                        got training today.  

           He moves to leave--

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (touching a branch)
                        You did a good job here. 

                                 MANDELA
                        You won’t tell him about this? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No, I won’t.  

           He crawls out. Mandela thumbs the pages of his mother’s book. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela run the trails, again. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm spars with Mandela, the older wearing training mitts. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Malcolm demonstrates the recurve bow to Mandela. Sinks a shot 
           into a tree. 
           Mandela takes the bow, apprehensive and awkward. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela gather water in buckets. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm and Mandela work the garden. Malcolm repairs the 
           fence and wire. Mandela turns the earth with a hoe. 

           They spread seeds in new rows. 

           Mandela pats the earth flat, he’s happy. Malcolm stands proud 
           over him. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           CRICKETS and the CRACKLE of a tiny fire in the hearth. 

           Malcolm and Mandela sit on the floor. Mandela stretched out 
           on a rug. Malcolm clutching his knees near the fire. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...you know momma used to call you 
                        Doctor? 

           Mandela perks up.

                                 MANDELA
                        Doctor? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Yep. Sometimes Dad used to let it 
                        slip. For the first few years. Then 
                        he stopped. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (barbed)
                        He never talks about her. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He don’t know how. 

           Mandela considers this. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Why did she call me that? 
                                 MALCOLM
                        She thought you were gonna be that. 
                        You’d help people. Can’t be nothing 
                        in here your whole life.

           Mandela YAWNS. 

                                 MANDELA
                        What else? 

           Malcolm looks away. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (distant)
                        She loved us. Wanted us to have a 
                        good life. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Mom was really smart right? 

           Mandela hungers for this, like a baby bird. This is routine, 
           but still he yearns for it. He looks up at Malcolm, hopeful.   

                                 MALCOLM
                            (uncertain)
                        Yeah. And she was beautiful. And 
                        everybody loved her.

                                 MANDELA
                        She could sing? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Pretty. Like a bird. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (barely awake)
                        ...and she was really nice? 

           Malcolm looks down at Mandela. So innocent. Malcolm pities 
           him. The pity turning to a loving lie: 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (faithless)
                        Sure. ...she’d do anything for you.   

           Mandela falls asleep. Malcolm sees it. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I’d do anything for you.  

           He leans back, staring into the flames. 

           Something is tugging at him. Malcolm stands, walks to the 
           kitchen. He opens a cabinet, finds the painkillers. 
           Pockets them. 

           He slips on a sweater, heads to the door, takes a look 
           around. 

           Mandela is out like a light. 

           Malcolm leaves. 

           Mandela opens his eyes, a look of worry crossing his face. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Malcolm makes his way down the path toward the clearing. 
           Unbeknownst to him, someone is watching...  

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Malcolm emerges from the trees. Spots The White Girl, curled 
           next to a campfire.  

           Makes his way over.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Sorry I’ve been gone so long... My 
                        brother needed me. Our dad is... 
                        suspicious. Maybe. I’m not sure. 

           She won’t budge. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to leave you out 
                        here. 
                            (re: the fire)
                        But... you found my striker. 

           Still, nothing. Malcolm rolls his eyes. Steps between her and 
           the fire. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I brought you something for the 
                        pain...

           He presents the pills, looks down to see that she’s 
           shivering, eyes barely open. 

           He drops to her side.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (patting her cheek)
                        Hey? Hey! Um... girl... 
           He stands, unsure what to do. Wanting to call for help. He 
           reaches down, tries to sit her up. She’s limp, clammy. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come on... 

           RUSTLES from the trees. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (freaked)
                        Who’s that?! 

           He picks up a branch. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        WHO’S THAT?

           A shadow emerges from the foliage. Malcolm steels. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come on! 

           The form moves closer and we see it’s Mandela. The older 
           brother EXHALES, relieved. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Why are you following me? 

           Malcolm turns back to The White Girl. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Bad enough you want me to lie to 
                        dad in the day time-- now, past the 
                        line, at night?? I thought you 
                        weren’t gonna leave--

                                 MALCOLM
                        She won’t wake up. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...what?

           Mandela gets closer, touches her forehead. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        She’s got a fever. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Can you help her?  

                                 MANDELA
                        I’m... not sure. We don’t know how 
                        long she’s been like this... 
                                 MALCOLM
                        What do we do? 

                                 MANDELA
                        We gotta cool her off. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (searching)
                        The stream! 

           Mandela nods. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. STREAM - NIGHT

           The boys struggle to carry The White Girl to the bank of the 
           stream. 

           They lay her down there.

                                 MANDELA
                        You have a bucket? A bottle?  

                                 MALCOLM
                            (shaking his head)
                        When you were a baby you got 
                        sick... dad held you up, put your 
                        whole body in the water...

                                 MANDELA
                        Gotta get her cold fast. 

           Malcolm takes his jacket off her shoulders. He pulls her top 
           off, exposing a bra underneath. Mandela looks away. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You said you would help. 

           Mandela hesitates. Malcolm GRUNTS. He lifts the White Girl 
           under her armpits. Drags her backward toward the stream. 

           He shuffles and pulls until they hit the water. 

           SPLASHING and struggling, he pulls her in. Mandela watches 
           from the shore. 

           A long BEAT. 

           Malcolm cradling her. The water, settling. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come on...
                                 MANDELA
                        Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Come on. 

           He splashes water on her face. 

           The White Girl SPRINGS to life, eyes wide. Kicking and 
           splashing, shocked to find herself in the water. 

           She CLINGS to Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (smiling)
                        Tried calling you... You wouldn’t 
                        wake up... 

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        June. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        June? 

           She nods, calming. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        June. 

           Mandela watches them, staring as they embrace in the moonlit 
           stream. They seem to forget the world a moment. Mandela 
           clenches his jaw... he doesn’t like it.   

           Malcolm and June move to the stream bank, out of the water. 
           Malcolm hands her his jacket, she bundles up. 

           Malcolm, finally, looks toward Mandela. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           Mandela nods. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - LATER

           Malcolm and June sit close to each other. Mandela nurses a 
           fire, separated from them. 

           Malcolm hands her a few of the painkillers.  

           She gulps them down, gratefully. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        There’s more in the bottle. Just 
                        take a few at a time. It’ll help 
                        with the fever and everything else.

           She nods.

                                 JUNE
                        Thank you.

           Malcolm smiles. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        How you know how to do all that? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (motions to Mandela)
                        He’s the doctor in the family. 

                                 JUNE
                        Doctor? 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...my mom taught me. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where is she? 

           The boys grow silent. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dead. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (off her puzzled look)
                        She was a nurse. Left some books 
                        and stuff. My brother’s read every 
                        word. Twice. 

           Mandela suppresses a smile. 

           Malcolm moves to stoke the fire. June watches Mandela a 
           moment, crosses to him. Sits. 

           An AWKWARD BEAT. 

                                 JUNE
                        ...thank you for what you did. 

           Mandela shrugs.

                                 MANDELA
                        Malcolm just don’t like to read. 
                                 JUNE
                        I-- owe you. Wish I could pay you 
                        back.  

                                 MANDELA
                        Leave. 

                                 JUNE
                            (slowly, melancholy)
                        If I could. 

           Silence. Malcolm watches them, makes a face at Mandela. The 
           younger rolls his eyes. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t blame you... wanting me to 
                        go. I been mean... I’m sorry for 
                        that. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (softening)
                        It’s fine. 

                                 JUNE
                            (looking to Malcolm)
                        Mean to him too. Y’all been good to 
                        me, though. I just miss my 
                        family... 

           Mandela nods, connecting. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        --and I ain’t ever really been 
                        around niggers before... 

           A BEAT. 

           Malcolm and Mandela exchange a look. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...niggers? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What are niggers? 

                                 JUNE
                            (quickly)
                        Don’t mean to be no kinda way-- 

                                 MANDELA
                        We’re not niggers. We’re just boys. 

           June stares, confused. She nods to Mandela. The boys share a 
           look, quizzical. Malcolm shrugs. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Malcolm and Mandela walking back. The younger a few steps 
           behind, lost in thought.  

                                 MALCOLM 
                        Gotta hustle back, Dad’ll be up 
                        soon. 

                                 MANDELA
                        You gave her the pills. Dad’s 
                        pills. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Hm? Yeah. He’s almost better.  If 
                        he asks, I’ll tell him they got 
                        lost. 

                                 MANDELA
                        You gonna lie to him yourself? 

           Malcolm glances over, reading his brother’s tone. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’d rather I let her die? 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...no.  

           They walk in silence again. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Summer’s coming soon. We can get 
                        anything we need outside the woods. 
                        Raids. Like before.

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad can’t do that. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        His leg’ll heal. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...you doing all this for her? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Maybe... so? 

           Mandela pulls the wolf emblem from his pocket. A moment, 
           Mandela wrestling with his brother’s feelings. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...I just, want things to go back 
                        to normal.
           Deciding to let Malcolm dream. He examines the patch, puts it 
           away. Malcolm looks back. Mandela catches up. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Mandela tends the garden. Malcolm CHOPS wood. He stops as 
           Cassius makes his way out of the cabin. He leans on a large 
           branch, a makeshift cane.  

           Mandela moves to help. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (waving him off)
                        ...nah. Nah. I got it. 

           He sweats and struggles; he’s in great pain. But he’s 
           WALKING. On his own.

           Malcolm just watches. 

           Cassius makes his way all the way out and sits in a chair. 
           Mandela claps. Malcolm, slowly, does too.  

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (catching his breath)
                        Heh. Thanks. 

           Mandela goes back to his garden. Malcolm lingers, staring at 
           Cassius a moment too long. Then goes back to CHOPPING. 

           Cassius notes this. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Almost on my feet. Rest makes a man 
                        feel brand new. 

           Mandela approaches, kneels down at his side. Looking at his 
           leg. Tinkers with the dressing.  

                                 MANDELA
                        It’s healing. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        That’s cuz of you. 

           Mandela looks up. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you son. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (floating)
                        You’re welcome. 
           Cassius pats his head. Malcolm slows a moment, Cassius 
           watches him.  

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Dad? 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (absent)
                        Hm? 

                                 MANDELA
                        What’s a nigger? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        What.... ? What you say boy? 

                                 MANDELA
                            (shrinking back)
                        Nigger. 

           Cassius leans forward. SNATCHES Mandela’s arm. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Where you get that? Hm?

           Malcolm is just as puzzled as Mandela. The younger brother 
           looks back to him. Malcolm looks away. 

           His brother is letting him take the fall. 

           Malcolm shuffles, mind racing.  

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        I’m askin, not him... Look at ME.

                                 MANDELA
                        I... 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (enraged)
                        What? Where you get that?!

                                 MALCOLM
                        His BOOKS!

           Mandela stands face to face with his father, refusing to 
           relent this time. 

           Cassius stares for a moment, testing his mettle. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (looking back at Malcolm)
                        Books... 
           Cassius stands. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        What book? 

           Mandela searches for an answer. 

                                 MANDELA
                        ...one of mom’s. 

           A BEAT. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I don’t wanna hear it again. 

           He hobbles back to the cabin. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        And bring me the book. 

           Mandela turns back to his garden. Malcolm wanders over, 
           guilty. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I didn’t know what to say. 

           Nothing. Mandela simply works the dirt. Malcolm watches a 
           moment, then heads back to chop wood. 

           Mandela never looks up. 

           They toil, silent and separate. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Cassius stands over a fire, flipping through the pages of 
           their mother’s book.  

           Mandela watches, his eyes never leaving the book. Malcolm 
           sees the sadness on his face. His hopes pinned to the pages.

                                 CASSIUS
                            (shaking his head)
                        This ain’t doing nobody no good. 

           Locks eyes with Mandela. 

           He tosses the book on the flames. Mandela almost leaps after 
           it. Cassius moves to him, hugs him to his side. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        ...gotta stand on your own. 
           EXT. LEAN-TO - DAY

           Malcolm approaches the shelter, holding a bucket. Mandela’s 
           legs are sticking out of the lean-to.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        Man-man. I’m going to get water. 

           SILENCE. Finally the legs twist away from Malcolm as Mandela 
           turns his back inside the shelter. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I... couldn’t jump in.  

           INT. LEAN-TO -- CONTINUOUS 

           Mandela lays on his side, listening. 

                                 MALCOLM (O.S.)
                        What was I supposed to say? Huh? 
                        You tell me! I don’t know what he 
                        was gonna do.

           Mandela shakes his head.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (calming)
                        I’m just sick of all the trees. 
                        Anyway. Thank you. 

           A BEAT. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Well... ain’t you coming out? 

           Mandela doesn’t budge. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Fine. 

           Mandela hears FOOTSTEPS walking away. 

           EXT. STREAM - DAY

           Malcolm arrives at the stream, the bucket swinging from his 
           arm. He stoops to fill it, something catches his eye. 

           June stands up stream, in her bra and panties, RINSING her 
           skin. Running water through her hair. 

           June is BEAUTIFUL, SEXY... And vulnerable. 
           He scrambles back to where she can’t see. Malcolm watches 
           her, full on-enamored. 

           She steps out of the water, grabs her clothes from the shore 
           and heads back to the clearing. 

           Malcolm realizes she’s leaving, grabs his bucket and follows. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - DAY

           Malcolm follows June from tree to tree. She holds a scratched 
           cell phone high up, looking for reception. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        How come you didn’t call home if 
                        you had it the whole time.  

                                 JUNE
                        I dropped it in the storm, found it 
                        when I was wanderin. Wasn’t workin. 
                        Must’ve dried out in the sun. 

           Malcolm is suspicious, but he shrugs it off. 

           No bars. She SIGHS. Sits. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Useless though. 

           An idea occurs--

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Hey do you--? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (shaking his head)
                        Never seen one before. My dad told 
                        me about ‘em though. Just one more 
                        way they keep track of you, keep 
                        their boot on you...

                                 JUNE
                        They? 

           Malcolm looks up, the error dawning on him. The phone BEEPS. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (evading)
                        Did it find somebody? 

                                 JUNE
                        No. It’s dying. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s not alive... right? 

           June smiles. 

                                 JUNE
                        You miss a lot out here. 

           Malcolm sits. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I do? Like what? 

                                 JUNE
                        ...cell phones. Ice cream. Roller 
                        coasters. Swimming. 

           She shuts her eyes, drifting into memory. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Even sometimes parties with your 
                        friends. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Friends. 

           She opens her eyes. Looks him over. 

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah. I didn’t have a lot of those. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        But you got everything else.   

                                 JUNE
                        Everything? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (longing)
                        The whole world. 

                                 JUNE
                            (melancholy)
                        I used to just wanna leave. Go 
                        somewhere. Get lost. I’d dream 
                        about it. Now... 

           The sit in silence a moment.

                                 MALCOLM
                        There was this Indian Chief a long 
                        time ago. And he gets old and he 
                        wanted to pass along the tribe. 
                                 JUNE
                        The tribe? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        The power, I think. The throne. So. 
                        He makes this contest for all the 
                        boys in the tribe.

                                 JUNE
                        Boys? Not girls? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Men. And he says bring me a gift. 
                        Man with the best gift gets the 
                        throne. And everybody brings dead 
                        bears and gold and stuff they find. 
                        And this one guy comes back with 
                        nothing. And he says I couldn’t 
                        find anything worth more than what 
                        you gave us. The times you took us 
                        fishing. The way you taught us to 
                        hunt. The stories you told at the 
                        fire circle. That was the best gift 
                        and it’s already given. 

                                 JUNE
                        So he took it back. Indian Giver! 

           She LAUGHS. Malcolm doesn’t get it. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No. The Chief gave him the throne. 

                                 JUNE
                        Why? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Cuz he said the best gift was 
                        memory. That’s what the man gave 
                        him. 

           She smiles. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where’d you get that? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It was a story I heard. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad says mom used to tell me. 
                                 JUNE
                        You don’t remember?  

           Malcolm shakes his head. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                            (easing off it)
                        Why you wanna leave? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why do you want to go back? 

           She considers this, leans her head on his shoulder. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm approaches with the bucket of water. He spots Cassius 
           sitting out front, waiting. 

           The boy approaches, puts the bucket down. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        --It was heavy carrying back...

                                 CASSIUS
                        Don’t do that. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Wha--

                                 CASSIUS
                        Lie. I know where you been. 

           Mandela appears in the doorway. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I was at the stream. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You been past the line. Don’t play 
                        me dumb. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad... 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (rising)
                        You’ve been out of yourself. 
                        Getting lost. Getting distant. 
                        Telling tales. I don’t know what 
                        you been doing, but I’m done with 
                        it now. You don’t go past that mark 
                        again. 
           Malcolm’s eyes flit to Mandela, did he tell? 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        You understand? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        No...? 

                         MALCOLM
                                                    CASSIUS (CONT'D)
                                             You don’t know what you’re 
                                             saying... watch your mouth 
                                             boy... SHUT UP! 
           You always saying there’s 
           nothing good out there. 
           There’s people who want to 
           hurt us... I don’t believe 
           you. I think there’s 
           something better... And you 
           can’t have it, so you don’t 
           want us to have it either. 
           You want us to die in here 
           Sad and alone with YOU! 

           Cassius SLAPS the boy. Mandela watches. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        You living cuz of me. Everything 
                        you have, is cuz of me. 

           Cassius hobbles inside. Mandela and Malcolm stare at each 
           other. Mandela turns, heads inside. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           THOCK. A large blade sinks into the trunk of a tree. 
           Malcolm’s knife. His hand pulls it out. 

           Malcolm steps away from the tree, turns and THROWS the blade 
           again. 

           Walks up to retrieve. 

           Mandela approaches. Malcolm gives him a passing glance. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You told him? 

           Another THROW. 

                                 MANDELA
                        No. He’s not stupid. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        He doesn’t know anything. 

                                 MANDELA
                        I think he’s right. 

           Malcolm SCOFFS. THROWS. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You think June’s dangerous? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Maybe not her... 

           Mandela hands him the patch. Malcolm looks it over. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        I found it... I think it’s hers. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        So? Ain’t a real wolf. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (growing angry)
                        You’re being stupid. You don’t even 
                        know her. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I know she ain’t a killer. 

           Mandela fumes, aggravated. 

                                 MANDELA
                        You don’t know anything!

           Malcolm watches him go. Pulls the knife from the tree. Stands 
           there, considering it. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - NIGHT

           June sits by a fire. Alone, lost in thought. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Cassius stands near the front door. He looks from a pair of 
           binoculars. 

           He sees the GLOW from the fire in the woods. 

           Cassius SCOWLS. 

           Heads inside. 
           INT. CABIN - NIGHT 

           Malcolm tosses and turns. Gets up, heads into the kitchen for 
           water. 

           He drinks from a mug, lays it aside. 

           He walks toward the couch, no sign of Cassius. Malcolm 
           frowns. He walks to his father’s bedroom. No luck their 
           either. 

                                 MANDELA (O.S.)
                        He went out. 

           Malcolm turns to him. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        I heard him get up. Walked outside. 
                        Then he came back in, got the rifle 
                        and left. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Where?

                                 MANDELA
                        Why what are you going to do? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        WHERE? 

           A standoff. Mandela shakes his head. 

                                 MANDELA
                        I’m not sure. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Cassius limps along bushwhacking his own trail. His rifle at 
           the ready. 

           A VOICE ECHOES... calling JUNE! JUNEBUG! 

           Getting closer.

           Cassius stops, finds a vantage. Tucks behind a boulder. He 
           peeks out, watching the woods ahead of him. 

           A man appears, MILITARY from the look of him. 

           Boots and Flack Vest. A shamog around his neck. A mask 
           obscuring his face. A sidearm strapped to his thigh. 

           Cassius breathes deep and slow. 
                                 SOLDIER
                        JUNE! 

           The man moves ahead a bit. 

           Cassius SPRINGS OUT, rifle trained. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        That’s enough there. 

           The man freezes. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Turn around. 

           He complies, turning away from Cassius.

           Cassius slowly descends his vantage point, wary. He limps and 
           shuffles toward the man.  

           CLOSE ON the Soldier, listening to his awkward gait. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        What you doin’ out here?  

                                 SOLDIER
                        Same as you. Lookin for somebody. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Whose that? 

           The Soldier is silent. Cassius jabs him with the rifle.   

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Who? 

                                 SOLDIER
                        You don’t know her. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Her? 

           Nothing. 

           Cassius jabs him again, but the Soldier spins away from the 
           muzzle. A SHOT rings out. 

           They struggle for the rifle. Cassius pulls it away, the 
           soldier kicks him in the leg. 

           Cassius SCREAMS, drops. 

           The Solder pulls his pistol, ready to end it, gets close. 
           Cassius grabs his wrist, diverting his aim. 
           A DESPERATE STRUGGLE for the weapon, both men grunting. 

           Their bodies tight, close. The Soldier LEANS on his leg. 
           Cassius SQUEALING. Soldier tries to apply pressure with his 
           hand. 

           Cassius takes the opening, presses the pistol under his chin, 
           FIRES. 

           Point blank. Blood and brain matter SPLATTERS Cassius. 

           He rolls the man off him.

           GRITS his teeth in pain, trying to catch his breath. 

           He struggles to his feet. 

           Grabs his rifle. Picks up the pistol, tucks it away. 

           Looks down on the man. SPITS at him. 

           He notices something on the man’s chest. Reaches down tugs at 
           it. Looks around for a tool. Pulls the deadman’s knife from 
           it’s holster. 

           CUTS the cloth from his chest. 

           He holds it up to the light. 

           We see it now-- THE SAME EMBLEM MANDELA FOUND ON JUNE. 

           The WHITE WOLF’S GAPING JAWS. 

           Cassius pockets it. Pulls the mask up the dead man’s face. 

           He’s White. 

           Grim, Cassius turns, heads back. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Dawn just breaking over the horizon. Malcolm and Mandela sit 
           watching the path from June’s clearing. 

           Malcolm fretting. Fearing the worst.

                                 MANDELA
                        Maybe she left... 

           Malcolm sneers. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        It’s better that way. 
           Cassius appears, from the OPPOSITE direction. Mandela spots 
           him. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        He’s back there. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Where’s he coming from? 

           Malcolm and Mandela share a look, puzzled.  

           Malcolm runs to him. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           He takes his father in, dirty, spattered with blood, spent. 
           Cassius shoves the rifle at him. 

           Walks past. 

           Mandela takes in the sight. 

           The boys stand in the dawn light, looking at each other, 
           trying to make sense of it. 

           Cassius returns from inside the cabin, carrying a bottle of 
           whiskey. 

           He sits, drinks. Looks out toward the woods. The boys 
           approach. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I found an injured animal. Heard 
                        him callin. I put him down. 

           Mandela looks his father over. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What kind of animal? 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (turning)
                        Wolf. 

           The boys exchange a look. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Get dressed. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        For training? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        No. We’re going hunting. 

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           The boys follow Cassius as he limps along the path toward 
           June. He shoulders the rifle. 

           Malcolm carries his bow. 

           The boys silently argue. Malcolm worried for June. 

           Neither can stop their advance. 

           EXT. STREAM - LATER

           Cassius splashes water on his face and neck, washing away the 
           blood. 

           Malcolm watches. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What are we looking for? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Deer. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We still got food at home. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Then let’s call this sport. Only 
                        one way to learn to hunt. 

           He pulls a map from his pants. Malcolm watches. Cassius finds 
           his position, folds the map and puts it away. He prepares to 
           stand, but spots a footprint in the dirt. 

           June’s footprint. 

           He looks down stream, finds the path toward the clearing. 
           Starts to follows the path. 

           Malcolm is right on his heels, racking his brain for a way 
           out. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                            (walking)
                        Animals are predictable. Food. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Water. Shelter. Sometimes they get 
                        clever, though. Fight their nature. 
                        Leave their herd... that’s usually 
                        when you get your shot.  

           Cassius arrives at a tree with his mark painted on. The boys 
           catch up. Cassius takes a look back.

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - DAY

           June unwraps the gauze around her wounds. She presses her 
           flesh. It’s tender, red, but healing. She stands, STRETCHES. 

           VOICES on the path. Malcolm’s voice. 

           She perks up, STANDS to greet him. 

           A LONG BEAT. 

           Her smile fades... Something... off. 

           WE PUSH CLOSER to the foliage. TIGHTER and TIGHTER. The 
           leaves RUSTLE. And--

           Cassius pushes into the clearing. The boys trailing. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad... 

           Cassius holds up a hand. Silencing him. He scans the 
           clearing. 

           He spots the ASHES of campfire. 

           Moves to it. Feels for heat. 

           As he looks around the clearing, PULL BACK to REVEAL June, 
           pressed up against a nearby tree, just out of sight. She 
           holds her breath. 

           Malcolm looks around searching for June, trying not to give 
           her away. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (stepping forward)
                        What are we doing Dad? 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (focused)
                        Hunting son... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        There’s nothing out here. 
           Cassius looks down, kicks away some leaves and sticks to find 
           Malcolm’s Jacket. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You sure? 

           Malcolm is silent. Mandela simply watches. Cassius turns 
           back. Walks toward June’s tree, steps around it-- but she’s 
           not there. 

           Cassius hangs there a moment, he can almost SENSE her. 

           Malcolm’s heart pounds in his chest. 

           Cassius stands on a low ridge. Just below him there is a 
           fallen tree trunk. June is LYING FACE DOWN in the dirt, STILL 
           as the grave. 

           He puts a foot on the side of the log. Dirt and debris 
           falling on top of June’s face. Across her eyes and nose. 

           Tickling. Irritating. 

           She holds her breath. 

           Cassius leans forward about to take another step... 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It was me! 

           He turns back to Malcolm. A moment of relief for June. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        It was me. I was out here. I left 
                        my jacket. I went across the 
                        treeline. I just wanted to see what 
                        it was like. 

           Cassius hesitates, then walks back to his son. He takes the 
           boys head in his hands and... pulls him in for a hug. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I set those blazes for you. I left 
                        that world, for you. I’m not gone 
                        let them have you now. 

           Malcolm nods. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        This is family is the only 
                        important thing. No more lies now. 
                        Hm?  
           Mandela stares at Cassius, the words sounding sincere. This 
           is love. This is all there is.  

                                 MANDELA
                        No more lies. 

           Cassius looks to Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Ok, dad. 

           The three of them bask in the feeling a moment. Cassius 
           SMILES at his sons. After a moment, he feels convicted, pulls 
           something from his pocket. The Wolf Emblem. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        I took this from a man who was... 
                        trying to hurt us. From outside the 
                        trees.  

           Malcolm and Mandela recognize the patch, both trying to play 
           it cool. 

           Cassius notes it. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...what is it--

                                 MANDELA
                        What happened to him? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        He’s gone.  

           Back at the log, June is listening. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen this? 

           Malcolm shakes his head. Mandela stares for a moment. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Son? 

                                 MANDELA
                        I... no. 

           Cassius takes in both boys. He can feel their tension. They 
           lied right to his face. Cassius, heartbroken, puts the patch 
           away. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (feigning relief)
                        Ok, good. 
           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Malcolm leads them back to the cabin. Mandela walks next to 
           his father, head hung low. 

           Cassius spots a squirrel in a tree. 

           He stops, shoves the rifle at Mandela. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        See that? 

           Mandela spots the squirrel. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Take him. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        Me? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        You’re old enough. 

           Malcolm turns back, spots the gun in Mandela’s hands.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        What--what are you doing? 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Your brother’s going to kill that 
                        squirrel. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He’s a bad shot... Let me--

                                 CASSIUS
                        He’ll learn. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He can’t even bait a hook. 

                                 MANDELA
                        I can do it. 

           Cassius looks to Malcolm. Mandela nods, shoulders the rifle 
           awkwardly. 

           Malcolm frets. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        He’ll learn. 

           Malcolm stands aside silently. Cassius looks between his 
           sons, his manipulation finding ground. 
           Mandela gets a line on the squirrel. He aims... hesitates.

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        It ain’t hard once it’s over. Just 
                        take a breath, and pull. 

           A BEAT. 

           Mandela FIRES, the noise near deafening to him. He stumbles 
           back. Cassius takes the rifle. 

           Cassius SIGHS. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        You winged him. 

           Moves to the squirrel. Mandela follows. Malcolm watches from 
           the path. 

           Cassius stands over the squirrel. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        He’s suffering. Slow. Bleedin’ out. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        I didn’t mean that... 

                                 CASSIUS
                        It happened. You gonna leave it be? 
                        Or finish what you started? 

           Mandela steps forward, staring down. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Boot or the tree. 

           Mandela frowns. Raises his foot, STOMPS down on the rodent’s 
           head, killing it. 

           He is frozen for a moment. Malcolm is fully STUNNED. 

           Then he turns, and walks toward the path.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The boys sit silently at a fire. Malcolm tries to look at his 
           brother but Mandela only looks down. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        That shouldn’t have happened. He 
                        shouldn’t--

           Cassius appears holding the squirrel by it’s tail. 
                                 CASSIUS
                        What shouldn’t? 

           Malcolm clams up. Cassius sneers. He sits. Pulls at the stiff 
           squirrel’s spine, loosening it up. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinkin. You’re 
                        down because... you think you did 
                        something evil. That’s wrong. 

           He lifts his blade, checking the edge in the firelight. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        ...all you did, was survive. That 
                        ain’t on you. That’s God’s plan. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        Then maybe God’s evil. 

           Cassius lift’s the squirrel’s tail, cuts a slit along it’s 
           back. He twists the tail SNAPPING it’s tailbone. More 
           cutting.

                                 CASSIUS
                        In these woods, you’re kids. 
                        Somebody else gonna do all the 
                        nasty things. Out there... when 
                        they see you... you get grown. 

           Cassius pulls the skin of the lower back up, making a small 
           flap from the animal’s hide. 

           He lays the creature on the ground, grips its legs in his 
           hand, steps his heel on the flap of skin and fur.  

           In one motion Cassius RIPS THE SKIN off the squirrel like 
           skin-tight pullover. He tosses the sticky white skin into the 
           woods. 

           He holds the pink fleshy mass in his hand. 

           Mandela tries hard to look on. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        You remind me so much of your 
                        mother. I love you both. Soft 
                        hearts though.

           Mandela meets his gaze. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        She wasn’t right for that world. 
                        That’s why she’s gone. 
           Cassius cracks open the rib cage. Pulls the HEART. 

           He sticks it on the tip of his blade holds it over the fire. 
           It STEAMS and smokes. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Those white men are coming. You 
                        don’t get to be boys anymore. 

           Mandela watches the heart ROASTING. Malcolm stares into 
           Cassius, refusing to accept this. 

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        So, you gotta decide what you’re 
                        gonna be.  

           A BEAT. 

           Mandela grabs the heart from the knife. He BLOWS it, pops it 
           in his mouth and chews it up. 

           Cassius sits back. Satisfied. 

           Malcolm watches Mandela fall under Cassius’ spell. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The boys are laid out asleep near the fire. Cassius snoozes 
           in a chair. 

           Malcolm lays alone on the ground. 

           A PEBBLE lands on his hand. Another on his stomach. Then 
           another. 

           REVEAL June is tossing them. Trying to get his attention. 
           Malcolm wakes, spots her. He’s immediately alarmed. 

           He gets up gingerly, moves to her at the edge of the dense 
           foliage. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (whispered)
                        My dad could wake up anytime... 
                        plus Mandela might tell on us. 

                                 JUNE 
                        The man. Your dad mentioned 
                        someone. Said he was gone. Who was 
                        he? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...You think it’s your dad? 
                                 JUNE
                            (somber)
                        Or my uncle. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        That’s good right? 

           June shakes her head... No.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on? 

                                 JUNE
                        I can’t say right now. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (end of his rope)
                        Of course. You always say that. 

                                 JUNE
                        This is different. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        How? You barely answered one 
                        question about you since we met. 
                        Why don’t you tell me? 

                                 JUNE
                        I will. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No. Now. 

                                 JUNE
                        Why?! You don’t care about me. You 
                        just want to leave here. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You don’t know what he’s like... 

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah. I do.

           A BEAT. He sizes her up, she seems sincere. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        My dad found something the guy in 
                        the woods. Took some patch from 
                        him. That’s all I know. 

                                 JUNE
                        Patch? 
                                 MALCOLM
                        A picture of a white wolf with 
                        thunderbolts. 

           June goes pale. 

                                 JUNE
                        You haven’t seen the man? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        No. 

                                 JUNE
                        We’ve got to find him. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why? 

                                 JUNE
                        Because he wouldn’t take that patch 
                        off. Never. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (nodding)
                        Dad’s got a map, I saw. Probably 
                        marks it all, it’s how he found you 
                        in the clearing. 

                                 JUNE
                        He must have all of these woods 
                        figured out on there. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I can get it. We’ll find him. It’s 
                        going to be--

                                 JUNE
                        It’s not. It’s gonna be bad.

                                 MALCOLM
                        For my dad? 

                                 JUNE
                        For everybody. 

           Malcolm looks back to his family. The terror in her voice 
           unsettling him. 

           EXT. SOUTH WOODS - NIGHT

           June waits for Malcolm by the trail behind the cabin. The 
           path his father took. Malcolm sneaks down, his bow in hand. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        I couldn’t get the map. 

                                 JUNE 
                        What? How do we find him then? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We never use these trails. They’ll 
                        be signs.

           He clicks on a small flashlight. Walks ahead, June follows.

                                                            TIMECUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH WOODS - NIGHT

                                 JUNE
                        Why would your dad even be out this 
                        far?  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I don’t know. 

                                 JUNE
                        For a man that wants to be left 
                        alone he sure’s got a funny way. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What you mean? 

                                 JUNE
                        All of it I guess. The guns. The 
                        fighting. Some people can’t put it 
                        down. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...Dad says it’s them. The world 
                        out there. It’s dangerous. He just 
                        wants to protect what we have. 

                                 JUNE
                            (shrugging)
                        World’s okay. I lived there my 
                        whole life. It’s just some 
                        people... some people just looking 
                        for a fight.

           Malcolm stops. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        My mom died out there. She wasn’t 
                        anybody like that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                        Soldier or anything. She was good. 
                        Nice. They killed her.

           June considers this, softens. Malcolm spots something ahead. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Look... 

           They walk ahead, the dead Soldier lies on the ground, 
           partially chewed and trampled by animals. 

           June CHOKES. 

           Malcolm spots the jacket where the patch has been cut away.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead. 

                                 JUNE
                        I know. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (reeling)
                        My... dad killed him. Just... shot 
                        him dead. 

                                 JUNE
                        I know. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He said... this man was trying to 
                        hurt us. Do you... know him? 

           She looks the body over. Kneels next to him, lifts his mask. 
           She looks away at the smell, the sight. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Is it your dad? 

                                 JUNE
                        No. 

           Malcolm breathes a sigh of reliefe. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Your uncle? 

                                 JUNE
                            (grave)
                        No. But... he’s not alone. They’re 
                        coming. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Who’s coming? 
                                 JUNE
                        My family. 

           EXT. SOUTH WOODS - LATER

           June speeds back up the trail, toward the cabin. 

                                 MALCOLM 
                        Slow down. 

                                 JUNE
                        No. 

           He gets in front of her. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What are you so scared of? What’s 
                        out here? What’s that patch mean? 

                                 JUNE
                        It’s like a medal. A reward. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Reward? For what?

                                 JUNE
                        Something bad. PLEASE. Stop. 

           Malcolm calms. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        We have to go. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Go back to the cabin?

                                 JUNE
                        No. Leave the woods. Run. Go as far 
                        as we can. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why? 

                                 JUNE
                        Your dad killed one of them. It 
                        won’t be long. They use radios. 
                        They know where he went. They’ll 
                        come looking for him... and then 
                        they’ll find all of us.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I can’t just leave my brother, my 
                        dad... 
                                 JUNE
                        They don’t want them... Not really.

                                 MALCOLM
                        How do you know? 

           June hesitates. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        June. How do you know? 

                                 JUNE
                        They’re looking for me. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What? 

                                 JUNE
                        My uncle is not a good man. Worse 
                        than your dad. A lot worse. But I 
                        lived with him and the others. They 
                        were like my family. Only one I 
                        ever knew. My dad came for me one 
                        day. Like magic. Like a fairy 
                        godmother. But my uncle didn’t want 
                        to let us go. Said my dad owed him. 
                        So... we ran. And we got separated 
                        in that storm and I got lost. They 
                        want me back. They sent him. 
                        They’ll send more. Until--

                                 MALCOLM
                        We’ll go. I’ll get the map, some 
                        supplies. We can run. Tomorrow. 
                        They won’t find us. 

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah? 

           Malcolm nods. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        What about your family? 

           Malcolm weighs it out. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        My dad won’t leave. 

                                 JUNE
                        What about your brother? 
                                 MALCOLM
                            (uncertain)
                        ...he’ll go. 

           They turn back toward the road. Malcolm heads back for the 
           cabin. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Sunrise. Cassius waking up with the first light. He 
           stretches. Looks over at Mandela. SMILES. 

           Rubs the boys head. 

           Mandela flutters to life. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Morning son. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (groggy)
                        Mornin’. 

           Cassius looks over at Malcolm, offers a smile. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Gonna be a good day. 

           Malcolm nods, looks out on the woods. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Cassius stands over Mandela and Malcolm as they do push-ups. 
           Malcolm clearly distracted. 

           Cassius’ eye is on Mandela now. The boy pushes himself hard 
           trying to impress. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY 

           Cassius and Mandela set snares and trip wire in the woods. 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm steals Cassius’ map. Loads a backpack full of food, 
           bandages, a water bottle...  
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Cassius shows Mandela how to shoot with the rifle, taking aim 
           at distant trees. 

           Malcolm dry-tests his bow. 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Malcolm slips on his boots. He looks around his bedroom, 
           turns, and leaves. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Sun dropping low. 

           Malcolm peeks out, no sign of his brother or his dad. He 
           slips the backpack up his shoulder, turns to go. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad’s checking snares in the woods 
                        behind the house. You’re leaving, 
                        right? 

           Malcolm spins. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                        Going to meet June? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (frozen)
                        You going to tell? 

                                 MANDELA
                        I don’t know. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I want you to come too. 

           Mandela shakes his head. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Really. This... what you’re doing 
                        now... it’s dad. Not you. 

                                 MANDELA
                        It’s being a man. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Who says? 

           Mandela is struck silent. 
                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t going to leave you. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Don’t go. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We have to. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad says-- you could get killed if 
                        you go. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He lies. 

                                 MANDELA
                        How do you know? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad killed somebody. Now his 
                        friends are going to come looking 
                        for us, unless we go now. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (trying to comprehend)
                        A white man? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Does it matter? 

                                 MANDELA
                        He must’ve had some reason--

                                 MALCOLM
                        This is dad’s fault. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Maybe it’s... her. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Before June came, everything was 
                        fine. Now more white men come. And 
                        what about that patch? This is all 
                        her fault.  

           Malcolm stares at his young brother, incredulous. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        ...I’m going. Tonight. If you want 
                        to come... you know where to find 
                        me. 

           Malcolm pushes past him, starts for the trail to June. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Malcolm... tonight? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Yes. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Did you forget? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (stopping)
                        ...forget? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Mom’s birthday. You said you’d 
                        celebrate with me...

           Malcolm hesitates. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad never talks about her... you 
                        were too young to remember... and 
                        so was I. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Remember what? 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (turning)
                        It’s not her birthday. I don’t even 
                        know when it is. Just another 
                        story. 

           Mandela is crushed, TEARS welling and falling. Malcolm sees 
           it. He stands there, fighting himself. Wanting to move to 
           Mandela’s side.

           Both boys wishing things were different. Malcolm looks away, 
           and walks off. 

           Mandela stands there watching his brother disappear. 

           He SNIFFS, wipes away his tears... and SNARLS at his absent 
           brother, sadness turns to resentment. 
           EXT. CABIN - LATER

           Night has fallen. Cassius finally returns, his injury now 
           just a hitch in his walk. Mandela waits by the front door. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Hey son.

                                 MANDELA
                        Hi Dad. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (stretching)
                        You and Malcolm ready for dinner? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Malcolm left. 

           Cassius pauses, thinking. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        When is he coming back? 

                                 MANDELA
                        He’s leaving forever. Went to the 
                        north woods. 

           Mandela motions toward the trail. Cassius FUMES. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Why? 

           Mandela moves to his father hands him something. Cassius 
           looks down at it, REVEAL the patch Mandela found. 

           Cassius pats his own pocket. Pulls out the patch he cut from 
           the soldier. Compares the two.

                                 CASSIUS (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you get this?  

                                 MANDELA
                        I found it in her things. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Her? 

                                 MANDELA
                        June. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Malcolm and June following Cassius’ map... trying to. June 
           shines a light as Malcolm twists the map around, confused. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I thought we were past the 
                        ravine... I’m sorry. I’ve never 
                        been this far out. 

                                 JUNE 
                        We’ll use a handrail. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What? 

           She hands him the light, takes the map. Lays it on the 
           ground, squats. Scans it with her finger. 

                                 JUNE
                        The stream is there... leads to a 
                        bigger creek... all the way out to 
                        these falls. If we keep it on our 
                        side, we’re going the right way. 

           Malcolm nods, impressed. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        How you know so much about this 
                        stuff? 

                                 JUNE
                        ...my uncle taught me. How come you 
                        don’t? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        My dad never showed us his map. I 
                        guess... he never wanted us to 
                        leave. 

                                 JUNE
                        Well... I never met nobody like you 
                        before out there. Don’t think I was 
                        supposed to. 

           A BEAT. Tentative, he touches her hand.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                            (awkward)
                        I... gotta pee.  

           She stands. 
           She moves behind a set of trees. Malcolm sits alone with the 
           map.

           After a moment, he hears RUSTLING. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        June? 

           No response. 

           Malcolm folds the map, sticks it in his backpack. Shines his 
           light on the dark woods around him. Shadows dancing, Malcolm 
           on edge. 

           He pulls out his knife. 

           Settles on a mossy oak, nearby leaves still shaking. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come out! I see you! 

           BEAT. 

                                 A VOICE
                        OK. Ok. Here I come. 

           Malcolm stands, knife at the ready as a man steps from behind 
           the oak. Tall and solid with a neat goatee. He’s older. White 
           hair, cropped close. 

           This is BILL, 54. Wearing army fatigues and tactical gear. 
           Walks with the confidence of a man who wins the fights he 
           starts. 

           He shields his eyes from the light, approaches slowly.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        That’s enough. 

           Bill stops, hands up. 

                                 BILL
                            (smiling)
                        Alright. 

           Malcolm just stares. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Now what? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What do you want? 
                                 BILL
                        Me? This is your show. Simon Says. 

           Malcolm, flustered, not daring to take his eyes of Bill. He 
           spots a gun on his hip.

           Bill follows his eyes. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        This? Alright. Simon Says put it 
                        down. 

           Bill reaches for the gun. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (almost pleading)
                        Stop. 

           Bill smirks. 

                                 BILL
                        Sounds like a request boy... 

           He pulls the gun. Malcolm TREMBLES. He inches back, trying to 
           retreat. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                            (barking)
                        STOP. 

           Malcolm stumbles, freezes. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        See? Isn’t that better? Now. Put 
                        that blade down. 

           Malcolm, slowly, lowers it to his side. Bill stands there 
           watching him, a cat with a mouse.  

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Good. Come on out ya’ll. 

           Malcolm looks around, frantic as a dozen men emerge from the 
           trees like wraiths. All in paramilitary gear. All Armed. 

           All WHITE. 

           Malcolm’s breath quickens. Bill never takes his eyes off the 
           boy. 

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Let me go! 
           Malcolm looks over to see June, roughly escorted by one of 
           the men. She kicks and swings, but it’s no use. 

                                 BILL
                        Calm down, Junebug. Gonna give 
                        yourself a hernia. 

           Bill walks over to her. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you know how much I worried? 

           He leans down and June SLUGS him. A solid shot. 

           Bill stands, swallowing rage. His man JERKS her back. Bill 
           steps closer, raises a hand to slap her. June flinches. 

           He stops. 

           Points a scolding finger. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        You are an ungrateful child. Just 
                        like your daddy. 

           June lights at this. 

                                 JUNE
                        Where’s my dad? 

           Bill SMILES. 

                                 BILL
                        Bring ‘em both. Fall out. 

           The soldiers hop to action, a pair of soldiers snatch up 
           Malcolm. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        And let me have a look at that... 

           A soldier hands him the knife. 

           They drag Malcolm and June into the trees. Bill follows, 
           looking the blade over. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Cassius, armed with his rifle searches the woods with 
           Mandela. He looks over at his son, a somber thought in his 
           head. 
           He pulls the pistol he found on the dead soldier, hands it to 
           Mandela. 

           Mandela holds it awkwardly. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Take the safety off. 

           Mandela nods, feeling the weight of it.  

           EXT. BILL’S CAMP - NIGHT

           A bivouac near a sloping hill. Multiple campfires. A 
           temporary shelter made from tin siding. 

           Malcolm sits alone at a fire. Two of the white men, faces 
           obscured standing guard. 

           A few others talk and drink. One lounges, lying across an 
           ATV. 

           Bill sits under the shelter, leaned back against the roots of 
           a tree, feet elevated. 

           Malcolm spots June flanked by two men, standing a distance 
           away. He flags her, gets her attention. Malcolm looks around, 
           motioning back toward the woods. 

           Let’s make a run for it. 

           June follows his gaze. Shakes her head. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        June?!

           A wiry, wild eyed man runs past Malcolm’s fire. He’s not 
           dressed like the others. He doesn’t move like the others. The 
           soldier’s stand to attention, ready to go.

           Bill looks up, leisurely rising to his feet. 

           The soldiers get in his way...

                                 BILL
                            (waving)
                        Let him through... 

           They step aside and the stranger pushes past. 

                                 STRANGER
                        JUNE!
                                 JUNE
                        Dad! 

           June leaps up, hugs him tight. He stands back and looks her 
           over. 

           This is DECKARD, 40, stringy and unkempt. He looks like he’s 
           been on a desert island. Bill’s baby brother. 

           Bill approaches. 

                                 BILL 
                        I’ll tell you. Reunion like this... 
                        You’ve got no idea how much joy it 
                        brings. 

           Bill CLAPS. 

           The Soldiers, rowdy and drunk follow. HOOTING and HOLLERING. 
           Deckard looks around. 

           June sneers at her uncle. 

                                 JUNE
                        Dad... can we go? 

           Deckard looks to Bill, who stops clapping. Bill looks around 
           the camp. 

                                 BILL
                         Get set. Moving out in 10. 

           The Soldiers prep their gear. 

           Malcolm, far from Bill and the others, looks around him as 
           the camp springs to activity. 

           AT JUNE’S CAMPFIRE--

                                 DECKARD
                        I just want to take her home. 

                                 BILL
                        And you will Deck. Just a little 
                        detour first. 
                            (to June)
                        We put a lot of time into finding 
                        you, girl. Ironic really. Soon as 
                        he steals you away, he loses you 
                        and comes crying to me to fix it. 

                                 JUNE
                        Dad, what’s he talking about? 
                                 DECKARD
                        Nothing... nothing. 

                                 BILL
                        That’s your problem... I never lied 
                        to that child. 

                                 DECKARD
                            (angry)
                        She’s not your child. 

                                 BILL
                        Then why am I raising her? 

           Bill shakes his head. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Ungrateful. 
                            (scolding)
                        Teaching her all the wrong things. 

                                 JUNE
                        Dad? What’s going on? 

           Deckard stares at Bill a moment, wilting. His anger turning 
           to a plaintive stare. 

                                 BILL
                            (sighing)
                        Your daddy needed my men to help 
                        look for you. He was with the Bravo 
                        team, and one of those boys never 
                        came back from recon. We never 
                        woulda been out here if it wasn’t 
                        for you. And him askin... so it 
                        stands to reason, he’d help me 
                        catch the sonofabitch who killed my 
                        man... and string him up. Least... 
                        that was the terms. 

           Deckard shakes his head, willing this moment to be over. June 
           steps to him. 

                                 JUNE
                        Is it true? 

                                 DECKARD
                        ...you could’ve been killed. 

           June pulls away. 
                                 BILL
                        I swear if we ain’t have the same 
                        daddy, Deck, I’d think you were 
                        half-nigger. Once we get our 
                        killer, you’re free and clear. 

                                 DECKARD
                        You’ve got the boy. He was armed 
                        right? 

                                 BILL
                        Him?
                            (HEARTY LAUGH)
                        That boy is five-six, what, a buck 
                        thirty? Jared was airborne 
                        infantry. TOUGH. That boy ain’t 
                        alone. Now... It’s time to do the 
                        right thing... then you go home. 

           Deckard scowls at Bill, lacking the courage to say anything.

                                 JUNE
                        My dad can’t help you. He doesn’t 
                        know anything. 

           Bill looks to the girl. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        But... I do. 

                                 BILL
                        Deck, she must’ve gotten all the 
                        brains. So. Tell me what you know.  

           June looks back to Malcolm, torn. 

           AT MALCOLM’S FIRE -- LATER

           Malcolm stares up at the hill, at the top. A few trucks 
           parked close. There’s a gravel road. 

           It leads out-- A WORLD OUTSIDE THE WOODS. There is a soft 
           glow, a town, miles down the road. 

           He’s never been this close. 

                                 BILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You seem close. 

           Malcolm snaps out of it, finds Bill standing over him with 
           his knife. 
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                            (motioning with the blade)
                        You and my niece. 

           Malcolm is stoic. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        She’s a sweet girl. Got a good 
                        heart. But... She don’t always make 
                        the right choices. 

           Bill sits. Face to face with Malcolm now. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        You know this isn’t gonna work, 
                        right? Different worlds and all. 
                        You know that. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...yes. 

                                 BILL
                        Yes. Good. What’s best, I think, is 
                        for you and her to part ways. And 
                        you go on back where you came from. 
                        We do the same... Before this gets 
                        outta hand.   

           Malcolm hesitates. Bill takes the knife by the blade, extends 
           the handle to Malcolm. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Go on, son. 

           Malcolm takes the blade. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Run on home. 

           Malcolm stands. The soldiers watching. One of them hands him 
           his backpack. 

           Malcolm takes a look back at June. Guilt racking her. He 
           turns, and runs off into the trees, back toward home. 

           A BEAT. 

           Bill stands. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Well... Let’s go get ‘em. 

           The soldiers fall out. June runs over to Bill. 
                                 JUNE
                        You promised not to hurt him... 

                                 BILL
                            (turning to her)
                        I’m not. I’m gone shoot him in the 
                        head. 

           Bill walks away. June is powerless to stop him. 

           EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT

           Malcolm races through the dark, stumbling and falling and 
           scrambling. Lost. 

           He crests a hill and runs into--

           Mandela and Cassius. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Malcolm!

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad!

           He runs, hugs his father tight. Mandela watches. He and 
           Cassius are surprised. 

           They hold tight a moment. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (pulling back)
                        What the hell are you doing here? 
                        Huh? I told you--

                                 MALCOLM
                        I know. I’m sorry. But... Dad... 

                                 CASSIUS
                        What is it? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We have to run. They’re coming. 

           Cassius sees the terror in his eyes. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Let’s go. Come on...

           He ushers the boys back ahead of him. He turns back to 
           covering their exit, eyes sharp, rifle raised. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The boys race down past the stream, down toward their cabin. 
           Cassius struggles to keep up on his game leg. 

           EXT. MICROBURST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Bill and his men make their way into the clearing. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The cabin in sight. The boys running, a little relief on 
           Malcolm’s face. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We’re almost there. 

           Mandela stops running. Malcolm turns back. Jogs to him. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 MANDELA
                        Where’s dad? 

           Malcolm looks around. They’ve lost him. 

                                 MANDELA (CONT’D)
                            (calling)
                        DAD?

                                 MALCOLM
                        Shh!

           Footsteps behind them. 

                                 MANDELA
                            (relieved)
                        Dad. 

           Two soldiers appear, guns drawn. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Nope. 

           They close in. Malcolm stands in front of Mandela. 

           BLAM BLAM. Two shots ring out. The first soldier drops, dead. 
           The second wheels on the muzzle flash--

           BLAM. He’s struck, falls, lifeless. 
           Mandela stares at the bodies. Malcolm tries to turn him back 
           toward their path. Cassius appears, rifle still raised. 

           He motions toward the cabin. 

                                 MALCOLM
                            (taking Mandela’s hand)
                        Come on... 

           Cassius stops him. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Son... the snares. 

           Malcolm nods. The trio run off. 

           EXT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Malcolm, Mandela and Cassius reach the clearing before their 
           cabin. They sprint across the open expanse, looking back for 
           their pursuers. 

           They reach the cabin. Mandela runs in followed by Malcolm. 

           They stand their, beckoning Cassius. 

           He stops at the door. Pulls to close it. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad? No... 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Barricade it. Defend yourselves.

           Mandela holds up the pistol. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Dad--

                                 CASSIUS
                        You ain’t boys anymore. Look out 
                        for each other. 

           Cassius pulls it closed, hobbles off. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Malcolm and Mandela stand staring at the door. Malcolm steps 
           forward, locks it. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Bill stands over the bodies of the two men Cassius shot. A 
           few of his men stand behind him. 

           Another appears ahead of him. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        We scouted ahead. There’s a cabin. 

                                 BILL
                            (burning)
                        The fuck are ya’ll waiting for? 

           He stands, shoves the man aside. They all follow. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Cassius moves to the woodpile. Drops to his knees, moving 
           logs, giving himself a vantage. 

           He sets his rifle, lays prone, waiting. 

           Cassius catches his breath. 

           WIDE ON THE CABIN, from the woods. 

           SILENT, isolated. 

           INT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT

           The boys race around, closing shutters and drawing curtains. 

           They push furniture against the front door. 

           Malcolm pulls the recurve bow from the wall in his bedroom, 
           collects the arrows. 

           They sit on the floor. 

           Only the sound of their BREATHING. 

           EXT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT

           Cassius, hunkered behind the woodpile, stares down his rifle 
           sight. 

           In the distance, at the tree line, all is still and dark. 

           A LONG BEAT. 
           Something moves. 

           BLAM. 

           Cassius takes his shot. No more movement. He strains to see, 
           can’t confirm the kill. 

           Cassius SWEATS. Breathes deep, trying to calm himself. 

           He steadies for his next shot... But nobody comes. 

           WIDE and HIGH we look down to see--

           The Soldiers creep from the edges of the forest. Cassius, the 
           cabin and the boys are COMPLETELY SURROUNDED. 

           BEHIND THE CABIN-- 

           A pair of soldiers creep toward a side window. 

           AS-- 

           Another man sneaks up on Cassius’ blind side... 

           AND-- 

           Cassius finds a soldier across the field in his sites... 

           AND--

           Mandela spots a shadow shifting down the hall. Picks up his 
           pistol, creeps toward it... 

           But there’s nobody there. 

           WE PULL BACK to see a Soldier, standing silently behind 
           Mandela, just outside the glass window. 

           The man lifts his gun, takes aim--

           EXT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT

           Cassius FIRES at the distant soldier, who drops, struck. 

           A man appears at his side, swings for him with a blade, 
           Cassius rolls out of the way. They WRESTLE. 

           INT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT

           The man in the window turns, distracted. 
           A SHARP WHISTLE. Mandela spots Malcolm aiming his bow, 
           Malcolm let’s it fly, Mandela ducks.

           The arrow shatters the glass, PIERCES the soldier through the 
           NECK. 

           Mandela ducks as the glass rains down. 

           The Soldier CHOKES and SPUTTERS, falling dead on the window 
           sill. 

           Mandela crawls away from the dead man. Utterly shocked. 

           EXT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT

           Cassius and his man, wrestle in the dark, Cassius gets the 
           upper hand, flips him on his back. 

           The soldier gets his pistol free, first a SHOT into Cassius’ 
           left side. 

           He GRITS through the pain, smashes the man’s wrist on the 
           ground until he drops the gun. 

           Cassius drops a few THUNDEROUS forearms. The man goes dizzy. 
           Cassius grabs a log and BASHES his SKULL in. 

           He rolls over on his back. Exhausted. FOOTSTEPS and VOICES 
           echo across the field. 

           Cassius crawls back to the pile, lifts his rifle, positions 
           again. He’s nearly worn out.  

           He looks for targets, breathing heavy. 

           INT. CABIN - SAME MOMENT 

           Malcolm crosses to the dead man, looking him over. He turns 
           back to Mandela. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Y--

           A SHOT from outside distracts him... 

           Another SOLDIER APPEARS, grabs Malcolm from outside the 
           window. They struggle. 

           Mandela fumbles with the gun, tries to fire, but the trigger 
           won’t pull. 
           Malcolm, GASPING and CHOKING, reaches down, grabs his knife 
           from a scabbard on his waist, STABS the soldier in the arm. 

           He SCREAMS, releases. 

           Malcolm scrambles away--

           Mandela finds the safety, FIRES. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM. 

           The soldier drops to the ground, dead. The boys fight to 
           catch their breath, both terrified. 

           Malcolm touches Mandela, who is still pointing the gun. 

           Mandela turns to him, nods. Malcolm nods back. He looks out 
           the window. 

           Points toward the South Woods. 

           Mandela hesitates. Sounds of more GUNFIRE out front. 

           The boys stare at each other a moment, on Malcolm’s face, the 
           look-- trust me.

           Mandela stands, Malcolm grabs one of the dead men’s pistols. 
           Checks for other soldiers. He crawls out the broken window. 

           Helps Mandela. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY 

           Cassius FIRES between ragged breaths. 

           Muzzle flashes from the woods, fire returned from unseen 
           soldiers. 

           ORDERS and RESPONSE. 

           Cassius sinks down behind the wood pile, the situation is 
           desperate. 

           He looks back toward the cabin. 

           Steels himself. Rises again. Shooting with everything he has. 

           And then--

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. 

           The rifle is empty. 
           Cassius pulls it back. Sits with his back to the pile. He 
           grabs the dead man’s pistol. Checks the magazine. 3 or 4 
           rounds left. He loads the weapon. 

           Looks up, wheezing. A silent prayer.

           OUT ON THE FIELD -- 

           The remnant of Bill’s men emerge. Just a handful now, moving 
           toward the cabin. 

           One rides an ATV in.  

           Bill leads them. 

           BLAM. BLAM. 

           Cassius blind-fires over the pile, Bill and his boys hit the 
           dirt, evading. 

           BLAM. BLAM. CLICK. 

           Bill rises again. Motions his men forward. 

           A pair of Bill’s soldiers reach Cassius. They take away his 
           rifle and the dead man’s gun. 

           Bill arrives. He looks Cassius over. Bleeding out, barely 
           awake. 

           Bill nods toward the cabin a pair of men move to search it. 

                                 BILL
                        Up. 

           The soldiers wrestle Cassius onto his knees, hold him steady. 

           They lock eyes. Cassius sizing the man up. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        You’re a brassy fucker. 

           Cassius GRINS, losing consciousness. He spots the WOLF emblem 
           on BILL’s chest. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        Army? 

                                 BILL
                            (nodding)
                        Once. You?  

           Cassius lifts his arm. Bill shines a light on a “Semper Fi” 
           tattoo. 
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                            (almost respectful)
                        Marines. 

                                 CASSIUS
                        ...why? 

           Bill sighs. 

           Bill spots a hunting restriction sign, high up in a nearby 
           tree. 

                                 BILL
                        Just ain’t enough for everybody, I 
                        guess. Not even out here. 

                                 CASSIUS
                            (deep breath)
                        My--

           Bill turns, SHOOTS him twice, point blank in the chest. Bill 
           looks down on Cassius dead body for a moment. 

           The soldiers return from the Cabin. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        It’s clear. 

                                 BILL
                        Bring her. 

           One of his men stomps off. He returns with June and Deck, 
           hands in zipties. 

           She spots Cassius’ mangled frame and nearly vomits. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        What other suprises they got out 
                        here? 

                                 JUNE
                        That’s it. It was just him. 

                                 DECKARD
                        You got what you wanted. 

           Bill frowns, grim. June spots a can of mace on one of the 
           men’s hip. 

                                 BILL
                        Where would they go? 

           June shrugs. 
                                 DECKARD
                            (stepping forward)
                        She doesn’t know anything else...

                                 BILL
                        SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH. 

           He shoves Deckard who tumbles back and falls. As the others 
           look on, June grabs the mace, sprays at the soldiers, Bill 
           shields his face and turns away. 

           June runs off into the South Woods -- after Malcolm. 

           Deckard writhes in the dirt, scrambling to follow, but Bill’s 
           men are on him.  

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                            (roaring)
                        They’re fucking CHILDREN! HOLD HIM. 
                        I’ll get that little bitch! 

           Two men detain Deckard. 

           The soldier on the ATV scouts ahead, Bill goes after her, two 
           other men follow him in. 

           EXT. SOUTH WOODS - NIGHT

           Mandela and Malcolm hustle through the woods, Malcolm 
           leading. They stumble upon the first man Cassius killed. 

           Mandela slows. 

                                 MALCOLM 
                        Come on. 

           Mandela can’t move. He drops into the dirt nearby. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        They could be right behind us. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Dad did this. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        To the man trying to kill us yes. 

           Mandela shakes his head. 

                                 MANDELA
                        Is it any better out there Malcolm? 
                                 MALCOLM
                            (out of hope)
                        It’s not worse. 

           Honesty... for once. Mandela nods. He stands. 

           The ROAR of the ATV sounds. Malcolm looks back, spots the 
           approaching headlight. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come on... 

           Malcolm and Mandela start to run.

           In the distance, the soldier on the ATV spots them. He 
           beelines, speeding up. HOOTING and HOLLERING, like he’s 
           hunting rabbits. 

           Malcolm and Mandela are pushing, but they can’t outrun the 
           thing. 

           The Soldier is gaining. 

           A meter away.

           Yards. 

           Feet. 

           He stands, reaches--

           Malcolm pulls Mandela to the ground next to the trail, out of 
           the ATV’s path. 

           The soldier whizzes by and is nearly DECAPITATED by a high 
           wire, suspended between trees. A snare line.   

           The ATV keeps going. The man COUGHS, GASPS and BUCKS around 
           on the ground, clutching his bloody throat. 

           Malcolm looks back at him. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Come on Man--

           Mandela stands, marches to the injured man and UNLOADS the 
           clip into him. 

           The soldier lies motionless. 

           Mandela looks down on him a moment. Then turns, and walks 
           past, continuing their escape. Malcolm is blown away, he 
           follows. 
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           First Light. 

           The boys emerge from their woods into a misty, cold meadow. A 
           long paved road runs toward a nearby town. 

           Malcolm steps forward. Looks around. Breathes DEEPLY. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We’re out... 

                                 MANDELA
                        But. Dad. 

           Malcolm looks back to the woods. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He wanted you to be safe. 

           Mandela nods. 

           JUST INSIDE The TREE LINE--

           One of Bill’s men takes position. Aims at Malcolm. 

           Malcolm hears a noise, turns. It’s June, SPRINTING, she 
           nearly tackles him and-- 

           BLAM. 

           She takes a bullet. Falls hard right on top of him. Mandela 
           rushes to their side. Malcolm, in shock himself, looks down 
           at June, dying in his lap. 

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                            (shaking his head)
                        ...no... no. No. Why’d you do that? 

           She COUGHS, trying to speak... and dies. 

           Malcolm just sits there. Mandela’s eyes go wild. 

                                 MANDELA
                        She can’t... June? 

           Bill’s men appear. Bill in the center of it. They start 
           crossing to the boys. Mandela pulls his pistol up, rage in 
           his eyes. He raises it, SCREAMS. 

           FIRES, every last bullet. 

           Bill’s men scramble for cover. Bill takes one in the 
           shoulder. 
                                 BILL
                        FUCK! 

           The pistol empty, one of the soldier’s runs up and takes it, 
           SMACKS Mandela to the ground. 

           The Soldiers cover Malcolm and Mandela. 

           Malcolm hasn’t looked up from June. Bill stands, clutching 
           his new wound. 

           Mandela fights free of the soldier, runs to Malcolm’s side. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit. Fine. Fine. He can die 
                        right here. Just dig one hole. 

           Bill lifts his pistol, deliberately. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        I... loved that girl. She was my 
                        blood. 

           Malcolm finally looks up, tears in his eyes. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Just got out of hand is all... 

           Malcolm’s face changes, pure HATE for this man. Bill feels 
           it, grits his teeth. 

           Aims. 

           Then-- 

           SIRENS. Police cars. Trucks. 

           A dozen cops or more. They race out, weapons trained. Take 
           positions. 

           Bill and his men are outgunned. 

           A black woman in dress uniform and a leather coat takes aim 
           at Bill. Steely eyes, hair pulled tight behind her. This is 
           Officer PAT, 35.  

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        PUT THAT DOWN! GET ON YOUR KNEES! 

           Bill looks at the boy. Malcolm looks back. Venom in both 
           their eyes. 

           A STANDOFF. 
           Officers move to flank. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        You want to walk away? 

           A BEAT. 

           Bill lowers the pistol. Throws it away. His men do the same. 
           The cops move in, cuff them. 

           Officer pat lowers her weapon. Cops move in, pull the boys 
           back. One separates Malcolm from June. 

           Officer Pat sees Bill escorted past her to a police car. 
           She’s dumbfounded. 

           Turns to look back at the boys. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Sunrise. The police swarm the cabin and the field. Sweep 
           through, arresting Bill’s men. 

           They free Deck. 

           He ASKS about his daughter. Someone breaks the news. 

           EXT. MEADOW - DAY

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER
                        ...neighbors reported shots... we 
                        get out her and it’s a goddamn 
                        horror show. Far back as the other 
                        access road... bodies... 

           Mandela and Malcolm sit in the back of a police car. Officer 
           Pat breaks off from a group discussing the scene. 

           She moves to the cruiser. 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Mandela and Malcolm stare as she approaches. She looks them 
           over. Bloodied. Cold. Tired. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        ...are you hungry? 
           Malcolm and Mandela exchange looks. They nod. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                            (calling)
                        YATES?

           Another uniformed officer, young, white, handsome. 
           Approaches. He smiles at the boys. 

           They stare back. 

           EXT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - DAY

           A single beat-up cruiser is driving through empty early 
           morning streets.

           A flat, depressed town passes by. Strip malls. Shuttered 
           shops. Empty lots. The part of America that needs to be made 
           ‘great again’-- if ever it was.  

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - DAY

           The boys sit in the backseat. 

           Officer Pat and the white cop Yates, in the front. Yates 
           drives, looks back at the boys in the rearview. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                            (turning)
                        You like burgers and fries? 

           Mandela looks toward Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We don’t know. 

           Officer Pat glances at Yates. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        That’s alright. We’ll find out. 
                        Even get you some shakes.  

           More blank stares. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Ice cream? 

           Nothing. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        You’ll love it. 
           She turns around, the boys look out the window. Officer Yates 
           leans over. 

                                 OFFICER YATES
                            (whispered)
                        What kinda kids never had ice 
                        cream?  

           She jabs him, he quiets down.  

           From the back seat we watch the Police Cruiser gaining on a 
           pickup truck. A confederate flag hands from the back. 

           A bunch of SKINHEAD PUNKS sitting in the flatbed. 

           The HOOT and Holler as the cops roll by. 

           Malcolm and Mandela stare. 

           The Punks start acting like monkeys. Screaming inaudible 
           things. 

           Mandela clutches Malcolm’s hand. 

           Malcolm stares them down. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Idiots. Some cities get mafia. We 
                        get militia. There oughtta be a 
                        law. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           A small town police station. Virtually empty. 

           Mandela swivels in a desk chair, sips a milkshake. Officer 
           Pat sits nearby, watching. 

           Malcolm sits on the other side of the desk, munching fries. 

           Yates sits across the bullpen, filling out a report. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                            (to Mandela)
                        Good hm? 

           Mandela nods, quickly.  

                                 OFFICER YATES
                        I’ll bet. That’s your second one... 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        You can afford it right? 
                                 OFFICER YATES
                            (nodding)
                        I only do it for the money. 

           Officer Pat turns to Malcolm. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        How’s yours? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s good.

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Malcolm, I want to ask you some 
                        questions. 

           Malcolm quickly glances at Yates. Officer Pat follows. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Yates. You mind finishing that up 
                        in a few? 

           Yates looks up. Pat motions to the boys. 

                                 OFFICER YATES
                        Too early to work anyhow. I’ll grab 
                        some sleep before my shift. 

           Yates leaves. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Ok. Do you know where you live? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        In the woods. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Before that. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We always lived there. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        What about... family? 

           Mandela looks away. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Our dad... was in the woods when... 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Ok. Ok. What about your mom? 

           Malcolm shakes his head. 
                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Is there anyone we can call? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why? 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        To take care of you. 

                                 MANDELA 
                        We take care of ourselves. 

           Officer Pat looks between the boys. She sits back. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I have to go pee. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        There’s a bathroom down the hall, 
                        to the left. 

           Malcolm stands, hesitates. Mandela sips his shake. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        I’ll look after him. We’ll be right 
                        here. 

           Malcolm leaves. 

           Officer Pat makes a face at Mandela. He LAUGHS. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           The sound of a FLUSH. Malcolm exits the bathroom. He looks 
           down the hall. 

           Officer Pat is still playing with Mandela.  

           Malcolm looks to his right. An open door. He follows his 
           curiosity inside. 

           There is a smaller set of desks. A shared office. 

           Malcolm takes a seat behind a desk. He leans back in the 
           chair, testing it. 

           Plays with the knick knacks on the desk. Repositions office 
           supplies. Opens drawers. He shuts one--

           REVEALING a handgun in a lower drawer, the lock is broken, 
           the drawer can’t be closed. 

           Malcolm slides the drawer as closed as he can. 
           He looks around the room, taking in the sight of it. On the 
           wall, he sees a set of photos. Police in dress blues. Plaques 
           awarding Distinguished Service. 

           Malcolm stops at one. Reads the inscription, then moves down 
           the line. SMILING. 

           He freezes as he arrives at one picture toward the end of the 
           line. He moves closer, takes the photo down. 

           It’s a labeled, William Finley... and it’s a picture of BILL. 
           The militia leader from the forest... 

           Is a retired COP. 

           Malcolm shudders, stares. Unsure what to do. 

                                 OFFICER YATES (O.S.)
                        We never forget our brothers. 
                            (at the door)
                        Those men are heros. 

           Malcolm looks back at him. 

                                 OFFICER YATES (CONT’D)
                        Every. One. 

           He steps in toward Malcolm. 

           Malcolm breathes heavy. Faster. He glances down, sees the gun 
           in the drawer. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - SAME MOMENT

           Back in the bullpen. 

           Mandela sits across from Officer Pat. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        When you finish, I’ll take you both 
                        somewhere you can get a bath, some 
                        new clothes. You smell like you’ve 
                        never left the woods.  

                                 MANDELA
                        I haven’t. 

           BLAM! BLAM! 

           Mandela springs to his feet. Officer Pat pulls her weapon. 
           She pulls Mandela back, shelters him on the ground behind a 
           desk. 
           Officer Pat moves to the hallway. She makes her way don, 
           slowly, gun at the ready. 

           She looks left and right, the doors all locked but for the 
           bathroom. She peeks in, but there’s nothing. 

           A CRASH in the office at the end of the hall. She moves to 
           the door. Opens it-- 

           Just as Malcolm appears. Officer Pat JUMPS. 

                                 OFFICER PAT
                        Malcolm? You almost gave me--

           She sees he’s still holding the gun.

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Malcolm. 

           He raises his gun. A BEAT. She puts her back in her holster. 
           She’s at his mercy. 

           She sees the photo of Bill on the ground, the frame 
           shattered.

           Officer Pat recognizes the man. She shakes her head -- this 
           isn’t right.

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        The man from the meadow? 

           Malcolm sizes her up.  

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Yates.

           WIDE and we see Yates, bloodied and still on the ground. 

                                 OFFICER PAT (CONT’D)
                        Son... 

           Malcolm stares her down. Something new in his eyes, something 
           cold. Something... absent. Something lost.

           He fingers the trigger well. And we--

                                                               CUT TO:

           BLACK. 

                                 THE END
