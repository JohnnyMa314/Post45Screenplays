           INT. PCC PRISON - NIGHT

           Blue security lights blink on caged PRISONERS in the dark. 
           Intermittent flashes of rippling arms with shamrock tattoos. 
           A forehead with NORTE scrawled across it. 

           A BURST of hot orange light illuminates a perfect gladiator 
           ring of cells. The terrifying contours of a panopticon glow. 
           The massive INMATE POPULATION, under the orange blast, is now 
           visible in its grotesque entirety.

           Smoke rises past the cells and billows into a hallway on the 
           heels of a RUNNING man. In the distance, somewhere behind the 
           rushing smoke: RAPPING. DERANGED LAUGHTER. ONE PROMINENT 
           MONKEY CALL. 

           A windowed door glows at the end of the hallway. Outside, red 
           desert swirls beneath a street lamp in a parking lot caged in 
           barb wire.

           The man runs to the door. He tries to open it. It’s locked. 
           His face is a black shape against the street lamp. He 
           breathes HEAVILY. A huge PUFF of smoke, DISTANT SCREAMING and 
           RAPPING, envelops him. 

           His BREATH quickens. Through the window, red dust blows 
           wildly, cloaking the lamp’s light in cloudy bursts of red. 
           The RAPPING GROWS as we push into the blinking red light. 

           The murky light becomes hotter, digital. The RAPPING begins 
           to ECHO. A number materializes. Then many numbers, which 
           finally emerge as giant belts of infinite, moving red data. 

           The belts of data swim across buildings as the RAPPING fades.

           The buildings are Wall Street skyscrapers swathed in the S&P 
           and the DOW. A plastic bag blows before them, flashing red.

           EXT. SONORAN DESERT - ARIZONA - NIGHT

           A recreational DRONE buzzes through the twinkling desert sky. 

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                             (pressured, manic)
                        Did you know the CIA gives Taliban 
                        informants pens with invisible ink? 

           Two ROTC SCHOLARS in ARMY UNIFORMS and shaved heads squat in 
           desert scrub. ETHAN BLACKMAN (18), a massive American ox with 
           intense eyes, pilots the drone from his iPhone. MARCO SANCHEZ 
           (18), pimpled, slight, watches in awe.
                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        They mark insurgent, trucks and 
                        shit, so the CIA knows where to 
                        send the drones.

           SUPERIMPOSE: PIMA STATE UNIVERSITY. TUCSON, ARIZONA.

                                 MARCO
                        ... Whoa. Whoa. 

           Ethan lands the drone before them in a puff of dust. He 
           removes FIREWORKS, duct tape, a lighter, and a marker from a 
           backpack. He starts taping the fireworks on the drone. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (singing)
                        OH say can you see! By the dawn’s 
                        early BLIGHT! 

                                 MARCO
                        Holy shit. 

           He giddily draws an X on Marco’s forehead. 

                                 ETHAN
                        You been marked, insurgent. 

                                 MARCO
                             (laughing nervously)
                        Dude, what the fuck?

                                 ETHAN
                             (slipping on his backpack)
                        It’s gonna track us. 

           The drone WHIRS to life and lifts. Ethan lights the fireworks 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        5 seconds ... 5.. 4... Get running, 
                        bitch! 

           They BOLT across the desert. The drone takes off after them. 

           Angle from the DRONE CAMERA chasing the boys -- euphoric  
           daredevils, laughing, sprinting through the desert. The drone 
           lowers down to chase them at their level. Ethan’s energy is 
           unbridled and mounting. He HOOTS and HOLLERS. They spring 
           onto a desert road, panting. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Kakawwww!

           The drone hurtles toward the boys. The first firework SHOOTS. 
                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Left!

           Marco hesitates and splits right. 

           A wide aerial of the desert: The fireworks EXPLODE like 
           THUNDER. A huge BURST of light illuminates PIMA STATE CAMPUS. 
           A CAMPUS POLICE CAR TURNS ON ITS SIREN LIGHTS.

           The drone zips overhead, pivots, chases them. They backtrack. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        HOLY SHIT!!!! 

                                 MARCO
                        What the fuck’s wrong with it?! 

           They race across a desert highway. HEADLIGHTS BLAZE. A truck 
           speeds down the road. The drone zips across the road, right 
           on their tail. It grazes the truck and SPLINTERS into pieces. 

           The truck SCREECHES and SWERVES, CRASHING into an embankment.  
           The desert silence is broken by the truck’s blaring HORN. It 
           BEEPS, stuck, for what feels like forever. 

           The kids, panicking, slowly drift toward the car. 

           A DRIVER in a cowboy hat spills out of the car, clutching his 
           stomach, the wind knocked out of him. 

                                 ETHAN
                        ... Are you OK? Sir?

                                 DRIVER
                        ...What the fuck...are you doing? 

           The driver, his hands shaking, dials 911. He looks terrified 
           as Ethan -- this 6’6 manic bull -- approaches him.

                                 ETHAN
                        Sir, are you hurt?

                                 DRIVER (INTO PHONE)
                        I just had an accident. Two guys 
                        lit fire crackers, and crashed some 
                        fucking thing into my car. 

           The faint sounds of distant SIRENS. Ethan starts to panic.

                                 ETHAN
                        Sir, please, it was an accident. 

                                 DRIVER (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, right off I-10 by Pima State.
                                 ETHAN
                        There’s no need for this. SIR!

                                 MARCO
                             (to Ethan)
                        Tone it down, man.

           The SIRENS grow louder. They’re getting close.

                                 DRIVER  (INTO PHONE)
                        ... I hear sirens. 

                                 ETHAN
                        We can handle this ourselves! We 
                        can handle it. FUCKING LISTEN TO 
                        ME!

                                 MARCO
                        Dude!

                                 DRIVER (INTO PHONE)
                        One of them is becoming irate. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why the fuck won’t you talk to me 
                        directly? 

           SIRENS BLARE. Ethan’s eyes dart towards the CAMPUS COP CAR. 

                                 DRIVER  (INTO PHONE)
                        Someone’s here. 

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re human. I’m human. Humans 
                        converse!

           The cop car pulls up. Its headlights shine BLINDING LIGHT on 
           Ethan GRASPING at the driver’s phone. TWO COPS exit the car.

                                 COP 1
                        Sir, you need to calm down and step 
                        over to the car, please.  

           Ethan backs away. They encroach upon him like hunters going 
           for outsized prey. 

                                 COP 1 (CONT’D)
                        You been doin’ any drugs today? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Don’t touch me.

           They try to grab him. He jumps aside, a wild, unhinged moose.
                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fucking touch me! I’m a 
                        service man. I SERVE YOU

                                 COP 1
                        Son, we need to search your bag.

                                 ETHAN
                        Then it’s Hi! Hi! Hey! The Army’s 
                        on its way!

           They pounce on Ethan. He pushes them off and SCREAMS WILDLY.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck off me!

                                 COP 1
                        Do not resist. 

                                 ETHAN
                        FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!

           They cuff him, pull him upright, rip off his bag and dump the 
           contents. A computer and a zip-lock bag of PILLS crash to the 
           ground. Marco paces nervously.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        And the Army goes rolling along!!!

           INT. SIGNET CAPITAL, ELEVATOR - NYC - MORNING

           A WOMAN (33), sharp grey suit, head down, stands before an 
           embedded HD SCREEN playing CNBC. Her face is a vacant shadow 
           against the jagged red topography of a stock plummeting down 
           a TICKER.

                                 ANCHOR CNBC (OVER TV)
                        They’re calling it the 
                        ‘pharmaceutical Enron.’

           The elevator doors open. She lifts her head: she’s remote, 
           beautiful, scrappy, thick Texan accent. This is CHASE MORRIS.

                                 CHASE

           TRACK Chase out of the elevator across the male-dominant 
           trading floor of a huge hedge fund. An associate, LUIS, 
           catches up with her. They continue down the floor.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        Do you not stream news on Twitter

                        normal person?

           They reach an Art Deco sitting room guarded by a SECRETARY. 
           Open mahogany doors frame a sprawling office. RAJIT KHAN, the 
           hedge fund Svengali, is on the phone, his feet on his desk, 
           next to an excessive display of fruit and pastries.

                        much fruit, it’s not good. 

           Rajit waves her inside. She shuts the doors. Rajit hangs up.

                        I fucking told Sarah to buy Comtax.

                                 RAJIT
                        How much did you tell her to buy? 
                        And did you know she was going to 
                        sell it today? 
                             (off Chase’s silence)

                        Don’t get emotional. Numbers don’t 
                        have feelings. Emotion won’t get 
                        you very far. 

           INT. SIGNET, ROOF - NIGHT

           Champagne, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres fly around on silver 
           trays. Chase sips scotch at a high top replete with SIGNET 
           wives and some TOAD FACES from her office. Chase is in hell.
                                 SIGNET WIFE 
                        A half-way decent baby nurse in New 
                        York? $150,000 in cash, minimum. 

                                 SIGNET GUY
                        That’s a quarter million taxable 
                        income.

                                 SIGNET WIFE
                        You give birth and instantly you’re 
                        “mommy the ATM.” Nothing’s better 
                        though. Motherhood’s like a spell. 

           Chase swipes a scotch from a passing tray. The wife squirts 
           hand-sanitizer in her hands and goes for a bowl of nuts. 

                                 CHASE
                        Nice touch.

                                 SIGNET WIFE
                        I’m in love with your accent. Where 
                        are you from? 

                                 CHASE
                        The sticks.

           THE CHIMING OF CHINA. Rajit toasts a champagne flute beside 
           SARAH BERGEN (40), patrician and ruthless. He slides a 
           paternal arm around her. Chase assumes a place next to Luis.

                                 RAJIT 
                        When I hired Sarah, I asked why she 
                        loved finance. She replied, ‘living 
                        on Earth is expensive. But it 
                        includes a free trip around the 
                        sun.’  

           Polite chuckles.

                                 CHASE
                             (sotto, to Luis)
                        And that’s the only thing we get 
                        for free. Apparently at lunch, 
                        today, she raised an additional 5 
                        billion from Blackstone. Even with 
                        this Comtax shit, how in the actual 
                        fuck?

                                 LUIS
                        Her father’s a billionaire?

           EXT. SIGNET, ROOF - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Chase smokes by a heat lamp into the slick black NYC rain. 
           Sarah Bergen joins her and lights her own cigarette.

                                 CHASE
                        Jesus, the wives in here. How much 
                        Botox and pills and neglected 
                        children will it take to realize 
                        you’re already dead? 

                                 SARAH BERGEN
                             (laughing)
                        How’s your personal life? Still 
                        nonexistent? 
                             (dragging her cigarette)
                        You know Rajit would sooner die 
                        than give you credit for anything.

                                 CHASE
                        Like you gave me credit for Comtax? 
                        You’re a real piece of work, you 
                        know that? You bitch about wage 
                        inequality, the female minority on 
                        Wall Street, yet you’re first in 
                        line to screw another woman. 
                             (flicking her cig)
                        And I’d love to tell Rajit to fuck 
                        off into oblivion. But 
                        unfortunately, Sarah, daddy didn’t 
                        buy me a hedge fund.

           EXT. MIDAS GOLD MINE - NEVADA - JUST BEFORE DAWN

           A 2 miles-wide adobe red gold mine. A post-apocalyptic 
           amphitheater cast in dark shadows pierced by dawn. DEEP IN 
           THE MINE, TRUCKS scoop gold ore with huge shovels.

           SUPERIMPOSE: MIDAS GOLDMINE, NEVADA

           JEROME ALVAREZ (42) Black-Dominican, soulful despite years of 
           punishing work, operates a LOUD truck. He’s coated in dust. 
           His BOSS waves him down. Alvarez hops off.

                                 BOSS
                        Just got word from on high. We’ve 
                        gotta reduce you to part time.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        What the fuck, Bobby? I’ve got 
                        three kids, man. 

                                 BOSS
                        Well, I sure as hell didn’t tell 
                        you to have that many. 
           INT. ALVAREZ’ HONDA - NEVADA HIGHWAY - TWILIGHT

           The sky is a faded blue in the thin light of daybreak. 
           Alvarez smokes and squints into the sun. The rearview mirror 
           catches his tense eyes. On his temple, there is a tiny tattoo 
           of a black square. 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NEVADA - MORNING 

           A rundown TRAILER HOME cuts the soaring cerulean sky. Alvarez 
           parks in a patch of gravel, littered with toys. He spritzes 
           himself with cologne and pops a mint.

           INT. ALVAREZ’ LIVING/ROOM KITCHEN - NEVADA - MORNING

           Alvarez plugs in an iron. He flips it over, inserting the 
           handle into the grooves of an oven, so the mirrored end faces 
           up. He fills a pan with water and puts it on the iron. He 
           fills a tea kettle and puts it on the stove. MARIA (3) 
           precocious, light-skinned, waddles in, dazed. 

                                 ALVAREZ (IN SPANISH)
                        You awake?

                                 MARIA 
                        No.

           Alvarez ushers her through a tiny living area with a ceiling 
           of stained Styrofoam tiles. They enter a bedroom quietly, so 
           as to not wake his visibly pregnant wife, EVA (30). Maria 
           crawls into bed with her, sucking her out of a deep sleep. 

                                 EVA (IN SPANISH)
                        Oh, shit. Good morning. 

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Alvarez pours the boiling pots of water into the bathtub. 
           Steam rises as he strips off his T-shirt. Faint morning light 
           travels over a maze of crucifix tattoos on his back that 
           appear to cover older ink. 

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Alvarez and Eva wash their beautiful daughters Maria and 
           OCTAVIA (4) in the warm bathtub. Alvarez smiles and smooths 
           water over their heads as they splash around. He looks at 
           Eva, she’s beautiful, but frail and sickly. Their 
           conversation drifts in and out of Spanish and English.

                                 ALVAREZ (IN SPANISH)
                        How you feeling?
                                 EVA
                        Like I ain’t got debt and mouths to  
                        feed. 

           Alvarez smiles sadly, picks up Octavia and towels her off. 
           Eva leans in and kisses him.

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        You’re smoking again.

           Alvarez ignores her. Octavia runs to the bath and helps Maria 
           struggle out of it. 

                                 OCTAVIA 
                        Maria’s too wet!

                                 EVA
                        You think that shit relaxes you, 
                        but it stresses you.

           The girls run out of the room, trailing water and laughter. 
           Alvarez leans on the bathtub and looks away from Eva.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        I got let go today. 

           Eva’s face falls. She decides to handle this gingerly.

                                 EVA 
                        Did you get in a fight with Bobby?

                                 ALVAREZ
                        There were cuts. That’s it!

           Alvarez dries his hands and starts to leave the room.

                                 ALVAREZ (CONT’D)
                        That job was a thankless piece of 
                        shit. I’m gonna find something 
                        else. With benefits. 

           INT. ALVAREZ GARAGE - LATER

           Alvarez smokes at a shabby desktop computer, searching jobs 
           on Craigslist -- “willing to work,” “need janitors 
           immediately”, “hood cleaner.” He scrolls head on into 
           frustration. He pauses suddenly -- “Correctional Officer. 
           Salary and Benefits, ARIZONA.” He clicks on the link. A web 
           site opens. A guard stands proudly before the American flag 
           and a slogan: PCC. America’s Excellence in Corrections. 

           Alvarez’ reflection is caught in the computer, as he exhales 
           the final pull on his cigarette and stubs it out. He pulls 
           back his lower lip revealing a tattoo inside. It reads NORTE. 
           INT. HOLDING CELL, AZ COUNTY JAIL - MORNING

           Marco is asleep on the cell ground. Ethan, eyes dark and 
           bloodshot, jumps up and down, trying to tire himself out. He 
           still hasn’t slept. A GUARD appears and motions for Marco.

                                 GUARD
                        His parents are here.

           Ethan shakes Marco. The guard opens the cell and cuffs him. 
           Ethan watches Marco escorted out. The doors CLANG behind him.

           trading monitors at the foot of Chase’s bed. Chase ZIPS up 
           carry-on luggage in an unmade mess of sheets, and wheels it  
           through the antiseptic luxury bedroom. Enormous and

           JOHN LAWSON(R. AZ), septuagenarian, scrappy enough to skirt

           New Inmates. New day. Ethan sits with his head in his hands. 
           Dark circles have grown under his eyes. 
           He still hasn’t slept. The guard appears and hands Ethan a 
           docket. Ethan looks up with alarmingly bloodshot eyes.

                                 DR STEIN (PRE-LAP)
                        Did you stop sleeping before or 
                        after you started using Oxycontin?

           INT. PIMA STATE, PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - LATER

           SGT. DANIELS and DR STEIN (F60s) sit in sterile white chairs. 
           Ethan sits before them, bobbing his knee restlessly. He bites 
           his nails raw. His red eyes are wounds in dark circles. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Before.

                                 DR STEIN 
                        Do you feel propelled by energy you 
                        can’t control? Does your mind race?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yes.

                        Do you ever feel depressed?

           Ethan breaks down sobbing.

                                 ETHAN
                        I had to buy Oxy. You guys would

                        You present as bipolar. It’s very 
                        Dangerous not to treat it. This 
                        medication will help you stay in 
                        control. To feel in control. 

           She writes up two prescriptions and hands them to Ethan. He 
           looks young and fragile suddenly. He chokes on his tears.

                                 SGT. DANIELS
                        Ethan, we have to revoke your 
                        scholarship. And Pima is expelling 
                        you. I’m sorry. 

           INT. PHARMACY - DAY

           Ethan leaves the counter clutching a pharmacy bag. He rips it 
           open and chooses the KLONOPIN. He pops two.

           INT. HENRY BLACKMAN’S HOME - TUCSON, ARIZONA - DAY

           Blinds shut out the day. The floor is strewn with pizza boxes 
           and water bottles. A MAN chain smokes before a TV. Ethan 
           enters, stoned. He passes a photo of a smiling YOUNG CADET.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        I paid your bail. 

           Ethan’s father HENRY is obese, depressed, medicated. The 
           harrowing metamorphosis of the soldier in the photo.

                        You better pay me back. I won’t 
                        make rent.
           Ethan crosses behind him. Henry’s dead hand whips into a 
           snare around Ethan’s forearm. Ethan tries to break free, but 
           they contort into an arm wrestle. Henry attempts to 
           extinguish his lit cigarette into Ethan’s arm. Ethan snatches 
           the cigarette with his free hand and pushes it into his own 
           flesh. Henry releases Ethan. Ethan walks off.

           Alvarez descends a mountain pass. A MASSIVE PRISON 
           PANOPTICON, nestled in adobe red mountain ranges, expands 
           into a panorama. Huge, red PCC logos are visible on the 
           distant prison buildings. A town borders the complex. Tract 
           houses. A gas station. A grocer. A post-office. A court. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: PCC CORRECTIONAL. PINAL WAY - FLORENCE, ARIZONA.

           EXT. PCC PINAL CORRECTIONAL, THE YARD - DAY 

           American flags and flags with PCC logo encircle the complex. 
           Alvarez walks in a LINE of PEOPLE, a melange of RACES, some 
           fit, some obese, some elderly or barely of age. GARTH CARRICK 
           (50s) 6’5, bolo tie, and HARRINGTON (20s), a zealous

           Through a coughing fit, Alvarez manages an assault exercise. 
           The other potential HIRES cough violently and peel off.

           Alvarez sits, shirtless, on an examination table. A DOCTOR 
           inspects his body. An EXAMINER photographs his tattoos.

                                 WARDEN MELODY (PRE-LAP)
                        Ever been convicted of a felony?

                                 ALVAREZ (PRE-LAP)
                        No. But I did probation for a 
                        misdemeanor as a minor.
                                 WARDEN MELODY (PRE-LAP)
                        For what?

           The doctor shines a light in Alvarez’ mouth. Alvarez 
           stiffens, nervous. They do not pull down his lower lip.

                                 ALVAREZ (PRE-LAP)
                        Simple assault. It was twenty years 
                        ago, you know?

           INT. WARDEN MELODY’S OFFICE, PCC PRISON - DAY

           WARDEN MELODY (40), a Latina woman in a tight bun with the 
           soul of a white Republican male, sits at a desk. A poster of 
           a cowboy lassoing the words WARDEN is nailed behind her. A 
           photo of her at a firing range is taped on the wall. Near it 
           hangs a poster of Osama Bin Laden with a bullet through his 
           head. She studies photos of Alvarez’ tattoos and suddenly 
           fires out a question in Spanish, clearly a native speaker.

                                 WARDEN MELODY <<IN SPANISH>>
                        Ever been in a gang, Mr. Alvarez?

                                 ALVAREZ
                        No. 

           She continues the conversation in perfect American English.

                                 WARDEN MELODY
                        PCC’s a family company. Most of our 
                        folks have lived right here in the 
                        valley for generations. My father 
                        worked here for thirty years. I 
                        worked along side him for twelve. 
                        He was very lucky to come here from 
                        Mexico and thought being a CO was a 
                        calling. Folks thanked him all the 
                        time for keeping them safe. 
                        Safety’s what it’s all about. And 
                        prison is a very dangerous 
                        environment. We’ve got highly 
                        manipulative criminals. We’ve got 
                        proprietary security features. So, 
                        our CO’s understand information 
                        here is under seal. PCC requires 
                        all employees sign confidentiality 
                        agreements. Violating this 
                        agreement has serious consequences.

           She hands him an NDA. He peruses it, signs, and returns it.

                        I don't give a fuck if I’m digging 
                        graves. We’re not having a sick 
                        kid. They give me a 401k. They give 
                        my family insurance. You tell me 
                        where else a nigger ex con can get 
                        that.

                        I need two years, and we can move 
                        somewhere permanent. Put the girls

           EXT. COURTHOUSE, PARKING LOT - DAY

           Ethan walks across the tar lot in his Sunday best. He opens a 
           bottle of Klonopin. His hands tremble as he pops three. 

           INT. ARIZONA COURTROOM - MORNING

           Ethan appears drugged, depressed. He sits by a shabby PUBLIC 
           DEFENDER. Marco’s in the witness box. Ethan can’t even look. 

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        Did Ethan Blackman sell Oxycontin

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        Did you see him do it?

                        Conjecture. 

                                 JUDGE CARTER
                        Irrelevant. The defendant possessed 
                        sixty pills of Oxycontin on a 
                        college campus. Intent is 
                        mandatory. Counselor will you 
                        continue to waste my time because 
                        you don’t know federal drug law? 
                        Law, I remind you, that was upheld 
                        just last week.

           The military psychiatrist occupies the witness box.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST 
                        Ethan Blackman is severely bipolar. 
                        I’m treating him with Klonopin and 
                        Lithium. He’s showed almost 
                        immediate improvement. But prison 
                        is very dangerous for someone in 
                        his condition. All the excess 
                        stimuli could induce mania.

                                 JUDGE CARTER
                        Son, do you intend to stay on these 
                        medications?

           Ethan nods. Carter shakes his head a beat.  

                                 JUDGE CARTER (CONT’D)
                        Well, I applaud your seeking 
                        treatment, and encourage you to 
                        continue on that path. But 
                        unfortunately, no one here, least 
                        of all me, is free to do some 
                        interpretative dance of mandatory 
                        sentencing law.

                                 FOREMAN
                        The jury finds the defendant guilty 
                        of felony possession in the fourth 
                        degree with intent to distribute.

           On Ethan, terrified. Then...
                                 JUDGE CARTER 
                        In violation of section 8.18-403.5 
                        the court sentences Ethan Robert 
                        Blackman to 8 years in prison. 

           EXT. PCC HEADQUARTERS - PHOENIX, ARIZONA - MORNING

           Chase sits in a curtained Maybach with KEVIN MYERS(45) peppy, 
           milquetoast, General Tassin’s right hand. The window curtains 
           frame churning red dust from the desert road outside. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: PCC HEADQUARTERS. PHOENIX, ARIZONA. 

                                 KEVIN MYERS 
                        The mission of PCC is to secure 
                        America. That starts with inmate 
                        rehabilitation. 

           Chase looks through the windshield as they turn into the 
           circular driveway of a massive, all-glass CRESCENT SHAPED 
           building. A fountain spritzes in the driveway. American flags 
           flank the entrance underneath huge PCC logos. 

           INT. PCC HEADQUARTERS, HALLWAY - DAY

           Chase and Myers walk down the hallway. RAW BLUEPRINTS OF 
           PRISONS, framed museum quality, adorn the walls. 

                                 KEVIN MYERS
                        They are prisoners, but we believe 
                        redemption is their right. 

           Chase studies an ornate tapestry of scripture on the wall: 
           CAST YOUR CARES ON THE LORD AND HE WILL SUSTAIN YOU; HE WILL 
           NEVER LET THE RIGHTEOUS FALL. 

           INT. TASSIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A modest office. GENERAL TASSIN (60), half Native American, a 
           hard read, dons a cheap oversized suit. A wood cross hangs on 
           the wall behind him. Framed photos surround it: Tassin on a 
           helicopter with Kissinger. Tassin at the White House. Tassin 
           on a tractor. Kevin Myers stands dutifully off to the side. 

                                 TASSIN 
                        The big man on campus gets the 
                        smallest office. Sets the right 
                        tone. 

           He offers Chase a seat.

                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        So, Chase Morris. SIGNET. Big fund. 
                        $50 billion under management?

                                 TASSIN

                                 TASSIN
                        How’d a nice Texas girl end up a 
                        Harvard MBA? 

                                 CHASE
                        Harvard’s red neck quota, I guess.  

           Tassin breaks into uproarious laughter.

                                 TASSIN
                        I grew up on a Native American 
                        reservation. Educated in a one-room 
                        schoolhouse. White daddy. Left me 
                        at 0. General’s my Christian name. 
                        You know why my mother gave me that 
                        name? Because she always wanted me 
                        to feel important even if I wasn’t. 
                        You’re lookin’ at class of ‘65.

                                 CHASE
                             (charming)
                        It’s a shame we didn’t overlap. 
                        Forgive me if I plow right in. I’ve 
                        studied PCC very carefully, and I 
                        think you’ve overlooked the 
                        company’s hidden value.

           Tassin smiles and looks over at Kevin Myers.

                                 TASSIN
                        And how’s that?

                                 CHASE
                        Your revenues are generated by the 
                        number of occupied beds, right? On 
                        paper, PCC looks exactly like a 
                        hotel chain. Inmates equate to 
                        customers. PCC should become a 
                        REIT: A Real Estate Investment 
                        Trust. You will bypass corporate 
                        income tax, and generate a cool 
                        billion in tax revenue by the end 
                        of the fiscal year. If the SEC 
                        approves.
           Tassin studies her with sudden disapproval.

                                 TASSIN
                        Do you have ANY idea how many live 
                        bodies revolve in and out of the 
                        penal system each year?

                                 MYERS
                        7 million. Live bodies. 

                                 TASSIN
                        When I formed PCC, private prisons 
                        didn’t exist. The nation was 
                        rotting with decrepit facilities 
                        and a surplus of criminals it 
                        couldn’t afford to house. It was a 
                        damn emergency, in my view, to 
                        inject market efficiency into a 
                        broken system. But with all due 
                        respect, Ms. Morris, there’s a 
                        helluva difference between all

                        down there, and plain old efficient

                        provider behind the fed, 
                        understand? We’ve got government 
                        partners in every last corner of 
                        the nation. And when Wall Street 
                        pokes its toe in government waters, 
                        folks assume it’s dirty business.

           INT. ALVAREZ’ HONDA - DUSK

           Alvarez and Eva drive down Pinal Way, vacant and flush 
           against flanking red dust. A reflection of barb wire bleeds 
           over the windshield and expands into the PCC panopticon. Eva 
           looks out the windshield. The kids sleep soundly in the back. 

           Alvarez looks out the drivers’ side window. A pawn shop. A 
           junk yard. A liquor store with a sign, “WE CASH GOVERNMENT 
           CHECKS.” Double wides pepper the roadside. 

           They turn into the lot of a double wide covered in chipped 
           paint. FIGHT DOGS, chained to a metal fence around an 
           adjacent lot, BARK wildly as Alvarez pulls in. A NEIGHBOR, 
           Caucasian (40s),  in a wife beater, comes out of the house, 
           grabs the dogs by their collars and waves to Alvarez.

           INT. ALVAREZ’ DOUBLE WIDE, KITCHEN - FLORENCE, ARIZONA - DUSK

           A linoleum tiled kitchen extends into a grey-carpeted living 
           room. The dwelling is modest but dwarfs their former place. 
           Alvarez runs the faucet as the girls cling to the counter. 
           Maria unloads groceries into the fridge.

                                 MARIA
                        This whole house is ours?

           Alvarez chuckles. Octavia tries to touch the running stream. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Hey! Careful. 

           The water begins to steam. Maria tries to touch it. Alvarez 
           swats her hand away. 

                                 ALVAREZ (CONT’D)

           BOY (32), a hardened, black FATHER (50), five young BLACK 
           MALES, and a fat LATINO MAN (40). Ethan studies the PCC flags

           DARK CELL. BARS SLAM. Ethan looks around. A white guy (50s), 
           prescription aviators, a zombie junkie, is passed out 
           upright. This is DON. Photos of Don at a healthy weight, with 
           a glowing FAMILY at their McMansion, are pinned to the wall. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Garth helms the room. Alvarez stands beside him sizing up the 
           space. It’s vacant save 15 OFFICERS -- all WHITE MEN aside 
           from 2 BLACK MEN, 1 LATINO, 1 WHITE WOMAN -- suiting up

           BASCH (44), a tough softy, shakes Alvarez’ hand.

                                 BASCH

           The CO’s HOOT and WHISTLE at the news. Harrington hands 
           Alvarez a box of Charmin Ultra ‘ridged.’ 

                                 HARRINGTON
                        This goes to Cell 88.

           They CO’s start filing out. Basch grabs Alvarez.

                                 BASCH
                        D-POD’s a right of passage, bro. 
                        But listen, do not fuck with Tyler 
                        Lott. He’s a lethal motherfucker. 
                        Once he stuck safety pins all over 
                        his body, walked around like that 
                        for a fuckin’ week. Man feels no 
                        pain.

           INT. D-POD, DON/ETHAN’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           The CELL POPS OPEN. AUTOMATED. A CAVERNOUS BOOM. 

           Ethan peers out of the cell. ALL THE DOORS on his tier are 
           open. INMATES herd toward him unshackled. No guards. Ethan 
           exits. The RUSH of INMATES propels him down his TIER. 

           All the cells are empty, save CELL 88. It’s double normal 
           size. A queen bed. Two TVS on mute. A man is visible from the 
           back. He’s covered in tats and scars: THE AF, 8.8, SWASTIKA, 
           SHAMROCKS. This is TYLER LOTT (50). We never see his face. 

           Ethan and his herd reach an OPEN CHOWHALL. They join a 
           frenzied mesh of INMATES: An elderly white man with 
           Osteoporosis. Strung out ADDICTS of all ages and races. A 
           BESPECTACLED BLACK GUY in a wheel chair. BIG BOY. They form a 
           scattered FEED LINE.

           Huge white INMATES, hairnets, SHAMROCK, 8.8., SWASTIKA 
           TATTOOS work the FEED LINE. All of them are ARYAN FEDERATION. 

           A BAND of ARYANS peacock aggressively through the hall. When 
           the ARYANS reach feed, the INMATES in line part as if 
           commanded by God. Aryans eat first. Always. They grab trays. 
           A massive Aryan heavy, ASHTON KELLY (21), smiles at Ethan. 
           Ethan matches him in size - a yet unadulterated doppelganger. 
           They slide their plates on deck. They’re piled with food. 

           Ethan examines the horde of UNAFFILIATED INMATES. Many appear 
           very UNDERFED.

           A BAND of NUESTRA FAMILIA, built LATINO GANGSTERS NORTE, X14, 
           N14 TATS, stride across the hall. They are consolidated but 
           highly outnumbered by the ARYANS. They wait to eat.

           The ARYANS finish feed and corner off a section of chow. 
           Ethan and the other inmates line up. Ethan is next to a 
           strung out, black inmate. The inmate gives his plate to RYAN 
           C., fucked up teeth, 8.8. face tat.

                                 RYAN C.
                        Your JPAY’S empty. 
                                 STRUNG OUT INMATE
                        It’s comin, man. My girl, she said 
                        by the 13th. Come on, man. 

           Ryan gives the inmate a GOLF BALL size portion of GRITS. He 
           walks away. Ethan gives Ryan his plate. Ryan hands it back.

                                 RYAN C.
                        Swim away, new fish.

           Ethan sits down with an empty tray next to the old white man 
           with Osteoporosis. He also has a golf ball size portion. He 
           traces it with a pen. He eats the food leaving a tiny circle.

           INT. C-POD - LATER

           BUZZER SOUNDS. Green-iron bars open onto a dirt-caked hallway 
           in disrepair. Alvarez descends the hallway. The walls are 
           holey, exposing pipes. Flanking cells are over capacity. 
           Legions of underweight inmates are crammed together like a 
           train in Maoist China. Whites, blacks, Latinos, are clustered 
           in no apparent order. A flurry of gang tattoos. 

           Alvarez reaches the vast metal doors where C-POD ends. BUZZ. 
           The doors OPEN onto D-POD chow. The cavernous hall teems with 
           unshackled inmates. It hits Alvarez like an oncoming truck.

                                 INMATES
                        YOBWOC, mothafucka! And he got 
                        Charmin ridged.

                                 BLACK INMATE
                        Like wiping yo ass with velvet 
                        potato chips. ALL NIGHT!

           Alvarez weaves through the hall, concealing his terror.

                                 BLACK INMATE 2
                        And he a nigger!

           Two INMATES surround Alvarez.

                                 BLACK INMATE
                        ALL NIGHT!

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Back the fuck off, man. 

                                 BLACK INMATE
                        (pointing to a huge cell) 
                        88, my negro.
           The inmates scatter, as Alvarez approaches the cell. He 
           reaches the cell and stands hesitantly in the doorway. Two 
           TVS on mute [CNN, CNBC] silhouette TYLER LOTT in bed.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s cowboy spelled backwards?

           Tyler stands with a partially devoured plate of pancakes. His 
           body is scarred, but his face is clean and chiseled. No face 
           tats. A blonde biker beard. A thug intellectual messiah. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        What’s. Cowboy. Spelled. Backwards?

           Ashton Kelly appears behind Alvarez and snatches his mace.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        YOBWOC. Yellow, obnoxious badge we 
                        often con.

           Tyler takes the box of Charmin and points to a ceiling camera

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Say cheese. 

           Kelly laughs and throws Alvarez his mace. Alvarez catches it 
           with one hand, eyeing Kelly with disgust.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Alvarez fills out a punch card. Basch pats him on the back.

                        How’s the first day of potty

            Garth walks in. He snatches the shift log and reads it.

                        You can’t leave it like this.

                        That’s an eight hour shift.

           INT. TYLER’s CELL - LATER

           Tyler and Kelly dump the Charmin on Tyler’s bed. Piles of 
           contraband tumble out: weed, heroin, coke, cigs, razors.

           INT. DON/ETHAN’S CELL - LATER

           RAP and REVELRY BLAST from somewhere O.S. DON is passed out. 
           Ethan lays in bed. Kelly files in.

                        Don Don, rent’s due... Yo, DON!

           Don wakes up and languidly hands Kelly a cell phone.

           Kelly throws a bag of heroin to Don. Don starts cooking.

           Don shoots up. Kelly rubs Don’s head like a dog and walks 
           out. RAP BLASTS LOUDER. Ethan peers out of the cell.

           MASTURBATION SOUNDS from a neighboring cell. Ethan battles 
           insomnia. A prisoner CRIES out from BELOW. Dawn creeps in. 
           Ethan punches a wall and draws blood on his knuckles. Ethan 
           gets up. He spies a tin of heroin under Don’s pillow. He 
           slithers his hand under the pillow. Don presses a shank to 
           Ethan’s neck, and opens his eyes.

                        concerned, it’s a real estate

                        drives mass incarceration. Take PCC 
                        contracts. They require the

                        full or our taxes pay the 
                        difference. They call it the “bed

                        criticizing SIGNET’s overall 
                        strategy. And used this deal as a 
                        prime example... 

           The studio backdrop plays Sarah’s interview. Chase is livid.

                        I’m not a “pump and dump” investor. 
                        Take this PCC deal. They’ll squeeze 
                        the board, skim the profits, and 
                        dump the stock. I doubt anyone from 
                        SIGNET has set foot in a prison. 
                        Their rationale? It’s a tax deal. 
                        What does it matter? I care about 
                        America’s long term prosperity more 
                        than that.

                        First of all, Ms. Bergen has made a

                        certainly not how we see it. 
                        Helping great companies enhance 
                        profits is in no way, not even 
                        remotely, a bad thing. And PCC is a

           WIDE on the second tier cell block: Ruiz’ crew is diluted, 
           locked among disparate cells. Basch locks up his final 
           escort, a tiny Norte, JOSE PENA. M RUIZ is last to be housed. 
           Alvarez leads him down the tier as his scattered crew RAPS.

                        ransom!!

           An ELDERLY NORTE, part of the diluted ranks already in this 
           prison, spots M RUIZ and yells excitedly from his cell.

                                 NORTE PRISONER <<IN SPANISH>>
                        General Ruiz! The original 
                        mothafuckin’ gangsta. Respect, OG.

           Alvarez locks Ruiz in an adjacent cell. Only the old Norte’s 
           hands are visible, hanging through the bars next door.

                        are starving. Mi general.

           Ruiz pushes his cuffed hands through the bars and motions for 
           the NORTE to grab them. The Norte holds on tight -- a moment 
           of pure solidarity. Ruiz suddenly lets go and seizes Alvarez, 
           banging his mouth into the cell bars. He thrusts his chin at 
           Alvarez’ tattooed temple.

                        You an ex-banger, pendejo? 

           Basch breaks into a sprint at the other end of the tier.
                                 M RUIZ
                        We want our JPAY cards. Fuckin’ 
                        house nigga.

           RUIZ’ voice rises and RESONATES in the caverns of the pod.

                        Watch your motherfuckin’ mouth.  
                        PENDEJO.

           C-POD’s 1st tier doors are open onto D-POD Chow. Lott watches 
           them from C-POD Chow below. Harrington passes Lott and slinks 
           into C-POD’s 1st tier. He radios to Basch and Alvarez.

                                 HARRINGTON (INTO HIS RADIO)
                        Give ‘em their Jpay cards and bring 
                        ‘em to commissary. And put the 
                        midge beaner in D-POD.

           INT. DON/ETHAN’S CELL - LATER

           Basch locks Peña in the cell. Peña sizes up Ethan. Ethan 
           looks around. There’s no bed for Peña. Peña lies on the floor

                                 PEÑA
                        It’s cool, white boy.

           INT. COMMISSARY - LATER 

           Alvarez escorts M RUIZ and his NORTES into commissary. ARYANS 
           man the commissary counter from within a metal cage with a 
           backdrop of packaged food. The NORTES slap commissary request 
           lists and JPAY cards on the counter. The ARYANS run the cards 
           with suspect politeness and hand over boxes of food. 

           INT. D-POD - CHOW HALL LATER 

           CHOW DIN. ARYANS feast in their territory. ARYANS man feed. 
           Ethan stands miserably in line amidst the scraggly HORDES. 

           M Ruiz bursts into chow with his CREW, carrying crates of 
           FOOD. Alvarez trickles in behind them. The hall falls still. 
           RUIZ sizes up the room -- the starving PRISONERS, the diluted 
           NORTES, the consolidated ARYANS. He motions to Peña who joins 
           them. EVERYONE watches, confused, terrified, as RUIZ’ crew 
           corners off part of chow and rips into the FOOD. 

           The ARYANS calmly continue feed. Tyler carries on eating as 
           if nothing is amiss. He doesn’t even look up from his food.

           The OLD NORTE joins Ruiz CREW. Gradually, gun-shy NORTES 
           who’ve lived here longer, drift toward Ruiz’ posse. They give 
           pounds and share the commissary bounty. Forty NORTES are 
           suddenly eating together freely.

           Tyler finally lifts his head and silently beholds this 
           ceremonial piss on his crew. 

           INT. C-POD FIRST TIER - LATER 

           Alvarez escorts the NORTES into C-POD. D-POD CHOW DOORS CLANG 
           SHUT behind them, blocking out the DIN. As Alvarez leads the 
           NORTES down first tier, they throw packaged food to other 
           NORTE inmates. 10,20,30, catch them ravenously. 

                                 NORTENO 1
                        Internet Norteño bringing you the 
                        biggest shit on the planet, Ese. 

                                 NORTENO 2
                        La raza! Biggest shit on the 
                        planet, taco bell!

           NORTES crack up laughing. Alvarez locks them in their cells.

           INT. D-POD, DON/ETHAN’S CELL - LATER

           Ethan sits up in bed, his head up against the cement wall. He 
           watches Peña, lying on the floor, blowing smoke rings from a 
           cigarette. Don reads in bed. ASHTON KELLY, RYAN C, BIG BOY, 
           slither into the cell. They casually hold rolled socks that 
           conceal something heavy. Don slinks out of the cell.

                                 ASHTON KELLY
                             (to Peña)
                        Buenos Dias. So. I’m curious. 
                        What’d you eat for breakfast?

           JOSE P continues smoking, badly concealing his terror.

                                 ASHTON KELLY (CONT’D)
                        You deaf, motherfucker?

           They surround him and uncoil the socks, weighted by padlocks.
                                 ASHTON KELLY (CONT’D)
                        Breakfast. What did you eat?

           Metal padlocks fly. Swift, dark pendulums. Peña SHRIEKS.

           Ethan remains in bed, frozen in fear. Tyler enters the cell. 
           The serene predator, he films the assault with an iPhone: 
           ARTFUL SHOTS of padlocks bludgeoning Peña in SCREAMING AGONY.

           INT. C-POD SECOND TIER - LATER

           Alvarez locks the last NORTE in the overcrowded cells. He 
           turns, caught by the sound of distant screaming, which barely 
           pierces the dull roar of C-POD’s inmates. 

           INT. D-POD, ETHAN’S/DON’S CELL - SAME TIME

           Four NORTES charge the cell. Twenty ARYANS BLOCK them. The 
           assault is partly obscured by a wall of legs. Blood seeps 
           through the gaps of their feet. 

                                 ASHTON KELLY
                        Fuck off pendejos, or we’ll skin 
                        you at night!

           The NORTES withdraw. Tyler hands Ethan the phone.

                                 TYLER LOTT
                        Film it. 

           Ethan, trembling, takes the phone and captures the scene. 
           Tyler reads a commissary list with the tenor of a professor.

                        Yes.

                        That exact meal three times daily

                        YOU THIS? 

           The ARYANS taunt Peña, whirling locks over his mangled body. 
                                 TYLER LOTT (CONT’D)

                        weeks? That’s $285,007.80!!!

           Tyler grabs the phone from Ethan and turns it on himself. 
           Below him, fast sharp, padlock hits. Peña SCREAMS.

                        THE MONEY COMING FROM? 

           Tyler turns the phone on Peña.

                        ENTER THEM!

           Peña punches in the numbers with his bloodied hands. 

           INT. C-POD SECOND TIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Alvarez rushes along second tier. As he nears D-POD, Peña’s 
           screams amplify. He sprints down the stairwell to first tier.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO RADIO)
                        I think someone’s being attacked in 
                        D-POD. Copy? 

           INT. DON/ETHAN’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler grinds his foot into Peña’s wounds. Peña howls. The 
           ARYANS exit the cell and peacock around chow as Tyler yells.  

                                 TYLER LOTT

           INT. C-POD FIRST TIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Alvarez bursts through the CHOW HALL DOORS onto --

           D-POD CHOW

           He scans the 3 tiers of cells bordering Chow -- not a single 
           guard amidst this caged colosseum. He spies blood oozing from 
           a cell in the distance. He runs to the cell, past the ARYANS, 
           who congregate in a nonchalant huddle.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO RADIO)
                        I need medical. There’s blood all 
                        over the place.

                                 RADIO (OVER RADIO)
                        20 minutes.

            Ethan runs out of the cell. Alvarez chases him. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Get on the ground. Now!

           Alvarez sprays him and cuffs him to a nearby column. Ethan 
           coughs uncontrollably. Alvarez runs to Peña and gets on his 
           knees in the pool of blood.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO RADIO) (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck, 20 minutes? He’s 
                        gonna die, man. 

                                 RADIO
                        20 minutes.

           The RADIO cuts out. He notices Peña’s NORTE tat. Panicking, 
           he looks at his own hands, his knees, soaked in blood. 

           INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - LATER

           Ethan, wheezing, eyes burning, is handcuffed to a stool 
           outside the doctor’s office. Basch and Alvarez hover over 
           Peña’s unconscious, nearly dead body, carelessly unstrapped 
           on a gurney. One leg hangs perilously off it. The DOCTOR 
           emerges from a DOORWAY. They wheel Peña inside. 

           INT. A BARE QUESTIONING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Garth sits on a chair backwards. The spray still constricts 
           Ethan’s breath. He rubs his burning eyes with his shackled 
           hands. Alvarez is frantic. 
                                 GARTH
                        Who’s this?

                                 ALVAREZ
                        The cellie. He was standing by the 
                        body when I found it.

           Garth stands, unbuttons Ethan’s shirt, and inspects him.

                                 GARTH
                        Got any tattoos?

                                 ETHAN
                        No.

                                 GARTH
                        Go upstairs, write them up for 
                        mutual combat. Six more months for--  

           Garth looks in Ethan’s uniform. A tag: ETHAN BLACKMAN # 11230

                                 ETHAN
                        I didn’t do anything!

                                 GARTH
                        Six more months for Ethan Blackman 
                        here, and Jose Peña. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        You’re charging the victim?

                                 GARTH (INTO RADIO)
                             (eyeing Alvarez, angry)
                        I need a prisoner escort from 
                        questioning. 

                                 ETHAN
                        It fucking wasn’t me!   

           Harrington storms in. Garth addresses him.

                                 GARTH
                        Write up Peña and Blackman for 
                        mutual combat.

                                 ETHAN
                        I want a grievance form! I know my 
                        rights! You fucked up Fascist hick!

                                 GARTH
                        You want a grievance form? Here, 
                        you little piss ant.

           Garth pushes him into a desk and thrusts a paper in his face.
                                 ETHAN
                        I can’t see!

           Harrington drags Ethan to a fountain, washes out his eyes, 
           and throws him back onto the desk. Ethan writes furiously.

                                 HARRINGTON
                        That’s enough, Hemingway.

           Harrington drags Ethan out.

                                 ETHAN
                        I want my grievance filed! I want 
                        my meds! I want a shower! This is 
                        illegal! I didn’t do shit you limp 
                        dick, red neck faggot!

           The doors slam behind them leaving Alvarez and Garth alone.

                                 GARTH
                        Never contradict your superior in 
                        front of an inmate. It’s not your 
                        job to ask questions and create 
                        more chaos. You eat the chain of 
                        command with a grin on your face. 
                        Got it? 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Familiar PCC FACES, Harrington and Garth, play darts and take 
           shots. Alvarez and Basch smoke at the bar. 

                                 BASCH
                        You, OK? 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Fuckin’ savage ... But, yeah. Yeah. 

                                 BASCH
                        Attaboy. Just keep telling yourself 
                        that and soon enough, you’ll 
                        believe it. Goin’ on 15 years, bro.  

           Alvarez presses on. He’s clearly not alright.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        What was I supposed to do? They got 
                        1 guy for 5 floors, 300 inmates, 
                        some of ‘em lifers. What’s stoppin’ 
                        em all from just ending me, man? 
                        They couldn’t get me backup for 20 
                        fuckin’ minutes. What’s up with 
                        that shit?
                                 BASCH
                        An army can't operate if its 
                        soldiers run around like chickens 
                        with their heads cut off. Your job 
                        is to follow orders, get through 
                        your shift, and trust your superior 
                        ranks know what the fuck they're 
                        doin. (beat) Look, every job, every 
                        big corporation’s got something you 
                        might not agree with. But people 
                        like us? We don’t get stock 
                        options. People like us don’t get 
                        401ks. You get to be part of 
                        something here, bro. 

                                 HARRINGTON
                        Yo, Basch, call your sister, you 
                        prick!

                                 BASCH
                        In this country, if you ain’t part 
                        of a corporation, you’re on the 
                        outside of life. 

           INT. D-POD, DON/ETHAN’S CELL - NIGHT

           Night settles in outside the window. Ethan hovers vigilantly 
           over Don, on the lookout for the perfect moment to rob him. 
           When Don looks adequately passed out, Ethan reaches under his 
           pillow for the tin of heroin. It’s not there. Don’s desperate 
           junkie eyes pop open. As Don reaches for his shank, Ethan 
           smothers him silent with his pillow. He rifles through Don’s 
           pockets for his iPhone and JPAY card.

           LIGHTS ON. DOOR POPS.

           Ethan sprints out of his cell through the chow hall -- 
           prisoners trickle out of their cells behind him. 

           INT. THE COMMISSARY - MOMENTS LATER

           ARYANS perch like vultures over the room. Ethan, terrified 
           but starving, approaches the COMMISSARY COUNTER. Kelly stands 
           in the cage, smiling before the rows of food. Ethan hands him 
           the JPAY card and scans the merchandise. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Um, a TWIX. A box of TWIX.

           Kelly swipes the card.

                                 ASHTON KELLY
                        Don Don gave you his card? U suck 
                        his dick?
           Kelly hands over the box of Twix and the card.

                                 ASHTON KELLY (CONT’D)
                        100 bucks. 

           Ethan grabs the Twix box, rips it open and gobbles a bar. As 
           he turns to leave, M RUIZ and his CREW filter in. They swarm 
           over commissary in an ominous configuration. Seated ARYANS 
           stand on the defense. Suddenly, RUIZ starts RAPPING -- a 
           brilliant messiah rallying his disciples. 

                                 RUIZ
                        A rider in this blood, Imma 
                        northern Cali thug. 

                                 NORTES/RUIZ
                        No one’s runnin up less they wanna 
                        slug.

           The NORTES beat box and make beats on the walls, on the 
           commissary cage -- a unifying, soulful rap. 

                                 RUIZ
                        Catch me in the streets, hustlin, 
                        holdin it down. All flamed up ready 
                        to go round for round. 

           The ARYANS begin to surround them.

                                 NORTES/RUIZ
                        We got glocks techs n’ 3 by sex. 
                        Don't fuck wid, us you’ll end up 
                        dead.

           More ARYANS enter commissary, diminishing the NORTE ranks. 
           The NORTES rap resiliently, and beat box louder and louder as 
           the ARYANS multiply around them.

                                 NORTES/RUIZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m an X FOUR rider known to creep 
                        like a spider. Fast deets spits 
                        fire, man I’ll never retire. 

           The NORTES reach in their pockets and throw their JPAY cards 
           on the ground. They are cut in half. Unusable.

                                 NORTES/RUIZ (CONT’D)
                        With a pistol by my hip mothafucka 
                        don’t trip. When we ride we dip. 
                        Free bout nothin this bitch.

           The ARYANS now outnumber the NORTES four to one. They pin the 
           NORTES to ground, as they RAP with raucous, proud resistance. 
                                 NORTES/RUIZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m an X FOUR rider known to creep 
                        like a spider. Fast deets spits 
                        fire, man I’ll never retire!!!!

           Amidst the mayhem, Ethan manages to slither into-- 

           THE HALLWAY

           He smashes straight into Tyler. He looks up in terror.

                                 TYLER LOTT 
                        They call grievance forms the spine 
                        of order in the wild. Not in here. 
                        (pushing Ethan into the wall)
                        Do you know where you are, son? 
                        This is a for-profit prison.
                        Your body trades on the Stock 
                        Exchange. It lurks in millions of 
                        401ks. And mutual combats rack up 
                        fees. See, if a guard found us 
                        cutting your head off while sucking 
                        my dick, they’d still write you up.  

           EXT. CHASE’S OFFICE, SIGNET - MORNING

           A PROTEST. MOTHERS, FATHERS, SIBLINGS, SCREAMING WITH SIGNS: 
           NO PRIVATE PRISONS! NO MANDATORY SENTENCING! NO BED QUOTA! 

           A tearful young mother YELLS at Chase.

                                 MOTHER
                        My son is not a paycheck!

           Rajit approaches the building in a rage. Chase follows him.

           INT. SIGNET, ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Chase and Rajit stand shoulder to shoulder before the HD TV.

                                 RAJIT
                        Your position is the GDP of fucking 
                        Guam. When I said this could be a 
                        very dark association, I did not 
                        mean go on fucking television. 

           The elevator doors close. They lift off.

                                 RAJIT (CONT’D)
                        I’m aware this is America, and you 
                        can’t take a breath without 
                        dissent, but I explicitly asked we 
                        not take out a 13-d and make this 
                        public.
                                 CHASE 
                        You knew we’d have to take out a 13-
                        d to acquire a position with any 
                        real influence. And a road show to 
                        promote stock is completely 
                        standard. That’s why I went on 
                        television.

                                 RAJIT
                        You went on television to plaster 
                        your face on the deal. Precisely, 
                        because I told you not to. 

           Ding. The elevators open. They walk down the HALLWAY.

                                 RAJIT (CONT’D)
                        And you lied. Using my name. On 
                        broadcast news. Tell me one good 
                        reason why I shouldn’t fire you 
                        right now.

                                 CHASE
                        Because I have more conviction 
                        about this deal than anything in my 
                        entire shit-eating tenure at 
                        SIGNET. 

           They walk into -- 

           RAJIT’S OFFICE

           Huge trading monitors. STOCK TICKERS. Chase clicks PXW stock.

                                 RAJIT
                        How apropos. Because for the sake 
                        of my reputation, I want a photo of 
                        you cleaning a felon’s toilet bowl.
                             (into the phone)
                        Janice, get me Tassin at PCC. 

                                 CHASE
                             (tapping the monitor) 
                        The stock is up 6 points since my 
                        interview.

                                 RAJIT
                        What the fuck does that have to do 
                        with the SEC? Or this celebratory 
                        fucking parade that my fund is 
                        behind the deal? If you fuck this 
                        up, I will seize your options and 
                        render you unemployable. Just get 
                        it done. Legally. Quietly. And get 
                        rid of it.

                        Mr. Khan, to what do I owe the 
                        pleasure?

                                 RAJIT (INTO PHONE)
                        The pleasure’s all mine, really. 
                        When’s the soonest we can have Ms. 
                        Morris inside an active facility?

                                 TASSIN (OVER SPEAKER PHONE) 
                        Against our policy. Safety issues. 
                        Only way in’s a felony conviction, 
                        or an inmate in the family.

                                 RAJIT (INTO PHONE)
                        I have beneficial ownership of your 
                        company, Mr. Tassin. A position I’m  
                        willing to unload today if you 
                        don’t let me inside my own 
                        investment. And when the market 
                        sees I’ve sold a quarter billion of 
                        your stock, you’ll have one hell of 
                        problem.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           A matte black Mercedes truck zooms into the lot, churning red 
           dust. CORPORATE GUARDS, in black uniforms, get out. 

                                 BASCH
                        Fuck. Corporate.

                             (exiting, shouting)
                        Time for the monkeys on the ground 
                        to dance! 

           Basch HUMS a song. Everyone suits up. Harrington reenters the 
           locker room with a RAT on A LEASH. EVERYONE starts WHISTLING. 

                                 HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        This is our school mascot. His name 
                        is Kevin Myers.

           Everyone LAUGHS. Harrington walks the rat around the room. 

                                 HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Oooo widdle Myers you’re so cuddly.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        That’s fucked up.
                                 GARTH
                        Cut it out, Harrington. (shouting) 
                        Follow me, ladies!

           INT. COMPUTER LAB - LATER

           Garth stands before all the CO’s sat before computers. 

                                 HARRINGTON
                        WOOOEEEE! PCC up and paid for some 
                        new ass shit.

           Garth holds up a paper shift log.

                                 GARTH 
                        As of today, paper shift logs are 
                        obsolete. Corporate is switching to 
                        a digital system called KRONOS. 

           ON THE COMPUTERS: BYZANTINE LOGS. Endless colored codes and 
           columns.

                                 GARTH (CONT’D)
                        Row E, pod. Row F, shift. Row E, 
                        shift command name. Column A, 
                        maiden names. Column B, middle 
                        names. Column C, first names. 

           Alvarez peers at the log: it’s totally indecipherable. 

           Basch puts on reading glasses.

                                 BASCH
                        Jesus Christ. It’s gonna take us 20 
                        hours just to clock out. 

                                 GARTH
                        I don’t give a shit if it takes you 
                        two days! Tattoo it to your fucking 
                        foreheads. Table N, overtime. 

           INT. PRISON ADMIN HALLWAY - LATER

           The CORPORATE GUARDS IN BLACK UNIFORMS huddle inside an 
           office scanning paper logs into an armada of scanners 
           attached to desktop computers. Kronos software blazes on 
           their screens. Alvarez eyes them en route to C-POD.

           INT. C-POD FIRST TIER - CONTINUOUS

           Alvarez descends C-POD as irate NORTES harass him. He scans 
           the ceilings, noticing loose electrical wires.
                                 M RUIZ
                        You ever gonna let us at chow,

                        LA RAZA!

           A light bulb fizzles out behind Alvarez as he walks into -- 

           D-POD - CHOW HALL

           INMATES swarm. D-POD’s original NORTES are diffuse and 
           obedient with Ruiz and his crew locked in C-POD. Tyler and 
           the ARYANS hold court by feed. Ethan is thinner, on a 
           perilous edge of sleep deprivation. Alvarez assumes a place 
           against a wall.

           INT. PRISON ADMIN HALLWAY - LATER

           Ceiling lights power off in an ominous cascade down the hall. 
           The distant FILE ROOM blacks out. Corporate guards disappear 
           in the dark. The WHIR of a dozen bulky Xerox machines 
           powering down. 

           INT. D-POD - CHOW HALL

           A CAVERNOUS BOOM. THE LIGHTS IN D-POD CHOW TURN OFF. TOTAL 
           DARKNESS. 

           Inmates CHANT and bang tables: hooting, hollering, stomping 
           their feet like Johnny Cash has come to Folsom Prison. 

                                 INMATE
                        PRISON BLACKOUT! HUA!

           Alvarez moves through the darkness, the maze of bodies, 
           punctuated only by his breath and inmates slithering by him. 

                                 INMATE 1
                        Yo, badge.

                                 INMATE 2
                        Where da cowboy at? 

           The STOMPING GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER. 

           Distant light glows from C-POD. Alvarez looks hopefully onto 
           C-POD hall. Its lights extinguish, one by one, as cell lock 
           mechanisms malfunction, and doors burst open like dominoes.

           SCREAMING and YELLING in Spanish travels from C-POD. 

           BLUE SECURITY LIGHTS TURN ON -- a faint, flickering border. 
           It illuminates Ethan, cowering against a wall.
           INTENSE BANGING. SHOUTING AND YELLING IN SPANISH. A flash of 
           blue light outlines a horde of NORTES, led by M RUIZ, RUSHING 
           THE CHOW HALL FROM C-POD. They charge the feed line and tear 
           it apart in a frenzy. Alvarez beholds the seeds of revolution 
           in sheer terror.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO HIS RADIO)
                        We need to be evacuated. Now.

           The radio crackles. The sound of no one on the other end. 
           Alvarez grabs his OC and waves it blindly in the dark.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO HIS RADIO) (CONT’D)
                        Code red. 

           The chow hall doors LOCK from the outside. They’re trapped. 

           SHOUTING, SCREAMING. Light flickers on the feed line, now in 
           a whirling brawl. Trays of food crash to the floor.

           Ethan and unaffiliated INMATES grasp desperately at scraps of 
           food. Tyler barks at them. 

                                 TYLER
                        Sit the fuck down.

           INMATES scatter like Gazelle in the Serengeti and sit.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO HIS RADIO)
                        SOMEBODY FUCKIN HELP ME, MAN!

           Hands ensnare Alvarez’ chest. He drops his radio and mace. 

                                 M RUIZ
                        You a bug, mothafucka? Wanna dance 
                        on the blacktop?

           Light glimmers over M RUIZ. Three NORTES blink in blue light 
           behind him. They pounce on Alvarez as Ruiz rips off Alvarez’ 
           shirt and inspects his tattoos. He pulls back Alvarez’ lip. 
           The NORTE tattoo glistens in the blue light.

                                 M RUIZ (CONT’D)
                        La Raza. Is your spine made of 
                        dollar bills, Ese? 

           AN ALARM SOUNDS. 

           The NORTES are caught off-guard. Alvarez breaks free and 
           bolts. He searches frantically along the floor for his mace. 

           THE OVERHEAD LIGHTS TURN ON.
           ARYAN and NORTE bodies contort in a spinning brawl. The feed 
           line is upside down. Food and trays are strewn everywhere. 
           Starving inmates, Ethan among them, are caught like scared 
           dogs snatching food from the ground.

                                 TYLER
                        What’d I just say? SIT THE FUCK 
                        DOWN.

           The helpless herd disperses and sits.

           Alvarez SPRAYS mace into the brawl, catching Kelly’s face.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Everyone, get on the fucking 
                        ground! 

           Two sprays, and he’s out. The fight sieges on. 

           Suddenly, TEAR GAS pours from the ceiling vents.

           Everyone breaks into coughing fits. The NORTES clutch their 
           stomachs and dissipate. The ARYANS fight through the spray 
           and circle Alvarez like vultures. Kelly kicks him in the 
           back. He buckles and falls. The Aryans close in on him, as 
           Lott pants and yells like a black minstrel.

                                 TYLER
                        Massa, massa, the house nigga will 
                        sell you up da river so to massa he 
                        look bigga. HOUSE NIGGERS DO NOT 
                        SPRAY THE BRAND!!! 

           THE CHOW HALL DOORS FLY OPEN. GARTH, HARRINGTON, BASCH plow  
           in wearing RIOT gear and gas masks. The ARYANS ease up. 
           INMATES are strewn everywhere, coughing, pissing themselves. 
           Garth throws gas masks to Alvarez and Tyler. 

                                 GARTH
                        Fuckin mess. Get Ruiz’s bitches 
                        back in C-POD!

           Basch and Harrington cuff RUIZ’ CREW in the background. 
           Alvarez puts on the mask and hoists himself up. 

                                 TYLER
                        Does you compute, house nigger?

           Alvarez loses it and lunges at Lott. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        You wanna do me like that? HUH?

           Garth restrains him. 
                                 GARTH
                        Whoa, whoa.

           Garth cuffs Tyler and leads him out. Alvarez seethes. 

                                 M RUIZ
                        We’ll pop you, puta BITCH! Por La 
                        Raza! 

           Tyler laughs and gives a thumbs up. 

           INT. WARDEN MELODY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Melody uncuffs Lott. They sit. The energy is charged.

                                 MELODY
                        You need to tighten your shit up. 
                        Way up. 

                                 TYLER
                        I need housing moves. Nuestra

                                 TYLER
                        This prison is a dilapidated 
                        fucking ruin! Your security 
                        procedures are such shit, your food 
                        supplies so minute, your parking 
                        lot attendant baby-shitters so 
                        inept, you RELY ON ME. So, do you 
                        want to continue the empty threats? 
                        Or do you want me, your only 
                        solution, to give you fucking one?

           A coarse moment of silence. She’s cornered. 

                                 MELODY
                        You give me a sound plan for order, 
                        and it’s yours. As always.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 

           Alvarez is falling apart, drenched in sweat. His hands are 
           bruised. He strips off his uniform as Basch hovers over him.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        What the fuck’s going on in here, 
                        man?
                                 BASCH
                        Electrical malfunctions happen. 
                        Doesn’t make it OK. Alright? 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Fuck. FUCK!

           Basch grabs him, not fucking around.

                                 BASCH
                        Shut the fuck up and listen. Why do 
                        you think they put cowboys in D- 
                        POD? They’re telling you -- the 
                        second you step in here, you’ve got 
                        two masters, PCC and the Aryan 
                        Federation. And it’s lethal to fuck 
                        with us. We call it going dark.

           INT. C-POD, SECOND TIER - LATER

           GUARDS hurl M Ruiz’ CREW from their cells with brutal force. 
           Harrington and another guard exert excessive force on Ruiz, 
           SLAMMING him against the bars of the ELDERLY NORTE’s cell. 
           Ruiz thrusts his arm inside. The elderly man clasps his hand, 
           accepting a crumpled RED LETTER before Ruiz is DRAGGED away. 

           INT. SOLITARY - LATER

           A harrowing block of SOLITARY cells. Twenty solid metal cages 
           of profound darkness, isolation and filth. MOANING INMATES 
           hang LIMP ARMS through their single shred of freedom -- a 
           thin, dark food slot. This is the torture of the damned. 

           Wires hang from the ceiling. Light bulbs swing like pendulums 
           Vermin scuttle across the zone. Harrington and Basch lock M 
           RUIZ and his crew onto the zone. They brutally SLAM the 
           doors, sealing them irrevocably in this extreme solitude.

           INT. D-POD, FIRST TIER - LATER

           Ethan hyperventilates in bed. Suddenly, over a LOUDSPEAKER. 

                                 TYLER LOTT (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
                        Attention D-POD. For the next 48 
                        hours, this pod will be totally and 
                        utterly silent. If I hear so much 
                        as a fart in the fucking wind, your 
                        rent will double. If you have chow 
                        rations, they will be cut. If you 
                        haven’t earned chow rations, your 
                        earning requirements will double. 
           Cells containing ARYANS pop. They step out and fan over the 
           pod like guards. Ethan eyes BIG BOY as he passes, stone 
           faced. The pod falls totally, utterly silent.

                                 TYLER LOTT  (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Hush a bye baby on the tree top. 
                        When the wind blows the cradle will 
                        rock. When the bow breaks, the 
                        cradle will fall. And down will 
                        come baby, cradle and all.

           INT. PCC SOLITARY, THE DEAD MAN’S ZONE - LATER

           NORTES hang limp arms through the slots. Tyler, Kelly, BIG 
           BOY, charge onto the zone armed with mace and iPhones. They 
           seize the hanging arms, and spray the NORTES in the face as 
           they SCREAM. They film each brutal second with the iPhones.

           INT. D-POD - LATER

           Tyler throws a heaving, spitting young NORTE into the middle 
           of CHOW. Prisoners in surrounding cells watch in silence. 

                                 NORTE 
                        I’m blind! I’m BLIND!

           INT. BLACK ESCALADE, GEORGETOWN, D.C. - NIGHT

           Zuckerman and Lawson ride in the back of an Escalade. They 
           pull up to a valet line -- town cars, SUVs, Maybachs -- in 
           the driveway of a sprawling Georgetown mansion. Guests step 
           out of the automobiles in black tie.

                        You’ll need a majority on the

           INT. GEORGETOWN MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A fancy party in full swing. Uniformed waiters abound with 
           champagne. The wealthy schmooze with government officials. 
           Lawson and Zuckerman approach Homeland Secretary WILMOT DEAN -
           - army medals, will slice your balls off -- in mid 
           conversation with a PANTSUIT.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        I don’t think half the whackos in 
                        this country should have the right 
                        to vote. It’s the goo goo syndrome. 
                        (noticing Lawson) 
                        Secretary! Had a chance to approve 
                        our budgets yet? 
                             (then, to the suit)
                        Will you excuse us? 

           Dean leads them to sit in nearby leather chairs. Dean plunks 
           down and lays into Lawson.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN (CONT’D)
                        While you hold our budget hostage, 
                        the security of the world is at 
                        stake. Homeland is the world, 
                        Lawson. The fucking globe. 
                             (then) 
                        Who’s your friend?

                                 LAWSON
                        Max Zuckerman. Brawn and Scheck.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        Christ, our Senate Appropriations 
                        Chairman’s on a goddamn date with a 
                        hired gun. Is there no decency? 

                                 LAWSON
                        Look, Dean, I’m gonna draft an 
                        additional spending provision for 
                        your budgets. 34,000 arrests a day, 
                        mandated and budgeted for --  

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        Budgeted for by whom?

                                 LAWSON
                        By me. Aka the Senate 
                        Appropriations Committee. I’ll 
                        draft it, approve it. And so forth.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        34,000 arrests a day, that’s gonna 
                        cost, shit, what?
                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN (CONT’D)
                        8 billion in manpower? $100 dollars 
                        a goddamn head. That’s great. You 
                        give Homeland the money to arrest 
                        them, and where the fuck are we 
                        gonna put all those bodies? 
                             (to Zuckerman) 
                        Or is that where your sweetheart 
                        comes in?  Who you shootin’ for, 
                        son?

           EXT. ALVAREZ’ FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           Alvarez sits on the steps, staring into the dark, chain-
           smoking and drinking a beer. Eight empty beer bottles 
           surround him. Eva comes out of the house. She crouches next 
           to him and holds him. 

           A dog HOWLS from the adjacent double wide. Eva and Alvarez 
           look over. One of the fight dogs spills onto the porch with a 
           bloody face. The owner follows him, holding a looped leather 
           belt one uses as a whip. He sets a bowl of food on the porch, 
           and kneels by the dog as it eats ravenously. The dog finishes 
           and licks the owner on the mouth, wagging its tail.

           Alvarez vacantly pops another beer as Eva nuzzles into him.

           INT. ETHAN/DON’S CELL, J.K.L - NIGHT

           Liquid drops on Ethan in bed. Don’s mattress is soaking. Don 
           has wet the bed. Ethan springs up, about to lose it on Don. 

           DON IS BRIGHT BLUE. A CADAVER. AN ERECT NEEDLE IS LODGED IN 
           HIS ARM. AN OPEN, EMPTY TIN OF HEROIN LAYS BESIDE HIM.

           Ethan grabs the cell bars. His tier is silent. 2nd tier is 
           silent. Chow is empty and silent. No guards. He rips the 
           syringe from Don’s arm, and peers into its belly for heroin 
           remnants. He pushes it, releasing a thin arc of blood. He 
           bursts into a silent deluge of tears. He walks to the window 
           and stares out. Suddenly, he’s transfixed by the parking lot 
           below. We barely hear him counting, as his lips move faintly. 
           Street lamps throw tubes of eerie light on the vacant lot. 
           There are 200 empty spaces and 3 cars.

           INT. HELICOPTER, OVER THE DESERT - LATER

           Tassin and Chase fly low over a band of prisons.  
                                 TASSIN
                        Our largest concentration of 
                        prisons in America.
                             (cocking his head left)
                        And that there’s the holiest 
                        hoosegow of hoosegows. Sorry I 
                        won’t be able to escort you myself, 
                        but the hands of Kevin Myers are 
                        second only to my personal touch.

                                 CHASE
                        Of course I realize we’ve shared 
                        some tension from the outset. So, 
                        I’m simply grateful for your 
                        accommodation, General. 

                                 TASSIN
                        Well, Chase, as they say in the 
                        bible: I pray you may prosper, as 
                        your soul also prospers.

           They pass a swath of desert marked by PCC flags. Construction 
           equipment with PCC logos sits idly by a spec prison and huge 
           pits in the earth. The Mexican border thorns in the distance.

                                 CHASE
                        What’s all that construction? 

                                 TASSIN
                        Land survey. We do them all over. 

           Tassin suddenly diverts the conversation.

                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        You know, I realize, women have a 
                        tough road. You work like a man, 
                        people resent you for it. You put 
                        your whole being into your work, 
                        don’t you, Chase? I admire that.

                                 CHASE
                        I appreciate that, General. 

           Tassin’s ELABORATE ESTATE expands beneath them as they land.

                                 TASSIN
                        You’ve got a real particular type 
                        of hunger. You know what being 
                        truly rich is all about? Total 
                        control. No one owns you.

           GUARDS open the doors. An awaiting PHOTOGRAPHER photographs 
           them before a PCC logo on the helicopter’s belly. Tassin 
           shakes Chase’s hand, smiling. Chase appears bristled.
                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        If this deal goes through, you’ll 
                        be rich enough to have a kind of 
                        freedom most people never taste.

           INT. PCC PRISON LOCKER ROOM - DAWN

           Industrial grade cleaning supplies line the front of the 
           room. All the GUARDS suit up. Alvarez looks out the window. A 
           parked matte black Mercedes. A brigade of CORPORATE GUARDS 
           stride through the dust.  

           OVER A PRISON LOUDSPEAKER:

                                 WARDEN MELODY (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
                        Good morning. Corporate will tour 
                        some investors this afternoon for a 
                        deal that will increase the value 
                        of your 401ks. 

           HOOTING. HOLLERING.

                                 WARDEN MELODY (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Today all of you work in D-POD. If 
                        you speak to anyone, you’re fired. 
                        And in breach of your 
                        confidentiality agreements. Now, 
                        I’d like to demonstrate to 
                        corporate that we are effective. 
                        Streamlined. I hid a tangerine 
                        somewhere in D-POD. You have 20 
                        minutes to shine the pod spotless 
                        and find it. Heard, understood, 
                        acknowledged.

                                 ALL THE GUARDS.
                        HUA!!!

           Everyone grabs supplies and bolts. Alvarez doesn’t move.

                                 BASCH
                        Come on, man. Last time she fired a 
                        whole unit.

           INT. C-POD, 1st TIER - MOMENTS LATER

           A HERD of GUARDS sprint down the hall with supplies. INMATES 
           SCREAM and RAKE their cell bars with various OBJECTS. A 
           dissonant ramshackle CHORUS. A loud MONKEY CALL. The noise 
           becomes DEAFENING as guards shoot through the pod.

           INT. D-POD - MOMENTS LATER
           Lights turn on. The arena of cells is TOTALLY SILENT. THE 
           GUARDS burst in and rapidly disperse. They search all 
           potential hiding places: a fire extinguisher case, under rec 
           chairs, above a door frame. A wild goose chase. 

                                 GARTH
                        Make it shine!

           They BUFF the floors. A heavy DIN in otherwise TOTAL SILENCE. 
           Alvarez walks FIRST TIER with a mop and bucket. He approaches 
           Ethan’s cell, and is overcome with a horrible stench. Ethan 
           sits on the ground with his head in his hands. Don’s cadaver 
           has been there all night. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Jesus fuck, man. What happened? 

           Ethan remains totally silent. 

                                 ALVAREZ (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           Ethan doesn’t say a word. 

                                 MELODY (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
                        Ten minutes!

           Alvarez turns to face the passing chaos on the tier. Guards 
           fan over it inspecting every crevice. Basch crouches by a 
           vent. He retrieves a tangerine and holds it up proudly.

                                 BASCH
                        Geronimo!

           INT. MERCEDES TRUCK - DAY

           2 CORP GUARDS drive Chase and Myers past the idle development 
           she saw from the chopper. Chase observes it suspiciously.

                                 CHASE
                        I don’t recall projections for any 
                        new developments.

                                 KEVIN MYERS
                        Border developments. Construction’s 
                        stalled till the REIT goes through.

           The truck descends prison valley.

                                 CHASE
                        What? Why is that?

                                 KEVIN MYERS
                        That’s us down there.
           The adobe red mountains expand into a panorama of the PRISON 
           complex. PCC flags encircle it proudly.

                                 CHASE
                        Why is construction dependent on 
                        capital from the REIT? A week ago, 
                        your boss didn’t even approve of 
                        the deal. 

                                 KEVIN MYERS
                        I spoke beyond my pay grade, Ms. 
                        Morris. I’m really not privy to 
                        those kinds of details. 

           INT. PCC HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Alvarez and Basch carry Don’s corpse -- carelessly wrapped in 
           his bed sheets, his grey face visible --  down the hall. 

           EXT. PCC PRISON - LATER 

           A corporate GUARD leads Chase and Myers along the empty 
           prison yard. Chase observes an expanse of prison buildings 
           looming behind them. They reach a back entrance. CORPORATE 
           ARMED GUARDS man the entrance. They pat Chase down. 

           INT. D-POD, GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           BUZZ. Chase enters in a brigade of PCC guards led by Melody. 
           Formidable silence permeates the gleaming pod. Inmates avoid 
           eye contact. FOUR GUARDS nervously man each tier. 

                                 MELODY
                        The state gives us 60 million in 
                        annual budget. We have a bed 
                        capacity of 3,500. A 3:1 prisoner 
                        guard ratio. Highly trained COs. 

           They pass Ethan’s cell. Alvarez stands guard. Ethan paces.

                                 CHASE
                        So there are over 1000 guards on 
                        duty at all times?

                                 MELODY
                        1000 guards at all times. Minimum.

                                 ETHAN
                             (barely audible)
                        They’re lying... 

           Ethan’s mania swells. He erupts, piercing the silence.
                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re fucking lying!

           Chase looks at Ethan -- this underfed, unhinged creature.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s usually one guard. Or none. 
                        They just leave us here to rot.

           Harrington, Basch and TWO more CO’s approach the cell. The 
           two corporate guards begin to escort Chase out.

                                 CORPORATE GUARD
                        This way, Ms. Morris.

                                 CHASE 
                        Wait. 

                                 ETHAN
                        THERE ARE NO FUCKING GUARDS!

           Chase approaches Ethan’s cell. Ethan grabs onto the bars.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Aryans run this prison. The inmates 
                        are the guards. Count the cars.

           Ethan screams wildly. Chase looks back.

           A pall hangs over the lab as forlorn guards filter out of the 
           room. Alvarez sits at a computer clocking out. Basch stumbles 
           into the room, weaving past other guards. He plunks down by 
           Alvarez, removes a flask from his pocket and swigs it. He’s 
           wasted. He pulls out his cellphone, hands it to Alvarez, and 
           unsteadily presses play on a video.

           Basch spills out of his seat, leaving Alvarez with the phone, 
           and exits the room. Alvarez hurriedly texts himself the video 
           and deletes the outgoing text.

           He looks around to make absolutely sure the room is empty. He 
           logs into Kronos and attempts to click on a log from 
           yesterday. The screen turns red and freezes. He punches in a 
           range of dates. An ERROR warning appears. He snaps a photo of 
           today’s log with his phone.

                        private corporation. It’s immune to 
                        the public records act. These hell 
                        holes are basically black sites.

                        Liquidate the position. Air your

           Chase sucks on her cigarette and downs her drink. Her phone 
           buzzes. She checks her e-mail.

           CHASE’s CNBC INTERVIEW IS ATTACHED AS A YouTube CLIP. She 
           clicks it, startled, as if she’s being watched. Her eyes 
           drift to a NOTE in the body of the email ...

           INT. FOUR SEASONS, TUCSON, UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATER

           Chase leans on a column in the low-ceilinged lot. The 
           oppressive silence of windowless concrete. A water droplet on 
           the ceiling echoes to the ground. Alvarez approaches, 
           shrouded in a sweat suit. He stops before her -- a bandana 
           over his mouth so only his eyes are visible.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        The kid told the truth. 
            They’re both on edge -- unsure whether to trust each other. 

                                 ALVAREZ (CONT’D)
                        PCC uses white gangs to control the 
                        prison on the cheap. They extort 
                        people. Starve them. They work with 
                        the warden. They organize hits. 

           He plays the surveillance tape of Tyler silencing D-POD. 
           Chase watches the gruesome scene as ARYANS fan over the pod.

                        They pretend there’s all these real 
                        guards. They doctor shift logs. 
                        They force you to log in twice so 
                        it looks like you worked a double. 
                        Sometimes a triple. People sign 
                        with maiden names, middle names. 
                        But it’s bullshit. These people 
                        don’t exist.

                        I don’t know. I’d guess-- 

                                 CHASE
                        -- I’m not interested in guessing. 
                        I need the exact numbers of absent 
                        bodies for which taxpayers are 
                        being billed.

                        It’s gotta be at least 8. 900. A

           Alvarez shows her the Kronos log on his phone.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Kronos. Thing’s like a mind game. 
                        Impossible to read. I tried to 
                        download a week of logs. But it 
                        freezes. You can’t see shit but 
                        your session. Before they used 
                        paper logs. Those are more obvious.

                        talks about this guy Kevin Myers.

                        No. People gotta know what’s going 
                        on. Gangs don’t just exist in

           INT. NORTE COMPOUND, NOGALES - LATER THAT NIGHT

           TRACK a young MAN through a smoky, sparsely furnished house, 
           past a kitchen teeming with Latina women. We follow him into 
           THE BASEMENT. Paramilitary-grade firearms lean on the wall 
           under a flag of the HUELGA BIRD. A horde of tatted NORTES 
           observe the throbbing, bloody back of a man getting inked 
           with a huge Aztec symbol.

           SUPERIMPOSE: NUESTRA FAMILIA COMPOUND - NOGALES, ARIZONA - 
           THE MEXICAN BORDER 

           The man we’ve been following is JULIO (17). He looks up with 
           dilated, red eyes and a face too young to be this angry. He 
           hands a RED LETTER (the one Ruiz passed off before being 
           locked in solitary) to LA ARAÑA (50s), the Norte GODFATHER. 

           La Araña slices open the letter and unfolds the note. It is 
           blank. He runs a lighter beneath the note. A maze of AZTEC 
           SYMBOLS begins to appear, OXIDIZING under the flame.

           Araña holds up the letter and waves EVERYONE in for a hug. 
           Julio stands between Araña and the tatted man. He wraps his 
           arm around the man’s freshly bloodied back.

                        that you, Wall Street, pressured 
                        them to become a REIT. If it 
                        appeared they struck the decision 
                        internally it would incentivize the 
                        SEC to actually scrutinize the 
                        deal. 

                                 CHASE
                             (a beat, in shock)
                        You set me up.

                                 ZUCKERMAN
                        No. I led a desperate woman I knew 
                        was greedy to a deal that was too 
                        good to be true. 

                                 CHASE
                        Fuck you. I’m getting out. 

                                 ZUCKERMAN
                        You can’t get out. You do not 
                        comprehend the depth of power here. 
                        Shut up. Wait it out. You will be 
                        rich and it will be over. Then you 
                        can send me some cuff links and a 
                        bottle of Krug.

           INT. D-POD, FIRST TIER - NIGHT

           Alvarez walks through the pod. Dark. No guards. Silence.

           INT. PCC PRISON CONTROL ROOM - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN

           SURVEILLANCE SCREENS: FIVE SCREENS. FIVE PODS. GHOST TOWN. 

           SURVEILLANCE SCREEN of the PARKING LOT. A car pulls in. Garth 
           gets out. We follow him on multiple screens to the FILE ROOM. 
           Alvarez watches, hyper vigilant.

           ON SCREEN Garth disappears in the room. There’s no visible 
           surveillance in the room. He exits and leaves the door ajar. 

           ON SCREEN, D-POD: Garth appears on the tier. He unlocks the 
           2nd tier JANITOR CLOSET. He closes it. Tests it. Unlocked.

           INT. HALLWAY, EXIT - DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN

           Darkness. Alvarez’ strained steps. Short breath. Wet palms. 

           THE FILE ROOM 22.

           Alvarez slips inside. FILE CABINETS EVERYWHERE. He tries to 
           open them. LOCKED. A ring of KEYS on one of the cabinets. He 
           grabs it and studies it: ten metal keys, one key card. He 
           surveys the room: a black metal cabinet, military grade -- no 
           key holes, a thin slot. He slides in the key card.

           A DRAWER OPENS and falls toward him. Alvarez looks around, 
           nervously. No one. He looks inside -- BLUEPRINTS, just like 
           the ones in Tassin’s office -- but of the GLADIATOR DOME -- 
           AERIAL VIEW. ALL THE BLOCKS. ALL THE CELLS. IN RED, IN 
           CLUSTERS: ARYAN. ARYAN. ARYAN. +45. IN BLACK, DILUTED: NORTE -
           25. It’s a housing plan. On the bottom a stamped seal: PCC. 

           BOOM. A door opens in the distance. Alvarez snaps a PHOTO of 
           the housing document with his cell. He carefully places the 
           blueprint back inside the drawer and closes it. He keys open 
           another drawer - PAPER SHIFT LOGS. Someone WHISTLES. He snaps 
           a photo of one log and quickly hides behind a cabinet.

           He e-mails himself the photos and moves them to the TRASH. He 
           goes to SETTINGS, GMAIL. He deletes the account: GHOST000.

           A hand comes through the door. It flicks a light switch 
           illuminating a line of RAT TRAPS full of dead rats. The light 
           switches off. The door closes and locks. Alvarez waits. A 
           door CLOSES O.S. Alvarez fumbles for the ring of keys. He 
           finds it. He tries a couple at the door. Finally, a fit. He 
           opens the door. Across the hall, light glows under a door. 
           Alvarez places the keys where he found them and slips out, 
           shutting the door softly. 

                                 GARTH (O.S.)
                        What’re you doin here, buddy?

           Alvarez turns to Garth. His smile is prominent in the dark. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        I took Basch’s night shift. Guy 
                        needed a load off. 
           Garth says nothing. Tension builds as the sun rises outside. 
           Soon, they are in almost full light, standing face to face.

                                 GARTH
                        Before you clock out, move M. Ruiz 
                        into D-POD. Cell 23. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                             (knowing what this means)
                        Nah, man.

                                 GARTH
                        Move Ruiz or pack your shit and go.

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Alvarez enters the zone. Intense BANGING from inside a cell. 

                                 INMATE
                        I ain’t no dog. He ain't no dog. We 
                        ain’t dog.

           The BANGING spreads to the cell next door. Then the cell next 
           to it. Then the cell next to it. A ripple effect until all 
           the cells BANG in unison, heaving for freedom. 

                                 INMATES IN UNISON
                        FEED US!

           INT. D-POD, 1ST TIER - DAWN

           1st TIER DOORS POP OPEN. Tyler, Ethan, Kelly and 3 ARYANS 
           charge out of their cells. They swiftly ascend to 2nd tier 
           and file into the unlocked janitor closet. 

           INT. D-POD, 2ND TIER HALLWAY - DAWN

           Alvarez locks M Ruiz, shackled, terrified, into D-POD. He 
           looks spiritually and morally broken as he uncuffs Ruiz.

                                 RUIZ <<IN SPANISH>> 
                        You a swata rat motherfucker? No, 
                        no. I believe, inside, you’re no 
                        fucking parasite. 
                             (beat, hissing)
                        Pop our cells. We’ll hack Lott to 
                        pieces and make his bitch crew eat 
                        it. 

           M RUIZ throws a JPAY card through the bars. 

                                 RUIZ <<IN SPANISH>> (CONT’D)
                        20gs, Ese. You do what I say? The 
                        card fills up. Just like that. 
                                 ALVAREZ <<IN SPANISH>>
                        I don’t take dirty money, man.

                                 RUIZ <<IN SPANISH>>
                        You eat dirty money, homes. Your 
                        children are la raza. Your wife is 
                        la raza. La raza grows inside her. 
                        And you take orders from these 
                        pigs?

           Alvarez grabs Ruiz, clanging his skull on the bars.

                                 ALVAREZ <<IN SPANISH>>
                        You ignorant thug motherfucker. I 
                        don’t owe la familia shit, bitch. 
                        Who’s inside? And who’s outside? 

           He grabs his mace and sprays Ruiz in the face.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Huh?

           Ruiz screams. Alvarez drops him to the floor.

                                 ALVAREZ (CONT’D)
                        La Raza’s just some backwards 
                        campesino bullshit.

           Alvarez walks off. Ruiz, on his knees, his hands over his 
           eyes, shouts after him in genuine terror.

                                 RUIZ <<IN SPANISH>>
                        Don’t let ‘em pop my cell. Oye, 
                        Ese!

           INT. D-POD, 2nd TIER JANITOR CLOSET - LATER

           PARTIAL DARKNESS. The heavy sound of clustered men BREATHING.  
           A sliver of light jaggedly illuminates the ARYAN huddle. 

           Muscles, 8.8., The shamrock. Ethan focuses on Tyler’s 6.6.6. 

           The cavernous BANG of the first tier door pop below. The 
           CLAMOR of PRISONERS filing in for chow. Tyler whispers.

                                 TYLER
                        First tier. 

           CU on Ethan’s shiv. He flings open the door. A BLAST of light 

           Ethan rounds to CELL 23. M. RUIZ sits inside. The second tier 
           doors POP. Ruiz turns in terror as Ethan smashes him to the 
           ground and cuffs him to the bed. Tyler, Kelly, the 3 
           henchman, form an ominous blockade over the cell door.
                                 RUIZ <<IN SPANISH>>
                        Help me!!

           INMATES scatter.

                                 TYLER
                        Slaughter him.

           Frenzied, confused, Ethan pulls out the shiv.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        NOW!

           Ethan draws the weapon high, his eyes red and watery.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        In for life, out by death.

                                 M RUIZ
                        Do it, motherfucker. 

                                 TYLER
                        This is an order. 

                                 M RUIZ
                        That’s you in the pen for life!

                                 TYLER
                        Now! NOW! 

           Ethan suddenly turns the shiv inward and backs away like a 
           feral rat. He drags the blade through his own forearm, slow 
           and deep, and lets out a deranged SCREAM.

           Tyler looks at THE AUDIENCE in the chow hall below. He grabs 
           the shiv from Ethan. He stabs Ruiz 18 times in the face. 
           Blood sprays the cell. Ruiz shrieks in agony. 

           Ethan watches in horror, clutching his bloody arm. Tyler 
           grabs Ruiz’ limp corpse by the ankles. He pulls it out of the 
           cell and hauls it down the stairs. 

           On the chow hall, ARYANS stack chairs into a tower. Tyler 
           drags Ruiz across chow. He hoists the body and jumps on a 
           table by the tower of chairs. He props Ruiz on the top chair. 
           A sacrifice on a throne. INMATES thicken into a mob around 
           Ruiz. Tyler surveys the crowd and addresses them solemnly.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Free breakfast today.

           The ARYANS start to man feed. INMATES line up. Food is 
           served, numbly, under the spectre of this mangled corpse.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Alvarez strips off his uniform.

                        Shift commander Alvarez to Warden 
                        Melody’s office.

           INT. WARDEN MELODY’S OFFICE, HALLWAY - LATER

           Garth pats down Alvarez. He rips his cell out of his pocket.

           INT. WARDEN MELODY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           A SURVEILLANCE SCREEN is set up on the desk. Alvarez IN THE 
           FILE ROOM plays on loop. The partially open door blocks a 
           view of him opening the cabinet.

           Alvarez sits in a Spartan chair. Melody and Garth lean on her 
           desk. Garth scrolls Alvarez’ cell.

                                 MELODY
                        Why were you in the file room? 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        There’s rats all over the place. 
                        Basch’s been laying traps. The door 
                        was unlocked. I saw rats crawl out. 
                        That room’s infested.

           Garth grabs Alvarez in a choke hold. Melody walks over 
           slowly. She hovers over him for a moment, then bends back his 
           lip and studies his NORTE tattoo. Alvarez eyes water.

                                 MELODY
                        I knew you were an ex-banger the 
                        minute you walked in here. 

           Garth releases Alvarez and speaks into his radio.

                                 GARTH (INTO RADIO)
                        Basch to Warden Melody’s office.

                                 MELODY
                        How many Norteños crawling the 
                        streets have heard the name M Ruiz? 
                        Hundreds? Thousands. 

           Melody clicks the SURVEILLANCE SCREEN. A new tape pops up: 
           Alvarez MOVING RUIZ INTO CELL 23 

                                 MELODY (CONT’D)

                        Nortes live to kill swata rats. 
                        Don’t they, officer?
                             (beat)
                        When you accepted this position, 
                        you signed a confidentiality 
                        agreement. An oath. PCC takes that 
                        very seriously. Please understand, 
                        I’d like to protect you. But you 
                        have to help me do that.

           SOMEONE BANGS ON THE DOOR. Garth opens it and lets Basch in.

                                 MELODY (CONT’D)
                        Did you tell Officer Alvarez to do 
                        something in room 22? 

           An excruciating pause.

                                 BASCH
                        Yeah. Kill rats. 

           Melody stares at them for a moment, her expression 
           terrifyingly indecipherable. Then she nods to Garth. Garth 
           hands Alvarez his phone 

                                 GARTH
                        Lay off the cutesy e-mails with

           Basch is fuming as they charge down the hallway. 

                                 BASCH
                        What the fuck’s matter with you?

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - MOMENTS LATER

           BLINDING CEILING LIGHTS TURN ON. INMATES SCREAM in SPANISH 
           and BANG the cells. Tyler and the ARYANS carry RUIZ’ corpse 
           onto the zone and splay it across the floor. Tray slots open-- 
           a succession of vacant rectangles containing only NORTE eyes. 
           As they behold the corpse, the zone falls totally silent.

           INT. ALVAREZ’ HONDA, DESERT HIGHWAY - LATER

           Alvarez zooms down the desert highway on his cell.

                        What about the paper logs? 

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO PHONE)
                        I have a photo of one. That and the 
                        housing plan is enough, right? 

                                 CHASE (INTO PHONE)
                        The housing plan is useful only if 
                        we can prove the ghost worker 
                        scheme along with it. I told you, I 
                        need one year of logs.

           Alvarez pulls over the car and hits the steering wheel.

                        Hello?

                        Ok. I’ll get all of them. But I 
                        want 500 grand. And I want half up 
                        front.

                        You said if I found that doc you’d

                        3. I said 300. And in addition to 
                        the logs.

                                 ALVAREZ (INTO PHONE)
                        I can’t do this by myself! I need 
                        another person. And no guard at PCC 
                        will turn against the man unless 
                        they see cash, in the bank! I’ll 
                        give you my name, my banking info. 
                        All of it.

                        Send me everything you have right 
                        now. I’ll wire you 5grand and put 
                        495k in escrow as proof. When you 
                        get the logs I’ll release the funds

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - LATER THAT DAY

           Feet are dragged along the charred borders of the solitary 
           cells. Prisoners MOAN quietly. An obscured form unlocks a 
           cell and throws a shadowy body inside.

           INT. SOLITARY CELL, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - SAME TIME

           PITCH DARK. A PRISONER’S HEAVY BREATH. The CREAKY OPENING of 
           the tray slot. The CLICK of a lighter. Light flickers through 
           the slot, illuminating a sliver of Ethan’s face in the cell. 

                                 TYLER
                        Genocide.

           DARKNESS. A long dark beat. Tyler whispers through the slot.

                                 TYLER LOTT
                        Genocide is not always immediate 
                        destruction. It is a coordinated 
                        plan to destroy the foundations of 
                        national groups, with the ultimate 
                        aim of racial annihilation. Laws 
                        make white areas accept diversity, 
                        but that is forced assimilation. 
                        Article II, part (C) of the United 
                        Nations Genocide Convention defines 
                        mass immigration plus forced 
                        assimilation as genocide. We are 
                        the era of WHITE GENOCIDE. 

           The lighter clicks on and off. A diabolical alternation of 
           dark and light over Tyler’s face. He starts singing, sweetly.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m a little tea pot short and 
                        stout. Here is my handle. Here is 
                        my spout. 

           Light catches Ethan’s bloodshot eyes. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                             (coaxing him) 
                        Come on, son.... 
                             (singing)
                        When I get all steamed up, I just 
                        shout...
           Ethan shouts the lyrics. A kind of twisted protest. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Tip me over and pour me out!! 

           A HARD FLICK OF the LIGHTER. Light beams through the slot. 
           Tyler holds a paper pill cup through it. Ethan wriggles 
           toward it. Tyler drops it to the floor. It’s empty. 

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        They call this block, the dead 
                        man’s zone.

           The slot shuts. TOTAL DARKNESS. BOOTS leaving. The sound of 
           Ethan breathing, alone.

           EXT. HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS, D.C. - DAY

           A labyrinthine fortress of l-shaped edifices with bright 
           green roof lawns. American flags punctuate the perimeter.

           INT. HOMELAND SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           A white Homeland Security seal is the bull's-eye of a navy 
           wall-to-wall carpet. Tassin, Zuckerman, Bo Harris, Lawson, 
           and SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN, sit in wood furniture.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        34,000 arrests a day. 
                             (referring to Lawson)
                        Johnnie’s got it. He’s approved it. 
                        But with that kinda quota you’re 
                        gonna need to make up the budget 
                        shortfall in housing.

                                 BO HARRIS 
                        Are you really gonna sit there 
                        claiming budgets are your chief 
                        concern? Why do we have private 
                        mercenaries, Dean? Shadow armies 
                        protected as private business that 
                        can elude our own court martial, 
                        Dean. Now, do you want more 
                        lawyers, journalists, politicians, 
                        the public, jumping out your ass? 
                        Or do you wanna operate with the 
                        opacity PCC can provide?

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        We’re aware of the protections 
                        private business affords PCC. Very 
                        aware.

                        We’ll fill ‘em, but we’re not gonna 
                        build ‘em. So, we need to know. How 
                        much cash do you have lying around? 
                        And how fast can you go?

                                 TASSIN
                        We’ve got a hundred miles of land 
                        on the Mexican border. Forty fully 
                        scouted building sites. And when 
                        the REIT clears, that’s an extra 
                        billion in slush to start   
                        construction immediately.

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        A billion, just for our sites? 
                        Ready to go?

                                 TASSIN
                        Just for your sites. Ready now.

           Beat. Wilmot Dean clearly thinks this is quite the offer. 

                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        But, Secretary, for this to be 
                        effective, Homeland needs to 
                        enlarge our bid. 

                                 SECRETARY WILMOT DEAN
                        By how much? 

                                 TASSIN
                        We want a beneficial share of the 
                        DHS detention market.

           Wilmot Dean mulls this over. This is serious.

                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        We think it’s in Homeland’s 
                        interest, Secretary, to make us too 
                        big to fail.

                                 TASSIN
                        This deal will make us Homeland’s 
                        arms and legs. And the government 
                        does not investigate its own 
                        fucking body parts.

           INT. WALGREENS, MESA AZ - DUSK

           An expanse of branded food under cruel fluorescent light. An 
           ELDERLY WOMAN inspects packages for deals. Eva smiles at her 
           as she selects some cereal off the shelf and drops it in her 
           cart. Octavia hangs onto Eva’s free hand. A man, resembling 
           an Aryan gangster, lurks through the aisles. Maria snatches a 
           bottle of whip cream off a shelf and blasts it in her mouth. 

                                 EVA
                        No. Maria.

           A TEENAGER in Chicano gangster clothes peruses goods. He 
           inches closer to Eva until they are side by side. He looks up 
           at her -- it is JULIO, the Norte who delivered M. Ruiz’s red 
           letter to La Araña. He covers her mouth, and pops a switch 
           blade near her pregnant abdomen.

                                 JULIO <<IN SPANISH>>
                        Tell your husband, if he doesn’t 
                        pop our cells, we’ll cut your 
                        tongues out.

           A CAUCASIAN CIVILIAN (50) whips out a gun and points it at 
           the teenager. SHOPPERS SCREAM. The girls start CRYING.

                                 OFF DUTY COP
                        I’m a cop! I’m a cop! 
                        (to Julio) 
                        Let her go or I’ll shoot you. 

           Julio holds Eva tighter.

                        Let her go!

           Julio slices Eva’s palms as she SCREAMS. The cop shoots and 
           misses. He releases Eva and bolts. She falls to the ground 
           SCREAMING. The cop shoots wildly after Julio. Eva shields the 
           girls, as bullets spray the aisles. Julio narrowly escapes 
           out of the store.

           EXT. ALVAREZ’ DRIVEWAY - LATER

           Alvarez raggedly approaches his house. He zeroes in on his 
           front door and breaks into a sprint. The door is covered in 
           NORTE graffiti.
           INT. ALVAREZ’ LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Alvarez bursts through the front door, pouring faint porch 
           light into the dark house. Thick, black graffiti trails down 
           the walls. It cuts across the couch, the floor, the windows -- 
           a horrifying black tableau of menacing, symmetrical, ancient 
           Aztec symbols.

           Scrawled across the ceiling are the words: “ASESINO X14“ 
           MURDERER X14. 

           Eva and the girls huddle on the couch crying hysterically.

           INT. ALVAREZ’ BEDROOM - LATER

           Alvarez rapidly packs belongings. Eva is hysterical. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        Listen. At night they’re all locked 
                        in their cells. It’ll take me two 
                        hours. I need you to trust me.

                                 EVA
                        How do you know this chick is even 
                        gonna pay you? Know what you’re 
                        gonna do? You’re gonna shut your 
                        damn mouth.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        This money will buy us a new life! 

           Eva loses her shit and starts whacking him. 

                                 EVA
                        You’re no different than when you 
                        was a thug. Makin’ all these 
                        “plans,” tryna cut deals. You can 
                        be so stupid, Jerome. God DAMN you 
                        can be stupid.

           Alvarez hurls an open suitcase against the wall. He sits on 
           the bed and collects himself. Eva seethes with anger.

                                 ALVAREZ
                        It’s off. We’ll all go to my 
                        cousin’s in Fresno tonight.

                                 EVA
                        No. The girls and I are going 
                        tonight. 

                                 ALVAREZ
                        What the fuck are you saying?
                                 EVA
                        Two hours. I’m sayin you for real 
                        better pull this shit off in two 
                        hours.

           Chase fast tracks at the TSA line with a hefty carry on. She

                        We’re gonna need you to step aside.

           A GIANT TSA AGENT approaches Chase from the security belt.

                                 TSA AGENT 2
                        Ma’am follow me. 

                                 CHASE
                        For what? I’m gonna miss my flight. 
                        And it’s a red eye. 

                                 TSA AGENT 2
                        This is a random screening, OK? 
                        Come with me, please.

           INT. TSA QUESTIONING ROOM - NIGHT

           Harsh florescent lights. Styrofoam white ceiling. White desk. 
           White walls. White floors. Chase stands before the giant 
           agent who wears latex gloves. Two LACKEYS rummage through 
           Chase’s luggage. They dump the contents onto the floor. 

                                 CHASE
                        JESUS, what the hell are you doing? 

           They remove the contents of her purse: CELL PHONE, WALLET, 
           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. They examine the prescriptions, as the 
           giant TSA agent pats Chase down -- her arms, her stomach. A 
           distinct hybrid of outrage and shame crosses Chase’s face. 

           A MALE AGENT bursts in. He wears an all black security 
           uniform, and appears to be something other than TSA. 

                                 MALE AGENT
                             (to Chase)
                        Take a seat. 

           Chase sits in a plastic white chair. 
                                 MALE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Why are you attempting to board an 
                        aircraft when you’ve been labeled a 
                        flight risk? 

                                 CHASE
                        Excuse me?

           The male agent holds up Chase’s boarding pass. 

                                 MALE AGENT
                        Ms. Morris, I know you’re aware of 
                        the SSSS procedures.

           Chase looks at him blankly.

                                 MALE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Secondary Security Screening 
                        Selection.

                                 CHASE
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

           The TSA agent hands the male agent Chase’s cell phone.

                                 MALE AGENT
                        Password please. 

                                 CHASE
                        I want to talk to my lawyer. 

                                 MALE AGENT
                        Ms. Morris, if you don’t cooperate 
                        with our security procedures, we 
                        have the right to detain you.

                                 CHASE
                        I want to talk to my lawyer, right 
                        fucking now. 

                                 MALE AGENT
                        YOU CANNOT CALL YOUR DYING MOTHER 
                        UNTIL YOU ARE PROPERLY SCREENED. WE 
                        CAN AND WILL DETAIN YOU. IS THAT 
                        CRYSTAL FUCKING CLEAR?

           Chase’s eyes water. For the first time, amidst this 
           Kafkaesque nightmare, she looks terrified. The agent stands 
           up and leaves with Chase’s phone.

           INT. ETHAN’S SOLITARY CELL - LATER
           TOTAL DARKNESS. Vermin SQUEAKING. Ethan BREATHES heavily. The 
           SOUND of his door slot opening. A LOUD SQUEAL. Something, 
           squeaking, is thrown through the slot. THE SQUEAKING revs 
           into screaming. Ethan shrieks. It’s on him. A LIGHT flickers 
           through the slot, revealing Ethan on the floor screaming, as 
           a rat crawls on him. Ethan grabs onto the food trough. A 
           hulking FIGURE pulls his arm through the slot and cuffs it to 
           the doorhandle. The figure throws a rat through the slot. 
           Then another. Ethan SCREAMS.

           DARKNESS. A ceiling bulb crackles for a split second, 
           lighting Garth’s face in the slot as it SLAMS shut.

           DARKNESS. BOOTS walk away. Ethan CRIES as the rats SQUEAK 
           around him. A PRISONER shouts from a nearby cell. 

                                 PRISONER (O.S.)
                        I ain’t no dog. He ain’t no dog. I 
                        ain’t no dog. 

           INT. TSA QUESTIONING ROOM - NIGHT

           Chase stares at the blank wall as she compulsively picks her 
           nails. She’s wired but about to crash. Her hair is tied in a 
           messy bun. She’s been there for hours. The agent reenters the 
           room, startling her, and hands over her phone.

                                 MALE AGENT
                        You’re free to go. 

           EXT. ACELA TRAIN TRACKS, D.C. - NIGHT

           Chase buys a pay-as-you-go phone at a junky electronics 
           vendor. She nervously dials a number. 

                                 CHASE (INTO PHONE)
                        Ari I was fucking detained. 

                                 ARI (OVER PHONE)
                        What? Where are you?

                        I was detained at the airport. They 
                        told me I’m a fucking flight risk, 
                        and seized my phone. Ari, I think 
                        it’s PCC. What the fuck. WHAT THE 
                        FUCK?

                                 ARI (OVER PHONE)
                        Calm down. Jesus. You’re acting 
                        insane. What the hell does PCC have 
                        to do with you being detained at 
                        the airport? Last time I checked we 
                        live in a police state post 9-11.

                        Is it legal, Ari? 

                                 ARI (OVER PHONE)

                        financially from the person’s 
                        disclosures. Yes. It’s legal.  
                        Chase, what’re you doing? These 
                        people will sue you into debtor’s 
                        prison and piss on your grave.

                        here? Tell me what the fuck am I 
                        supposed to do? 

                                 ARI (OVER PHONE)
                        What are you supposed to do? You’re 
                        supposed to be absolutely, 
                        positively, every last syllable 
                        fucking certain that you’re right. 
                        And you better have the documents, 
                        every goddamn one of ‘em, to prove 
                        it.

           INT. ETHAN’S SOLITARY CELL - SAME TIME

           DARKNESS. Vermin squeaks. An INCESSANT BANGING from the 
           adjacent cells floods Ethan’s from both sides. 

           INT. ADJACENT SOLITARY CELL - SAME TIME

           A bulb flickers from exposed wires in the ceiling. A NORTE 
           wrenches a metal pipe from a huge hole he’s torn in the wall. 
           He rips the pipe free and wields it like a weapon. 

           INT. ETHAN’S SOLITARY CELL - SAME TIME

           The banging grows faint. Everything becomes silent save the 
           squeaking of vermin. Then, the unmistakable sounds of Ethan 
           stomping the rats to death.
           INT. ACELA, D.C - NIGHT

           The NYC skyline whips by. Chase looks tormented in her seat.

           Chase texts GHOST00: FROM NOW ON. USE THIS NUMBER. ONLY!!!!

           INT. ETHAN’S SOLITARY CELL - NIGHT

           DARKNESS. Tyler enters the cell. He turns on a PORTABLE 
           LANTERN, casting faint patterns of light and shadow on the 
           cell. Ethan is chained to the door -- a zombie suspended in a 
           battleground of dead rats. TYLER unshackles him. Ethan falls 
           to the ground, disintegrating into a corpse-like heap. 

                                 TYLER
                        Do you know what we do to people 
                        who hurt our family? We remind 
                        them, history is not peaceful.
                        We remind them, history is violent.

           He gives Ethan water and a Klonopin in a paper cup. Ethan 
           takes it listlessly.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I would never let anyone hurt you. 
                        I will never betray you. Do you 
                        want me to protect you, son? 

           Ethan curls in a fetal ball. 

           A long beat. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yes.

           Tyler places the lantern by Ethan. He kneels down and peels 
           Ethan off the floor. Ethan sits upright, clutching his knees.

                                 TYLER
                        Ascetic monks used solitary to 
                        purify the mind. I did ad-seg for a 
                        year. I put you in here so you’d 
                        know how strong you can be. 

           He hands Ethan a piece of paper. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Read this to me. 

           Tyler starts filming Ethan on a cell phone. After a long 
           beat, Ethan begins. He stares ahead with dead eyes. 
                                 ETHAN
                        The objectives of forced 
                        assimilation are the destruction of 
                        our political and social 
                        institutions. America is becoming 
                        Balkanized like the Balkans; we are 
                        breaking apart because of other 
                        races. 

           EXT. THE PCC PRISON YARD - NIGHT

           SECURITY LIGHTS cast thick glowing beams on the dusty prison 
           yard, surrounded by a tall chain link fence. An obscured 
           FIGURE lingers on the yard. A masked figure stands outside of 
           the fence and LOBS FOOTBALLS over it. The person on the yard 
           catches them. 

           INT. CHASE’S APARTMENT LOBBY - 95 WALL STREET, NYC - DAWN

           A stone lobby. Chandeliers. A red rug lines a row of 
           elevators. A CONCIERGE sits behind a lacquered desk. Chase 
           enters the automatic doors of the lobby. A BELL MAN tries to 
           help her with her bag. A paranoid wreck, she wheels past him.

                                 CHASE
                        I got it.

           She eyes the concierge, almost as if she’s anxious he won’t 
           let her up. The concierge nods pleasantly back.

           INT. CHASE’S APARTMENT - WALL STREET, NYC - MOMENTS LATER

           Chase hovers over her wall of monitors. Her email glows on 
           the first monitor. She drags an attachment onto the adjacent 
           monitor. The HOUSING PLAN appears giant and full screen. 
           Chase studies it in horror. She drags the paper log and the 
           surveillance video onto the second and third monitors. All 
           three pieces of evidence glow in horrifying succession. 

           Chase looks out at WALL STREET, as if its data-wrapped 
           buildings appear suddenly sinister and chilling.

                        up in that corner of the room.

           Alvarez stands against a back wall. The ARYAN status quo has 
           resumed. Everyone lines up for feed with their JPAY cards. 
           The OLD NORTE congregates feebly with a few NORTES. His eyes 
           skim Alvarez up and down.

           INT. ETHAN’S SOLITARY CELL - SAME TIME

           Boots on the GROUND. The cell DOOR opens. A shaft of light 
           beams on Ethan, curling up his suffering in a fetal position. 
           He squints in pain, unaccustomed to the light. Tyler and 
           Melody stand over him with lanterns. Ethan doesn’t 
           acknowledge them.
           INT. D-POD CHOW HALL - DAY

           Everyone eats grimly. Suddenly, the sound of Ethan’s voice 
           pours over a loudspeaker, enrapturing the crowd.

                                 ETHAN (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
                        The objectives of forced

           INT. C-POD HALLWAY - LATER

           Melody and Tyler lead Ethan down the hall. Ethan walks 
           freely, without protest, but his eyes are dead and vacant. A 
           part of him is gone forever. 

                                 ETHAN (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

                        because of other races.

           They lead Ethan into --

           The entire hall stops and absorbs Ethan standing beside 
           Melody and Tyler like a phantom. Alvarez watches in terror.

                        security, our liberty...  

           The inmates listen intently and study Ethan. An eerie, 
           pulsating energy permeates the hall, as we realize, this is a 
           myth growing before our very eyes.

           Basch is visible through the EXIT DOOR. Dust swirls around

           INT. D-POD, ETHAN’S CELL - NIGHT

           Ethan sits on the edge of his bed. A sleepless hulk. He holds 
           a safety pin. He starts brutally carving into his forearm. 
           His face is blank and painless. After a while, we start to 
           make out a jagged, bloody shamrock.

           He ascends an EMPTY STAIRWELL.

           He enters an EMPTY HALLWAY. He turns on the LIGHTS.

           THE FILE ROOM becomes visible at the far end of the hallway.

           Ethan’s startled as a cell CREAKS OPEN somewhere in the

           Alvarez walks down the hall. The FILE ROOM grows nearer.

           CLANG. The lights TURN OFF. 

           DARKNESS.

           Alvarez grasps the walls. He fumbles his way down the hall.
           INT. D-POD - NIGHT

           A central view of the pod -- dark, motionless, antiseptic.

           One open CELL swings, almost imperceptibly, in the stillness.

           TOTAL DARKNESS. Alvarez’ HEAVY BREATHING.

           The EXIT DOOR is a glowing square in the distance.

           THE SOUND OF DOORS LOCKING IN UNISON.

           Alvarez sprints to the EXIT DOOR. He tries to open it. It’s 
           locked. 

           BLUE EMERGENCY LIGHTS BEGIN TO FLICKER. 

           ALARMS SOUND.

           They are on LOCK DOWN. 

           Alvarez panics. The red adobe moonscape swirls, dark and 
           terrifying, outside the EXIT DOOR.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM EXIT - LATER

           A CINDER BLOCK is wedged in the door frame. A BODY, drenched 
           in sweat, removes the cinder block, opens the door, steps 
           into the red dust outside and shuts out its influx.

           Through the window, dust swirls over this dark form. The dust 
           clears for a moment, revealing Basch, dead bolting the door 
           from the outside. He takes off RUNNING. His body SHRINKS away 
           into the red dark.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME TIME

           ON THE SURVEILLANCE SCREEN: Alvarez turns away from the EXIT 
           and RUNS to the FILE ROOM.

           REVEAL Tyler watching Alvarez on the SURVEILLANCE SCREENS.

           Tyler SMASHES THE LOCK DOWN PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.

           Tyler watches Alvarez on the SURVEILLANCE SCREENS as he turns 
           into the FILE ROOM and disappears.

           Tyler SPRINTS out of the room.

           Alvarez fumbles frantically for the master keys. Finally, he

           Alvarez runs his fingers along the military grade cabinet. 
           Finally he locates the slot. He slides in the key card. 

           The DRAWER opens and FALLS toward him with a resonant CLANG.

           It’s EMPTY, save a small perfect square of ASTRO TURF. 

           Alvarez frantically keys open the other FILE CABINETS --

                        Yeah?

                                 LUIS (OVER PHONE)
                        Rajit’s looking for you. 

           She rubs her eyes and looks at her monitors. The KRONOS log 
           and the PAPER LOG reflect over her face.

           INT. FILE ROOM - LATER

           Alvarez, panicked, SPRINTS out of the room into --

           THE HALLWAY

           He runs for his life, processing this betrayal, overcome with 
           intense fear. He slips into --

           THE BASEMENT 
           He runs up a distant STAIRWELL. 

           INT. THE FILE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler stands in the empty FILE ROOM intermittently lambent in 
           BLUE LIGHT.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - LATER

           Alvarez BURSTS into the room. 

           BASCH IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

           Alvarez starts CHOKING up in a fit of panic. 

           He beholds the surveillance station ...

           THE SHATTERED LOCK DOWN PANEL.

           THE SURVEILLANCE SCREENS. 

           Alvarez dials 911 on his iPhone. No ringing. He looks at his 
           phone: CALL DECLINED. He tries again. CALL DECLINED. There 
           are full bars of service. He tries again. CALL DECLINED.

           He texts EVA: I’M TRAPPED. CALL THE POLICE. He waits, in 
           agony, for the text to send. It doesn’t. A red exclamation 
           appears. He tries again. It doesn’t send. A red exclamation 
           appears. 

           Alvarez watches the THE SURVEILLANCE SCREENS.

           TYLER LOTT CHARGES DOWN THE FILE ROOM HALLWAY. 

           THEN ANOTHER HALLWAY.

           SCREEN AFTER SCREEN HE’S ON THE LOOSE. 

           Alvarez starts HYPERVENTILATING. He quickly assesses the 
           various buttons and controls:

           C-POD 

           D-POD 

           SOLITARY POD

           He POPS a TIER of CELLS. Then another.

           INT. C-POD - SAME TIME

           Rows of cells, sprinkled with NORTES, POP like dominoes.
           INT. D-POD - MOMENTS LATER

           A CENTRAL VIEW of the pod. Cells containing NORTES, POP. 
           Cells containing ARYANS stay closed. For a moment -- a still, 
           perilous, gladiator ring in the dark. 

           Then, INMATES begin to make NOISES. One prominent DOG BARK.

           Ethan, locked in his cell, scans the liberated group of 
           NORTES. 

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - MOMENTS LATER

           The CELLS POP in grand UNISON. NORTES’ hulking shadows STIR 
           and move onto the zone. They WHISPER and CHATTER in Spanish.

           INT. PCC HALLWAY - SAME TIME 

           Tyler CAREENS down the HALLWAY clutching the handcuffs.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alvarez BOLTS out of the room into -- 

           THE HALLWAY

           He runs for his life. He turns onto -- 

           THE STAIRS

           He sprints down the stairwell. He turns into --

           THE LOCKER ROOM

           He BURSTS into the LOCKER ROOM and LOCKS the DOOR. 

           He throws his back against the door, panting hysterically.

           He runs to an EXIT DOOR. He tries to open it. It’s DEAD 
           BOLTED. 

           He picks up a LAND LINE. Dead. 

           He BURSTS into TEARS. 

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DEAD MAN’S ZONE - MOMENTS LATER

           A partly obscured, organized LEGION of NORTES hold jagged 
           weapons made of metal pipes. In sudden unison, they drop down 
           into a paramilitary exercise -- a swift, unifying battle cry.

           INT. CHASE’S APARTMENT, WALL STREET, NYC - NIGHT

           Chase, WIRED now, smokes and paces before the monitors. 
           ON SCREEN: the KRONOS LOG and the PAPER LOG are side by side.

           She stops suddenly. She peers at them, scrutinizing them, 
           mesmerized. She notices something. She ZOOMS INTO THE KEY AT 
           THE TOP OF BOTH LOGS AND COMPARES THEM.

                                 CHASE
                        Holy shit.

           She DIALS her CELL.

                                 VOICEMAIL (OVER PHONE)
                        The person you are trying to reach 
                        is no longer available. 

           She tries again. 

                                 VOICEMAIL (OVER PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        The person you are trying to reach 
                        is no longer available. 

           She lights another cigarette, an internal hurricane rising 
           inside her.

                                 CHASE
                        FUCK!

           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - LATER

           ON THE SCREENS: INMATES SWARM OUT OF DEAD MAN’S ZONE, C-POD, 
           THE HALLWAYS, LIKE LOCUSTS. 

           We push into the SCREENS onto -- 

           D-POD

           A portion of the armed NORTES from SOLITARY slink though D-
           POD. They file straight into CELL 8.8, TYLER LOTT’s CELL. 
           They search it relentlessly, tearing it apart. 

           Ethan crouches in shadow behind his bed. An armed NORTE 
           charges from Lott’s cell down the TIER towards him. He 
           thrashes the bars of Ethan’s cell with his pipe. Ethan cowers 
           behind his bed. 

                                 NORTE
                        Where the fuck is Lott?

           INT. PRISON CANTEEN - SAME TIME

           TRAYS and VATS of food. UNREMITTING BANGING on a metal door. 
           The DOOR BURSTS open. The remaining NORTES from solitary 
           erupt into the room. They tear apart the food and feed 
           themselves in a grotesque, primal frenzy.

           They WHEEL the CARTS of FOOD out of the room.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           BANGING AND SHOUTING in the distance. Alvarez sits in the 
           dark locker room hyperventilating. 

           INT. THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON THE SURVEILLANCE SCREENS: NORTES burst into CHOW wheeling 
           carts of food. They disperse over chow wielding their PIPES. 
           HUMAN SILHOUETTES snatch savagely at the carts of food.

           REVEAL TYLER beholding the SURVEILLANCE STATION. He takes 
           command of the controls. He pops the ARYANS’ cells.

           ON SCREEN: A CENTRAL VIEW of D-POD as the ARYANS’ cells POP.

           ON ANOTHER SCREEN: he watches Alvarez in the LOCKER ROOM.

           INT. D-POD - SAME TIME

           The NORTE thrashes Ethan’s cell. THE CELL suddenly POPS open. 
           Ethan SPRINTS narrowly past the NORTE. The NORTE chases him 
           down FIRST TIER.

           ON SECOND TIER, HULKING NORTES in silhouette save light 
           flickering over NORTE TATTOOS, hover ominously over the 
           popped ARYAN CELLS. Their PIPES are aimed to strike the 
           cowering ARYAN SHADOWS.

           ON GROUND TIER, INTENSE BANGING. The OLD NORTE instructs a 
           NORTE crew BANGING fire extinguishers into the ailing walls 
           creating massive holes. Metal pipes run underneath. They BANG 
           and PULL at the pipes, trying to free them from the wall.

           DARK BODIES crouch in various corners eating.

           Ethan SWERVES for his life through the MAYHEM.

           He looks up to SECOND TIER. PIPES CRACK over MOVING SHADOWS. 
           Swift dark pendulums. SHRIEKING FROM ABOVE IN THE DARKNESS. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Alvarez is paralyzed in the dark as distant SCREAMS, ALARMS, 
           LAUGHING, grow and RESONATE around him.
           INT. C-POD JANITOR CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler rips open the door of an unlocked janitor closet. A BOX 
           of FOOTBALLS sits inside. He picks it up and BOLTS down C-POD 
           as the SCREAMS from D-POD grow DEAFENING. He BURSTS through 
           the C-POD DOORS onto --

           D-POD CHOW 

           Tyler assesses the battleground. Visible ARYANS immediately 
           turn to him, expecting something. He throws them the 
           FOOTBALLS, which they catch adroitly.

           Tyler punctures his own football with a SHANK, and pours a 
           line of yellowish LIQUID across the floor. 

           The LIQUID hits the edge of the wall and stops.

           In the distance, an ARYAN ignites the liquid. It’s KEROSENE. 
           It bursts into FLAMES and rushes toward Tyler like a dry 
           river bed fresh with heavy rain. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Alvarez COUGHS as thick SMOKE seeps under the door frame.

           INT. D-POD CHOW HALL - LATER

           Chow is up in FLAMES, filled with SMOKE. Nothing but shadows 
           moving. The riotous sounds of YELLING, SHRIEKING, BARKING. 
           TOTAL ANARCHY.

           We can barely make out Ethan running through the bedlam. 

           A glint of light hits Ethan. He panics. He looks for Tyler. 
           He looks for his assailant. A split second of stillness as he 
           and Tyler lock eyes. 

           FIRE ALARMS sound. RED LIGHTS turn on.

           Ethan looks at Tyler and takes off in the opposite direction. 
           The sensation of ESCAPE, as he disappears into the smoke.

           EXT. SWANKY TOWNHOUSE UPPER EAST SIDE, NYC - 2AM

           Chase chain smokes and frantically rings the doorbell. The 
           door finally opens. Sarah Bergen stands there in a bathrobe.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Alvarez BOLTS out of the locker room. 
           INT. PCC HALLWAY - LATER

           A TUNNEL of SMOKE. Alvarez CAREENS down it, COUGHING.

           INT. PCC BASEMENT - LATER

           Alvarez, frantic, tries to open the door. It’s LOCKED. 

           He runs downstairs to the -- 

           DEAD MAN’S ZONE

           DARKNESS 

           Alvarez BREATHING.

           He glimpses an EXIT DOOR in the distance. 

           BOOTS walking. Voices SHUSH each other.

           The sound of LIQUID poured onto the floor. The sound of it 
           STREAMING into a narrow river.

           A hand with a SHAMROCK TAT holds a lit match. The match 
           burns, fire and soot, almost to the head. The match drops. 

           A HOT orange BURST.

           Alvarez hides in the shadows. 

           A thin trail of Kerosene shoots into flames. It erupts into a 
           billowing blaze illuminating the long line of solitary cells. 
           The dead man’s zone goes up in flames.

           INT. PCC PRISON HALLWAY, EXIT - LATER

           Smoke rises and billows into a hallway on the heels of a 
           RUNNING man. 

           REVEAL ETHAN, cast in growing LIGHT, running toward the door.

           He looks back. In the distance, somewhere behind the rushing 
           smoke: RAPPING. DERANGED LAUGHTER. ONE PROMINENT MONKEY CALL.

           A windowed door glows at the end of the hallway. Outside, red 
           desert swirls beneath a street lamp in a parking lot caged in 
           barb wire.

           He tries to open it. It’s locked. His face is a black shape 
           against the street lamp. He breathes HEAVILY. A huge PUFF of 
           smoke, DISTANT SCREAMING and RAPPING, envelops him. 

           His BREATH quickens. Through the window, red dust blows 
           wildly, cloaking the lamp’s light in cloudy bursts of red. 
           The RAPPING GROWS as we push into the blinking red light onto 
           -- 

           THE DEAD MAN’S ZONE

           A fiery blaze. Alvarez, cast orange, throws his full body 
           weight into a door. The door finally BURSTS OPEN onto a --

           STAIRWELL

           Alvarez ascends the stairwell.

           A NORTE descends it with a JAGGED PIPE.  

           Alvarez retreats into the shadows. 

           He waits, BREATHING.

           INT. THE FILE ROOM - SAME TIME

           Hulking ARYAN SILHOUETTES douse the room in kerosene. 

           They turn sharply into the -- 

           HALLWAY

           One of them throws a lit match into the room. FLAMES burst 
           through the door. 

           INT. SARAH BERGEN’S HOME, NYC - MOMENTS LATER

           Mid-century modern study. Sarah and Chase stand tensely.

                                 CHASE
                        A Kronos log is impossible to read. 
                        But if you apply the original key 
                        from a paper log? A pattern 
                        emerges. There are columns -- 
                        middle name, first name, last name, 
                        maiden name -- four workers are 
                        generated from a single name. 
                        Corporate changed the key on the 
                        Kronos log to make it difficult to 
                        decipher. To deliberately mislead 
                        and defraud the American public. No 
                        chasm between corporate and the 
                        boots on the ground. DOCUMENTED 
                        corporate malfeasance. And one of 
                        the largest tax frauds ever 
                        perpetrated in American history. 
                        They make Enron look innocent.

                        before I do it. 

           INT. PCC PRISON STAIRWELL - LATER

           Alvarez waits. Listens. NO ONE. He’s sure. NO ONE. 

           He sees a DOOR to the OUTSIDE. He tries it. Locked. 

           Smoke BILLOWS into the stairwell like the breath of a dragon.

           Alvarez coughs uncontrollably and takes off his ski mask. His 
           face flickers in a blinding SECURITY LIGHT blinking outside 
           the door. 

           He hides in the shadows as another NORTE passes with a pipe.

           INT. PCC PRISON HALLWAY - LATER

           Ethan runs down a dark hallway. TEARS FLOOD from his EYES. 
           LOUD CHANTING chases him from somewhere in the distance. 

           INT. PCC PRISON STAIRWELL - LATER

           Alvarez looks up the stairs. NO ONE. 
           He looks down the stairs. NO ONE.

           He completely loses it and BANGS on the EXIT DOOR like a mad 
           man, hurling his body against it like a battering ram. 

           Suddenly, he glimpses something terrifying. 

           He’s THROWN into the door. 

           He’s HANDCUFFED to the door handle.

           A HULKING FORM SHIVS him. Dark. Illuminated. Dark. Blood. 
           Dark. Blood. 

           Alvarez SCREAMS.

                                 VOICE
                        I ain’t no dog! 

           Dark. Blood. Dark. Blood. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t no dog!

           Light flickers on the ASSAILANT’S face: it’s ETHAN -- out of 
           his body, out of his mind.

           SMOKE BILLOWS around them. Obscured in dark clouds, Ethan 
           STABS Alvarez repeatedly. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not a dog. I’m not a dog! I’m 
                        not a fucking dog!

           Ethan stops suddenly, glimmering in sinister light, clutching 
           the SHIV. 

           Alvarez’ CORPSE hangs in silhouette from the door. 

           A heavenly SUNRISE creeps through the window, as Ethan 
           beholds the corpse with wild eyes. He hyperventilates, as if 
           suddenly conscious of what he’s done and terrified by this 
           demon he’s become.

           Tyler steps into the light. He hovers over Ethan and gently 
           removes the shiv from his quivering grasp. 

           SPRINKLERS rush from the ceiling. 

           Ethan hunches over Alvarez. Their bodies become a soaked 
           human sculpture, as dawn light glows through the deluge.
           INT. SARAH BERGEN’S OFFICE, TRADING FLOOR, NYC - DAWN

           Thin light hits skyscrapers wrapped in infinite RED data -- 
           The S&P. The DOW. We realize they are looming through the 
           windows of an unfamiliar trading floor. Sarah helms the room.

                                 TRADER 1 
                        PCC. Ticker PXW. Yeah, you don’t 
                        believe me it’s gonna tank, that’s 
                        why I’m calling you numb nuts!

           EXT. PCC PRISON PARKING LOT - LATER

           Silent, smoking, destruction over the complex. 

           BLACK TRUCKS pull into the parking lot. 

           PCC SECURITY in SWAT GEAR pour out of the trucks like ants.

           A different TRUCK pulls up. Melody and Garth get out.

           INT. D-POD - LATER

           SPRINKLERS blast, shrouding bodies in smoke and water. 

           The SWAT TEAM bursts in and shoots gas into the hall as 
           bodies drop like flies.

           INT. NYSE/CNBC STUDIO - LATER

           Chase sits opposite the anchor in the glass cube. The NYSE 
           stock ticker is vast and infinite behind her. Alvarez’ leaked 
           surveillance tape plays on the studio TV screen. 

                                 CNBC ANCHOR
                        Wow. Wow. Wow. Still. Why come 
                        forward? Why risk the position? 

                                 CHASE
                        Firstly, PCC is totally criminal. 
                        Secondly. I believe in free 
                        markets. The market, unfettered, 
                        naturally corrects itself, and 
                        weeds out criminals in the process. 
                        I don’t believe in manipulating it. 
                        Gambling. Back door deals. I 
                        believe in capitalism.

           The TRADERS stare at endless twinkling TRADING MONITORS all 
           turned to PXW. They’re waiting for something. 

           Suddenly, PCC/PXW hurtles on a terrifying red decline down 
           the huge stock tickers.

           The TRADERS break into CHEERS. 

           INT. SIGNET CAPITAL, ELEVATOR - AFTERNOON

           RAJIT stands before an embedded HD SCREEN playing CNN. He is 
           FURIOUS against the jagged red topography of PXW stock 
           plummeting down a TICKER.

                                 MALE CNN ANCHOR (OVER TV)
                        PCC stock is in the toilet! Two 
                        billion off their books. Signet 
                        capital took a 300 million dollar 
                        loss. And in huge twist Sarah 
                        Bergen’s firm SHORTED PCC and came 
                        out with a cool billion. BAM! 

           The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN onto the MALE-DOMINANT TRADING FLOOR. 
           His TRADERS, shocked and weary, stare out at him from the 
           trading floor. 

           He gets a TEXT: ON HIS PHONE there is photo of Chase CLEANING 
           A TOILET while FLIPPING THE BIRD.

           A RANDOM PCC CORPORATE GUARD zips Alvarez into a body bag.

           Tassin sits in the back of his Maybach. The window curtains 
           frame churning red dust from the desert road outside. He 
           looks through the windshield as they turn into his 
           headquarters. PRESS SWARM the car. Tassin and Myers share a 
           look. Myers opens the door onto the RABID REPORTERS, SNAPPING 
           Tassin’s PHOTO, shoving MICROPHONES in his face. 

                                 REPORTER 1
                        General Tassin, what do you have to 
                        say about --
                                 REPORTER 2
                        Amidst the accusations that --

                             (putting his hand up, 
                              coolly)
                        Why don’t you let me get out of the 
                        car, before I take questions. I 
                        hope that’s alright with everyone?

           A few corporate GUARDS part the press. Tassin walks through 
           them and ascends the steps. CAMERAS FLASH on his serene face.

                                 TASSIN (CONT’D)
                        PCC has done our own extensive 
                        investigation into the matters 
                        posed in the press and by the SEC. 
                        We’ve found that there were 100  
                        hours of falsified shift logs in 
                        one prison in Arizona. This scheme 
                        was perpetrated by a few low-level 
                        PCC employees on the ground. We at 
                        PCC feel downright betrayed. Folks 
                        who work for us are family. 

           EXT. PCC PRISON YARD - DUSK

           GUARDS stand in a firing line. Their oblong shadows wave over 
           the hot earth. BASCH paces in front of them. He YELLS in a 
           few of their faces as they peel off, wounded animals. 

                                 TASSIN (V.O.)
                        As for the sensationalist tape 
                        broadcast on CNBC, PCC has engaged 
                        in legal proceedings against the 
                        network.

           Melody and Garth preside over him like alert Dobermans.

                                 TASSIN (V.O.)
                        We cooperated fully with the FBI, 
                        who turned the investigation over 
                        to Justice. As there was no 
                        evidence whatsoever to support the 
                        ludicrous allegations that PCC 
                        aligns with white gangs as a 
                        management tool.

           A three-legged dog BARKS before a of row ramshackle trailer 
           homes. It trots its scraggly shadow to the trailer next door. 
           Eva breast feeds her newborn BABY on the steps of the 
           trailer. She looks like she’s been crying. Maria and Octavia 
           play tag in the dust.

                                 TASSIN (V.0.) 
                        For more than thirty years, PCC has 
                        answered the call. For more than 
                        thirty years, PCC has strived to 
                        make America safe.

           Tyler lays in bed smoking a cigarette, watching CNN, CNBC on

           plays on CNN.

                                 TASSIN (OVER TV)
                        And we will continue to do so for 
                        the next thirty. We will serve, 
                        sacrifice and stand together, as 
                        one PCC family. 

           The CLANG of LIGHTS OUT. 

           Tyler clicks off the TVS. Tassin’s image disappears.

           TOTAL DARKNESS.

           Tyler pulls on the cigarette. One orange circle punctuates 
           the darkness.

           Eva rocks the baby on her arm, as she looks out the window at

           EXT. GALERIES LAFAYETTE, PARIS - NIGHT

           A GILDED DOME looms in the dark sky. 
           SHOPPERS SPILL out of Galeries Lafayette onto HASSMAUN 
           BOULEVARD, dwarfed by the cathedral of consumerism, behind 
           them.

           A WOMAN, smoking on a balcony, looks at them from above. 

           SUPERTITLE: PARIS.

           INT. GRAND PARIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Soft white curtains flutter in the open balcony doors. Chase 
           steps through them into her apartment. She continues smoking, 
           her focus inward, toxic, as she digests her surroundings -- 
           dark herringbone floors, mid-century modern velvet and dark 
           wood furniture, a smattering of branded contemporary art. She 
           has acquired herself a Sarah Bergen abode in Paris. She walks 
           into an --

           AIRY BEDROOM 

           A MAN lays in bed. He fiddles with an ashtray and lights a 
           cigarette. He’s partially cast in shadow.

                                 CHASE
                        Do you know why Paris has 
                        boulevards? The streets were 
                        narrow. Easily barricaded by 
                        revolutionaries. Napoleon 
                        demolished them and built 
                        boulevards. Revolution became 
                        impossible and Paris became a city 
                        of promenades.

           Chase pours herself a scotch. 

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        A stage upon which people strolled 
                        and looked at each other. Their 
                        dress. Their possessions. The lower 
                        classes began to emulate the upper 
                        classes. 

           Chase slides into bed. She opens a bottle of KLONOPIN by her 
           bedside.

                        Classes broke down and a new 
                        species of consumers was born.

           She swallows TWO KLONOPIN and shuts off the lights. 

           DARKNESS, save the edge of a curtain dancing at an open 
           window.
