          November 11, 2016
           SUNRISE

           over downtown Los Angeles... first commuters already hitting 
           the 110... cars zipping by an

           OVERPASS

           but we’re moving beneath it... down... to a

           TENT CITY

           HOMELESS early risers waking... tumbleweed beards and red 
           eyes emerging from tents... stretching... a MUTT

           BARKS like some dystopian rooster crowing and find a

           STRAY CAT

           spooked on a ledge... back arched... claws out... as a

           CITY WORKER

           reaches up with thick gloves... tiptoe on a ladder... calling 
           softly as he tries to coax it down and

           behind him... ever so slowly... 

           JACQUELINE HEATH

           emerges from the shadow of the underpass... from the thick 
           Los Angeles haze itself but we...

           KEEP FOCUS on the worker, seeing Jacqueline only in the 
           background as she approaches below... concerned...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        What are you doing to that cat?

           His eyes stay on the cat... wooing it with kissy noises...

                                 CITY WORKER
                        I’m D.A.C.C. I round them up.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Round them up for what?

                                 CITY WORKER
                        Removal.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        She’ll be killed?
                                 CITY WORKER
                        Probably yeah.

           He’s got food in his hand and slowly... the cat stalks 
           over... sniffs the bait and... he GRABS it by the scruff and

           backs down the ladder... paying her no mind...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Sir, I’d like to adopt that cat.

                                 CITY WORKER
                        You can’t adopt a feral cat. It’ll 
                        claw someone’s eyes out.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’d never forgive myself if that 
                        cat was exterminated. I insist.

                                 CITY WORKER
                        “You insist?” Listen sister, I’ve 
                        seen one of these things blind a 
                        kid. You can’t have the cat--

           HE STOPS

           seeing her for the first time... not was he was expecting...

           she’s severe... striking... early 30s... bulky fatigue jacket 
           that could be retro chic or picked up under the bridge as

           she smiles at him... and 

           the cat MEOWS...

                                                                 CUT TO

           Jacqueline carrying the cat...

           Strolling atop the overpass... cat purring contentedly... 
           morning sun high now... the beginning of a beautiful day as

           she approaches her beat-up

           HATCHBACK

           and pops the trunk and... inside is a

           CAGE FULL OF FERAL CATS

           Mean, hissing, anxious claws ready to rip... she drops the 
           new cat in...
           Sounds of a FRENZIED CAT-FIGHT as she shuts the trunk and

                                                                 CUT TO

           K-TOWN PET STORE

           The OWNER looking skeptically at the cage of sleeping cats... 
           turns back to Jacqueline...

                                 OWNER
                        Where you find these?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I am the selling agent for a highly 
                        regarded cat breeder, sir.

                                 OWNER
                        They’re drugged.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        They’re resting. Research shows 
                        that after undergoing trauma, like 
                        leaving their breeder’s home for 
                        instance, cats often experience an 
                        adrenaline dump and then fall into 
                        a deep sleep state.

           He shakes his head ‘no’...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        My client is a motivated seller.

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE counting small bills in her hatchback... still in 
           the pet store parking lot as a

           MASERATI

           pulls up... a YUPPIE COUPLE gets out...

           Jacqueline watches them... rolls down her window to 
           eavesdrop... Jacqueline is curious about people...

           The WOMAN is young, manicured... the MAN is older... eyeing 
           the crumbling store front...

                                 MAN
                        You’re kidding.

                                 WOMAN
                        Stop it. Jill got Bagel here.
           Jacqueline still watching as they head in and

           LATER

           THE COUPLE emerges... get in their car... pull out...

           Jacqueline starts her engine and we

           FOLLOW THE MASERATI

           driving west... towards the beautiful people... slums turning 
           into golf courses... mansions...

           Cruising MELROSE and it’s high-end boutiques... stilettos in 
           windowsills... thousand dollar handbags... and everywhere are

           BILLBOARDS AND ADS

           full of SMILING WOMEN... SEXY WOMEN... HAPPY WOMEN... 
           explaining what to buy and how to look and who to be and

           THE MASERATI pulls over... the WOMAN kisses her man and heads 
           into a YOGA STUDIO and

           JACQUELINE

           is still watching from behind the wheel...

           LATER

           JACQUELINE wanders the block... taking in the wealth... 
           Italian store names and espresso cups... and everywhere are

           FIT PEOPLE IN SPANDEX

           walking into ZUMBA...

           walking out of PURE BARRE...

           crammed into window-filled FITNESS STUDIOS...

           sweating on display and

           none of it is particularly fascinating to Jacqueline until... 
           she passes an open door and her ears perk up at

           MOANS OF PAIN

           whimpers choked back and swallowed... the sounds of a torture 
           chamber set to the thumping DANCE TRACK...

           Jacqueline peers in the window and watches this
           SPIN CLASS

           bursting with the PERFECT BODIES OF WEST HOLLYWOOD... pushing 
           and straining under the unblinking gaze of

           THE INSTRUCTOR 

           a purebred in a sports bra... piston-legs pumping... bike 
           RAISED above the others like a GOD QUEEN barking...

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        I need fighters now, only fighters. 
                        Are you a fighter? Two-three-and--

           Her voice rhythmic as the beat drops...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Left. Right. Left. Right. Leave it. 
                        All. Here. Now.

           The acolytes peddle for their lives...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Do not coast. In here, in life. Do. 
                        Not. Coast. Maybe you’re in a new 
                        relationship, maybe you think you 
                        can relax and “just be yourself”. 
                        Well Fuck. That. Noise. Jean. 
                        Hands. At. Three. Go!

           JEAN in the front bears down, pushes harder...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re at war, Christie. War with 
                        your body. War with yourself. And 
                        you. Will. Win. Go! 

           CHRISTIE nods, blasts through the beat...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Pick it up Alice. All the doubters, 
                        all the haters, make them choke on 
                        your dust in three. Two. One. Go-- 

           The class bouncing, driven, shirts flying off, except...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Alice. No, not again. Alice.

           OVERWEIGHT ALICE struggles in the back... wants to hide...

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You will not quit in my class, 
                        Alice. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to feel like nothing? 
                        Do you want to be nothing? Alice? 
                        Wait--

           ALICE dismounts and... RUNS out of the room... dizzy, 
           humiliated... running all the way out to the STREET where

           JACQUELINE

           is watching her with great interest... as Alice slumps 
           against the wall... head in her hands...

           BAWLING

           thick, sad, mucus-filled sobs that make you want to look away 
           but make Jacqueline ravenous as...

           Jacqueline peers back in... the Instructor pumping on... 
           driving the class... through pain, past weakness and... 

           Closer and CLOSER on JACQUELINE...

           WONDER IN HER EYES

           as the sobbing in the background SWELLS AND

                                                               SMASH TO

           SPIN GYM OFFICE

                                 JACQUELINE 
                        I’m interested in leading a class.

           THE MANAGER looks up from his magazine...

                                 MANAGER
                        Umm. You one of Gina’s friends?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Not currently, no, but if you could 
                        provide Gina’s contact info or even 
                        facilitate an e-introduction, I 
                        would love to get to know her over 
                        a casual drink or a coffee.

                                 MANAGER
                        Huh? Gina handles new trainers.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’d like to explain how my unique 
                        perspective and skill set could 
                        benefit your operation.
                                 MANAGER
                        You mean the gym? Well, like, do 
                        you have your ACSM? Your NSCA?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Unfortunately not with me. Possibly 
                        I left them in my apartment.

                                 MANAGER
                             (beat)
                        Those are certifications. We can’t 
                        hire trainers who aren’t certified. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m sure I can procure credentials.

                                 MANAGER
                        Maybe some sketchy gyms down 
                        towards Manhattan Beach, Hermosa, 
                        might hire you without certs... but 
                        really you should enroll, get a 
                        foundation, learn the basics. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’d like you to reconsider.

                                 MANAGER
                        You’re not hearing me. You’re a 
                        good looking chick but that doesn’t 
                        mean you know shit about fitness. 
                        Let me explain some things to 
                        you...

           He continues but now Jacqueline’s staring at his NECK... his 
           carotid artery

           PUMPING

           hot blood... thump-thump... starting to drown him out...

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        ...there’s a science to this... 
                        musculature... anatomy... but you 
                        girls come in and....

           She notices a LETTER OPENER on his desk... the BLADE 
           gleaming... glorious...

           THUMP-THUMP

           louder and louder... as he drones on...

           THUMP-THUMP
           and on...

           THUMP-THUMP

           finally finishing...

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        ...which is the thing a lot of you 
                        girls don’t get. Understand?

           SILENCE... Jacqueline looks up from the letter opener...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        How far is Hermosa?

           roll over more WEIGHTS... more MACHINES... more NOISE... the

           to the SYMPHONY and find

           JACQUELINE

           looking out across the gym floor like a lioness scanning the 
           plain as... we begin to hear her instruction in VOICEOVER...

                                 JACQUELINE (V.O.) 
                        We’re just warming up now. Do you 
                        know why warming up is critical?

           Her body has been purified... sculpted to perfection by an 
           unknowable number of months and reps...
                                 JACQUELINE (V.O.)
                        One, it reduces the risk for muscle 
                        and connective tissues injuries.

           Find her athletic shoulders... perfectly toned arms...

                                 JACQUELINE (V.O.)
                        Two, it increases blood flow.

                        Three, it promotes sweating. 
                        Sweating is good.

                        And four, warming up-- Peter, hands 
                        off the rails please, thank you.

                                 PETER
                        This feels a little fast.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s not.

           She ratchets his treadmill up to a brisk jog...

                        Where was I? Right, the fourth and 
                        most important reason for warming 
                        up? It provides a chance for us to 
                        chat.

                        on strategies to achieve them. I

                        I’m sorry I’m just not comfortable 
                        with this!

           He steps off the treadmill...

           Beat as Jacqueline stares at him...

           DARK WAVES rolling and breaking behind her eyes... gym sounds 
           DAMPENING in the background...

           and then...

           she smiles... sound floods back in...

                        That’s okay. We’re both just 
                        warming up, aren’t we?

                        I had a dream. To bring the most 
                        innovative minds in fitness -- the 
                        winners -- together to collaborate 
                        on the future of health. And you 
                        know where we held that first 
                        conference? A backyard in Receda. 
                        Now I want you to look around. 
                        Seven years later and we are in

                        There are thirty-one thousand 
                        fitness clubs in the United States 
                        today. 50 million members.  22 
                        billion in revenue last year... You 
                        know, there’s a place called “the 
                        pinnacle.” The top. I’ve been 
                        there. My time playing pro-
                        football. The best of the best. The 
                        Arena Football League. I know what 
                        the pinnacle feels like. Do you? Do 
                        you know what it sounds like?

                        It sounds like a knock at the door. 
                        An opportunity. And tomorrow that 
                        door is going to be opened for one 
                        of you. I’m proud to announce,

                        And they won’t just be there to 
                        watch. No, they’ll be there looking 
                        for one new face, one new product, 
                        one new workout, to build their new

           NIGHT

           as JACQUELINE climbs the steps of her stucco

           APARTMENT COMPLEX

           like human-cubbies with windows facing other human-cubbies 
           and... she scoops to pick up a

           STACK OF MAGAZINES

           outside her door and... begins to unlock an obsessive number 
           of DEADBOLTS and

           INSIDE

           it’s DISTURBINGLY STARK...

           Undecorated... barely furnished... as she passes a LAPTOP on 
           a bare desk... screen the only light source, glowing like a 
           window to the outside world and...

           Jacqueline spreads open a PAMPHLET from the fitness 
           convention... finds a glossy PHOTO of a beaming trainer 
           leading a workout on stage and...

           TEARS

           it out... she turns now to the room’s only accent... her

           VISION BOARD

           like a corkboard shrine to SUCCESS... push-pinned cut-outs of 
           SEXY PEOPLE, SEXY HOMES... fitness models and money... like a 
           collage of Vegas tourism ads...

           She tacks up the new FitCon photo... steps back... admiring 
           the it in reverence... beat and... she

           DIVES into a routine of flutter kicks, V-tucks, Russian 
           twists... eyes never leaving

           the board’s promise of a bigger and better life... stay on it

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Hello. I’m Jacqueline Heath, 
                        founder of Heath Health.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi! Let me just find you... Hmm, I 
                        don’t see you here.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Perhaps there’s been a clerical 
                        mistake? I spoke with Jeff.

                                 MIKE
                        Jeff? There’s no Jeff working here.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Then I haven’t signed up yet.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. Okay. Well you’re in luck, we 
                        still have boothes available.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Excellent.

                                 MIKE
                        They start at four thousand for the 
                        weekend.

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (beat)
                        After some consideration, I’ve 
                        decided my dynamic program won’t 
                        best be showcased with a static 
                        booth. So I’ll simply skip that and 
                        present to the reps on stage.
                                 MIKE
                        Unfortunately, presentations are 
                        only for enrolled vendors, and 
                        enrollment includes a booth.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Let’s innovate and find a solution.

                                 MIKE
                        The solution is that booths start 
                        at four-thousand for the weekend.

           An impasse... as the mood stiffens and

                                                                 CUT TO

           Jacquline wandering past stations being set up... banners 
           being stapled, samples placed... until she stops at an

           EMPTY BOOTH

           still vacant except for a taped for “ALPHA SUPPLEMENTS” and

                                                                 CUT TO

                        You must be Alpha Supplements.

           JOEY “SWOLLZ” pops his bald head up... likes what he sees...

                                 JOEY
                        Hey now.

           Joey’s shirt reads “ALPHA”... has no sleeves... 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m Jacqueline Heath, co-founder of 
                        Heath Health, and I have a 
                        proposition for you.

                                 JOEY
                        Sure, sexy. You a presenter?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Well that’s just the thing: due to 
                        a scheduling oversight I don’t have 
                        a booth. Which is why I’d like to 
                        invite you to partner with me.
                                 JOEY
                        Huh?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        In exchange for your presenter 
                        pass, I’d like to offer you a 
                        generous equity stake, say 2%--

                                 JOEY
                        No.

                        --in my company Heath Health, a--

                                 JOEY
                        No.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You’ll want to understand the 
                        product before making a decision.

                                 JOEY
                        You can have my pass and my booth 
                        for six grand.

                                 JACQUELINE

                        Health.

                                 JOEY
                        Six grand.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        500 plus a 10% stake.

           Joey looks off to an ALLEY...

                                 JOEY
                        Maybe make me a different offer. 
                        Back behind there.

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (pause)
                        I understand your implication, and 
                        I’m aware that goods-for-services 
                        trades have always had a place in 
                        dynamic economies. But I’d need to--

                                 JOEY
                        Yes or no? I’m not missing my turn 
                        for pussy. 
           OFF JACQUELINE once again smiling politely and

                                                               SMASH TO

           A PRESENTER PASS 

           around Jacqueline’s neck... she’s FLUSHED... tucks some loose 
           hair back into her ponytail... as she walks towards

           SECURITY

           and flashes the pass... she’s ushered

           BACKSTAGE

           where TRAINERS psych-up in mirrors... repeat affirmations... 
           get a pump going... as a WRANGER spots her pass...

                        “Alpha Supplements”. I almost cut 
                        your spot. You’re next.

           She peers past the curtain to the STAGE... an INDIAN GODDESS 
           gyrates to Hindi music... leading a crowd through her 
           “‘BOLLYWOOD WORKOUT”... and then

           Applause and... the wrangler gives Jacqueline the nod... she 
           breathes deep... walks out into the stage’s

           BLINDING LIGHTS

           which settle as she squints... coming into focus on the

           JUDGES TABLE

           where SHAWN sits with the REEBOK REPS... staring at her... 
           waiting...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Hello. I’m Jacqueline Heath, 
                        founder of Heath Health.

                                 SHAWN
                        Hi Jacqueline.

           Silence... one Rep whispers something to Shawn... he nods...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        Well, you look great. Tell us what 
                        you’re all about.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        At Heath Health we believe that 
                        everybody, with any body, should--
           She stops as REGISTRAR MIKE approaches Shawn... WHISPERS 
           something in his ear... they both look up at Jacqueline... 

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m sorry, if you’re not a 
                        registered presenter, I’ll need you 
                        to step down.

           Beat as she stares at MIKE... then walks backstage and

                                                                 CUT TO

           REGISTRATION 

           where Mike sits... playing with his phone... until he senses

           JACQUELINE

           leaning over his desk... uncomfortably close...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m astounded that you chose to 
                        bring up our miscommunication at 
                        that critical juncture. That would 
                        be like me using the “about us” 
                        section of the expo’s site to trace 
                        your name and phone number to your 
                        house, and then visit you there at 
                        your most vulnerable moment.

           MIKE tries to speak but nothing quite comes... she leaves and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PARKING LOT

           as the last fitness soldiers trickle out into the

           NIGHT

           dark, eerie in the infinite lot and find 

           SHAWN

           walking to his truck... climbing in... checks the mirror...

                                 JACQUELINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

           HE JUMPS as she materializes outside his window...

                                 SHAWN
                        Jacqueline, right?
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Shawn. I remembered because it 
                        rhymes with “brawn.” I’m here 
                        because I’d like your feedback.

                                 SHAWN
                        Now’s not a great time.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        There’s never a bad time for 
                        constructive feedback. It’s 
                        critical for improving performance.

                                 SHAWN
                        Listen, here’s the good news: 
                        they’re still looking. They didn’t 
                        find the right person.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Perhaps you’ve just found her for 
                        them.

           He studies her... breaking into a smile...

                                 SHAWN
                        You... you may just have some 
                        hustle muscles. What’s your 
                        following like on social?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m very private person.

                                 SHAWN
                        Well that’s a problem.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Being private?

                                 SHAWN
                        Being a person. You’re not selling 
                        a product. It’s not 2009. In 
                        today’s mobile/social world, you 
                        are the product. Jacqueline the 
                        brand. Understand?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I am the product.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m talking about personal 
                        branding. Embracing that special 
                        thing inside of you and building 
                        your brand up around that.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        That thing inside of me.

           The lot’s dead quiet now... Shawn nods...

                                 SHAWN
                        Can’t wait to find out what that 
                        is.

           She nods... determined... goal-oriented as... Shawn rolls up 
           the window and

           pulls away...

           revealing...

           JOEY’S EMPTY BMW

           The last car parked in the lot... abandoned....

           Jacqueline fishes

           JOEY’S KEYS

           out of her bag and

           BEEP, unlocks it... gets in and pulls out into the night...

           License plate reading “ALFA MLE”...

                                                                 CUT TO

           WEIGHTS RATTLING

           and 

           CABLES SLIDING 

           up and down... up and down... the rhythm of the gym and

           JACQUELINE

           is evaluating herself in a MIRROR... muscles pumped... 
           perfect sheen... ready... as she holds up her

           IPHONE

           and positions herself with studied precision:

           -- 3/4 ANGLE to the mirror --

           -- HIP OUT, ARM SKINNY -- 

           -- camera angled high to FLATTER BREASTS and--
           CLICK

           She opens her INSTAGRAM PROFILE...

           BLANK

           yearning for flesh...

           Deep breath... finger hovering... and she

           POSTS

           her first selfie...

           silence as she waits... agonizing seconds ticking and...

           NOTHING

           so Jacqueline hits the deck and begins her push-ups... hard 
           and angry and

                                                                 CUT TO

           NIGHT

           Jacqueline back in the MIRROR... drenched in sweat as...

           she examines her arm... critical fingers probing her 
           tricep... finding more

           MEAT

           than she’d like and she

           PINCHES

           the underarm hang

           SQUEEZING

           way too hard...

           COLOR DRAINING from her skin... so tight it’s about to BURST 
           and

           DING!

           She turns... goes to the computer and sees

           ‘ONE LIKE’

           She stares at it... in awe...
           Waiting for more but it’s just silence... silence and

                                                                 CUT TO

           QUIET SUBURBAN HOUSE

           Jacqueline walks up the brick pathway towards the door... 
           RINGS the doorbell and waits... inside the sounds of a

           FATHER AND CHILD

           playtime interrupted as... footsteps approach the door and 

           PUDGY PETER

           swings it open... confused by this visitor on his doorstep...

                                 PETER
                        Jacqueline?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Hi Peter. Can we talk?

           He glances back inside... hearing his SON playing and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PETER’S LIVING ROOM

           Jacqueline curiously observing Peter’s son

           JULES (4)

           playing with BARBIES on the floor... oblivious to the 
           strangeness of this new woman... and then...

                                 JULES
                        It’s you!

           He places his gloved BOXER BARBIE in Jacqueline’s hands... 
           she stares at him...  this strange, small person as

           Peter returns from the kitchen with two glasses...

                                 PETER
                        Sorry I’ve only got water.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That’s fine. Mrs. Levinson away?

                                 PETER
                        She’s got a workshop in Reno.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Peter I’ll be direct. I haven’t 
                        seen you in the gym since our first 
                        session, and that irks me. It makes 
                        me feel a sense of failure, that I 
                        wasn’t able to help you succeed.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, sorry about that...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Don’t apologize for your weakness. 
                        It’s part of who you are.

                                 PETER
                             (beat)
                        Okay.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        And it’s what makes you the perfect 
                        person to take on this journey.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t understand.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m building my brand, Peter. Look.

           She shows Peter her phone... he leans in to look and

           STARTLES at

           BREASTS... ASS... THIGHS

           DRIPPING and BULGING out of spandex... JACQUELINE’S FLESH 
           checker-boarded in endless photos scrolling down...

                                 JULES
                        I want to see!

                                 PETER
                             (immediate)
                        Go play upstairs.

           Jules frowns... mopes up the stairs...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        The thing is, I’ve been finding it 
                        difficult to gain engagement. And 
                        then I realized: my level of 
                        fitness may be too intimidating.

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT'D)
                        So I figured, what if part of my 
                        brand could be showing a client’s 
                        transformation? Especially one who 
                        started off so weak and impotent.

                                 PETER
                        How did you get my address again?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It was in the system, but what’s 
                        important is that I’m offering you, 
                        Peter, my complete suite of 
                        services, free of charge. The 
                        opportunity to change your life and 
                        inspire others in the process. We 
                        could start tomorrow.

                                 PETER
                             (pause)
                        Work’s just crazy and... Jules 
                        needs me while Tess is gone so..

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You and Mrs. Levinson don’t have 
                        sex anymore, do you.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Your son is around four, right? 
                        Statistically, sex falls off after 
                        year four of marriage. And the 
                        numbers only get more grim when one 
                        of the partners gains weight after 
                        marriage. I can see by that photo 
                        on your mantle that you have.

                                 PETER
                        I...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Now imagine what Mrs. Levinson 
                        would say if she came home and you 
                        had dropped 20 pounds. Had more 
                        energy. More libido.

           Peter laughs, picturing it... but...

                                 PETER
                        Tess and I are okay, thanks. 
                        Honestly, I’m enjoying just being 
                        able to spend time with Jules.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Well what if you couldn’t?

                                 PETER
                             (beat)
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        What if you didn’t have your son.

           Jacqueline gets up heads into his kitchen...

                                 PETER
                             (calling after her)
                        What are you talking about? Excuse 
                        me, where are you going? Hello?--

           She swoops back in

           SLAMS

           a PEPSI BOTTLE down on the table... then BANG, an orange 
           soda... BANG, a sugary fruit juice...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You said you only had water.

           He looks away guiltily...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Peter, there are enough complex 
                        sugars in that fridge to double, 
                        triple your risk for deadly 
                        conditions such as heart disease, 
                        kidney disease, and diabetes. I’m 
                        talking about years off your life. 
                        So if not for your well-being...

           She places something in his hand...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Do it for Jules.

           It’s Jules’ BARBIE... long beat... something hitting home... 
           finally he looks back up at her... touched and

           FLASH!

           An IPHONE FLASH blinding us, then settling to reveal

           PETER POSING

           in a
           GYM LOCKER ROOM

           where he stands... dumpy in an oversized t-shirt... as 
           Jacqueline snaps more photos..

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Now sideways.

           He turns to profile and FLASH!... as she snaps again...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Now without the shirt.

                                 PETER
                        I’d prefer not to.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s not a gut, it’s a time 
                        capsule. Jules will dig up this 
                        photo one day and be so proud.

                                 PETER
                        A time capsule preserves things you 
                        want to remember.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Take your shirt off.

           He obeys... ashamed... turning slowly to camera and

                                                                 CUT TO

           GYM FLOOR

           as Peter struggles through PUSH-UPS... Jacqueline over him...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Four, five...

                                 PETER
                        It hurts.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It can hurt. Eight, nine...

                                 PETER
                        I’m in pain.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You can be in pain, you just can’t 
                        be a bitch. Nine, ten... Every time 
                        you want to stop, think of him--

           Jacqueline shows him a PICTURE OF JULES on her phone...
                                 PETER
                        Did you snap that while I was in 
                        the bathroom?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        20 more. Keep thinking about Jules. 
                        One, two.... 

           Peter shakes... body overloaded... and he

           VOMITS

           violently... sputtering on hands and knees as the puddle 
           spreads and Jacqueline looks down... finally satisfied...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to make you hard, 
                        Peter. Powerful. How do you feel?

           He coughs... recovering... looks up at her... overhead lights 
           cascading down behind her like a

           SAVIOR’S HALO

           and now there’s a new look in his eyes... like a junkie 
           realizing the power of his first high...

                                 PETER
                        I feel amazing.

           as a thick STRING of saliva snaps from his mouth and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SHAWN KELLEY

           parking his car on a BLUE HANDICAP CURB... hangs a HANDICAP 
           MEDALLION over the rearview mirror and steps out...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Mr. Kelley.

           HE JUMPS...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I hope it’s okay that I stopped by. 
                        This is your office, isn’t it?

           She motions at a bleak and crumbling OFFICE BUILDING...
                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to discuss my progress.

                                 SHAWN
                        You should absolutely find someone 
                        to do that with. Just not me.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Studies say that mentoring can help 
                        reinforce your communication skills 
                        and leadership qualities, you know.

                                 SHAWN
                        I already told you: go work on your 
                        brand. How’d you even find this 
                        address?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It was simple. I convinced the desk 
                        manager at the Marriott to give me 
                        the name of the corporation that 
                        registered the conference room, 
                        then looked up the tax records for 
                        that LLC and found the associated 
                        address. That, of course, led me to 
                        a hotel in Beverly Hills, which is 
                        where you must take meetings, so I 
                        questioned several valets, who 
                        tipped me to your car, which I 
                        followed back here, to what I 
                        assume must be your actual office. 
                        And as for my personal brand, I’ve 
                        had difficulty figuring out exactly 
                        what that special thing inside of 
                        me is. But I believe you’ll find 
                        that’s exactly what makes me 
                        appealing: I have the flexibility 
                        to lean into whatever you think the 
                        market will respond to. And I know 
                        that for a master such as yourself, 
                        there’s nothing more exciting than 
                        unshaped clay. 

           He’s staring at her in disbelief... and

                                                                 CUT TO

                        Your followers are horny teenagers 
                        in Russia. To get the attention of 
                        a big fitness brand, you need to

                        Is this weird? This is weird.

           She scans his physique... a little soft but he’s handsome...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        So... Should I come in?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I just want to take things slow.

                                 ALEX
                        It’s 3AM. You said to Uber over...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I want to make a connection.

                                 ALEX
                        You said it was “thirsty thursday.”

           Beat...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Okay you can come in. But only so 
                        that we can watch a movie or an 
                        episode of television on-demand.

           He’s confused but not going to say no... follows her in...

                                 ALEX
                        Wow. It looks like Pinterest 
                        exploded in here.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’ll get us some wine.

           She moves behind a KITCHENETTE and opens a CUPBOARD as

           he takes the place in...

                                 ALEX
                        What’s this collage thing? Weird.
           She stops... inside the cupboard are WINE GLASSES and a 
           black, Sig Sauer

           HANDGUN

           her hand hovers...

                                 ALEX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, was that rude? I think it 
                        looks cool. I like art.

           She chooses the wine glasses... joins Alex at the collage...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Just all that exercise looks like 
                        torture to me, that’s all.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Actually, treadmills were 
                        originally used as instruments of 
                        torture in English prisons until 
                        they were banned for being 
                        “excessively cruel.” Silly, right?

                                 ALEX
                        What?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Anyway, you asked about my Vision 
                        Board. It’s a tool for catalyzing 
                        the Law of Attraction.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh. Cool.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s fairly simple if you’d like to 
                        create your own.

                                 ALEX
                        I, umm...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        First, find pictures that represent 
                        or symbolize the experiences, 
                        feelings, or possessions you want 
                        to attract to your life. Second, 
                        spend at least 45 minutes a day 
                        visualizing in front of the board. 
                        Third, sleep! Simply let the board 
                        work its way into your subconscious 
                        and you’ll wake each day with a 
                        vibrational impulse to achieve your 
                        goals and desires.
                                 ALEX
                        Woah. It’s like you were reading 
                        that off a website.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I find lots of great tips and lists 
                        online. You mentioned the site 
                        ‘Pinterest’? Lately I’ve been 
                        getting a lot of home decor online 
                        too lately. With point and click 
                        ordering and same-day delivery it’s 
                        never been easier.

                                 ALEX
                        Point and click delivery... Sounds 
                        like how you got me here.

           He laughs... she doesn’t... he gulps his wine...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I don’t normally do this. 
                        Actually I’ve never done this.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Me neither.

                                 ALEX
                        I only got on the app last week.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Me too.

                                 ALEX
                        I just ended a long relation--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No ex’s or politics on a first 
                        date.

                                 ALEX
                        Ha, sorry. Advice you read online?

           She sits down next to him...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’d like to explain what I’m 
                        looking for in clear, concise 
                        language. 

                                 ALEX
                        Okay...
                                 JACQUELINE
                        A driven person needs a partner. 
                        Someone with whom they can pool 
                        resources, share dreams, work 
                        alongside while divvying up 
                        parental and homemaking 
                        responsibilities, which are 
                        increasingly gender blind in modern 
                        relationships.

                                 ALEX
                        Your text said “be inside me”.

           Beat...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Physical attraction is part of it.
                        And while everyone moves at their 
                        own speed, we shouldn’t be ashamed 
                        or embarrassed to test physical 
                        compatibility early on.

                                 ALEX
                        Totally. Yes. I agree.

           Alex gulps his wine... she’s looking at him expectantly so he 
           steels himself... leans in and...

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (pulling back)
                        Wait. No. We shouldn’t.

                                 ALEX
                        Sorry. I thought you wanted-- I’m 
                        so confused. Maybe I should go--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Put your hand down my pants.

                                 ALEX
                        What?!

           She guides his hand in...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Umm... okay... Like this? Or more 
                        like--?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Just let it go limp.

                                 ALEX
                        But then I’m not really doing 
                        anything--
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Shut up.

                                 ALEX
                        Sorry.

           She uses his hand as a tool, roughly, breathing deeper...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I feel like there’s a real 
                        connection here.

                                 ALEX
                        Same, yeah.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I don’t want to have walls up.

                                 ALEX
                        Me too.

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (climbing on top of him)
                        I know it’s only our first one-on-
                        one, but--

                                 ALEX
                        Our what?

           She puts her hand over his mouth... beginning to grind on 
           him... eyes rolling back into her head...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I can tell you’re here for the... 
                        mmm... right... reasons...

           She thrusts harder, breathing heavy as we MOVE TO

           THE VISION BOARD

           and see that it too has evolved... the fitness and wealth now 
           overlaid with photos of ROMANCE... angelic FLOWER GIRLS... 
           SMILING COUPLES with PERFECT TEETH and

           we stay on the images -- family and fulfillment by way of 
           Pier One -- as the sounds of GRUNTS grow louder and

                                                                 CUT TO

           A NOISY REC CENTER

           full of KIDS yelling and playing... Jacqueline signing 
           paperwork with an ADMINISTRATOR at the front desk... he then 
           points her towards
           LAURIE (50s)

           a frazzled single foster mother... trying to keep her kids 
           organized as she drops them off at the center and

                                                                 CUT TO

           Laurie walking with Jacqueline... shoveling candy into her 
           mouth...

                                 LAURIE
                        Skittles?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No. Thank you.

                                 LAURIE
                        You volunteers are so great with 
                        the kids. I bring all seven of mine 
                        here. Good for them to meet other 
                        fosters, ya know?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Which one is mine?

                                 LAURIE
                        Well my oldest, Olivia, just came 
                        to me out of the system a year ago. 
                        She’s at the age where other girls 
                        can be mean. But you taking her 
                        out, talking to her, whatever you 
                        want to do together... just 
                        spending some time with a young 
                        woman like you might help get her 
                        some confidence.

           OLIVIA (12) sits alone at the edge of the room, kicking her 
           feet... definitely in an awkward phase... Jacqueline examines 
           her... finally...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Do you have anything prettier?

           Beat...

                                 LAURIE
                        What?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Her clothes. Does she have a change 
                        of wardrobe?

                                 LAURIE
                        Oh.
           Laurie chuckles to herself... throws a handful of Skittles 
           down the hatch and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S WORKOUT CLASS

           PETER and a handful of new CLIENTS... Jacqueline barking...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Good, Peter! Higher, Grace! Those 
                        aren’t love handles, they’re lonely 
                        handles!

                                                                 CUT TO

           WOMEN’S SPORTS STORE

           as Jacqueline walks out... followed by the girl

           OLIVIA

           in head to toe fitness wear... they walk down the sidewalk...

                                 OLIVIA
                        I look weird.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You look great, and it’s important 
                        to show that to the world. Smile.

           Jacqueline SNAPS a selfie of them... they walk on...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Are you on social, Olivia?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah but I don’t have a lot of 
                        followers like you or Gigi or 
                        Kendall or Jenna Capaldi--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Who’s that? How many does she have?

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’s another girl at school.

                        Oh, okay.

                                 OLIVIA

                        I usually only get a couple, and 
                        Brittany and Sarah don’t count 
                        ‘cause they’re my friends IRL and 
                        also I don’t really post a lot...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Well your audience isn’t going to 
                        growth-hack itself.

                                 OLIVLA
                        I dunno, I guess... I don’t really 
                        look good in pictures...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You’re probably just saying that 
                        because girls’ self-confidence 
                        takes a nosedive during ages 12 to 
                        16. Show me.

           Olivia sheepish... hands Jacqueline her PHONE...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                             (scrolling through)
                        No you’re right, these aren’t good.

           She hands back the phone... Olivia pocketing it quickly... a 
           beat as Jacqueline watches her... small, scared... then...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Why don’t I show you how?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay! Cool. Yeah.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You need to think about your 
                        profile like a story, or like a -- 
                        what’s your favorite film? -- like 
                        a Mulan or Babe 2, Pig in the City--

                                 OLIVIA
                        The Hunger Games.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Okay yes, fine, if that helps you 
                        contextualize. In the film, on the 
                        posters, how do they show the girl? 
                        Strong, right? Attractive. 
                        Powerful. They don’t show her 
                        eating a bag of potato chips on the 
                        couch or slouching her way toward 
                        lower vertebrae problems.

           Olivia sits up straight...
                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        So try again. Become her. Wait. No. 
                        Turn 90 degrees. Yes, the sun 
                        behind you will accentuate your 
                        cheekbones.

           Olivia holds up her phone... tentative but... CLICK she snaps 
           the photo...

           they review it together...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Better.

           Olivia is exultant...  Jacqueline takes out her own phone...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s get one like that for my 
                        account.

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S GROWING CLASS

           A DOZEN CLIENTS now... Jacqueline marching through their 
           ranks like a general... barking and yelling and

           OLIVIA

           watches from the back... diligently observing as Jacqueline 
           berates a struggling woman and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SUGARFISH SUSHI

           where JACQUELINE and ALEX sit in candlelight... he’s more put 
           together this time... as he tucks into a piece of SASHIMI...

                                 ALEX
                        I was surprised when you called.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        The secret is they heat the rice. 
                        It’s a technique the chef learned 
                        in Osaka.

                                 ALEX
                        I just wasn’t sure if you would.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Well that may be a self-esteem 
                        issue with you, Alex.
                                 ALEX
                        I mean, it’s cool, I’m happy we’re 
                        hanging out. I’m not really that 
                        kind of guy anyway. I was in a 
                        weird place.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        A relationship means being okay 
                        with each other’s weirdness.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah but we’re not really--

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (to passing waiter)
                        Can you take a picture of us?

           Jacqueline poses as the waiter SNAPS a picture of them... she 
           reviews it while Alex waits... finally...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        How was work today?

                                 ALEX
                        Do you even know what I do?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        What do you do?

                                 ALEX
                        I’m a--

           CLICK

           as she shoots a SUSHI PLATE the waiter sets down... turns 
           back to Alex...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        What were you saying?

                                 ALEX
                        ...I’m a graphic designer.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        An entrepreneur, I knew it. We 
                        probably even have the same sign.

                                 ALEX
                        Actually I’m in-house at this 
                        little mom and pop shop. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Building a client base until you’re 
                        ready to break off. Smart.
                                 ALEX
                        Nah, I can’t see leaving. My hours 
                        are easy, gives me time to draw.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Oh, so you’re planning a pivot?

                                 ALEX
                        Huh?

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        To monetize your drawings. Create 
                        an e-tail platform to sell them?

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Nope, drawing is just something 
                        I do for me.

           Jacqueline doesn’t understand... long beat...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        And you? You’re a trainer, right? 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m an entrepreneur in the Health 
                        and Wellness sector. Training is 
                        part of that, but it’s really about 
                        developing myself as a brand right 
                        now. I want my brand to grow with 
                        me while I grow as a person. For 
                        example, if I was to be in an 
                        exclusive relationship or even to 
                        one day -- say in the next nine to 
                        twelve months -- get engaged, my 
                        brand could produce content and 
                        products related to the fun, messy 
                        world of cohabitation. Then I could 
                        develop a Wedding Workout, a 
                        signature bridal line, fit-parent 
                        courses, etcetera. More sake?

                                 ALEX
                        Please.

           Alex throws back the whole shot and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PETER POSING AT THE LOCKERS

           Noticeably svelter as Jacqueline’s camera FLASHES and

                                                                 CUT TO
           A GOLDEN RETRIEVER

           which Jacqueline holds by the leash... dropping OLIVIA off at 
           the REC CENTER... as she gives him a goodbye hug...

                                 OLIVIA
                        Such a mush! You promise you don’t 
                        have to give him back to anyone?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No, he’s a stray.

                                 OLIVIA
                        But why does his collar have an 
                        address?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Laurie’s here. 

           She SNAPS one more photo of Olivia and the dog... LAURIE 
           approaches...

                                 LAURIE
                        Olivia honey, I need to talk to 
                        Jacqueline for a minute.

           Olivia exits... Laurie is uncomfortable...

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        Jacqueline. Hi.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Hello.

                                 LAURIE
                        So. Olivia showed me some of the 
                        photos you’ve been posting and... 
                        I’m not sure this is a good idea. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Because of her overbite?

                                 LAURIE
                        Because she’s 12. She’s 
                        impressionable. Yesterday she got 
                        in a fight with a girl at school 
                        and called her a “sperm whale.”

                                 JACQUELINE
                        She’s learning to assert herself.

                                 LAURIE
                        I just don’t think you’re the right 
                        influence.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Olivia does.

                                 LAURIE
                        Well Olivia’s not in charge. And 
                        neither are you.

           Beat as Jacqueline stares at Laurie... just stares... and 
           then... turns and walks away...

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                             (calling after her)
                        Hey!
                             (Jacqueline crossing the 
                              street)
                        You left your dog!

           THE DOG wags its tail at Laurie’s feet and

                                                                 CUT TO

           LATE NIGHT

           Jacqueline outside a

           MCDONALDS

           watching with contempt through the window at a

           FAT MAN eating a HAMBURGER

           then staring at

           CHUBBY KID SUCKING DOWN FRIES

           Jacqueline disgusted as we get CLOSER and LOUDER on

           MOUTHS CHEWING

           and

           STRAWS SLURPING

           and

           KETCHUP SQUIRTING

           and

           FAT GIGGLING 

           and finally she spots

           LAURIE
           walking out with an arm full of burgers... and Jacqueline

           FOLLOWS HER

           out into the night and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S FULL CLASS

           PACKED now... clients sweating in unison... Jacqueline 
           leading harshly... and in the back...

           OLIVIA WORKING OUT

           trying to keep up with the adults and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SHAWN’S OFFICE

           Peter’s transformation... as

           JACQUELINE

           sits with PETER... awaiting Shawn’s judgement... finally

                                 SHAWN
                        Jacqueline, I’m impressed.

                        Impressed with myself, for 
                        recognizing something in you. This 
                        transformation is amazing.

                                                          PETER
           Thank you.
                                              Thank you.

           She shoots Peter a look...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        In six weeks I’ve acquired over 
                        30,000 followers organically, using 
                        content marketing to ensure that 
                        engagement is at least two X 
                        established averages for the 
                        lifestyle fitness space.
                        My class was full every night last 
                        week, and I’ve been carefully 
                        documenting Peter’s progress.

                        Not only has he lost seventeen 
                        pounds, but he’s feeling more 
                        confident, more energetic, more--

                                 PETER
                        Powerful!

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Don’t interrupt me.

                                 PETER
                        Sorry.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        More powerful than ever before.

           Shawn considers this... Jacqueline nods to Peter and he takes 
           his cue to leave them...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        So. You were going to set a meeting 
                        with your contacts at Reebok.

                                 SHAWN
                        You’ve got quite the memory.

                        Fiber-rich whole grains. When would 
                        work best?

                                 SHAWN
                        It could be a few weeks. In the 
                        meantime, keep slimming him down 
                        and we’ll bring him along. And keep 
                        showing us the lifestyle. The kids, 
                        the pets, the home, it’s working.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Thank you.

           Jacqueline gets up to go...

                                 SHAWN
                        Hold on.

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (moving to the door)
                        I’m looking forward to our meeting 
                        with Reebok.

                                 SHAWN
                        We’re not done yet.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Peter’s waiting.

                                 SHAWN
                        Peter can wait.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        He’s a valued client--

                                 SHAWN
                        I didn’t make the Colorado Crush by 
                        moving on weaker men’s schedules.

           Jacqueline is silent... Shawn motions “sit”...

           he goes to the credenza... picks a favorite football photo... 
           gently sets it down on the desk in front of her...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        You know the drill. No, don’t look 
                        at me...

           as he starts walking around to the backside of her chair....

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        Keep looking at the photo.

           ON JACQUELINE... face stone... as we hear the sound of

           RUBBING

           aggressive, hateful friction bleeding in and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S APARTMENT

           where we see the sound is from a pencil CIRCLING answers in a

           COSMO MAGAZINE QUIZ

           asking “What Kind of Woman Are You?”... answers circled more 
           and more obsessively as we scroll down the page as

           Jacqueline absently circles an answer... over and over 
           again... the graphite RUBBING loudly... harder and harder and 
           harder until the page

           TEARS

           snapping Jacqueline out of it... and she places it on the 
           “finished pile” which is a

           TOWERING STACK
           of women’s magazines... full of endless lists and tips and 
           personality modifications and new looks for Fall and the

           DOORBELL RINGS

           and Jacqueline puts on a smile... she opens the door...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        So glad you came over.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey. Yeah. I have to be up early so 
                        I can’t sleep over. Also my neck 
                        hurts, so be careful this time if 
                        you’re going to climb up on my--

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey!

           OLIVIA bounds into the room... Alex is speechless...

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

                                 ALEX
                        I’m Al--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        He’s my boyfriend. Alex, Olivia 
                        here is staying with me while her 
                        caretaker is in the hospital.

                                 OLIVIA
                        She got in an accident.

           Alex bends down to her... good with kids...

                                 ALEX
                        Aww that’s a bummer Olivia.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No it’s awesome, I like Jacqueline 
                        more.

           He LAUGHS... immediately liking her...

                                 ALEX
                        Well it’s very cool of Jacqueline 
                        to hang out with you. You know I 
                        hang out twice a week with some 
                        kids your age at the Y.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You do?
                                 ALEX
                        Yup. I teach them art classes. 
                        Here, I’ll show you.

           He begins to DRAW on a NAPKIN... Jacqueline takes out her 
           phone and begins to photograph the scene and

           LATER

           OLIVIA SNORES on the couch... Alex and Jacueline sip wine...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Is everything okay? With 
                        Olivia’s...?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Foster mom. We’ll see. She’s not a 
                        healthy person. The youth program 
                        where I volunteer placed Olivia 
                        with me temporarily.

                                 ALEX
                        Volunteer? I didn’t realize you 
                        loved kids too. I’m... I’m really 
                        happy you felt comfortable sharing 
                        all this with me. It’s really cool.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        So share something with me.

                                 ALEX
                        Like what?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You told me you just got out of a 
                        relationship.

                                 ALEX
                        Umm...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Discussing past relationships can 
                        deepen a bond between partners.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, I’m just not comfortable--

           She places her hand on his thigh...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                             (immediate)
                        She cheated on me.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Tell me more.

                                 ALEX
                        I dunno, you’ll think I’m...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        More.

           He takes another sip of wine... his eyes are glassy...

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, well... The sad thing is that 
                        when it happened, I actually felt 
                        relieved. Not that I didn’t love 
                        her, but... all these decisions, 
                        propose or break-up or whatever, it 
                        felt like they were all on me. And 
                        when she left it was like... she 
                        took that weight off of me.

                                 JACQUELNE
                        Keep going.

                                 ALEX
                        I know it’s not healthy, letting 
                        life just happen to me like that, 
                        but... I dunno, do you get what I’m 
                        talking about?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Living passively. Which can include 
                        everything from letting dreams pass 
                        by to forgetting to charge your 
                        cellphone before bed. 

           He laughs... feeling like weirdly she understands him....

                                 ALEX
                        This type of stuff... direction, I 
                        guess?-- It’s always been an issue 
                        for me. My parents weren’t really, 
                        like, present, you know? I never 
                        had anyone to push me and... Jesus, 
                        I’m sorry. I’m drunk. I’m 
                        blabbering.

           But she’s staring at him intensely... beat and...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I know exactly what you’re talking 
                        about. And I want to help you.

                                                                 CUT TO
           FITNESS CLASS

           where CLIENTS get settled... all oddly quiet... except

                                 ALEX
                        Am I late?

           Heads turn... like he’s yelling at a tennis match...

                                 NEIGHBOR
                             (nervous whisper)
                        You’re fine. Just--

           she hushes as

           JACQUELINE 

           enters and everyone SNAPS TO ATTENTION... Jacqueline stalks 
           silently through the mats... passing Alex... 

                                 ALEX
                        Hey!

           She says nothing... takes her place at the front...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        The word for the day is “agency”.

           They nod...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Owning your emotions, taking 
                        control of your actions, your 
                        workout, your life. Starting now. 

           MUSIC

           thumps in and the clients HUSTLE to stations... get busy 
           sweating... all experienced but

           ALEX 

           is confused... trying to follow his neighbor as

           JACQUELINE

           weaves through, shark-like, speaking to all...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you can’t control your diet. 
                        Or you’re scared to confront that 
                        colleague in the office place. 
                        Maybe you’re disorganized. 
                        Directionless.
           Alex bops his head, yes, as the beat pumps, starting to feel 
           it...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe for you agency means being 
                        decisive in your relationships, 
                        instead of sitting in the passenger 
                        seat like a whiny little bitch.

           Huh?, Alex lifts his head, but a

           BUZZER

           sounds and the class races to new stations... workout 
           intensifying... Alex shakes it off... tries to keep up...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Agency. Pushing yourself instead of 
                        being pushed. Not being content to 
                        make your little doodles all day at 
                        a job you’re afraid to leave.

           Alex halts his BENCH PRESS, what the fuck?... but the

           THE BAR

           is heavy... dropping slowly... he tries to resist but... it’s 
           too much... depressing into his chest...

           JACQUELINE

           appears right above him...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        You can do this. Imagine someone 
                        who’s humiliated you. Degraded you. 
                        Don’t let them weigh you down. Push 
                        them up! Visualize the man she ran 
                        off with. The man who took what was 
                        yours. The alpha to your weak, 
                        ineffectual beta...

           The bar CUTTING into him now... he can’t budge it... and...

           SHE SAVES HIM

           by lifting it back on the racks... then heads off to the next 
           client without a second thought... but we

           STAY ON ALEX

           gasping, angry, humiliated, and

                                                               SMASH TO
           THE SHOWER

           as Alex braces under the spray... shaken... then

           FREEZES

           as he hears footsteps... he peaks out of the shower 
           curtain... no one’s there... and

                                                                 CUT TO

           Alex changing at his locker...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           HE JUMPS

           then starts hastily pulling on his clothes, jaw set...

                                 ALEX
                        This is the men’s locker room.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You’ve been in here 25 minutes, 
                        they’ve all left. I thought maybe 
                        you needed help. Those box jumps 
                        can really shock the quads and-- Is 
                        something wrong? You’re going to 
                        have to communicate with me if our 
                        relationship is going to--

                                 ALEX
                        “Our relationship?!” 

           He SLAMS the locker closed... spins to her, furious...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Those things I told you were 
                        personal.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That’s why they were motivating.

                                 ALEX
                        They were humiliating.

           He bounces on one foot, struggling to pull on his shoes... 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Ah, okay. I understand.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m glad to hear that--
                                 JACQUELINE
                        This isn’t really about me at all, 
                        this is a defense mechanism. Your 
                        body’s natural resistance to 
                        change. Several things can trigger 
                        this:  One, a sudden increase in--

                                 ALEX
                        Shut up. Shut. Up.

           He slings his bag over his shoulder...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        This is absolutely about you.
                        I don’t like you. And believe it or 
                        not, I like me! Sometimes. And 
                        maybe I don’t want to change. Maybe 
                        I don’t want to be like...

           He points an exasperated finger at her... her perfect body, 
           her fucking abs and... fuck it...

           he turns on his heel and marches out... and we stay on

           JACQUELINE, face growing colder and colder and

                                                               SMASH TO

           JACQUELINE’S CAR

           horn blaring as she

           BLASTS

           down the 405... SMASHING the accelerator... a PHONE 
           RINGING... finally going to voicemail...

                                 PETER (VOICEMAIL GREETING)
                        Hi it’s Peter, please leave a 
                        message.

                                 JACQUELINE (LEAVING VOICEMAIL)
                        Peter you missed class today. 
                        Again. This is not appropriate 
                        behavior three days out from the 
                        most meaningful meeting of our 
                        lives. This is not how you respect 
                        yourself and your body. This is not 
                        how you show commitment to your 
                        future--

           A minivan HONKS and she SWERVES... missing it by inches and

                                                                 CUT TO
           PETER’S YARD

           where her car screeches to a stop, bumper jabbing a

           BARBIE PLAYHOUSE

           left on the edge of the lawn and Jacqueline

           MARCHES

           to the front door... BANGS... no answer and she goes around 
           to the back door... tries the knob... it’s open... and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PETER’S KITCHEN

           as she steps in quietly...

           scans left... scans right... her face falls... an

           EMPTY BAG OF CHIPS

           lies crumpled on the floor... she moves to hall and finds an

           EMPTY COOKIE SLEEVE

           and further up a

           SPENT CANDY WRAPPER

           Trash like a trail of weakness... which she follows to the

           LIVING ROOM

           with her teeth grinding as she rounds the corner and sees a

           JUNK FOOD BONEYARD...

           FAST FOOD bags and CANDY piled on side tables... SODA cans 
           and CHINESE FOOD cartons littered across the rug and there’s

           PETER

           asleep on the couch amidst the trash heap... lazy and 
           undisturbed and Jacqueline’s eyes darken in

           DISGUST

           RAGE

           as he snores like a pig and

                                                               SMASH TO
           SUBURBAN ROADS

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

           as he runs... Jacqueline pushes his back... faster...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        We’re past apologies. We’re past 
                        excuses and the stories you tell 
                        yourself about being weak. You are 
                        strong. I made you strong. And I 
                        will not have you disrespect... 
                        yourself.

           They round an outcrop of trees and look up...

                                 PETER
                        Please. No.

           Fear in Peter’s eyes... reveal they’re at the base of

           STEEP FOOTHILLS

           barren and mean and

                                                                 CUT TO

           - Peter STRAINING up the trail, really sweating

           - THE HIGH SUN torture in his eyes

           - Peter drenched, breathing, looking back and THERE’S 
           JACQUELINE, eyes grilling him, keeping pace and they go

           HIGHER INTO THE FOOTHILLS

           Where Peter stops, bent over, coughing, dizzy and

           FALLS TO HIS KNEES

           as the ground starts to bulge and distort... eyes watery, 
           mouth drooling...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Get up, Peter. I won’t let you 
                        quit. 

           Peter looks skyward seeing nothing but SUN AND HILLS... where 
           the fuck are they?...

                                 PETER
                        Why... why are you doing this?
           She takes out her phone... shows him the photo of JULES...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Do you remember why you started?

                                 PETER
                        Jules, I know, I know--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No you don’t know. You don’t know. 
                        What it could be like. Abandoned.  
                        Raised alone--

                                 PETER
                        Huh? Jules isn’t--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Bullied by the other girls--

                                 PETER
                        What are you talking about?--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Being powerless and getting kicked 
                        out of school and being made to 
                        feel weak and worthless and having 
                        to work the corner and be degraded 
                        five times a night by disgusting 
                        fat men in hotel rooms just to eat 
                        and--

           She stops... he gets it...

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry, Jacqueline.

           And her eyes SNAP back to him...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m talking about Jules. Jules. Do 
                        you understand me? Now get on your 
                        fucking feet or I will take this 
                        water bottle and leave you up here 
                        to rot.

           She lifts him roughly by the arm and pushes him on... towards 
           a steep face... he stumbles up... zombie like... as

           JACQUELINE

           watches him go... 20 yards... 40... 60... until HE STOPS and

                                                                 CUT TO
           Jacqueline clambering up... hearing faintly running water... 
           reaching him and seeing... the sound isn’t water but 

           PETER PISSING HIMSELF

           as a dark stain spreads on his shorts... except the liquid is

           DARK BROWN

           like tea, now dripping, now trickling down his leg as his 
           eyes roll back...

                                 PETER
                        Ambulance...?

           and he collapses...

           She begins to pour water into his lips... check his pulse... 
           talking all the way through... clinical...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That is myoglobin in your urine. 
                        Your muscles have ruptured and 
                        blood is flowing into your body. 
                        Interesting, I’ve never actually 
                        seen Rhabdomyolsis up close.
                             (he’s trying to speak)
                        What? No Peter, I can’t call for 
                        help. Why? Because someone less 
                        familiar with your fitness regime, 
                        or should I say lack of regime, 
                        might think that I caused this, 
                        when in fact-- quiet, just, shhh -- 
                        when in fact, you caused this. How? 
                        Via your sedentary lifestyle, your 
                        gluttonous fat consumption, and 
                        your selfish attitude-- Peter, no--
                             (she pries open his 
                              closing eyelids)
                        You’re looking for an out again, 
                        and it’s important that you not be 
                        conditioned to think that pain 
                        equals rest. I want to make you 
                        strong, Peter. I-- Peter?

           He’s dead...

           Jacqueline rises...

           Looks down at Peter’s body... looks around but there’s

           NO ONE

           for miles... beat and... without ceremony... she begins
           STRETCHING

           performing static lunges to loosen hip flexors, ankle pulls 
           to prepare quads, toe-touches to engage glutes (holding, 
           never bouncing) and all the while

           PETER’S BODY

           lies wet and heavy in the foreground...

           finally she bends down... throws his arm over her shoulder... 
           begins to LIFT him and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SHAWN’S OFFICE

           Shawn paces behind his desk...

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t understand.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        He’s no longer available to us.

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t understand what that means.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Your questions betray a lack of 
                        trust in my decision-making. 

           But he’s not listening anymore, buried in his phone...

                                 SHAWN
                        If he’s pussying out we’ll just 
                        need to show them some of his 
                        weight loss photos that you’ve--
                             (stops scrolling)
                        Where are the pictures of Peter?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You’re not hearing me. Peter is no 
                        longer a part of my brand. Peter 
                        has been disassociated.

           Vague understanding starts to register on his face...

                                 SHAWN
                        What have you done to--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I didn’t do anything to him.
                                 SHAWN
                        ...to me, you stupid bitch! What 
                        did you to me?! Three days from the 
                        meeting and you pull this shit?! My 
                        reputation is on the line. Maybe I 
                        was wrong about you,  maybe you’re 
                        not a brand ambassador. Maybe 
                        you’re just another tight ass in 
                        yoga pants.

           Jacqueline is gripping her armrest so tight it CREAKS...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        That’s the problem with all of you. 
                        You get a little attention for your 
                        tits and then you start thinking 
                        you have a business mind and--

           CRACK

           as the cheap armrest RIPS OFF in Jacqueline’s hand...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        I’m e-mailing them to cancel the 
                        meeting. And I’m billing you for 
                        the chair.

                                                                 CUT TO

           BARBELLS RATTLING

           and

           FEET POUNDING TREADMILL

           angry and intense and aggressively rhythmic and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE IN THE MIRROR

           pinching together a

           TINY ROLL

           of flesh on her stomach... just skin, really, as she starts

           SQUEEZING

           so hard her knuckles whiten and

           so hard her hand starts to shake and

           BLOOD begins to pool and drip and
           JACQUELINE’S GAZE

           is still perfectly cold and

                                                                 CUT TO

           DUSK

           as Jacqueline sits on a PARK BENCH across the street from

           SHAWN’S OFFICE

           waiting... and later it’s

           NIGHT

           and SHAWN exits... heads toward his car... oblivious...

           searching for his keys in his pocket... his briefcase... 

           seconds tick and he’s totally alone in the lot but...

           he finds his keys... unlocks the car... drives away and

           JACQUELINE

           is still on the bench... waiting for him to leave... then she 
           heads for the building and

                                                                 CUT TO

           HALLWAY

           in the dark building where... Jacqueline goes to Shawn’s 
           door...  tests the lock... bends down to work it and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SHAWN’S OFFICE

           as Jacqueline sits at his COMPUTER... keyboard RATTLING and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SUNRISE

           over

           REEBOK HEADQUARTERS

           a gleaming testament to the $80 billion fitness industry... 
           towering glass and steel, cold and hard and modern and heels
           CLACK

           against the polished floor as Jacqueline walks up the

           ENTRANCE HALL

           with BANNERS of the biggest faces in sport and fitness and 

           LATER

           Jacqueline sits in the waiting area.. leafing through promo 
           magazines... sculpted bodies... sex and sports...

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        Jacqueline?.

           THE ASSISTANT could have stepped right from the pages and

                                                                 CUT TO

           Glass offices full of FIT YOUNG PEOPLE... the ASSISTANT 
           leading Jacqueline and making small talk and finally they 
           arrive at a DOOR... he knocks and opens it into a

           CORNER OFFICE

           that’s chic and bossy and befitting the woman sitting inside

           KAREN COLE

           who’s earned her place as VP of marketing and you’d better 
           not forget it... with her short blonde bob and fitted white 
           pantsuit and smile that says “damn straight I’m 50”...

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Karen, Jacqueline Heath is here.

                                 KAREN
                        And did you offer her a juice?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Ms. Heath said she didn’t want--

                                 KAREN
                        Thank you.

           He nods... small... exits... 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Jacqueline! Please, come in. Sit.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Thank you.
                                 KAREN
                        It’s wonderful to meet. So sorry to 
                        hear Shawn isn’t feeling well.

                                 JACQUEILNE
                        Unfortunately the venereal 
                        infection he contracted seems to 
                        have spread. Don’t worry though, 
                        I’m ready to lead you through all 
                        aspects of Heath Health myself.

                                 KAREN
                        Well aren’t you something.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I believe that failing to prepare 
                        is preparing to fail, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        I agree.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        This mindset has helped me create 
                        value throughout my professional 
                        history, several examples being--

                                 KAREN
                        Jacqueline, please. This isn’t a 
                        job interview.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It isn’t?

                                 KAREN
                        I just want to get a sense of what 
                        you’re all about. Your goals.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Currently my goal is be the face of 
                        your new gym.

                                 KAREN
                        Of course. But why you? What makes 
                        you different? How would a Reebok 
                        by Jacqueline Heath fitness center 
                        feel? What is your brand?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s my lifestyle. Feminine, fun, 
                        fulfilled. I call it ‘The Three 
                        F’s” and I-- Is something wrong?

           Karen is disappointed...
                                 KAREN
                        I get that your posts are going for 
                        that. But I don’t see it. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Perhaps I can lead you through some 
                        visualization exercises.

                                 KAREN
                        You’re selling “cute” and “happy”, 
                        but it doesn’t fit. Perhaps you 
                        need a little more time to figure 
                        what you’re all about. Let’s try 
                        again when Shawn is feeling better.

           She goes to the door, inviting Jacqueline to leave but...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I cut Shawn out.

                                 KAREN
                             (stopping)
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I broke into his office, logged 
                        onto his computer, and reset this 
                        meeting without him. The branding 
                        confusion you mentioned, that was 
                        Shawn’s influence, his attempt to 
                        ‘soften’ my image. Truthfully, I 
                        sometimes think that he wants to 
                        domesticate my brand. To make me a 
                        wife or a mother. A male fantasy. 
                        But I’ve done my homework on you, 
                        Karen, on your rise from the 
                        backroom to the boardroom, and I 
                        think that if anyone could 
                        understand a strong, female brand, 
                        it would be you.

           Karen doesn’t say anything for a long time... then...

                                 KAREN
                        Aggressive. That’s what you are.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Aggressive.

                                 KAREN
                        Fierce. Independent. You don’t need 
                        a man, you don’t need anyone.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m strong enough on my own.

           Karen studies Jacqueline... it’s a perfect fit and Karen 
           knows it... and

                                                                 CUT TO

           SHAWN’S OFFICE

           as he enters in the morning... flips the light and sees

           HIS FOOTBALL PHOTO

           is propped up on the middle of his desk... what the?--

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Good morning Shawn.

                                 SHAWN
                             (jumping)
                        Jesus.

           She sits on the credenza... admiring the other photos...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Redecorating. That one’s your 
                        favorite, right?

           Shawn’s young mug stares back at him from the desk...

                                 SHAWN
                        How did you get in?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You know your problem, Shawn? 
                        You’re visualizing the wrong things 
                        with these photos. Things you’ve 
                        already done. The past. My vision 
                        board, in contrast, catalyzes the 
                        law of attraction by focusing on 
                        the future. Things I’ll be doing. 

                                 SHAWN
                        If I had a dime for every crazy 
                        bitch who got obsessed with me and--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Like the new fitness center I’m 
                        opening with Reebok.
                                 SHAWN
                             (beat)
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Karen Cole and I interfaced.

                                 SHAWN
                        I cancelled the meeting.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Then you emailed and reset it from 
                        this very computer. Or someone did.

                                 SHAWN
                        Bullshit.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Sure. It’s not like anyone could 
                        get in here without you, right?

           Shawn stares at her... long beat and...

                                 SHAWN
                        You little cunt.

           HE CHARGES

           pinning her up against the wall... as she pries at his 
           fingers around her neck...

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        First I’m going to call Karen and 
                        explain everything. Then I’m going 
                        to fucking punish you.

           He drops her in a heap... she gasps for breath as... he picks 
           up his office phone and dials...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You could. If you want to explain 
                        how Karen’s favorite new brand 
                        ambassador worked around you and 
                        impressed the entire sponsorship 
                        team after you said she “wasn’t 
                        ready.” Then, after highlighting 
                        your colossally bad judgement, 
                        you’d have to explain why you’re 
                        letting a personal quarrel get in 
                        the way of their million dollar 
                        business decision. Yes, let it 
                        ring, it’s only your single 
                        strongest brand relationship.

                        And then of course there are those 
                        photos you made me take.

           Shawn stops dead... trapped... he hangs up the phone...

                        Okay, okay. We’ve both made 
                        mistakes. The important thing now 
                        is that we move forward.

                        with my connections, I can get you--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        They have people to handle that.

                        I will. But first I need to come 
                        clean: I’m not here to redecorate. 
                        I’m here to thank you for inspiring 
                        me to be my best self, and to 
                        return the favor.

           She looks over the memorabilia... zeroes in on a TROPHY...

           Shawn’s eyes SHOOT OPEN in dreadful recognition... as she 
           approaches with it... a sharply angled

           of rough, gold-painted plastic...

                        No, don’t look at me. Look at the 
                        photo.

                                                                 CUT TO

           A MASSIVE WRAP OF JACQUELINE

           unfurling from the roof of the

           REEBOK GYM CONSTRUCTION SITE

           as Jacqueline, Karen and SUITS look on proudly... WORKERS 
           secure it around the building shell and 

                                                                 CUT TO

           A HARD HAT TOUR

           through the gutted industrial space... a CONTRACTOR 
           explaining what’s going where and Jacqueline spies a

           BLUEPRINT

           open on a sawhorse and no one notices as she SNATCHES it and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S APARTMENT

           where she’s piously PLANKING at night, eyes fixed ever up at

           HER VISION BOARD

           which has GROWN... metastasized up the entire wall... GYM 
           BLUEPRINT now in the center... spidering skyward towards

           photos of OPRAH and SANDBERG and other

           FEMALE TITANS

           of art and industry, strong executives, strong pantsuits...

                                 OLIVIA
                        I want to work out with you!

           Olivia breaks the spell... plops down... Jacqueline annoyed 
           as Olivia now takes out her phone and poses for a SELFIE--
                                 JACQUELINE
                        STOP!

           Olivia recoils... scared...

                                 OLIVIA
                        But... but I just wanted to...?

           Tears welling... Jacqueline leans down to her...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Do you know what “re-branding” 
                        means, Olivia? I’m explaining this 
                        to you because you’ve been showing 
                        such maturity lately and-- here, 
                        no, don’t use your hand, use the 
                        tissue, thank you-- You’re making 
                        so much progress on your own 
                        journey that I think you’ll be able 
                        to understand: strategic goals can 
                        change. And sometimes we have to 
                        shift an established image, or 
                        project a different side of 
                        ourself, to suit new circumstances. 
                        For example, I’m no longer 
                        projecting the side of myself that 
                        involves you. Because I’m leaning 
                        into being fierce and independent. 
                        Understand?

                                 OLIVIA
                             (sniffling)
                        Not really.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No more pictures.

           as Olivia nods... still hurt and confused and

                                                                 CUT TO

           CAFE GRATITUDE

           where Jacquline sits at a corner table... backed by a wall of 
           colorful AFFIRMATIONS declaring ”I am Dynamic!”, “I am 
           Present!”, etc... she sees a YOUNG WOMAN enter and waves over

           MORGAN BAILEY (30s)

           confident, professional, fast-rising senior editor at Conde 
           Nast...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Morgan?
                                 MORGAN
                        Jacqueline. Great to meet you.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That top is so cute.

                                 MORGAN
                        Oh, thanks.

           She sits...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        How cute is this place?

           Jacqueline is artificially bouncy... like she read “cute” was 
           a word woman use with each other...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        The menu items are named different 
                        affirmations, like “Vivacious” or 
                        “Extraordinary.” And when ordering, 
                        you’re asked to preface your choice 
                        with “I am” instead of “I’ll have.” 
                        So when ordering you might say “I 
                        am Vivacious,” or “I am 
                        Extraordinary.” 

           Morgan smiles politely...

                                 MORGAN
                        Thanks for agreeing to meet.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’ve read some of your many 
                        bylines. I’m so impressed that you 
                        hold a a staff position with the 
                        Conde Nast publishing family, given 
                        the rise of “permalancers” in 
                        online journalism today.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m glad we’re sitting down.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        And I’m glad we’ve been able to 
                        connect interpersonally and get 
                        comfortable before the interview.

           Okay... Morgan takes out a pen and notebook...

                                 MORGAN
                        Mind if I take notes?
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Of course not. I’m so excited to be 
                        featured.

                                 MORGAN
                        Before we start I should tell you 
                        I’m not 100% sure there’s a story 
                        here yet. I’m still exploring.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Exploring my story?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes, and--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s one of strength and 
                        independence. “One Woman’s Climb Up 
                        the Mountain.”

                                 MORGAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That’s just one idea I had for a 
                        title. You don’t have to use that 
                        exactly, but it should give you a 
                        sense of the article’s shape.

           Morgan raises a hand to stop her...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m sorry. You probably want to 
                        start with the gym opening. Of 
                        course. I’m not an expert like you, 
                        but I’ve read about the necessity 
                        of a “timely hook” for an article’s 
                        “lede”. I’ve even thought about 
                        what your “nut graph” might look 
                        like, and think that a description 
                        of my message to women could be 
                        perfect. So maybe that’s what you 
                        want to ask me about first?

                                 MORGAN
                        Actually no. 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No?

                                 MORGAN
                        I want to ask you about Peter 
                        Glenn.
           Jacqueline freezes... Morgan taps her pen... seconds tick...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Really cute rings by the way.

                                 MORGAN
                        Thank you. So?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes?

                                 MORGAN
                        Peter. You were his trainer?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Oh. Yes. Not for months though.

                                 MORGAN
                             (checking her notes)
                        Hmm... his wife said his last 
                        payment to you was three weeks ago?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Oh that could be correct, yes. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Jacqueline, I’m so sorry to tell 
                        you this but... did you know that 
                        Peter was found dead?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Oh. Oh my goodness.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m sorry. This must be a lot.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes.

                                 MORGAN
                        What are you feeling?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Several strong, consuming emotions.

                                 MORGAN
                        Can you talk me through what they 
                        are?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Just all the normal ones a person 
                        in this situation would feel.
                                 MORGAN
                        So to be clear, you hadn’t heard?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No. Peter had stopped his sessions 
                        so I figured he had fallen back 
                        into old habits. Disappointing. 

                                 MORGAN
                        And... heartbreaking, right?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes. Just terrible. Should we take 
                        a peek at the menu?

                                 MORGAN
                        They think he died of a cardiac 
                        problem related to over-exercise. 
                        What do you think about that?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        If you’re hungry, the blackened 
                        tempeh is delicious and it’s on me.

                                 MORGAN
                        Jacqueline?

           Jacqueline puts down the menu...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I was under the impression your 
                        article was about my gym opening. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I apologize, I should have been 
                        more clear.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        This feels like some sort of 
                        interrogation.

                                 MORGAN
                        Not an interrogation.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        But you’re not here to profile me.

           Morgan puts her pen down...

                                 MORGAN
                        Peter isn’t the first case, nation-
                        wide I mean, of death from over-
                        training.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        This kind of accident is becoming 
                        more and more common as intense 
                        workouts like CrossFit grow... Add 
                        to that the spread of body 
                        dysmorphia, that women diagnosed as 
                        such are 45 times more likely to 
                        commit suicide than the rest of the 
                        population... And the way social 
                        media is pushing this sort of 
                        compulsive body fetization further 
                        than ever... I mean, “waist 
                        trainers?” “Thigh gaps?” It’s all a 
                        a little disturbing, don’t you 
                        think? The article I’m exploring 
                        would be a trend story about our 
                        collective obsession with fitness. 
                        For balance I need a trainer’s 
                        perspective, so I thought: why not 
                        go right to Peter’s?

           Jacqueline studies her closely... long beat and...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Morgan, you’re absolutely right. 
                        There is an unhealthy obsession for 
                        some people. Sick people. Peter was 
                        obsessed. Insecure. Possibly from 
                        some childhood sexual trauma. 
                        Actually you should look into that. 
                        I tried to limit him, but he must 
                        have been working out on the side.

                                 MORGAN
                        So you’re saying he was the one 
                        working himself too hard?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I provide a positive push, I don’t 
                        bear down on tear-downs.

                                 MORGAN
                        Would your clients agree?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Absolutely.

                                 MORGAN
                        So then you wouldn’t mind if I 
                        reached out to...
                             (searching her notes)
                        Alex Tomlinson?

           Long beat... a woman shouts ”I am glorious!” at another 
           table... finally...
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Can you remind me who that is?

                                 MORGAN
                        You don’t remember? Someone who 
                        maybe had a bad experience?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I can’t recall. Perhaps you can 
                        tell me what you know?

                                 MORGAN
                        He posted a particularly harsh 
                        review online.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        That doesn’t sound right. Maybe 
                        you’re reading it out of context?

                                 MORGAN
                             (reading from her phone)
                        “I feel it is my responsibility to 
                        warn the world about Jacqueline 
                        Heath. Stay away from this trainer” 
                        -- that last part he underlined and 
                        italicized-- “Jacqueline is 
                        monstrous, and anyone who doesn’t 
                        share her twisted value system is 
                        mocked, humiliated, subjected to--”

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Alex. Of course.

                                 MORGAN
                        You remember him now?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes.

                                 MORGAN
                        Great, because there’s more.
                             (reading)
                        “She’s created a culture of fear 
                        and shame... fixating on clients 
                        with low self-esteem... bragged to 
                        me multiple times about one 
                        ‘success’ story I’ll just call 
                        ‘Poor Peter’, who she seems to be 
                        particularly cruel to...”
                             (beat)
                        He must be talking about Peter 
                        Glenn, no?
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Alex has a lot of free time. Which 
                        he ought to be spending on personal 
                        and career goals.

                                 MORGAN
                        Regardless, it sounds like he 
                        wouldn’t agree that your methods 
                        are healthy. Particularly in 
                        Peter’s case.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Alex is mistaken.

                                 MORGAN
                        Would you mind if I spoke with him?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Do you need my permission to speak 
                        with him?

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I wouldn’t mind at all.

                                 MORGAN
                        Fantastic.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’ll even put you in touch. This is 
                        important and I want to be helpful.

           A long beat as the two size each other up...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        So we’ll save the tempeh for next 
                        time then.

                                                                 CUT TO

           ALEX’S VENICE BUNGALOW

           where he’s SKETCHING... his happy-place... working on a

           BUSTY FEMALE SUPERVILLAIN

           with her mighty war hammer raised above a defeated 
           SUPERHERO... about to strike the killer blow and we notice 

           her hair, her face are... FAMILIAR... and
           on the wall behind him are sketches of the same anatomically 
           gifted VILLAIN in various states of undress and a

           SHAPE BLURS

           by the window... Alex looks up... goes to the view... 

           A HOMELESS MAN ambles along the alley... a DRUNK KID stumbles 
           back from the boardwalk... nothing abnormal and...

           BANG BANG BANG

           His heart jumps at the knock... he goes to the peephole...

           Shit... he paces and

           BANG BANG BANG

           the knock comes again... he hurriedly closes a portfolio 
           cover over the sketch... steels himself and opens the door...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Hello.

                                 ALEX
                        Hi.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Can I come in?

           He hesitates... invites her in...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        I think there may be something 
                        wrong with your voicemail service.

                                 ALEX
                        I didn’t call you back because I 
                        didn’t want to talk.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I understand you’re angry but-- 
                        What are these?

           She’s noticed the SUPERVILLIAN SKETCHES pinned to the wall 
           and we now see how clearly they resemble her...

           Alex steps in front of them...

                                 ALEX
                        I’m busy. Why are you here?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        To apologize.
                                 ALEX
                        Fine. I forgive you. That it?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        And to ask that you take down your 
                        negative review of me. 

                                 ALEX
                        Of course you want something.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        A journalist will contact you, and 
                        I need you to retract your review. 
                        And to not mention Peter Glenn.

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALEX
                        If that review keeps just one 
                        person from being abused by you, 
                        it’s worth it.

           Jacqueline stares at him...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’ll be right back.

           She exits... beat and...

           He starts snatching his sketches off the wall... sliding them 
           into his portfolio...

           Jacqueline walks back in with

           OLIVIA

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Tell him what we talked about, 
                        Olivia.

                                 ALEX
                             (to Jacqueline)
                        Was she just sitting in the car?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Jacqueline says everyone makes 
                        mistakes and we should forgive 
                        people.
                                 ALEX
                        Oh. Well, see it’s complicated, 
                        because sometimes grown-ups--

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (to Olivia)
                        Keep going.

                                 OLIVIA
                        And that if things go good with her 
                        new gym she won’t be stressed and 
                        will be with me more and be more, 
                        umm...
                             (struggling over wording)
                        ....‘present’ for me. And she says 
                        it’s important to be present for 
                        kids or they’ll grow up and just 
                        sit around all day and cry like 
                        lazy little bi--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Thank you Olivia, that’s good.

           Long beat as Alex studies them... Olivia staring up at 
           Jacqueline in adoration... his heart hurting... finally...

                                 ALEX
                        I’ll take down the review.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        And the journalist?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t want to be the cause of 
                        anything bad.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        So you’ll explain you were 
                        frustrated with yourself and you 
                        weren’t being fair, yes?

                                 ALEX
                        Just promise me you’ll go easier on 
                        people, okay?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I promise. Let’s go, Olivia.

           Alex watches them leave... out the window he sees Jacqueline 
           leading her into the car... Olivia fussing... Jacqueline 
           frustrated, scolding... trying to get her in the car and

                                                                 CUT TO
           THE REEBOK GYM

           really coming together as PAINTERS finish the last coat... 
           primary construction over... EQUIPMENT being moved in...

           JACQUELINE signs PAPERWORK... Karen’s ASSISTANT gathering

                        Karen wanted to know how the 
                        interview went?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        We’ll see.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        She says national press is 
                        critical.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m aware.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        And that for the brand to scale--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Is that all?

           He’s small... exits... A WORKER butts in...

                                 WORKER
                        Ms. Jacqueline? There’s a man 
                        outside for you.

                                                                 CUT TO

           THE SIDEWALK

           where Jacqueline emerges to find ALEX...

                                 ALEX
                        I tried to peek in but it’s all 
                        taped up. Maybe a VIP tour for a 
                        old time’s sake?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I can connect you with sales once 
                        we open.

                                 ALEX
                        Ha. Right. Well. I just wanted to 
                        tell you that Morgan from Conde 
                        Nast called. I told her she was 
                        barking up the wrong tree.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Thank you.

           She heads for the door...

                                 ALEX
                        Wait. There’s something else...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I can’t offer you a discount.

                                 ALEX
                        No it’s not that. I take it 
                        Olivia’s guardian is still sick?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Actually, she’s relocated.

                                 ALEX
                        What? To where?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Portugal.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh. Okay, anyway, I noticed the 
                        other day that you seemed a little, 
                        umm... overwhelmed... with Olivia. 
                        I know you’re super busy now so I 
                        figured... maybe I could help? Give 
                        you some pointers. With her I mean. 
                        To keep things manageable.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        We are not compatible romantically.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not--  That stuff I told you 
                        about my parents, it’s important to 
                        me. Olivia is a great kid and I 
                        just want to help.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I need to focus on the opening.

                                 ALEX
                        Exactly! Think about it this way: 
                        the more I can help with her, the 
                        more time you’ll have for this. 
                        You’ll be more... efficient.

           A WORKER pokes his head out...
                                 WORKER
                        The vendor say you need to pick a 
                        tile or he leaves.

           Alex cocks his head, see?...  OFF JACQUELINE, considering his 
           offer and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PACIFIC HIGHWAY FOOT BRIDGE

           where Jacqueline, Olivia, and Alex stretch

           40 FEET

           above the busy highway... cars RACING by below... 

                                 ALEX
                        I was thinking more like the mall.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes!

                                 JACQUELINE
                        The mall won’t boost your low 
                        social engagement, will it?

           Olivia pouts... walks to the far end... Alex smiles...

                                 ALEX
                        The kids I teach usually spend half 
                        the time sniffing the markers... 
                        What they want and what we want 
                        them to do, it’s a balance, right?

           He hoists one leg up the railing to stretch... cars BLURRING 
           by below... Jacqueline looks at him....

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Balance is important.

                                 ALEX
                        Deep down they want boundaries, but 
                        she’s going to test you.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m looking forward to more of your 
                        thoughts on this.

           She steps toward him... Alex’s eyes still on the speedway...
                                 ALEX
                        It’s not like I’m an expert or 
                        anything... I mean there’s no one 
                        right way...

           Another step toward him... arms-distance away...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What I’m trying to say is...

           She clocks his weight... the bounce on his toes... as a 

           SEMI

           speeds below in a giant blue of metal and...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be great.

           She stops herself... looks at him curiously... trying to 
           process the genuine compliment and

                                                                 CUT TO

           VENICE BOARDWALK

           as the three of them cool down from the jog... walking past 
           tattooed faces... mangy beards... and all look away when

           JACQUELINE

           makes eye contact... like they recognize a meaner dog and... 
           they pass an

           ICE CREAM STAND

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m starving.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        We’ve talked about saturated fats.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t care. I want a Chipwich.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Don’t do this now.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Why can’t I have a chipwich?! 
                        You’re being a total bitch--

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Olivia?
           Alex slides in between them...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        How about instead of ice cream, we 
                        do something really awesome?

           She quiets as he points up the coast to... to the

           SANTA MONICA FERRIS WHEEL

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t think I like heights.

                                 ALEX
                        Can I tell you a secret? I’m scared 
                        of heights too. But if Jacqueline 
                        says it’s okay, maybe we can face 
                        our fears together? You know... we 
                        can push ourselves.

           He winks at Jacqueline... and she’s standing

           TOTALLY STILL

           with some strange new look on her face... almost like... 
           FONDNESS... but then her phone

           BUZZES

                                 JACQUELINE
                             (picking up)
                        Hello.
                             (beat)
                        Yes, I can.
                             (beat)
                        Perfect. I’ll be there.

           She grabs Olivia by the hand...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Time to go.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Alex just said we could go on 
                        ferris wheel.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes but now I’ve been called into a 
                        meeting, so we need to adapt.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You suck.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        That’s not accurate.

                                 ALEX
                        You know, you could go to your 
                        meeting and leave us to hang until 
                        you’re done?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Why would you do that?

                                 ALEX
                        It’d be fun. We could get dinner-- 
                        healthy dinner!-- and then hit the 
                        ferris wheel. I really don’t mind.

           OFF JACQUELINE... again looking at him like she’s unused to 
           kindness and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE

           watching Alex and Olivia from afar as she gets into her 
           car... they’re playing, adorable... Jacqueline scans

           THE BOARDWALK

           her eyes lingering on two

           TEENAGE SWEETHEARTS

           making out on a bench... gross and beautiful young love... 
           then she spots a

           MIDDLE AGED COUPLE

           laughing as an ARTIST sketches their son... happy family and

           JACQUELINE

           looks like she’s starting to OVERLOAD... wires crossed... 
           hand moving instinctively to pull at her

           STOMACH

           to pinch at her “fat”... but then she

           STOPS HERSELF

           and climbs into the car... and

                                                                 CUT TO
           THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS

           where Jacqueline pulls up to a GATE... notes the security 
           cameras as it begins to OPEN and

                                                                 CUT TO

           KAREN’S HOUSE

           Jacqueline enters through the open front door... the place 
           smells like lavender and money... sexy lines... bougie music 
           floating in surround sound... 

           She runs her hand along marble edges... high thread-counts... 
           spots Karen through glass doors and joins her out on...

           THE TERRACE

           where Karen is lording over an A-List view... sounds of the 
           lesser beings below barely audible up here...

           Karen notes Jacqueline’s manila folder, begins to pour two 
           glasses of wine...

                                 KAREN
                        Leave the paperwork on the daybed-- 
                        no, not the modular chaise, the 
                        daybed. Thank you. How was the 
                        interview?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It went fine.

                                 KAREN
                        When’s the publish date? We’ll want 
                        to see a draft beforehand of 
                        course. This an Edmond Vatan 
                        Sancerre by the way, so savor it. 
                        To a big opening.

           They cheers... beat as Jacqueline steadies...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I killed the article.

                                 KAREN
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I didn’t like the editorial 
                        direction.
                                 KAREN
                        I see. Anything in particular that 
                        made you uncomfortable?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I thought it would run contrary to 
                        my brand. Our brand.

                                 KAREN
                        I’ll speak with communications, 
                        they’ll line up another outlet.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’ve been thinking we might try a 
                        quieter, soft opening.

                                 KAREN
                        Why would you want that?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It allows time to test and tweak 
                        our concept. To figure things out.

           Karen studies her over the rim of her glass...

                                 KAREN
                        “Soft” openings and “quiet” product 
                        launches... those days are over. 
                        There is no quiet anymore. Every 
                        brand, every person, every post and 
                        repost and comment makes a sound. 
                        And if you can’t talk above the 
                        noise, you won’t have a voice. 
                        Without press we will wither and 
                        die. I put my faith in you because 
                        I thought you understood that.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I do.

                                 KAREN
                        You did, but something’s different.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        No, I am fully engaged.

                                 KAREN
                        Pre-opening jitters? No, you’re not 
                        the type.  And I know it’s not a 
                        better offer.

           She looks deeper into Jacqueline... seeing...
                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not-- You’re not letting 
                        something personal threaten this, 
                        are you? Oh Jesus, tell me it’s not 
                        a man. Jacqueline? No. A MAN?!

           Her shout echoes down the valley... Karen calms herself... 
           smooths a crease in her pant...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I want to show you something.

                                                                 CUT TO
           DARKNESS

           and then

           LIGHTS SLAM ON

           in sequence... illuminating

           RACK AFTER RACK

           in Karen’s

           WINE ROOM

                        I started collecting around the 
                        time I made VP. I’ve got nearly a 
                        thousand bottles now. 

           She leads Jacqueline down an aisle... pulls a bottle...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        This is a twelve-hundred dollar 
                        Reisling I won at auction in 
                        Rheingau.

           She pulls another...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        A 1962 Bordeaux -- that’s a right 
                        bank Bordeaux -- for two thousand. 
                        And this...

           She moves to a PRIZE BOTTLE set off from the others...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        This is a 2007 Chateau Haute-Brion

                        The region’s grape seeds were sowed 
                        two-thousand years ago by Bituriges 
                        Vivisci tribesmen, the vineyard’s 
                        bottles were first imported to this 
                        country in 1787 by Thomas 
                        Jefferson. This wine was coveted by 
                        powerful men... priced by powerful 
                        men... And now it’s mine. 

           She cradles it with reverence...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to know what it is to 
                        be a successful woman in this 
                        country? Do you want to see what 
                        empowerment really looks like?

           Beat... and she

           SMASHES

           it against the wall... thousand dollar streaks bleeding down 
           to the floor...

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Taking what you want, tossing what 
                        you want, destroying what you want. 
                        Never reliant on anyone or 
                        anything. That’s empowerment. And 
                        you’re so close! But if you’d 
                        rather choose to be, what, a 
                        girlfriend? A housewife? To pump 
                        out babies... give away your 
                        power... well then you’re erasing 
                        yourself. In which case you might 
                        as well speed up the process.

           She bends to the smashed bottle and picks up a jagged

           SHARD

           which she places in Jacqueline’s hand... guiding it gently to 
           Jacqueline’s naked wrist and

           she leaves... Jacqueline alone... staring down at her

           VEINS PULSING

                                                                 CUT TO

           THE SANTA MONICA PIER

           crawling with TOURISTS... SINGERS pushing self-cut CDs... 
           rides and games and towering above them all is the
           FERRIS WHEEL

           where Alex and Olivia are half-way up their slow ascent... 
           gazing out at the night view...

                                 ALEX
                        Up that way is Malibu, and back 
                        there is Venice, where I live.

                                 OLIVIA
                        How far is Mexico?

                                 ALEX
                        Umm, about four hours that way. 
                        Why?

                                 OLIVIA
                        That’s where Laurie moved. Tulum, 
                        Mexico.

                                 ALEX
                             (beat)
                        I thought Portugal?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Jacqueline says Laurie doesn’t have 
                        self-control, and you need self-
                        control to raise a kid like me. 
                        There she is.

           DOWN BELOW... JACQUELINE has returned... waiting for them... 
           Alex looks at OLIVIA... concerned... as the wheel begins to 
           lower them...

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Olivia? We only have a couple 
                        of minutes until we’re down, and I 
                        wanted to ask you something.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Cool.

                                 ALEX
                        Besides heights... is there 
                        anything else you’re afraid of?

           She looks off...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Don’t want to tell me? Well I 
                        brought you something. Maybe this 
                        will help.
           He unfolds a piece of PAPER... it’s CARTOON OLIVIA, posed as 
           a strong SUPERHERO GIRL...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        It’s you! Obviously. Because you’re 
                        brave, right? Like, even if it’s 
                        scary to tell me something, you can 
                        do it, because that’s what brave, 
                        cool people do. And then we can get 
                        help. But you need to tell me, so 
                        that we can tell people that can 
                        help. Do you understand?

           Olivia says nothing... they’re halfway down now... 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Olivia, please. I don’t know when 
                        we’re going to get another chance 
                        to talk just the two of us.

           She fidgets... they’re nearly down, closer and closer...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                             (no time)
                        Olivia: are you scared of her? Has 
                        she hurt you? 

           Finally she looks at him... about to answer but

           THE CAR LURCHES

           and stops... they’re back on the ground... Jacqueline greets 
           them and

                                                                 CUT TO

           PIER PARKING LOT

           Olivia runs up ahead as Jacqueline and Alex walk towards 
           their cars... pregnant silence... finally...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I need to ask you 
                        about.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        You’re concerned about Olivia.

                                 ALEX
                        How did you--?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I understand completely.
                                 ALEX
                        You do? Oh, I mean, good. I’m 
                        worried that--

                                 OLIVIA
                             (running up)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Adult things.

                                 ALEX
                        Can we talk privately? Tomorrow?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Okay. Stop by the gym.

                                 ALEX
                        Sure.

           She moves toward the car door and stops...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I don’t blame you for your concern. 
                        My priorities have been confused. 
                        But I’m starting to reevaluate what 
                        matters, and I have you to thank 
                        you for that.

           A beat as she looks at him... almost romantic... almost

           GENUINE

           and then she gets in the car and they drive away... Alex 
           watching them go and

                                                                 CUT TO

           JACQUELINE’S APARTMENT

           Dark hours of the morning and who know’s how long she’s been 
           staring at her

           VISION WALL

           and its independent lionesses of global sport and commerce...

           as she ponders... her face unreadable...

           finally she goes it... tentative... reaches for a photo of a 
           pants-suit superstar and

           TEARS
           the photo down...

           A beat to make sure she’s still breathing... and then she

           takes down another photo... then another... and another...

           something like a smile... like CONTENTMENT... spreading on 
           her face as the wall comes down and

                                                                 CUT TO

           NIGHT

           at the

           REEBOK GYM

           as Alex parks... rehearsing in the rearview mirror...

                                 ALEX
                        ...an unsafe environment-- no, 
                        unhealthy environment-- for Olivia, 
                        and this isn’t personal but...

           He stops as his gaze drifts... noticing the gym is

           EMPTY

           and the lights off... totally quiet... 

           He exits and crosses the street... seeing as he approaches 
           that the front door is SLIT OPEN... with a

           NOTE

           taped to it...

           he reaches for it... unfolding it and seeing

           CARTOON OLIVIA

           Beat as he stares at it... panic starting to fire through his 
           body and... mind racing through the implications and a 

           GIRL SCREAMS

           seizing up his chest... he peers inside... then gets smart 
           and takes out his phone to dial 911... but...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           the phone is blinking
           “BATTERY 0%” 

           He smacks himself with it, stupid stupid stupid... peers back 
           in... total darkness... thinks about it... long beat and...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        No.

           He marches back to his car and

                                                                 CUT TO

           INSIDE HIS PARKED CAR

           as Alex looks down at the CARTOON...

           he rips it into pieces... sprinkles them out the window... 
           No... No... No fucking way and

           he starts the ignition... puts the car in drive...

           But...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                             (small)
                        Fuck.

           he can’t do it... can’t leave...

           as he shifts back to park... turns the engine off and

                                                                 CUT TO

           THE GYM

           as Alex steps inside and sees it’s

           PITCH BLACK

           so he props the door, dim outside light half illuminating the

           CAVERNOUS FITNESS CENTER

           Big, beautiful, nearly finished, full of equipment and he

           PUSHES

           slowly forward... past aisles of TREADMILLS... 
           STAIRCLIMBERS... fighting himself with every step....

           into a WEIGHT area, tip toeing forward and

           MOVEMENT
           from the corner of his eye and HE SPINS

           but’s just his reflection in the weight room’s mirrors... he 
           exhales and

           ANOTHER SCREAM

           SPINS HIM back around... looks up to the second floor...

           feels his heart... beating out of his fucking chest and... he 
           grabs a 12LB DUMBBELL... tests the weight... then heads for 
           stairs but

           RED LIGHTS SLAM ON

           startling him as the gym materializes around him in

           MILIARY CRIMSON

           bootcamp-style, and a thumping

           BEAT

           blasts in through speakers... throbbingly loud... and

           Alex grips the dumbbell with white knuckles, begins to walk 
           up the stairs as the music

           PULSES

           so loud he can’t hear his own footsteps as... he moves to the

           LANDING

           and stops... can’t do this... can’t go further... and

                                 JACQUELINE (O.S.)
                        Push through it, Alex.

           HE SPINS

           but she’s not behind him... she’s not in front of him...

                                 JACQUELINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s gut-check time.

           as he realizes she’s

           EVERYWHERE

           voice piping in through SPEAKERS strung around the gym and

                                                                 CUT TO
           JACQUELINE’S LIPS

           in SUPER CLOSE-UP as she adjusts her wireless MIC... too 
           close to see where she is except that it’s a 

           DARK ROOM

           with a BANK OF VIDEO SCREENS fed by the gym’s SECURITY 
           CAMERAS... and

           JACQUELINE

           studies pixilated Alex gripping the rail, paralyzed...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                             (into the mic)
                        One foot in front of the other. Dig 
                        in, you can do it. She needs you.

                                                                 CUT TO

           GYM FLOOR

           where Alex is holding back tears, trying to will himself up 
           the stairs...

                                 JACQUELINE (SPEAKERS) (CONT’D)
                        It’s time to be a man, Alex. 

           The TEARS begin to stream down his face, but still he 
           clutches the railing, stuck...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        You are a good person. You don’t 
                        want her to feel any more pain.

           He begins to nod... psyching himself up, and he

           LETS GO

           of the railing and takes a first step up the stairs... then 
           another... and another and in

           THE DARK ROOM

           Jacqueline is beaming... watching as he plods upwards... 
           motivated....

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Yes! That’s it! Just a few more 
                        steps and you’re up! Three, two, 
                        one!
           She reaches for the mic’s ON/OFF BUTTON and

                                                                 CUT TO

           THE SECOND FLOOR

           where Alex hears the KSHHH of the audio feed cutting out and 
           then... silence again... 

           He stands at the top of the stairway, taking in the

           PERSONAL TRAINING FLOOR

           Diabolical instruments of fitness not for the faint of heart:

           - BATTLE ROPES, KETTLE BELLS with menacing gargoyle heads...

           - SLEDGE HAMMERS leaning against giant TIRES...

           - A cruel, Bane-looking TRAINING MASK made for oxygen-
           deprivation...

           He lingers on the mask... creeped...

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        Alex? Hello? Can you hear me?

           It’s muffled... far away... coming from behind an UNFINISHED 
           DOOR marked with the gym’s final

           “CONSTRUCTION AREA”

           and softly... Alex puts down the barbell and picks up a

           SLEDGE HAMMER

           before pushing quietly through the door... into an

           UNFINISHED HALLWAY

           where he stops dead... nearly dropping the hammer... gaze 
           fixed upward at a

           NIGHTMARISH CANOPY OF JACQUELINE’S VISION BOARD

           covered in

           THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS AND CUT-OUTS 

           crawling up the walls and creeping over the curved hallway 
           ceiling...

           A monstrous hodgepodge stretching all the way down the 
           corridor... lit eerily by a string of CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS...
                                 OLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Alex?

           She’s calling from behind a door at the end of the hallway...

           He holds the sledgehammer tight, pushing down the hall, 
           eyeing the COLLAGE as he goes...

           At first the MONEY, the ARCHITECTURE, the BUSINESSWOMEN, the 
           FREAK FITNESS BODIES...

           He moves further and these are increasingly interspersed with 
           PORNOGRAPHY, ROUGH SEX... the wall becoming FLESHIER...

           Further still and he grimaces at images of VIOLENCE, PAIN, 
           MEDIEVAL TORTURE...

           Historical sketches of BODIES ON THE RACK, sitting in agony 
           on the pointed JUDAS CRADLE...

           Next to modern day FITNESS IMPLEMENTS of pain, EXERCISERS 
           roaring as they BENCH PRESS, wailing through workouts...

           A patchwork of AGONY, SUCCESS, PAIN, GAIN, MUSCLE and SINEW 
           stretched to the breaking point and

           Alex reaches the door...

           readying himself and... he KICKS it open into the

           LOCKER ROOM

           full of HOLES and IRON BEAMS... still under construction... 
           MIRRORS, SAWHORSES and TOOLS strewn everywhere...

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           He moves toward her voice... turns the corner around a bank 
           of LOCKERS and sees Olivia is

           BOUND TO A CHAIR

           by extension chords in the middle of the

           SHOWER ROOM

           and they lock eyes... she’s terrified...

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        She said this was the best place to 
                        make a mess.
           Alex looks around and sees... faucet heads... TUBS OF 
           BLEACH... holy shit...

           Olivia’s EYES GO WIDE and he FREEZES as...

           JACQUELINE steps out of the shadows with the SIG pointed at 
           his face...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Put this over your head.

           She slides a swath of plastic construction SHEETING towards 
           him...

                                 ALEX
                        Please. Just relax. It’s me.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Shut up.

                                 ALEX
                        Whatever happened to you, whatever 
                        made you like this, we can--

                                 JACQUELINE
                        “Made me like this?”

           She darts towards him and 

           JAMS

           the gun against his EYE... he shuts it tightly... praying...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        Who has the power here?

                                 ALEX
                        Oh god. You do. You have the power.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        But you’re still talking about what 
                        someone “made” me? Did you ever 
                        consider that nobody “made” me? 
                        That I have agency? That I do what 
                        I like, not what men tell me? Now 
                        put this over your fucking head.

           She shoves the plastic sheet into his chest...

                                 ALEX
                        No, no, sorry, I didn’t mean it 
                        like that, I just meant... 
           He looks at Olivia... at Jacqueline... mind spinning... 
           desperate... and then...

           AN IDEA

           and he turns back to Jacqueline... breathes deep...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I just meant... I like you.

           She stops dead... like she’s been shot...

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        And not “Jacqueline the brand”. 
                        You, just how you are. You like me 
                        too, I saw it at the beach. And I 
                        know that scares you, but I also 
                        know your warmth, your... 
                        humanity... that’s more powerful 
                        than any “brand”, isn’t it?

           A beat as this settles... Jacqueline almost frozen... 
           stepping back... the gun lowering to her side... and... he 
           sees his chance and

           LUNGES

           wrestling for the gun... both of them

           LURCHING

           right past Olivia who sticks her foot out to trip and they go

           CRASHING

           into the tile, concussion-hard and

           THE GUN

           clatters down into a pit of exposed piping... Alex dazed... 
           seeing stars... finally lifts his head up and

           JACQUELINE’S VANISHED

           without a trace... he races to Olivia... as he unties her...

                                 OLIVIA
                        She went back the way you came in. 

                                 ALEX
                        Do you have a phone?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s in her office.
                                 ALEX
                        Okay, I want you to leave through 
                        the back. Tell the first adult you 
                        see to call 911.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where are you going?

                                 ALEX
                        To make sure she can’t follow you.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Wait!

           He pauses... like she’s going to reveal something huge...

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Did you mean it? When you said you 
                        liked her?

           He looks at her... still innocent in the face of this...

                                 ALEX
                        No.  Now go.

           She heads for the back exit... as he moves back into the

           HALLWAY

           and edges slowly toward the personal training area but

           THE LIGHTS SLAM OFF

           and he stops... just a thin sliver of dawn sunlight poking 
           under the door...

           He opens it slowly and steps into the

           PERSONAL TRAINING AREA

           Moves forward, scanning, passing a wall rack, noticing...

           Is something different?

           An EMPTY HOOK where the mask hung... strange, as he presses 
           forward and...

           JACQUELINE CHARGES

           grunting like a beast through the evil

           TRAINING MASK

           strapped to her face and she lifts the
           SLEDGEHAMMER

           high and Alex

           LEAPS

           out of the way just as the hammer

           SHATTERS

           a mirror into a million pieces... and screams with rage, 
           crazed as Alex

           SCRAMBLES

           on his hands and knees, frantically crab-walking backwards... 
           kicking MEDICINE BALLS and EQUIPMENT into her path but

           she’s too agile, dodging and jumping... standing over him and 
           she raises the hammer again and it

           SLAMS

           down in between his legs... he’s scooted back just barely 
           enough and the impact

           SHOCKWAVES

           up her hands... making her drop the hammer as he

           KICKS 

           at her knees... scrambling backward but she rises, 
           relentless, as he CRAWLS for the staircase and...

           She POUNCES on his back...

           WRAPPING a battlerope around his neck, once, twice, three 
           times...

           Pulling back, choking him... 

           SQUEEZING

           tighter... face wild... feral... Alex turning white, blood-
           flow slowing to his brain...

           his hand searches the floor... desperate... finding

           A GLASS SHARD

           which he grabs and

           STABS
           into her GUT...

           she staggers back... Alex coughing, dizzy, tries to peel 
           himself up as

           she looks down in disbelief at the ragged GASH in her 
           stomach...

           Turns to a mirror, prodding at the ugly fissure where her 
           perfect abs were...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        They’ll never look the same.

           She turns to Alex...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        THEY’LL NEVER LOOK THE SAME!

           SHE TACKLES HIM

           onto a

           WEIGHT BENCH

           and grabs the BAR above him...

           PRESSING

           it down into his neck...

           Salivating as she stands over him, screaming... Alex fighting 
           the bar, STRUGGLING against the pressure on his neck...

           A BENCH PRESS for his life but

           gravity’s on her side, body weight pushing the bar down... 
           Alex GURGLING, struggling as his throat begins to INDENT...

           Jacqueline raises the barbell, just inches, a reprieve... a 
           window as he

           GASPS

           for air... and then she

           SLAMS

           it back down with all her weight and

           IMPLODES

           his windpipe with a final sickening
           CRUNCH...

           She rises, watching as he clutches at his throat... dying... 

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        I weigh a hundred and fifteen 
                        pounds, and you couldn’t even get 
                        one rep.

           Pathetic...

           She turns back to the mirror and pulls at her stomach, 
           assessing the damage as he writhes in the background...

                                 PHONE OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what is your emergency?

           Jacqueline SPINS... OLIVIA is holding up her

           SEQUINED IPHONE

           with 911 on speaker...  Jacqueline slowly removes her mask...

                                 PHONE OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Can you hear me? Are you in 
                        danger? Please be advised that we 
                        are requesting your location from

                                 JACQUELINE
                        What are you doing.

           She takes a step toward Olivia but... Olivia raises her other

                        Welcome back. Robyn, this next 
                        story is difficult to hear.

                                 ROBYN
                        But so important. Danger, fear, and 
                        ultimately, the triumph of the 
                        human spirit. Today’s own Lisa 
                        D’Cruz has the exclusive. Lisa?

                                                                 CUT TO

                                 LISA
                        Thank you, George.

                        If you live in Los Angeles you may 
                        have already caught wind of the 
                        harrowing tale about a rising 
                        fitness star and a vicious, crazed 
                        fan. But today she’s ready to share 
                        her remarkable story with the whole 
                        country on her first national 
                        interview. Jacqueline, thank you 
                        for joining us.

           JACQUELINE in the guest seat... calm and measured once 
           again...

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Thank you, Lisa.

                                 LISA
                        A month ago you’re on the verge of 
                        opening a new gym, about to become 
                        the face of a major fitness brand, 
                        and just weeks before the grand 
                        opening... you’re attacked. Take us 
                        back there.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s difficult for me...

                                 LISA
                        I’m sure. Maybe you can try to--
                                 JACQUELINE
                        Our new state of the art facility 
                        was set to open and a client I’d 
                        trained briefly requested a tour.

                                 LISA
                        But he wasn’t just any client, was 
                        he?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Later the police would tell me that 
                        his apartment was littered with... 
                        drawings... of me. Fantasies.

                                 LISA
                        So you invite him, and?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        He attacks me.

                                 LISA
                        And there’s no one to help. No 
                        alarms. No security cameras.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        We learned later that he disabled 
                        the cameras before entering.

                                 LISA
                        In that moment, what went through 
                        your mind?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        All the things any normal person 
                        would feel. Doubt. Fear. Panic.

                                 LISA
                        But you did something many ‘normal’ 
                        people wouldn’t, didn’t you? You 
                        decided to fight. And somehow you 
                        were able to overpower him.

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I believe that you should never be 
                        powerless. So strength is a 
                        priority for myself and my clients. 
                        Fitness literally saved my life.

                                 LISA
                        And not just your life, right?

           Lisa cues a PRODUCER... who pushes OLIVIA on stage...
                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        Olivia, who I’m told you’ve 
                        officially adopted--?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        The papers went through last week.

                                 LISA
                        --she was right there, witnessing 
                        the entire fight. Thank you for 
                        joining us, Olivia.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You’re welcome, Lisa. I think this 
                        is an important story to share.

           Olivia is poised, self-assured... Lisa smiles...

                                 LISA
                        Well aren’t you a confident young 
                        lady? You must get that from 
                        Jacqueline, huh?

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’s a model for women everywhere. 

                                 LISA
                        What does it mean to hear her say 
                        that, Jacqueline?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        I’m so proud that she understands 
                        how important it is to find what’s 
                        special about you -- even the 
                        things that you might be scared for 
                        others to know -- and to have the 
                        strength to embrace those things 
                        and show them to the world. That’s 
                        what finding yourself, your own 
                        personal brand, is all about.

           Jacqueline and Olivia reach for each others hands... a 
           genuine connection...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        I want Olivia, and other young 
                        people who look up to me to realize 
                        that my story is about adversity. 
                        And that for me -- for all of you -- 
                        your adversity is your advantage.

                                 LISA
                        “Your adversity is your advantage.” 
                        That’s become a mantra for you.
                                 JACQUELINE
                        It’s scrawled all across my gym. 
                        Which opens today at 7660 Wilshire.

                                 LISA
                        And I’m told it’s also the name of 
                        your new fitness video? 

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Cross-platform interactive wellness 
                        experience.

           A PRODUCER signals Lisa it’s time to wrap up...

                                 LISA
                        Before we go: tell us, what’s next 
                        for Jacqueline Heath?

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Spreading self-improvement.

                                 LISA
                        Oh come on! Give us the details. 
                        Podcast? Clothing line? Reality 
                        show?!

                                 JACQUELINE
                        Yes. I want to help shape people at 
                        every stage of their lives. On 
                        social and mobile and on TV.

           The show’s jaunty outro music cuts to SILENCE as Jacqueline 
           finds camera one...

                                 JACQUELINE (CONT’D)
                        I want to be in their homes.
                        I want to teach their children.
