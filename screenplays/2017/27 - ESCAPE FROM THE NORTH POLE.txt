           A haunting Christmas song we barely recognize as "Santa Claus 
           is Coming to Town" begins to play as we...

                                                                 FADE IN:

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

           A seven-year-old boy, TIMOTHY, is standing in front of a 
           broken window with a baseball bat hidden behind his back.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Timothy, tell me the truth, did you 
                        break the window?

                                 TIMOTHY
                        No, Mom. It wasn't me. I swear.

           INT. DARK ROOM

           In a dark room, a MYSTERIOUS FIGURE is seated at a wooden 
           writing desk.

           Over his shoulder, we glimpse the strange assortment of items 
           arranged in front of him: an old snow globe, a day-by-day 
           calendar, a collection of black quills, and an impossibly 
           ancient roll of parchment.

           The figure stretches a gloved hand across the desk, selects 
           one of the quills, and dips it into an inkwell.

           The black feather drips black ink and begins to write upon 
           the paper. Looping curves form into letters as the quill 
           dances across the page and those letters spell out a name: 
           "Timothy."

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY 

           SUSAN (7) is sitting at the dinner table with her arms 
           crossed before a plate of steaming broccoli.

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Susan, finish your vegetables.

           SUSAN picks up the plate and stealthily scoops it under the 
           table, into the family dog's mouth.

           INT. DARK ROOM

           The quill darts across the page and again a new name is added 
           to the list: "Susan."
           We watch as this process happens again and again, cutting 
           back and forth from the lives of children all around the 
           world to the dark room where those children's naughty 
           behavior is being recorded.

           A BRITISH GIRL scribbles on the wall with crayons.

           An INDIAN BOY slips candy in his pockets at the market.

           A MEXICAN BOY tracks mud all over the carpet.

           A SOUTH AFRICAN GIRL chases the family cat with a stick.

           A JAPANESE BOY copies answers off another student's test.

           A FRENCH GIRL stares at her phone while leaves go un-raked in 
           the yard around her.

           A GERMAN GIRL pushes a smaller kid into a pile of snow.

           The gloved hand adds name after name after name to the list.

           As the hand writes, the calendar grows closer and closer to 
           Christmas, until finally, the date reads December 24.

           The gloved hand sets the quill back into the inkwell, rolls 
           the paper up into a scroll, and disappears with the list.

           We drift up away from the desk, over to the snow globe, and 
           slowly zoom in on a swirling backdrop of snow...

           EXT. NEW ENGLAND NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           The final notes of the macabre Christmas song become the 
           opening notes of the Fred Astaire classic as the image in the 
           snow globe resolves itself into an idyllic New England 
           neighborhood on the night of Christmas Eve.

           An old family minivan makes its way through the snowy streets 
           and we slowly push toward the middle window, where bright-
           eyed thirteen-year-old SOPHIA is gazing out at the passing 
           landscape.

           Her face alight with the Christmas spirit, Sophia watches 
           sparkling decorations and newly built snowmen go by.

           The muffled sounds of an argument call her back to reality. 
           Sophia tears her gaze away from the outside world, and as she 
           turns her attention back to the car...
           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT

           We push inside the van where Fred Astaire's dulcet tones are 
           drowned out by yelling, crying, and bickering.

           RICHARD, a reedy, nervous man in his late 40s, is squinting 
           at the barely visible road through a thick pair of glasses.

                                 RICHARD
                        Honey, I need directions!

           In the passenger seat, COLLEEN, an overworked woman in her 
           early 40s, is trying to check her phone while simultaneously 
           managing the chaos in the seats behind her.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I can't see anything through the 
                        snow, Richard, and I'm not getting 
                        a signal, can you just--

           Colleen is cut off by the wailing of SARAH, a very unhappy 
           toddler in the middle seat.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Shhh, it's okay, calm down sweetie!

                                 RICHARD
                        Colleen, directions!

                                 COLLEEN
                        Still not getting a signal! Matt, 
                        Caitlin, can one of you please help 
                        your father?

           In the backseat, MATT (18) is jamming out on his headphones 
           to seasonally inappropriate EDM beats everyone else in the 
           car wishes only he could hear.

                                 MATT
                             (lifting his headphones)
                        Can we what?

           CAITLIN (16) doesn't even glance up from the young adult book 
           she's reading.

                                 CAITLIN
                        She wants us to help find Grandma's 
                        house, I guess by going back in 
                        time and persuading her not to 
                        become the only old person in 
                        America to move away from Florida.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Caitlin!
                                 MATT
                        Oh man, here comes the drop.

           He slips his headphones back on and resumes jamming out.

                                 RICHARD
                        Honey! The directions?

                                 COLLEEN
                        I know!

           Through the window, Sophia spots Grandma's House coming up on 
           the right.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Uh, Dad?

                                 RICHARD
                        Sophia, not now please!

           TOMMY, a bratty 6-year-old on the opposite side of the baby 
           seat from Sophia, starts kicking his dad's chair.

                                 TOMMY
                        I'm bored! You said we would be 
                        there already!

                                 RICHARD
                        Tommy, I'm about three seconds from 
                        crashing into a mailbox. Please 
                        don't kick my chair.

                                 TOMMY
                        But I'm bored!

           Meanwhile, the house is coming up fast.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Dad!

                           MATT
                 (drumming on the seat to 
                  the beat)
                                                           TOMMY
                                                  (kicking on every word)
                                               Bored! Bored! Bored! Bored!
           Bam-ba-ba-bam! Bam-ba-ba-bam!

                          COLLEEN
                                                          CAITLIN
                                               Oh my god, what is going on?
           Sarah, you've gotta calm 
           down, sweetie!

                                 RICHARD
                        Will someone please give me 
                        directions?!
                                 SOPHIA
                        Dad, it's right there!!

           EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The van pulls a hard right and screeches into the driveway of 
           the most perfect house on the block: an old red-brick two-
           story with glowing windows, a snow-blanketed roof, and a big 
           Christmas wreath on the door.

           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT

                                 RICHARD
                        Geez, Sophia. Speak up next time.

           The car locks pop open, and as soon as they do, Tommy crawls 
           over Sophia's lap and jumps out the car.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Ugh, Tommy!

           She unbuckles her seatbelt but before she can leave, Caitlin 
           pushes her seat forward, squashing Sophia into the front.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Caitlin pushes past her and hops out the back. 

                                 CAITLIN
                        Snooze ya lose, sucker.

           Sophia tries to get out again, but the seat is shoved forward 
           again as Matt gets out, headphones blaring.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Come on!

           Now the exit is finally free but before Sophia can move, her 
           mom appears. 

                                 COLLEEN
                        Sophia, can you unbuckle your 
                        sister please?

           EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door bangs open and out comes GRANDMA onto the 
           porch with a big plate of sugar cookies.
                                 GRANDMA
                        Well if it isn't my only living 
                        relatives at half past ten on 
                        Christmas Eve!

           Grandma gives each of her grandkids a kiss and a cookie as 
           they stream into the house.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hi Grandma.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Hey Grandma.

                                 MATT
                        S'up Grandma.

           From the car, Sophia finishes unbuckling Sarah and hands the 
           baby to her mom.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Ma, there was a snowstorm! We were 
                        stuck in traffic for 6 hours!

                                 GRANDMA
                        Ha! You think a blizzard would've 
                        stopped me when I was your age?

           Colleen heads up the driveway, holding a giggling Sarah.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Go back in the house, Ma! You're 
                        gonna freeze to death out here.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Nonsense! A little cold air is good 
                        for the constitution! Isn't that 
                        right, my sweetie pie?

           Sarah giggles her agreement, and together, Colleen, Sarah, 
           and Grandma head into the house.

           Sophia is about to follow them in when her dad calls out from 
           the back of the car.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sophia! A little help?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I was just going inside--

                                 RICHARD
                        C'mon, Sophia! I can't carry all 
                        this by myself.
           Sophia groans and trudges back down the driveway.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Sure, what else better do I have to 
                        do?

           Richard hands her a heavy-looking suitcase.

                                 RICHARD
                        Exactly. Thanks, honey! 

           As Sophia trudges up the driveway, Richard calls after her:

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        And tell your siblings to get their 
                        butts out here! There's a lot more 
                        luggage where that came from!

           Sophia turns to head up the porch but stops at the sight of a 
           BLACK CROW sitting on the railing.

           It cocks its head at her and takes off.

           Sophia stares after it, unnerved, before heading up the 
           stairs and into the house.

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

           As Sophia steps inside, Grandma approaches with a plate of 
           cookies.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Oh my goodness, Sophia, is that 
                        you?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Grandma!

           Grandma gives Sophia a hug with the arm that's not holding 
           the plate.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Last time I saw you, you were this 
                        big.

           She holds her free hand a few inches above Sophia's head.

                                 GRANDMA (CONT’D)
                        You're gettin' shorter, kiddo. A 
                        tragic case of sugar deprivation if 
                        I ever saw one. Better take these.

           She offers Sophia the cookie plate. Sophia hesitates.
                                 SOPHIA
                        Would it be okay if I left them out 
                        for Santa instead?

                                 GRANDMA
                        For Santa? Are you sure? These are 
                        the last ones, you know.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I know, I just like to keep up the 
                        tradition.

           Grandma gives Sophia a wink and takes the plate back. 

                                 GRANDMA
                        Well, I'm sure Santa will 
                        appreciate that. I'll leave these 
                        out by the fireplace.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Thanks, Grandma.

           Baby Sarah starts crying in another room.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Uh oh, sounds like someone needs a 
                        grandmother's touch. I'm a-coming!

           Grandma heads off and Sophia walks down the hall. 

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           In the living room, Tommy is staring, inches away, from a 
           glowing TV set.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Dad says you have to go help.

           Tommy doesn't even look up. Sophia rolls her eyes and moves 
           on to the kitchen.

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                 SOPHIA
                        Dad says you have to--

           Matt is standing in front of an open refrigerator, head-
           banging to music on his headphones. 

           Sophia stares at him, then slowly backs away.
           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, Sophia comes to a bathroom, in which Caitlin is 
           complaining to her friend over the phone.

                                 CAITLIN (O.S.)
                        We were seriously stuck in the car 
                        all day long. I'm camped out in a 
                        frickin' bathroom right now just so 
                        I don't have to see my stupid 
                        family for another second.

           The door is slightly ajar and Sophia pushes it open.

           Inside, Caitlin is leaning against the sink, phone to her 
           ear. She looks down as Sophia enters. 

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, great. Maggie, let me call you 
                        back.

           Caitlin hangs up and stares at her sister.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        What do you want? 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Dad says you have to go help.

           Caitlin's eyes go wide and she points at something above 
           Sophia's head.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh my god, is that mistletoe?

           Sophia looks up and Caitlin flicks her on the forehead. 
           Sophia drops the luggage.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Ow! What was that for?!

                                 CAITLIN
                        That was for your own good. You 
                        can’t keep listening to everything 
                        Mom and Dad tell you, Sophia. 
                        That’s why you’re turning into such 
                        a pushover.

           Caitlin turns to the mirror and starts brushing her hair. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        I'm not a pushover!
                                 CAITLIN
                             (bratty voice)
                        "Of course I’ll carry your luggage, 
                        Father. Would anyone else like to 
                        lay their burdens upon me? I have 
                        no will of my own."

                                 SOPHIA
                        I'm just trying to be nice! Maybe 
                        if you didn't act like such a jerk 
                        all the time, Santa would finally 
                        bring you a boyfriend.

           Caitlin shuts her book and pushes past Sophia into the hall, 
           kicking the dropped luggage into the kitchen as she goes.

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                 CAITLIN
                        For your information, Sophia, Tommy 
                        Campanella asked me out last month 
                        and I turned him down.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Tommy Campanella? The nose picker? 
                        Wow, real cool.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh like you're one to talk. The 
                        only kid in middle school who still 
                        believes in Santa Claus.

                                 SOPHIA
                             (a little too quickly)
                        What are you talking about? I don't 
                        believe in Santa anymore.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh really? Then why do you still 
                        leave him cookies every year?

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the living room where Tommy's watching TV and 
           Matt's jamming out. The cookie plate rests on a bench by the 
           fireplace.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I like to keep up the tradition! 
                        For the little kids!
                                 CAITLIN
                        Come on, Sophia. Even Tommy doesn’t 
                        believe in Santa anymore, and I’m 
                        pretty sure he’s about to flunk 
                        kindergarten.

           Tommy is still sitting an inch away from the TV, mouth open, 
           drooling.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        Just admit it. You think Santa 
                        Claus is gonna come sliding down 
                        the chimney tonight to find your 
                        precious cookies waiting for him.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Well I guess if he does, he'll know 
                        they're just from me.

           Sophia gestures to the cookie plate.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Consider this an intervention.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Consider wh--?

           Caitlin picks up the cookies and shoves them in her mouth.

           Sophia watches in shock as her sister chews and swallows.

                                 CAITLIN 
                        There. All gone.  

           Sophia picks up the plate, now covered only in crumbs.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        It's time you face the facts. Santa 
                        was never going to eat your 
                        cookies, Sophia, because Santa 
                        isn't real.

           That's the last straw. 

           Sophia chucks the plate at her sister just as her mom walks 
           into the room with Grandma and the baby.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Sophia!

           Caitlin ducks and the plate smashes into the wall.

           Tommy yelps and jolts back from the smashed plate, right into 
           the path of the jamming-out Matt. 
           Matt trips over his little brother, and his headphones fall 
           out, blasting music. 

           All the commotion sets off Baby Sarah, who starts crying in 
           Grandma's arms.

           Finally, Richard walks in, barely balancing six suitcases.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey, what's all the ruckus in--?

           He trips over the suitcase Caitlin kicked into the kitchen. 
           Everything crashes to the floor.

           Sophia is the only one left standing amidst the chaos, and 
           Colleen glares at her daughter.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Go to your room. Now.

           Sophia storms out of the room without another word.

           INT. SOPHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           In her room upstairs, Sophia is curled up in a ball in bed.

           The door opens and Colleen enters. They stare at each other.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Do you want to say you're sorry?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Do you?

                                 COLLEEN
                        I don't appreciate this attitude, 
                        Sophia. On Christmas Eve of all 
                        nights!

                                 SOPHIA
                        My attitude?! What about them? 
                        Everyone was a jerk to me all day 
                        long and you didn't do a thing 
                        about it! I'm the only one who ever 
                        helps around here and I'm the only 
                        one who ever gets punished. It's 
                        not fair.

           Colleen sits down at the foot of the bed.
                                 COLLEEN
                        Look, Sophia. I know things were a 
                        bit crazy today and if your 
                        siblings were picking on you or if 
                        Dad and I asked too much of you, I 
                        apologize. But that's no excuse for 
                        how you acted.

           Colleen puts her hand on Sophia's shoulder.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Would you say you're sorry if I 
                        said I'm sorry too?

           Sophia rolls over to face the window, shrugging her mom's 
           hand off.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I'm not sorry. I wish the plate had 
                        hit her. I wish you and Dad 
                        actually gave a crap. I wish that 
                        for once everyone would get what 
                        they deserve.

           Colleen sighs and stands up.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Are you sure about that, Sophia? 
                        Because what you deserve might not 
                        be what you're expecting.

           The door shuts, leaving Sophia alone in her room.

                                                                 FADE TO:

           Later that night, the grandfather clock strikes 12.

           Sophia is fast asleep in the attic as snow falls outside the 
           window.

           As the clock tolls, we see the stillness throughout the 
           house: the family members sound asleep in their rooms, the 
           embers burning out in the fireplace, the Christmas tree 
           ornaments twinkling in the moonlight.

           And finally, on the twelfth stroke of midnight, we return to 
           Sophia, whose eyes open at the sound of DISTANT CAWING.

           Sophia sits up in bed. She listens intently, then looks out 
           the window...

           There’s a strange shape cutting across the moon. Some kind of 
           carriage pulled by a team of animals.
           Sophia squints at it, thinking the obvious. Could it be?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Santa?

           It gets closer... and closer...

           The sound of cawing cuts through the silence. It’s not 
           Santa’s sleigh at all.

           It’s a BLACK VICTORIAN CARRIAGE driven by a MURDER OF CROWS.

           Sophia watches from her bed, dumbstruck, as the carriage 
           comes to a graceful landing on the roof outside her window.

           She throws open the window, grabs her coat and slippers, and 
           clambers out onto the roof.

           EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

           Cautious and shivering, Sophia approaches the carriage. The 
           crows shake their wings and stare as she approaches.

           There's something strange about these birds, and it's not 
           just their unusual size. They seem to give off a bit of black 
           smoke with every rustle of their wings.

           Before Sophia can take a closer look, the carriage door 
           swings open.

           BUCKLEBEE THE ELF appears in the doorway, framed by warm, 
           amber light. He steps off the carriage, and his features come 
           into focus.

           He wears a pointed cap, a double-breasted suit, red 
           stockings, and black boots turned up at the end. Clutched in 
           his gloved hand is a gnarled wooden staff.

           A BLACK CROW WITH A RED EYE perches on his shoulder, a scroll 
           in its beak.

           Bucklebee smiles down at Sophia as he takes the scroll from 
           the bird and unrolls it.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Sophia? Miss Sophia?

           Sophia stares at the stranger.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Who are you?
                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        The name’s Bucklebee, and I’m an 
                        elf from the North Pole.

           He turns his head and taps a finger against the tip of his 
           pointy ear.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        See?
                             (clearing throat)
                        I am here to announce, with the 
                        greatest joy, thrill, and pleasure, 
                        that you have been selected for a 
                        special Christmas visit to the 
                        North Pole!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Me?

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        That's right, Sophia, you! There 
                        will be sweets and toys and games 
                        all around. I have to tell you, I'm 
                        glad we found you when we did. You 
                        were a last minute addition to the 
                        list!

           Bucklebee shows her the list he's holding, and indeed, the 
           name "Sophia" is written at the very bottom.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        It's not just anyone who gets to 
                        visit the North Pole, you know. 
                        Only the most special children are 
                        allowed to make the trip. I know 
                        Santa Claus will be delighted to 
                        meet you!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Santa Claus? He's... he's real?

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Oh yes, very much so! Big white 
                        beard, red suit, the whole deal!

           Sophia bites her lip, considering, as Bucklebee and the bird 
           on his shoulder watch and wait for her reply.

           Something about this feels very off to her, but she's not 
           ready to turn away just yet.

           Bucklebee leans in, as if he's telling her a secret.
                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Think very carefully, Sophia, 
                        because this is the opportunity of 
                        a lifetime. The North Pole isn't 
                        just a place for fun and games. 
                        It's a place where everything is 
                        made right. Where people are 
                        rewarded for their behavior. Where 
                        everyone gets exactly what's coming 
                        to them. Please, won't you come 
                        along?

           Sophia nods to herself as she turns this over in her head.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Okay... Okay, I'll come.

           Bucklebee beams and offers the steps with a bow as Sophia 
           approaches the carriage.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Then without further adieu, may I 
                        present... 

           She climbs up the steps and into the carriage...

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        The Christmas Carriage!

           The moment she steps aboard, Sophia realizes the carriage is 
           much, much bigger on the inside than the out.

           Dozens of Christmas trees stretch high into the air and life-
           size Nutcrackers line the walls, all of them encircling a 
           full-fledged CHRISTMAS CARNIVAL.

           There are roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, and giant slides, 
           all of them made out of candy. Kids run wild around the 
           carriage, torn between playing on these rides and eating 
           them.

           Throughout the chaos, elves juggle and perform magic tricks, 
           inviting kids to try their hand at various carnival games. 
           Other elves wander the floor like waiters with trays of 
           steaming hot cocoa, making sure every kid has a fresh mug.

           Sophia can't believe it. She's been transported into a 
           Christmas wonderland.
           As Bucklebee closes the door behind them with a quick pull of 
           a lever, Red Eye plucks a candy cane off a nearby tree and 
           hands the candy to its master. 

           Bucklebee sticks the sweet in his mouth and winks at Sophia.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy.

           He disappears into the shadows, leaving Sophia to the marvels 
           of the Christmas Carriage.

           MONTAGE: THE CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE

           -Sophia yells with joy as she flies down a slide made of 
           licorice into a pool of cotton candy.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Woo-hoo!!

           -An ELF CARNIVAL BARKER invites kids to try a balloon-popping 
           game where the balloons are made from bubble gum.

                                 CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Step right up and take a shot!

           Sophia takes aim and lands a dart right on a bubble. POP!

           -Sophia rides a rollercoaster with peppermint wheels down a 
           track made from peppermint sticks.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Woo-hoo!!

           -A JUGGLER ELF juggles dozens of Christmas ornaments at once. 
           As Sophia watches, she notices a nearby NUTCRACKER, which 
           seems to be staring at her. When she looks back, it freezes. 
           As she turns back to the show, we clearly see the Nutcracker 
           turn its head to look at her.

           -At a "Decorate Your Own Christmas Tree!" station, kids run 
           wild around fir trees, stringing them up with popcorn, 
           hanging ornaments willy-nilly, and drowning them in tinsel. 
           Some of the kids are wrapping a crying kid up in garland.

           -Exhausted and satisfied, Sophia and the other kids ride a 
           merry-go-round made from gingerbread animals. She takes a 
           lazy bite out of her horse's ear.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Woo-hoo...

           END MONTAGE.
           As Sophia exits the Merry-Go-Round, an ELF WAITER hands her 
           and the other kids fresh cups of cocoa.

                                 CARNIVAL BARKER (O.S.)
                        A very special holiday show starts 
                        in just a few minutes! Get your 
                        cocoa and don't be late!

           The kids begin a mass exodus towards the center of the 
           carriage.

           Sophia is about to take a sip of her cocoa and follow after 
           the crowd when she spots the same Nutcracker that was 
           watching her before.

           As she stops and stares, a TALL GIRL exiting the ride bumps 
           into Sophia, causing her to drop her mug of cocoa.

                                 GERMAN GIRL
                        Achtung!

           Sophia turns and we recognize this girl from the opening 
           sequence as the GERMAN GIRL who pushed a little kid into the 
           snow.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Oh, sorry!

                                 GERMAN GIRL
                        Dummer Amerikaner...

           The German Girl slinks off, muttering.

           Sophia bends down to pick up her mug and realizes the 
           Nutcracker has moved a few feet from its original location.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What the...?

           She steps forward and gives the Nutcracker a hesitant knock 
           on the head.

           As soon as she does, the Nutcracker jumps and hurries off out 
           of sight.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Wait!

           Sophia gives chase after the Nutcracker as it runs through 
           the now empty fair grounds until it disappears behind a 
           pillar of gum drops.

           When she rounds the pillar, however, the Nutcracker is gone. 
           The only thing there is a barred grate in the wall.
           Sophia stares down into the dark tunnel beyond the grate.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Is anyone down there?

           No one responds. Sophia leans forward. Deep in the pipes 
           comes the sound of scuffling.

           Sophia gives a last glance over her shoulder before stepping 
           through the grate and into the pipe.

           As she disappears from sight, a nearby ELF bends down and 
           picks up the spilled mug Sophia left behind.

           He nods to another ELF, who heads off into the shadows.

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE PIPES - NIGHT

           Sophia crawls deeper and deeper down the pipe, into the 
           underbelly of the Christmas Carriage.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Hello?

           Sophia's hand crunches on something on the pipe floor and she 
           looks down. Toffee pieces are stuck to her hand.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Old candy... What's this doing down 
                        here?

           The sound of clanking wood echoes from up ahead in the pipe.

           Silently, she crawls toward a bright light until she's 
           looking right into...

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE UNDERCARRIAGE - NIGHT

           A small central room into which multiple pipes feed. Up above 
           is a grate through which light and music stream down from the 
           main floor of the carriage.

           It appears that someone has turned this space into their 
           personal living quarters. There’s a cot made from pine 
           needles and a stash of gingerbread and candy beside it.

           A wild-eyed STOWAWAY (11) is stepping out of a Nutcracker he 
           appears to have reconstructed into a wearable suit.

           Once out of the armor, the Stowaway begins collecting candies 
           from a hollow place in the suit's head.
           As he works, the Stowaway hums along to the Christmas music 
           from the carriage above.

           He turns and sees Sophia watching from the pipe entrance.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Uh, hi.

           The Stowaway screams and drops candy everywhere. He backs 
           against the wall like a cornered animal as Sophia approaches.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        It's okay! It's okay! I didn't mean 
                        to scare you!

                                 STOWAWAY
                        How did you get here?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        I saw you in the Nutcracker costume 
                        and followed the trail of candy--

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Followed?! You were followed?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, I don't think so... Wait, why 
                        would I be--?

           The Stowaway grabs a huge gumdrop off the floor and starts 
           scrubbing it against Sophia like it's a loofah.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Ow! What are you doing?!

                                 STOWAWAY
                             (scrubbing furiously)
                        They can't find us if we smell like 
                        candy!

                                 SOPHIA
                             (shoving him away)
                        Knock it off! Who's they? What are 
                        you doing down here? The party's 
                        upstairs. There's rides and hot 
                        chocolate and everything.

           The Stowaway drops the gumdrop.

                                 STOWAWAY
                             (whispering)
                        The cocoa... You didn't drink it, 
                        did you?
                                 SOPHIA
                        I...

                                 STOWAWAY
                             (shaking her)
                        The cocoa!! Did you drink the 
                        cocoa?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        No! No, okay? I dropped mine before 
                        I had any. Why? What's the big 
                        deal?

           The opening notes of a familiar song begin to play from the 
           carriage above them, and the Stowaway turns white as a sheet.

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Oh no... It's starting.

           He points a shaking finger to a slit in the pipe.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What's starting?

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Shhhhh!!

           The Stowaway presses Sophia's face against the opening and 
           she sees a strange scene unfolding in the carriage above...

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

           In the center of the main floor, Bucklebee is standing atop a 
           fountain spewing hot cocoa, where elves are ladling out cups 
           to a crowd of gathering kids.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Children, children! We're all just 
                        overjoyed you could join us on this 
                        magical Christmas adventure. We'll 
                        be arriving at our destination 
                        shortly, but before we do, won't 
                        you join me in a little festive 
                        tribute to the one and only ruler 
                        of the North Pole, the King of 
                        Christmas himself... Me.

           The children look up in confusion from their cocoa as 
           Bucklebee smiles and starts to sing.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        You better watch out
                        You better not cry
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Better not pout
                        I'm telling you why.
                        Bucklebee is coming to town.

           Bucklebee hops down off the fountain and starts tap dancing 
           and swinging his staff like a bandleader. 

           The steady rap of the staff against the floor forms a 
           hypnotic beat, along with which the elves begin stamping 
           their feet.

           The kids can't seem to help themselves: they too start 
           nodding and tapping along with the beat.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        I'm making a list
                        I'm checking it twice
                        I already know that you're naughty,
                        Not nice.
                        Bucklebee is coming to town!

           Bucklebee raises the staff, and in unison, all the kids lift 
           their mugs and down the rest of the cocoa.

           When they lower their cups again, the kids' eyes have gone 
           white and glassed-over. They wear dreamy smiles on their 
           faces, totally entranced.

           From the pipes, Sophia gasps in horror.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        I see you when you're sleeping!
                        And I know when you're awake!
                        I know that you've been bad, not 
                        good!
                        So give in and accept your fate!
                        Everybody!

           The kids join Bucklebee in a dance routine so elaborate and 
           perfectly synchronized, it would take months of practice to 
           pull off without the help of mind-altering cocoa.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        You better watch out!
                        You better not cry!
                        Better not pout!
                        I'm telling you why!
                        Bucklebee is coming to town!
                        Oh let's go!

           The Elves throw open hidden panels on the walls, revealing 
           holding cells, into which Bucklebee leads the still-dancing 
           kids like the Pied Piper.
           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE UNDERCARRIAGE - NIGHT

           As the kids continue to march to their doom up on the main 
           floor, Sophia turns back to face the Stowaway who is curled 
           up in a ball, shivering in a corner. 

                                 STOWAWAY
                        The carriage takes kids to the 
                        North Pole but it never brings them 
                        back. I only got away because I 
                        never touched the cocoa. Lactose 
                        intolerant, you see? Now I stay 
                        down here. So very long I've stayed 
                        down here... 

           He points to the wall and Sophia stares up at hundreds and 
           hundreds of scratched-in tally marks.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I don't understand. How could Santa 
                        let this happen? How could he let 
                        the elves kidnap children?

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Santa?!
                             (mad cackling)
                        Santa isn't running the show 
                        anymore, silly girl. The elves took 
                        over a long time ago. Santa's been 
                        gone for years.

           He cackles again as Sophia stumbles back in horror.

                                 SOPHIA
                        We have to get out of here. We 
                        can't be too far from where we took 
                        off. Maybe we could--

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Oh no, no, no, no! There's no way 
                        out. Look!

           The Stowaway pulls back a panel on the floor, revealing a 
           small hole in the underside of the carriage.

           Sophia peers through and sees nothing but snow in every 
           direction. Civilization is thousands of miles away by now. 
           They’re trapped.

           The Stowaway slides the panel back over the hole and sits 
           down on his cot of pine needles.
                                 STOWAWAY (CONT’D)
                        This is the only place left for us. 
                        Here where it's quiet. Here where 
                        it's safe.

           He picks up the fallen gumdrop and offers it to Sophia. She 
           knocks it out of his hand.

                                 SOPHIA
                        No! I’m not going to spend the rest 
                        of my life eating candy off the 
                        floor! There must be something we 
                        can do to get out of here!

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Shh! Quiet! They'll hear us.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You’ve been here long enough, you 
                        must have learned something useful!

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Quiet! You have to be quiet!

                                 SOPHIA
                        I’ll be quiet if you help me!

                                 STOWAWAY
                        The Missing Claus is in Yulewood 
                        Forest!

           Sophia stares at the Stowaway.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What?

                                 STOWAWAY
                        I... I heard the elves talking when 
                        they were loading up the 
                        carriage... They said the Missing 
                        Claus had been spotted in Yulewood 
                        Forest. Happy?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yulewood Forest? What is that?

                                 STOWAWAY
                        How should I know?! I've never been 
                        to the North Pole!

                                 SOPHIA
                        You're sure that’s what the elves 
                        said?
                                 STOWAWAY
                        I think so...

                                 SOPHIA
                        How sure?!

           The Stowaway goes pale and claps a hand over his mouth.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        What?!

                                 STOWAWAY
                             (barely a whisper)
                        What happened to the music?

           They both freeze. The music has stopped playing in the 
           carriage above.

           The Stowaway and Sophia slowly look up to see Bucklebee and 
           the elves grinning down at them from an open grate.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

           Bucklebee grabs the Stowaway, who screams as he's yanked up 
           out of sight.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        It's just I've been meaning to 
                        clean these pipes out for years!

           Sophia screams and takes off running.

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE PIPES - NIGHT

           Sophia scrambles through the pipe, dodging elves' hands that 
           grab at her from above as she crawls.

           Finally, she spills out of an opening...

           INT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

           And finds herself back on the main floor of the carriage.

           Elves surround her. Sophia looks for the lever to open the 
           carriage door, but it's dozens of feet away and Bucklebee is 
           blocking the path.

           Beside him, a terrified Stowaway is being held captive by a 
           GRUFF ELF.
           Bucklebee pulls out the candy cane he's been sucking on and 
           reveals it's been sharpened to a white point.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Looks like some naughty children 
                        haven't been drinking their cocoa. 
                        Why don't you try a fresh cup on 
                        the house?

           He waves his candy cane at one of the elves, who steps 
           forward with a tray of steaming cocoa.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I... I think it's getting a little 
                        late for all this sugar. Maybe we'd 
                        better just go.

           The elves all laugh and Bucklebee begins circling Sophia as 
           he monologues.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Go? 
                             (laughs)
                        You children are all alike. You 
                        think you can get away with 
                        misbehaving. That as long as no one 
                        is around to see or hear, all your 
                        bad deeds are as good as forgotten. 
                        But we're there, children. We're 
                        always there. Watching. Listening. 
                        Taking down names...

           Red Eye flies down from the darkness, the same scroll it held 
           before clutched in its beak. The bird alights on Bucklebee's 
           shoulder and hands the scroll to its master.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        On the Naughty List.

           Bucklebee unravels the scroll, revealing its true title: "The 
           Naughty List." 

           Sophia's name is right there at the bottom.

                                 SOPHIA
                        That's not possible... You're 
                        lying.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        The list never lies, Sophia. You're 
                        exactly where you belong.

           Sophia glares at Bucklebee as the elf rolls the list back up 
           and stuffs it in his jacket.
           The Stowaway lets out a whimper. Bucklebee turns and presses 
           the tip of his candy cane under the Stowaway's chin.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        And don't think I've forgotten you, 
                        my little stowaway! We've been 
                        searching for the gutter rat 
                        scurrying around our pipes for 
                        quite some time.

                                 STOWAWAY
                        Please! I don't want to drink the 
                        cocoa! I... I'm lactose intolerant!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Don't worry, my dear boy, you don't 
                        have to drink a thing! I have 
                        something else in mind for you.

           Bucklebee raises his staff at the quivering Stowaway.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Watch and learn, Sophia, what 
                        happens to those who disobey 
                        Bucklebee the Elf.

           He taps the boy on the nose with the staff.

           Instantly, porcelain begins to spread from the tip of his 
           nose, down into his mouth, and over his cheeks and eyes.

           Before the Stowaway can even finish screaming, he's 
           transformed into a PORCELAIN ORNAMENT.

           Sophia stares in horror.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Now unless you want to meet the 
                        same fate, I suggest you be a good 
                        little girl for once...

           Bucklebee picks a mug off the tray and shoves it in Sophia's 
           face. 

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        And drink. Your cocoa.

           Reluctantly, Sophia takes the mug, still wafting deadly 
           steam. She lifts it to her lips for a sip and meets 
           Bucklebee's eyes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Drink it yourself.
           Sophia throws the drink in Bucklebee's face and he shrieks in 
           pain.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Gahhh!!

           Before any of the other elves can react, Sophia ducks under 
           Bucklebee's legs and runs across the carriage.

           She seizes the lever to open the carriage door, grasps it as 
           tightly as she can, and yanks down.

           The carriage door flies open, and all at once, the whole 
           carriage tilts to the side, like an airplane with a hole 
           blown out the middle.

           Bucklebee and the elves are thrown backwards.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        No!!

           It's too late for Bucklebee, however, and he and all his 
           followers are sucked out the gaping entrance.

           A towering Christmas tree comes crashing to the floor just in 
           front of the exit.

           Sophia grabs onto the branches of the fallen tree and crawls 
           to the door.

           EXT. CHRISTMAS CARRIAGE ROOF - NIGHT

           As Sophia makes her way out onto the roof of the carriage, 
           the vehicle jerks wildly from side to side.

           Hundreds of feet beneath her stretches nothing but snow.

           Sophia gasps at the sight of something else beneath her: 
           Bucklebee clinging to one of the wheels, his crow Red Eye 
           cawing madly in the air beside him.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Well-played, Sophia! Well-played!

           With unnatural strength, he begins crawling up to the top of 
           the carriage as Sophia desperately searches for a way out.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        I hope you know I don’t take the 
                        destruction of my carriage lightly.

           Bucklebee leaps onto the carriage top and Sophia backs away 
           to the edge of the roof.
                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        No more cocoa for you, I’m afraid.

           Bucklebee raises the staff just as Sophia spots a mountain 
           peak coming into view ahead.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        This time, I'm going to make you 
                        pay.

           Sophia leaps off the carriage as Bucklebee brings his staff 
           down on empty air.

           She falls through the sky and Bucklebee watches her go.

           He turns to Red Eye on his shoulder and nods. The crow takes 
           off after Sophia as she drops down into a plane of whiteness.

           EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINTOP - NIGHT

           Sophia awakens on a snowy mountain peak, surrounded by debris 
           from the battered carriage.

           She looks up and sees in the far distance a forbidding gray 
           city from which towers a candy-cane striped pole with a 
           golden bauble at its top.

           Between the city and the mountain lie snowy plains, an icy 
           lake, and a thick stretch of forest.

                                 SOPHIA
                        The Missing Claus is in Yulewood 
                        Forest...

           The sound of distant mewling interrupts her train of thought.

           Sophia spins around but sees no one. Cautiously, she picks up 
           a board of wood fallen from the carriage and holds it like a 
           club.

           Another whimper in the distance.

           Sophia moves closer, then squints through the snow at...

           A BABY REINDEER, its antlers just barely coming in and its 
           hoof ensnared in a trap.

           The Reindeer looks at Sophia with pitiful eyes and bleats for 
           help.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you poor thing!
           Sophia drops her club and rushes over to help. As she does, 
           her foot catches on something buried in the snow.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        What the--ahhhh!!

           It's a trap and Sophia is yanked foot-first into the air and 
           left dangling upside down.

           As Sophia hangs from the snare, the Reindeer easily steps out 
           of its own trap and bounces happily around Sophia.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        You little faker! You tricked me!

           The Reindeer licks Sophia's face like a puppy.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Ugh! Get off!

                                 SMALL HOODED FIGURE (O.S.)
                        Good work, Clover.

           TWO HOODED FIGURES, one huge and one small, step out from the 
           rocks and approach Sophia and the reindeer CLOVER.

                                 GIANT HOODED FIGURE
                             (thick Russian accent)
                        Yes, tonight we have delicious 
                        feast!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Please don't eat me!

           The Hooded Figures halt and stare at Sophia.

           The giant steps into the light, revealing a towering Slavic 
           man with a great bushy beard and wild, beady eyes. He's 
           bundled up in coats and furs but wears a sea captain's hat.

           This is GEORGY (50).

                                 GEORGY
                        This is not little goat. This is 
                        little girl!

           Georgy turns to Clover.

                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                        Georgy cannot eat child! Meat too 
                        tough! What happen to goat?!

           Clover licks Georgy's face.
                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                        Bah!

           The Hooded Figure thrusts a staff in Sophia's face.

                                 HOODED FIGURE
                        What are you doing here? Are you 
                        with Bucklebee?

                                 SOPHIA
                        What? No! He tried to kidnap me! I 
                        had to jump off his carriage in 
                        midair! Please, I'm just a regular 
                        kid!

           The Hooded Figure lowers his staff.

                                 HOODED FIGURE
                        A kid? A human kid?

                                 SOPHIA
                        What other kind is there?

           The Hooded Figure pulls his hood down, revealing a handsome 
           face framed by pointy ears.

           This is JUNIPER THE ELF (mid 20s).

                                 JUNIPER
                        Just what we needed. A runaway from 
                        the Naughty List.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You're an elf!

           The elf swipes his staff at the rope, undoing the trap and 
           sending her tumbling into the snow. There's a caw in the 
           distance.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Come on. We should get to shelter.

           Juniper begins walking away as Georgy pulls Sophia to her 
           feet and a prancing Clover nudges her from behind.

                                 SOPHIA
                        How do I know you're not going to 
                        take me to Bucklebee?

                                 JUNIPER
                        You don't. But feel free to stay 
                        here and try your luck with the 
                        crows.
           Sophia looks up at the sky where the birds are starting to 
           circle overhead.

           INT. MOUNTAIN PASSAGE - NIGHT

           Juniper, Georgy, and Clover lead Sophia through a secret 
           tunnel carved into the mountain.

           As they walk, they pass signs of abandoned life: extinguished 
           torches, makeshift beds, and broken weaponry.

           Everything looks like it was constructed in a hurry; made to 
           be packed up quickly or left behind altogether.

                                 JUNIPER
                        These are the halls my ancestors 
                        built after Bucklebee drove us into 
                        the mountains. I'm Juniper, last of 
                        the free elves.

           Juniper's torch illuminates the walls around them, on which 
           sprawl enormous, elaborate cave paintings.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What happened to the rest of you?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Bucklebee happened. All the elves 
                        who didn't follow him were hunted 
                        to extinction after the Rebellion.

           Sophia gazes up at a series of cave paintings that look like 
           a cross between graffiti and religious frescoes:

           Santa being cast down by Bucklebee; a demonic horde of elves 
           driving the faithful from the North Pole; the diaspora of 
           loyal elves hiding in the mountains as crows swarm outside.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Why would anyone rebel against 
                        Santa?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Greed? Envy? Your guess is as good 
                        as mine. Bucklebee led the 
                        revolution a long time ago. If 
                        anyone still knows why, they never 
                        told me, and I don't plan to get 
                        close enough to Bucklebee to ask.

           Juniper catches Sophia staring at a painting of toys tumbling 
           out of a sack and down a dark ravine.
                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Legend has it that when Bucklebee 
                        took down Santa, he destroyed every 
                        single toy in the North Pole. Just 
                        out of spite.

           Juniper gives Sophia a wicked grin, and she gulps.

           INT. MOUNTAIN HIDEOUT - NIGHT

           The group enters a small burrow divided into three sections, 
           one for each of its occupants, encircling a dwindling fire 
           pit onto which Juniper tosses a log.

           Sophia walks into Juniper's section, where a modest cot is 
           surrounded by various woodworking projects that almost look 
           like toys.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Have you been here long?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Long enough to call it a home. 

           Juniper notices Sophia eyeing his corner of the room. He 
           kicks the makeshift toys out of the way.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Which, I might remind you, you are 
                        currently a guest in.

           Juniper sits down by the now crackling fire.

           Sophia moves on to Clover's section of the room, where Clover 
           is drinking melted snow water out of a simple wooden trough. 

           As Sophia approaches, he brays an invitation to her and trots 
           over to a big bed of hay. 

           The reindeer circles it a few times, lies down, and begins to 
           eat his own bed.

           Clover makes eyes contact with Sophia, burps loudly and 
           resumes eating.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Ugh...

           Sophia backs away from Clover and right into Georgy.

                                 GEORGY
                        Aha, yes! Enough of elf and 
                        reindeer!
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                        Georgy has something important to 
                        show you! Human to human!

           Georgy brings her to his corner of the room, where black-and-
           white photos, maps, diagrams, and an old Russian flag are 
           tacked to the wall.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Human to human? You mean you're 
                        human too?

                                 GEORGY
                        You think elves come this big? Bah!

                                 JUNIPER
                        I found Georgy wandering in the 
                        snow years ago. He was on some sort 
                        of expedition to the North Pole but 
                        got himself lost. Like, really 
                        really lost.

           Georgy taps the center of his wall spread, where everything 
           points to one drawing of a mysterious figure.

                                 GEORGY
                        Georgy seeks ancient beast of 
                        legend hidden in North Pole... The 
                        Abominable Snowman.

                                 SOPHIA
                        There's an Abominable Snowman out 
                        here?!

                                 JUNIPER
                        No, there isn't. Even in the North 
                        Pole, that's just a myth. 

                                 GEORGY
                             (angrily speaking Russian)
                        Snegovik zhivet, i ya naydu yego!

                                 JUNIPER
                        All right, all right, already!

           Juniper takes out a knife and starts whittling his staff.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, I've got my hands 
                        full here as it is. You can stay 
                        until the storm passes. Then you're 
                        on your own.
                                 SOPHIA
                        On my own?! We're in the middle of 
                        the North Pole!

                                 JUNIPER
                        That's not my fault.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It is if you're gonna send me back 
                        outside! I can't just walk home!

                                 JUNIPER
                        Well unless you can hitch a ride 
                        home with Santa Claus, I'd say 
                        walking's just about your only 
                        option.

           Sophia's eyes go wide.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Santa Claus...

                                 JUNIPER
                        No, wait--

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yeah, that's it! If we find Santa 
                        Claus, he could take me home!

           Georgy bursts into laughter.

                                 GEORGY
                        We find very funny girl in the 
                        snow, yes?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Come off it, kid. Santa's been 
                        missing for years. For all we know, 
                        he's probably dead.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Oh yeah? Then how could he have 
                        been sighted in Yulewood Forest?

           Georgy quits laughing and Juniper stops whittling. Even 
           Clover perks up.

                                 JUNIPER
                        What are you talking about?
                                 SOPHIA
                        When I was on the carriage, one of 
                        the kids overheard the elves 
                        talking. They said that the Missing 
                        Claus is in Yulewood Forest.

                                 JUNIPER
                        "The Missing Claus"? That could be 
                        anyone.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Seriously? How many missing Clauses 
                        do you think are running around the 
                        North Pole? It's got to be Santa.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Even if it is, which it isn't, 
                        Yulewood Forest is miles from here. 
                        Not only would you be traveling 
                        through snow and ice and darkness, 
                        but you'd be heading north, closer 
                        to Bucklebee.

                                 SOPHIA
                        And closer to the only person who 
                        can stop him!

                                 JUNIPER
                        Sophia, listen to me. This is a 
                        fool's errand. There's nothing in 
                        Yulewood Forest but wolves and 
                        trees. You'll die or get captured 
                        before you even make it there.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I wouldn't if you helped me!

           Juniper stands up and faces the wall as Sophia pleads with 
           him.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Please, Juniper. Finding Santa is 
                        my best shot at getting home. I 
                        really need your help.

           Clover trots over to Sophia and nuzzles her hand.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Clover, no!

           Georgy gets up and stands behind Sophia as well.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Oh you too, huh?!
                                 GEORGY
                        First we help funny girl find 
                        Claus. Then Claus help Georgy find 
                        Snowman. Everyone have great 
                        Christmas.

           Juniper glares at the three of them. Finally, he sighs.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Fine. I'll take you as far as 
                        Yulewood Forest.

           He picks up his staff.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Get the supplies in the corner and 
                        gear up. It's going to be a long 
                        hike.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

           Sophia, Clover, Georgy, and Juniper exit the mountain tunnels 
           and approach a steep slope leading to the ground.

           Juniper takes a cord of rope from his bag and ties it around 
           Georgy so that it hangs down off the cliff.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You're sure this is safe?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Never underestimate the power of a 
                        good cord of rope.

           Juniper grips the rope and rappels down the mountain face.

           Sophia takes a deep breath and follows after him. 

           As they're climbing, Sophia notices Clover is carefully 
           clambering down the slope like a mountain goat.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Is there a problem?

                                 SOPHIA
                        It's just... aren't reindeer 
                        supposed to know how to fly?

                                 JUNIPER
                        They are if someone's around to 
                        teach them. Bucklebee keeps all the 
                        older reindeer under lock and key.

                        Poor Clover here's spent his whole 
                        life stuck in the mountains with 
                        us.

           Clover wags his tail in concentration and makes a final leap 
           to the ground, followed shortly after by Sophia and Juniper.

                                 SOPHIA
                        How's Georgy supposed to get down?

                                 GEORGY
                             (calling from above)
                        Look out below!

           Juniper yanks Sophia out of the way as Georgy leaps off the 
           mountain face and slams down into the snow next to them.

           EXT. SNOWBANKS - NIGHT

           With the mountain behind them, the expedition heads through 
           the snowbanks toward the forest in the far distance.

           Clover leads the pack, bounding ahead with bottomless energy. 
           Georgy follows behind, clearing a way for Sophia and Juniper 
           through the snow.

           He steps right in a puddle of icy slush.

                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                             (groaning)
                        These boots no good. Full of holes. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Maybe when we find Santa, you could 
                        ask him for a new pair.

                                 JUNIPER
                        You think Santa's going to give you 
                        presents when you find him?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I mean, I'm not expecting one but I 
                        wouldn't be surprised if he did. 
                        That's kind of Santa's whole deal, 
                        you know? He gives people presents.

                                 JUNIPER
                        So Santa just has presents on him 
                        at all times? Where does he even 
                        put them all?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I don't know, probably in his 
                        sleigh!

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Don't you know all this already? I 
                        thought you were supposed to be an 
                        elf.

           Juniper halts in his tracks, his pointy ears twitching.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Be quiet!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Okay, geez, I didn't mean to--

                                 JUNIPER
                        Quiet!!

           Everyone stops what they're doing and listens. The sound of 
           distant cawing breaks the silence.

           The group turns and sees a black mark approaching fast 
           against the white landscape.

           It appears to be a single bird, but as it grows closer, they 
           realize it's a massive, convulsing murder of crows, led by 
           the screeching Red Eye.

           INT. BUCKLEBEE'S LAIR - NIGHT

           In a room we recognize from the opening scene, Bucklebee 
           cackles over a snow globe, in which he can see the snowy 
           plains from Red Eye's perspective.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                             (singsong)
                        I've found you!

           EXT. SNOWBANKS - NIGHT

           Bucklebee's laughter resounds from the mass of crows as the 
           birds give chase.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Run!

           They take off through the snow as the screeching grows louder 
           behind them.

           Clover brays and nods his head toward something ahead. 
           There's a gash in the ice at the bottom of the snowbank.

                                 SOPHIA
                        In there!
           They slide down the slope towards the cave entrance with the 
           crows nipping at their heels.

           Just as the crows are about to overtake them, they burst 
           inside the cave and Georgy pounds a fist against the wall, 
           collapsing the entrance behind them.

           The crows' screams mingle with Bucklebee's as the group is 
           plunged into darkness.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (O.S.)
                        Noooo!!

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           Inside the cave, they all pant and catch their breath.

                                 GEORGY
                        Everyone is okay, yes?

                                 JUNIPER
                        None of us are okay! The crows 
                        sighted us. Bucklebee knows exactly 
                        where we are now.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Do we know where we are now? I 
                        can't see a thing.

           Georgy rummages through his sack and takes out a torch and 
           flint. He strikes the flint and the torch catches fire.

           The light illuminates a small cave in which icicles dangle 
           from the ceiling like hundreds of sharp teeth.

           Carefully, the group begins to walk through the cave.

                                 GEORGY
                             (to Sophia)
                        Know how to tell difference between 
                        stalagmites and stalactites?

                                 JUNIPER
                        These are icicles.

                                 GEORGY
                        Shush! Georgy teaching important 
                        science!
                             (emphasizing the C's)
                        Stalactites hang from ceiling.
                             (emphasizing the G's)
                        Stalagmites grow from ground. You 
                        see? Is in letters C and G. 
                                 JUNIPER
                        I can't believe I'm going to die in 
                        an ice cave listening to this.

                                 SOPHIA
                        No one is going to die here. 
                        There's gotta be a way out.

           Whispering and giggling sounds echo from overhead. Clover 
           ducks behind Sophia in fear.

           From the wall above, we see tiny silhouettes watching the 
           kids before slipping off into the darkness.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Keep your voices down! There could 
                        be anything out there.

           In the torchlight, Georgy spies huge scratch marks on the 
           walls.

                                 GEORGY
                        Abominable Snowman.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Okay, there could be almost 
                        anything out there.

           A tinkling song begins to play from the darkness behind them. 

           Everyone spins around and sitting in a dark recess of the 
           cave is a JACK-IN-THE-BOX with a slowly turning crank handle, 
           just reaching the final notes of "Pop Goes the Weasel."

           They all watch the box, petrified with terror, as the music 
           builds to a climax. It gets closer and closer, and everyone 
           winces for the inevitable "Pop!"

           Instead, the final notes of the song play and the top of the 
           box creaks open with excruciating slowness as the toy JACK 
           emerges from the box.

           He's an old jester with a long nose and a golden crown. 
           Although his face is painted with a jolly grin, for some 
           reason, a long crack runs down his eye like a scar.

                                 GEORGY
                        That wasn't so bad.

                                 JACK
                        Welcome!
           Everyone screams. Clover jumps into Sophia's arms, who falls 
           backwards into Juniper. He grabs onto Georgy who slips onto 
           ice which begins to crack.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        No, no, wait! Don't step there! 

           It's too late, however, and the ice shatters beneath their 
           feet. Everyone tumbles down into a tunnel of ice.

           INT. TOY SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

           Together, they slide down the tunnel and into a snow pile at 
           the bottom of a vast underground ice cavern.

                                 JUNIPER
                        What was that thing?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        I don't know, I thought you were 
                        supposed to be the expert!

           Clover is buried head first up to his rear in snow. Georgy 
           yanks him out by the tail and places him at the top of the 
           snowy incline. 

           As they look out beyond the incline, both Georgy and Clover's 
           eyes go wide.

                                 GEORGY
                        Toys.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Well I've never had a... whatever 
                        that was talk to me before!

                                 GEORGY
                        Toys.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Why do you keep saying that?!

                                 GEORGY
                        TOYS.

           Georgy points beyond the snow pile, and everyone looks out at 
           what can only be described as a sprawling, sparkling SHANTY 
           TOWN FOR TOYS.

           Wooden blocks, Lego bricks, Rubik's cubes, and Lincoln Logs 
           are stacked on top of each other to form foundations for 
           makeshift shelters.
           These buildings are bound together with wrapping paper, 
           ribbons, and string: the discarded remains of thousands of 
           presents which give the city a colorful glow.

           Toys mill listlessly about the streets; army men and 
           ballerinas alike huddle beneath board games splayed open like 
           tents while stuffed animals stand around an Easy Bake Oven, 
           warming their paws.

           Sitting atop a box that was once a present, a baby doll plays 
           a wistful tune on a weathered toy harmonica.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It's just like in the painting. The 
                        toys that were thrown away...

                                 JUNIPER
                        I had no idea about this place. All 
                        these years, they've been down 
                        here...

           Sophia, Clover, Juniper, and Georgy walk through the shanty 
           town, and as they go, the toys exchange stunned whispers with 
           their neighbors.

           Georgy looks awestruck at a Russian nesting doll peering at 
           him from atop a building which barely reaches his eye level.

                                 GEORGY
                        Bòzhe mòi! Georgy has not seen one 
                        of these since he was tiny baby 
                        back in Motherland!
                             (waving at the doll)
                        Hello! Dasvidaniya, little ladies!

           Four dolls, each smaller than the last, hop out of the doll 
           and giggle amongst themselves in front of a beaming Georgy. 

           Juniper looks around in wonder at the toys his ancestors 
           built so long ago. He runs a hand over a rocking horse, which 
           whinnies at his touch.

                                 JUNIPER
                        I've never seen one in real life 
                        before. I can't believe the elves 
                        used to build all this.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You've never seen a toy before?

           Juniper looks away, embarrassed.

           Up at the front of the group, Clover spots a shiny, red TOY 
           SLEIGH, complete with silver bell reins. His eyes go wide. 
           He kicks the bells, they jingle, and he jumps with delight.

           Clover slips the bells around his neck and he starts jumping 
           around all over the cave.

           Thunderous RINGING fills the cavern.

           EXT. SNOWBANKS - NIGHT

           Outside, crows are flying low over the snowbanks, and Red Eye 
           swivels at the sound of distant jingling.

           The bird glares down at a translucent patch of ice in the 
           snow.

           INT. TOY SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

           Juniper grabs the bells off Clover's neck.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Let's try not to make any loud 
                        noises while we're in hiding, okay?

           Clover shrinks down, embarrassed, but keeps an eye on the 
           sleigh as they walk away.

           By now, the group has made it to the center of town and all 
           the toys are gathered round, watching them and murmuring.

           A rag doll with yarn hair and a calico dress emerges from the 
           crowd and approaches the children. This is PATCHES.

                                 PATCHES
                        You see?! What did I tell you, 
                        Hotspur?

           She reaches out a felt hand and touches Sophia as if she's 
           worried the girl might disappear. 

                                 PATCHES (CONT’D)
                        They are real.

           A miniature tin soldier, LIEUTENANT HOTSPUR, dressed in full 
           British regalia, pushes his way to Patches' side.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Wot, wot? Children in the North 
                        Pole?

           Hotspur stabs a tiny sword into one of Juniper's boots, and 
           Juniper gasps in pain.
                                 JUNIPER
                        What the frost!!

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Egad! It is a child!

                                 JUNIPER
                        I'm an elf!

           Georgy picks Hotspur up by the scruff of his coat.

                                 GEORGY
                        Maybe do not pick fight if you are 
                        one inch tall.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        A giant too, eh?! No matter, I can 
                        take the lot of you!

           Hotspur swings his dukes at Georgy as the "giant" sets him 
           down on top of a building.

                                 PATCHES
                        Hotspur, calm down! The first 
                        people to ever come here and you 
                        want to frighten them off!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Where exactly is here?

           The toys part to let a model train come chugging into the 
           town center with a familiar figure riding on top. 

                                 JACK
                        This is the home of the forgotten, 
                        the abandoned, and the lost. 
                        Welcome, one and all. Welcome to 
                        Toy Town.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Oh terrific, the talking head in 
                        the box is back.

           Jack hops off the train and bows before them.

                                 JACK
                        My sincerest of apologies for our 
                        former meeting, master elf. For 
                        some reason, popping out of my box 
                        always seems to frighten rather 
                        than entertain.
                             (frowning)
                        A most curious design flaw...
           Hotspur jumps off the building and scampers over to Jack's 
           side, with Patches following after him.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Careful, sir, they've brought a 
                        giant with them!

                                 JACK
                        Yes, thank you, Hotspur. At ease.

                                 PATCHES
                        There's a child in Toy Town, Jack! 
                        A real, live child! I can't believe 
                        it! 
                             (whispering)
                        Does my hair look okay?

                                 JACK
                        It looks splendid, Patches.

           Patches beams, and Jack addresses the group.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        We invite all of you to stay here 
                        as long as you like. Humble though 
                        our town may be, we hope it can 
                        serve as a refuge for all those who 
                        find themselves lost.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Thank you, Mr... Box, sir, that's 
                        very kind. But we really can't be 
                        staying long.

                                 PATCHES
                        You mean you want to leave already? 
                        But you've only just arrived!

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Yes, why on earth would anyone want 
                        to go traipsing off into the 
                        freezing cold at this hour?

                                 JUNIPER
                        That's what I said.

                                 SOPHIA
                        We're on a mission. We need to get 
                        back outside so we can find Santa 
                        Claus.

           A hush settles over the toys. They stare at the children in 
           disbelief. 
                                 JACK
                        Santa Claus... is alive?

                          SOPHIA
                                                          JUNIPER
           Yes, he is!
                                               Well...

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (glaring at Juniper)
                        He is, and we're going to find him!

                                 GEORGY
                        Say, Georgy have great idea! You 
                        come with us. More members for 
                        expedition. We find Santa together! 
                        Maybe find Snowman even!

           The toys exchange worried glances.

                                 PATCHES
                        You want us to go out there?

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Conditions seem most unfavorable.

                                 JACK
                        I'm afraid there's no place for us 
                        in the North Pole. In truth, it 
                        hasn't wanted us toys for a very 
                        long time...

           The toys clear a space in the town to reveal a wall of ice on 
           which is mounted a triptych of Lite Brites, Etch A Sketches, 
           and Magna Doodles.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        You see, long ago, we were brand 
                        new toys, ready to be given away to 
                        happy, waiting children.

           As Jack speaks, the Lite Brites burst into multi-color life 
           and we see Santa's Workshop, where row after row of toys are 
           being carried to Santa's Sleigh by happy, diligent elves.

                                 JACK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We were loaded onto the sleigh and 
                        flown into the air.

           Now the Etch A Sketches come to life, dozens of little knobs 
           spinning and turning to collectively animate the next scene:

           An elf places the finished Jack-in-the-Box in Santa's sack, 
           where thousands of other presents are already waiting. The 
           sack is tied close, sealing the toys inside.
                                 JACK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        For one glorious night, we thought 
                        we were on our way to the homes of 
                        children. But then...

           The final wall of Magna Doodles portray Jack as he slides out 
           of the sack, a blissful grin on his face, until he realizes 
           he's not being put under a cozy tree.

           He's in midair, in the cold dark night, hurtling toward a 
           black abyss.

                                 JACK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Came the darkness...

           Jack smashes down into the cave, tearing a gash across his 
           painted face.

                                 JACK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And the ice.

           All at once, the three walls of drawing toys go blank.

           At the foot of the triptych, Jack now stands at the same spot 
           onto which he fell, beneath the shaft of light from which the 
           toys first came.

                                 JACK
                        All we wanted was to be gifts for 
                        Christmas, but none of us were 
                        deemed worthy for the task. And so 
                        we were discarded.

                                 PATCHES
                        Thrown away.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Declared unfit for duty.

                                 JACK
                        And we've dwelt down here ever 
                        since... the Lost Toys of the North 
                        Pole. The toys not good enough for 
                        Christmas.

           Sophia looks out over the shanty town, where hundreds of 
           eyes--plastic, button, bead, and glass--all stare sadly back 
           at her.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You don't understand... You weren't 
                        thrown away because you weren't 
                        good enough.
           Juniper steps forward now. There's a new fire in his eyes, a 
           real anger we've never seen from him before.

                                 JUNIPER
                        You were thrown away because the 
                        elves didn't need toys anymore once 
                        they took over the North Pole. 
                        You're here because of the 
                        Rebellion. Because of an elf named 
                        Bucklebee.

           The crowd of toys gasps and begins talking amongst 
           themselves. This is earth-shattering news.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Can this be?! A vile insurrection?!

                                 PATCHES
                        All these years in the dark for 
                        nothing?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Believe me, kids would love to play 
                        with you. All of you! Please, come 
                        with us. Help us save the North 
                        Pole! Help us save Christmas!

           The toys look to their leader, eyes full of hope and fear.

                                 JACK
                        Yes, perhaps you're right... 
                        Perhaps we could...

           Jack stops talking. Snow is falling onto his wooden head from 
           the shaft of light above.

           We tilt up slowly, following the snow, to a network of cracks 
           spreading across the ceiling accompanied by a steady tapping 
           sound.

           A small piece of ice breaks off the ceiling and comes falling 
           to the ground, narrowly missing Jack. 

           A crow's head with a glaring red eye pokes through and stares 
           down at them.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        Tsk, tsk, tsk!

           INT. BUCKLEBEE'S LAIR - NIGHT

           Bucklebee peers down at the toys and children through the 
           snow globe in his lair.
                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Look who's found some toys to play 
                        with!

           INT. TOY SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        Mind if I play too?

           Red Eye squawks and hundreds of crows pour through the 
           opening in the ceiling and into the cavern.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Run!

           The crows dive-bomb the shanty town like they're planes from 
           the Blitzkrieg, ripping apart buildings and throwing toys 
           into the air. 

           The toys have never faced anything like this before, and the 
           birds utterly overwhelm them: tearing and clawing away at the 
           toys with razor-sharp talons and beaks.

           A black bird descends on Patches, pulling at her yarn hair.

                                 PATCHES
                        Let go of me!

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Unhand her, you foul fowl!

           Another crow easily picks up Hotspur in its beak.

           Juniper races to their defense with Georgy following close 
           after.

           The elf swings his staff at the crow, causing it to spit out 
           Hotspur and fly away, while Georgy kicks aside the crow 
           attacking Patches.

           By the wall of drawing toys, Sophia searches desperately for 
           a means of escape.

                                 SOPHIA
                        We've got to get out of here! 

           A familiar jingling cuts through the battle. 

           Clover has yoked himself to the sleigh, and the silver bells 
           ring with his every step as he races toward her. 

           The reindeer pulls up right beside Sophia, skidding to a 
           halt. She hops in the sleigh.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Clover, are you sure you know how 
                        to--

           Clover takes off at a gallop, and the sleigh SHOOTS off 
           impossibly fast, barreling through legions of crows. 

           At the other end of the cave, Juniper and Georgy are fighting 
           tooth and nail against the horde of crows. 

           Georgy grabs one by the wing and tosses it to Juniper, who 
           clubs the crow with his staff.

           As staff meets bird, something strange happens: the crow 
           disintegrates in an explosion of soot.

           Juniper looks down at a crow-like imprint left on the ice 
           floor, centered around a nub of coal.

                                 GEORGY
                        Juniper! Look out!

           Juniper looks up as a flock of crows races toward him.

           Across the cave, Clover and Sophia are moving fast toward 
           Georgy, who's desperately trying to fight his way through a 
           torrent of black wings and talons swirling around Juniper.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Come on, come on!

           Clover's legs pump furiously and the sleigh careens up onto 
           the cave wall, going straight over the desperate, clawing 
           crows.

           Just as Juniper and Georgy are about to be mobbed by a mass 
           of black talons, Clover drifts back to the ground, knocking 
           the birds aside.

           Clover gives Juniper his smuggest look and stamps a hoof on 
           the ground. The message is clear: get in.

           Georgy and Juniper don't need to be told twice. 

           Juniper climbs into the back of the sleigh, and Georgy starts 
           pushing it from behind like a shopping cart.

           On the other side of the cave, Jack flips a switch on the 
           Wall of Lite Brites, Etch a Sketches, and Magna Doodles, and 
           they part to reveal the opening to a tunnel.

                                 JACK
                        Quickly! In here!
           Red Eye and the other crows dive-bomb the sleigh from the air 
           as it zips toward the tunnel, with Patches and Hotspur 
           cheering them on as they race by.

           Right as they pass through the open doors, Jack yells after 
           them:

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Go! I'll hold them off!

           Jack extends himself and loops his springy torso through the 
           handles of the door, locking it shut with his own body.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Jack!

           As Bucklebee's enraged screaming echoes through the cave, the 
           crows swarm down and Jack disappears under the dark wings. 

                                 GEORGY
                        Stalactites!

           Georgy points up at giant icicles beginning to fall from the 
           tunnel roof as the whole cave shakes from the impact of the 
           crows.

                                 JUNIPER
                             (yelling as they rush 
                              forward)
                        Those are icicleeees!

           Clover is moving so fast that his hooves leave the ground. 

           With ice shattering down all around them, everyone screams as 
           the sleigh soars toward the light.

           EXT. SNOWY CLEARING - NIGHT

           Just outside Yulewood Forest, the sleigh bursts through the 
           ice, throws the group forward into a snowbank, and smashes to 
           pieces on the ground.

           Clover's head pops out of the snow and he yips with joy. He 
           runs circles around a dazed Georgy. 

                                 GEORGY
                        Yes, yes... Good work, little 
                        reindeer.

           As everyone picks themselves up, snow slides over the hole 
           they came from, sealing the toys back in their shanty town 
           once again.
                                 JUNIPER
                        I can't believe Bucklebee just left 
                        them there... All the elves' hard 
                        work, forgotten in the ice...

           Sophia puts a hand on Juniper's shoulder.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Don't worry. Once we find Santa, 
                        he'll come back for them. Santa 
                        will make everything right.

           Juniper leads Sophia, Georgy, and Clover away from the hole. 
           Together, they approach the edge of the forest.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Thanks, by the way. For not leaving 
                        me behind back there.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Well, I couldn't just let the crows 
                        get you, could I?

           In the snow behind them, a black beak emerges, followed by a 
           glaring red eye.

           MONTAGE: JOURNEY TO YULEWOOD FOREST

           -The gang moves on from the snowbank to a series of icy peaks 
           poking out of the ground.

           -Georgy gasps as he spies a tuft of brown fur caught in the 
           ice. He holds the fur up for inspection, squinting at it and 
           sniffing it. Juniper taps Georgy on the shoulder and points 
           ahead of them to where Clover is enthusiastically scratching 
           his body against a rock.

           -Clover finds a nook hidden in the ice. He pokes his head 
           inside, only to leap back as a snowy owl comes hooting out. 
           He stares up in astonishment as the bird takes off into the 
           night sky.

           -The group approaches a frozen lake and carefully makes their 
           way out onto the slippery ice.

           -Georgy stomps carefully across the surface while Clover 
           skitters on on all fours, barely able to stay upright.

           -Sophia has both arms out, trying to keep her balance, but 
           slips. Juniper's staff darts out and keeps her from hitting 
           the ice.
           -Juniper takes the rope out of his bag and ties himself, 
           Sophia, and Clover to Georgy, whose heavy bulk drags them 
           safely along behind him.

           -The gang makes it to the other side of the lake, where 
           Yulewood Forest awaits.

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. YULEWOOD FOREST - NIGHT

           Sophia and Juniper walk through the trees while in the 
           background, Clover prances around Georgy who's belting out 
           Christmas carols.

                                 GEORGY
                             (singing)
                        Jingle bells! Bucklebee smells! 
                        Juniper lays the egg!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Do you think they'll be okay 
                        wandering off on their own?

                                 GEORGY
                             (singing)
                        Georgy find Abominable Snowman and 
                        take him home to cave, hey!

                                 JUNIPER
                        I'm pretty sure we'll notice if 
                        they go too far.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Fair enough.
                             (beat)
                        Do you think it'll be much further?

                                 JUNIPER
                        I don't know... Yulewood Forest is 
                        pretty big. This is already the 
                        farthest from the mountains I've 
                        ever been.

           Juniper notices Sophia looking worried.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you know what? Let's take a 
                        break.

                                 SOPHIA
                        A break? Now? Are you sure?
                                 JUNIPER
                        Yeah, come on. Santa's been missing 
                        for longer than you've been alive. 
                        He can wait a little longer. Help 
                        me find some firewood.

           Juniper begins gathering up sticks.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Uh, okay, what should I do?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Start looking for pine needles, the 
                        browner the better. We can use them 
                        for kindling.

           Sophia starts scouring the snow for pine needles. They're not 
           hard to find as Yulewood Forest plays home to thousands of 
           evergreen trees, some as large as redwoods.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You know, these woods are pretty 
                        amazing. I don't think I've ever 
                        seen so many Christmas trees in my 
                        life! I mean, look at this one!

           She points at a perfect little Douglas fir tree.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Can't you just picture it all 
                        decked out in lights and tinsel?

           Juniper looks at the tree and seems genuinely enthralled by 
           what it might look like decorated.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Lights and tinsel...

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yeah, my family tried to do popcorn 
                        strings one year but my brothers 
                        just ended up eating all the 
                        popcorn.

           Juniper turns away so that Sophia can't see the longing on 
           his face as he asks:

                                 JUNIPER
                        What else does your family do for 
                        Christmas?
                                 SOPHIA
                        Well, let's see. This year we spent 
                        six hours in traffic on the way to 
                        Grandma's house and then somehow 
                        still managed to get lost once we 
                        finally found her neighborhood. 
                        Then my dad ordered me to carry 
                        suitcases while my brothers lounged 
                        around doing nothing. Then my 
                        sister insulted me to my face and 
                        ate the cookies she knew I was 
                        saving for Santa. And then, to top 
                        it all off, my mom sent me to my 
                        room and told me to apologize.

           Sophia gathers her pine needles and brings them over to 
           Juniper, who has a quizzical look on his face.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Another perfect Christmas with my 
                        family.

                                 JUNIPER
                        You were saving cookies for Santa? 
                        Why?

           Now it's Sophia's turn to look quizzical.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Well, you know, it's a tradition. 
                        Santa's supposed to eat them when 
                        he comes down the chimney. 

                                 JUNIPER
                        Why would Santa come down the 
                        chimney?

                                 SOPHIA
                        To bring people toys, of course!

           Possibly to avoid Sophia staring at him in disbelief, Juniper 
           bends down to assemble the wood for the fire.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Juniper... How do you know so 
                        little about Christmas? Not just 
                        cookies, but presents and even 
                        Santa?

           Juniper sprinkles the pine needles over the wood.

                                 JUNIPER
                        I know bits and pieces from the old 
                        world.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        The stuff that Bucklebee kept 
                        around, at least. I always liked 
                        hearing about Christmas in the old 
                        days, but no one was ever there to 
                        give me the full story. The other 
                        elves were taken when I just a kid. 
                        I've been on my own ever since.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Juniper... I'm sorry. That's 
                        terrible.

           Juniper strikes two stones together, trying to get a spark 
           going.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Ah, well, I have Georgy and Clover 
                        now, so it's not too bad. Apart 
                        from all the Snowman conspiracies 
                        and the fur shedding.

           Juniper clinks the stones together again and a spark catches 
           on the wood.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Finally!

           Just as Juniper starts blowing on the fire, Clover and Georgy 
           burst back into the clearing, kicking snow all over the place 
           and extinguishing the flames in an instant.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, come on!

                                 GEORGY
                        You won't believe what we find! Out 
                        in the woods! Santa's Cottage!

           EXT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           In a clearing in the woods, the gang stands before a cottage 
           made of gingerbread and candy. Smoke trails from a graham 
           cracker chimney and a thick layer of icing clings to the 
           roof.

           They stand a safe distance from the cottage, trying to peer 
           inside. The windows are made from glossy sugar crystal, and 
           it's impossible to see through them.

                                 SOPHIA
                        All right, here we go...

           She strides forward but Juniper yanks her back.
                                 JUNIPER
                        What are you, crazy?! Don’t you 
                        know who lives in gingerbread 
                        houses?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Um, the Gingerbread Man?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Witches. Witches who eat people.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Juniper, don't be an idiot. There 
                        aren't any witches out here.

           The cottage door creaks open of its own accord.

                                 GEORGY
                             (shuddering)
                        Baba Yaga.
                             (to Sophia)
                        You sure Claus lives in there?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I don't see any other magic candy 
                        houses around here. Come on, guys, 
                        let's go.

           She takes a few steps forward and Clover follows. They both 
           stop when they realize Juniper and Georgy haven't budged.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Aren't you coming?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Yeah, I think we'll be fine out 
                        here. Give a yell when you've found 
                        Santa. Or, you know, when you're 
                        being eaten by a witch.

           Sophia rolls her eyes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Fine. You two freeze out here in 
                        the snow while Clover and I go meet 
                        Santa Claus.

           She turns back to the cottage and heads inside with Clover.

           From the woods nearby, a gnarled hand wraps itself around a 
           tree and we hear a low, beastly growl.
           INT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           The cottage is decidedly witchier on the inside than the out.

           A cauldron bubbles in the fireplace, a broom lurks in the 
           corner, and the oven burns with a menacing glow.

           Sophia gulps, steels herself, and walks through the house.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Hello? Santa? Are you there?

           Resting on a shelf by the fire are a series of ancient books. 
           Sophia peers at the bindings but they're too dusty to read.

           Behind her, Clover nudges open a closet door and barks for 
           Sophia's attention.

           EXT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           Back outside, Juniper is gripping his staff and looking tense 
           while Georgy breaks a gumdrop off the house and takes a bite.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Hey spit that out! You don't know 
                        if it's safe!

                                 GEORGY
                             (swallows)
                        Tastes safe to me.

           Something from the trees growls and Juniper spins around.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Who's there?

           INT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           Inside, Sophia and Clover stare into the closet at a bright 
           red outfit hidden behind the other clothes.

           They push old coats, jackets, and boots aside to find the 
           unmistakable suit of Santa.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Santa's suit!

           Sophia’s eyes light up with excitement as they pull the 
           outfit down from the closet, only to discover...

           It isn’t a suit at all.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        A dress?! What's Santa doing with a 
                        dress?
                             (realizing)
                        Unless...

           There's a yell outside. Sophia and Clover turn to see through 
           the window behind them that two monstrous white shapes are 
           leaping toward Juniper and Georgy.

           They drop the dress and sprint out the door...

           EXT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Juniper is on the ground, yelling as a white wolf licks his 
           face, while an overjoyed Georgy pets another.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Get it off! Get it off me!

                                 GEORGY
                        Bah! Don't be baby! 
                             (scratching wolf's ears)
                        Is good puppy, yes? Good puppy!

                                 MRS. CLAUS (O.S.)
                        So you're the trespassers, eh?

           They all turn and find themselves face-to-face with an old 
           woman holding a blunderbuss.

           This is MRS. CLAUS, dressed not in red but in a thick fur 
           coat and leather boots, a heavy load of lumber bound in a 
           wooden sleigh behind her.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        I thought you might have been those 
                        elves I caught snooping around last 
                        week.

           She straps the blunderbuss around her shoulder.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Sent them packing quick enough.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You're the missing Claus?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        I don't know about "Missing" but I 
                        am Mrs.
                             (beat)
                        Claus, that is.
           The two wolves come over to her and she scratches them behind 
           the ears.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        I suppose I should have my pups rip 
                        you all to pieces for 
                        trespassing... But on account of it 
                        being Christmas Eve and all, I'm 
                        willing to let bygones be bygones. 
                        Come on. You four look half-starved 
                        to death. Come inside and get 
                        something to eat.

           Mrs. Claus whistles and her wolves follow her as she heads 
           into the cottage.

           There's a distinct limp to her walk, as if she has to drag 
           one of her legs along behind her.

                                 JUNIPER
                        I told you it wouldn't be Santa.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Well it wasn't a witch either, was 
                        it?

                                 MRS. CLAUS (O.S.)
                        Come on, don't let the heat out!

           INT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           Inside the hut, everyone is seated at a table by the fire. 
           Mugs of steaming milk warm their hands and they munch their 
           way through a plate of fresh cookies.

           Clover and the two wolves are curled up together in front of 
           a bowl of milk by the fireplace.

           Mrs. Claus is searching a bookshelf by the mantel, running a 
           finger along the spines as she searches for one volume in 
           particular.

                                 SOPHIA
                        So how long have you been married 
                        to Santa Claus, if you don't mind 
                        my asking?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Oh goodness, as long as there's 
                        been a Christmas, I suppose.

           She thumps an old book onto the table and cracks open an 
           ancient photo album.
                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Ah, here, see for yourself.

           She points to a picture of herself and her husband, a man who 
           is clearly Santa Claus but an older, almost Victorian 
           incarnation: a tall, thin man with a holly-and-ivy crown and 
           a familiar wooden staff. More a FATHER CHRISTMAS than a Santa 
           Claus.

                                 SOPHIA
                        That's Santa?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Look how young we were! I was quite 
                        a looker back in the day, you know.

           In the photo, Mr. and Mrs. Claus look at least 70 years old.

           Mrs. Claus turns the page to a new picture of Santa hammering 
           a sleigh. He's lost the holly-and-ivy crown and is now 
           wearing a reddish hood.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        And here he was, hard at work on 
                        the sleigh in July.

                                 GEORGY
                        He work on sleigh in July?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        I know! Such a procrastinator.

           They turn the page again and see a chubbier, older Santa 
           standing beside a reindeer whose nose is glowing red on a 
           foggy night.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Our first Christmas with Rudolph. 
                        Ugh, the fog that year was 
                        unbearable!

           They turn the page once again to a picture of Santa with his 
           arm around Mrs. Claus as they stand in front of dozens of 
           happy elves. 

           Sophia squints at the elf standing beside Santa. He's wearing 
           a smart green suit and a holly-and-ivy pin.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Is that...?!

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Bucklebee, yes.
           Mrs. Claus closes the photo album.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        That was a long time ago. Things 
                        are very different now.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What happened?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Bucklebee and my husband quarreled 
                        the night of the Rebellion. Over 
                        what I never found out. One minute 
                        Bucklebee was storming out of 
                        Santa's office. And the next... He 
                        betrayed us. The North Pole had 
                        never seen anything like it. Elves 
                        turning against elves, crows 
                        attacking the reindeer. We did what 
                        we could to fight back, but 
                        Bucklebee overwhelmed us. Santa 
                        told me to leave the city, that 
                        he'd send word as soon as it was 
                        safe. I waited here as long as I 
                        could, but as the hours turned to 
                        days and still no one came, I knew 
                        something had gone terribly wrong.
                             (beat)
                        I fought, of course, to get back 
                        in, to free my husband, but...

           Mrs. Claus takes her foot out of her boot, revealing it's 
           been turned completely to porcelain.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Bucklebee's magic proved too 
                        strong.

           Everyone stares in horror as Mrs. Claus returns her frozen 
           foot to her boot.

           She points out the window to where the golden bauble of the 
           North Pole peeks out above the forest.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                             (pointing)
                        There. They keep him locked up in 
                        the top of the North Pole. Only 
                        Santa's staff can unlock the door, 
                        and Bucklebee never sets it down.

           The golden bauble shimmers above a dark, gray landscape. 
           Sophia stares at it, her eyes bright with determination.
                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Without that staff, I'm afraid my 
                        husband is as good as lost to me.

           Mrs. Claus wipes tears from her eyes.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry... You shouldn't have to 
                        hear this. The ramblings of a sad 
                        old woman.

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, Mrs. Claus, let us help you. 
                        Isn't there any way back into the 
                        city? A way we could get to Santa?

           Mrs. Claus stares at Sophia, incredulous.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        My dear girl, haven't you heard 
                        what I've said? Don't you realize 
                        how dangerous it is out there?

           Sophia kneels down and takes Mrs. Claus by the hand.

                                 SOPHIA
                        We're not going to leave Santa in 
                        Bucklebee's hands. Right, guys?

           Over her shoulder, Clover barks his agreement and Georgy 
           shrugs.

                                 GEORGY
                        Sure, in for penny, in for pound.

           Unnoticed by Sophia, Juniper doesn't say anything at all.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Please, can't you help us?

           Sophia squeezes Mrs. Claus's hand, and Mrs. Claus, after a 
           long moment of consideration, finally answers.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        The city lies just outside Yulewood 
                        Forest. There's a sewer grate at 
                        the bottom of the wall. It's how I 
                        got out at the Rebellion. Follow 
                        the pipe straight through, and it 
                        will lead you into the city.

           Sophia looks deep into Mrs. Claus's eyes.
                                 SOPHIA
                        Thank you.

           She stands up, reinvigorated with purpose.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Guys, get your packs ready. We're 
                        going to save Santa.

           Georgy stands up too, nearly knocking the table over in the 
           process. He bows awkwardly to Mrs. Claus as Clover trots over 
           to his side.

                                 GEORGY
                        Thank you. For milk and cookies. 
                             (hesitates)
                        Georgy apologize he thought you 
                        were witch.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Dasvidaniya, Georgy. 
                             (cracks a little smile)
                        And who's to say I'm not?

           She's the first person besides Georgy himself to pronounce 
           his name correctly.

           Georgy stares wide-eyed at Mrs. Claus as he backs out the 
           door.

           Clover and the two wolves exchange affectionate nips before 
           Clover bounces out the door after Georgy.

           Mrs. Claus turns to Juniper, who's shouldering his cloak.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        It does my heart good to see an elf 
                        still loyal to Santa after all 
                        these years. I'm sure your family 
                        would be proud.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Maybe. If any of them were left.

           He turns and walks out the door, leaving Mrs. Claus staring 
           after him.

           Sophia, busy gathering her things and oblivious to what 
           Juniper has just said, shoulders her pack.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Thank you so much for everything, 
                        Mrs. Claus.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        We'll do everything we can to get 
                        your husband back. Bucklebee won't 
                        know what hit him.

           Before she can leave, Mrs. Claus puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Sophia, before you go, there's 
                        something you need to hear. 
                        Bucklebee holds great power over 
                        every child whose name appears on 
                        the Naughty List.

                                 SOPHIA
                        The list again! Mrs. Claus, I 
                        shouldn't even be on the list! I--

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        No, Sophia. If you're on the 
                        Naughty List, you're on it for a 
                        reason. And until you've changed, 
                        Bucklebee can still hurt you.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Well what am I supposed to do to 
                        get off?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Only you can figure that out.

           Mrs. Claus leans down and kisses Sophia on the forehead.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        You're a very brave girl, Sophia. 
                        You have my faith in you.

           EXT. COTTAGE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

           Sophia leaves the cottage with a troubled look on her face to 
           find Juniper, Georgy, and Clover waiting for her.

           Georgy and Clover are both looking anxious, and Juniper is 
           facing away from the other two, back to where they came from.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What's wrong?

           Juniper turns around, his expression grim.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Sophia, we shouldn't do this.
                                 SOPHIA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JUNIPER
                        We shouldn't go after Santa. It's 
                        too dangerous.

           She stares at him.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Are you kidding me? We came all 
                        this way and you want to back out 
                        now?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Look, going to Yulewood Forest is 
                        one thing but going to the North 
                        Pole? That's... That's suicide!

                                 SOPHIA
                        So you're saying we should just 
                        give up?

                                 JUNIPER
                        It's not giving up if it's 
                        impossible.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What about all the toys back in the 
                        cave, huh? What happens to them? Or 
                        everyone Bucklebee's frozen and 
                        kidnapped? Or what about me? How am 
                        I supposed to get home?!

                                 JUNIPER
                        You don't... You wouldn't have to 
                        leave.

           Again, Sophia stares at him.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        There's plenty of room in the 
                        mountains and if we keep quiet long 
                        enough, I'm sure we could throw 
                        Bucklebee off your trail.

                                 SOPHIA
                        So that's your plan? We just go 
                        back to doing what you've always 
                        done? Just hide in the mountains 
                        for the rest of our lives?
                                 JUNIPER
                        The mountains are safe! I'm trying 
                        to convince you not to get yourself 
                        killed.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You're trying to convince me to 
                        abandon everyone!

                                 JUNIPER
                             (shouting)
                        You don't know what it's like, 
                        okay?! You have no idea!
                             (beat, then quieter)
                        I can't... I can't watch anyone 
                        else get taken. Not again.

           His words hang in the silent forest. Sophia and Juniper can't 
           meet each other's eyes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I guess this is it then.

           Sophia and Juniper look to Clover and Georgy.

           Clover looks from Sophia to Juniper, then, ears drooping, 
           walks over to Sophia.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Clover, please...

           Georgy approaches Juniper and puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Georgy...

                                 GEORGY
                        Better to die for something than 
                        live for nothing.

           He squeezes Juniper's shoulder then walks to Sophia and 
           Clover.

           The three of them head north. 

           Juniper looks like he wants to call after them, but instead, 
           he too turns around and makes for the mountains. 

           From a tree branch above, Red Eye takes off, flying north.
           EXT. EDGE OF YULEWOOD FOREST - NIGHT

           Sophia, Clover, and Georgy exit the forest and trudge across 
           a stretch of snow toward the vast walls of the City of the 
           North Pole.

           Although the walls are built of ice, years of accumulated 
           soot have turned them completely black. The walls stretch 
           upward for what seems like miles and end in jagged points.

           Sophia spies the sewer grate near the bottom of the wall, 
           just where Mrs. Claus said it would be.

                                 SOPHIA
                        There's the way in. Come on.

           They slide down the slope to the wall and as quietly as 
           possible, Georgy pulls the cover off the pipe. They slip 
           inside, being careful to close the pipe after them.

           INT. SEWER PIPE - NIGHT

           There's a thin stream of liquid trickling at their feet and 
           slick moss growing on the walls.

           As they move further away from the grate, the light from the 
           moon begins to fade, and soon they are in near total 
           darkness.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Hand me the torch and flint, will 
                        you?

           Georgy rummages through the pack and Clover pokes his head in 
           too. Georgy comes up with nothing. Clover pulls out a cord of 
           rope in his mouth.

                                 GEORGY
                        Torch was in Juniper's pack.

           Sophia stares at him for a moment, then at the rope. Then she 
           turns and keeps walking.

                                 SOPHIA
                        That's fine. We're gonna be fine.

           Water drips in the distance, and the sound of draining is 
           audible from up ahead.

           Georgy and Clover walk ahead as Sophia trails behind.

           As she approaches the connecting pipe, a voice stops Sophia 
           in her tracks.
                                 COLLEEN (O.S.)
                        Sophia?

           Sophia freezes and turns to look down the dark, adjoining 
           pipe.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mom?

           INT. CONNECTING SEWER PIPE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sophia takes a step into the pipe. There's an eerie blue 
           light emanating from around the corner.

                                 COLLEEN (O.S.)
                        Sophia, are you there?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mom?!

           Sophia follows the sound of her Mom's voice, moving through 
           the connecting pipe.

                                 GEORGY
                        Sophia, what is it?

           He and Clover turn to find that she's disappeared behind 
           them.

                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                        Sophia!

           INT. SEWER CENTRAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sophia emerges into a central sewer system that opens into 
           multiple separate pipes.

           In the middle of the room, a snow globe is resting on an 
           elevated platform.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mom?

           She stares at the snow globe, confused. It's glowing and 
           swirling with snow.

           She reaches down and picks it up, and as she does, an image 
           of Colleen appears inside. 

                                 COLLEEN (V.O.)
                        Sophia, can you please unbuckle 
                        your sister?
           As Sophia watches, the snow globe begins to play a montage of 
           the night before, showing Sophia exactly how she behaved:

           She rolls her eyes at her mom, she talks back to her dad, she 
           throws a plate at her sister's head, and finally...

           Colleen and Sophia face each other on Sophia's bed.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Would you say you're sorry if I 
                        said I'm sorry too?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I'm not sorry. I wish the plate had 
                        hit her. I wish you and Dad 
                        actually gave a crap. I wish that 
                        for once, everyone would get what 
                        they deserve.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Are you sure about that, Sophia? 
                        Because what you deserve might not 
                        be what you're expecting. 

           The images fade from the snow globe, replaced by a flurry of 
           snow.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Mom...

           Georgy and Clover come running into the room. Sophia looks at 
           them, teary-eyed.

                                 GEORGY
                        What happened?! What is it?!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Everyone was right... I am on the 
                        Naughty List.

           Cackling echoes from the pipe entrances surrounding them. 

           ELVES swarm out of the pipes. One group pulls a leash around 
           Clover's neck while another group attacks Georgy from behind, 
           binds him, and brings him to his knees.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        No!!

           A boot kicks Sophia in the back, and she's sent hurtling down 
           into the foul grime of the sewer.
           Bucklebee steps down from a pipe behind her, with Red Eye 
           perched on his shoulder. The elf leans down and picks up the 
           snow globe.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        What did I tell you, my dear?

           He gives the globe a toss and tucks it in his jacket.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        You're exactly where you belong, 
                        getting exactly what you deserve.

           He twirls his staff, and Sophia backs away from its point.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        But I really should be thanking 
                        you, you know. You've delivered 
                        yourself right to my doorstep! It's 
                        Christmas come early!

           He takes a menacing step towards her, swinging his staff 
           again and narrowly missing Sophia. She's forced back out of 
           the clearing and into one of the pipes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Please! Don't hurt them!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Oh, don't worry, they won't feel a 
                        thing once they're frozen.

           Sophia inches backward, but her hand finds nothing to hold. 
           She looks behind her: the rusty pipe has broken off. It must 
           be a thousand foot fall from here. She's trapped.

           Georgy spies a wheel on the wall with a worn label: "Water 
           Release Valve."

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        It's been a wonderful Christmas 
                        Eve, but I'm afraid you really must 
                        be going now.

           Bucklebee raises his staff. 

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Sophia.

           Before he can bring it down, Clover bites down hard on the 
           Elf holding him. 
           The Elf screeches and drops the leash. Clover head-butts the 
           guards holding Georgy, who launches himself at the wheel on 
           the wall and spins it with a well-aimed shove.

           Water explodes out of all the pipes, knocking everyone to the 
           ground. Bucklebee manages to keep his footing, but the water 
           hits Sophia full on.

           She's swept away by the jet of water, plummeting off the 
           broken pipe and into the darkness.

           EXT. SNOW DRIFT - NIGHT

           On a snow drift that overlooks the Yulewood Forest and the 
           City of the North Pole, Juniper turns at the sound of a 
           distant explosion of water.

           Juniper stares at the North Pole, an anxious expression on 
           his face.

           INT. SEWER PIPE - NIGHT

           The jet stream carries Sophia down, down, down and spits her 
           out into a black pit of water.

           INT. SEWER PIT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sophia bursts up, gasping for air, and swims over to a small 
           incline of rock with a beam of light shining down on it.

           There's a sewer grate above her, but it's far too high for 
           her to climb on her own.

           Nevertheless, wet and shivering, Sophia desperately tries to 
           scale the wall. It's cold and slimy and every time she jumps 
           up, she just falls back to the ground.

           Finally, Sophia sinks down to the floor, wet, crying, and 
           shivering.

                                 SOPHIA
                        This is my fault... This is all my 
                        fault...

           The flood of water finishes draining down, and the pit 
           becomes still and silent once more.

           She curls into a ball, trying to warm herself. In the sewer 
           grate above, the North Pole glimmers in the moonlight. Sophia 
           gazes up at it as she makes a last ditch prayer. 
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Please, I just want to make things 
                        right. Help me get out of here and 
                        I'll do anything. Please... 
                        Please...

           We see a ripple move across the water as Sophia cries. A 
           final wave left over from the downpour ebbs against the 
           shore, carrying something with it.

           An object bumps against Sophia's foot.

           She opens her eyes and looks down. It's the coil of rope from 
           Georgy's pack.

           She looks up in wonder at the North Pole, which almost seems 
           to twinkle in the night.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Sophia takes the rope, and in quick succession, we watch as 
           she tries to latch the rope onto the sewer grate above her 
           once, twice, and finally...

           Sophia grips the rope, gives it a tug, and begins to climb.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Sophia pulls herself up out of the sewer and steps into a 
           dark alley behind a towering building. Carefully, she sneaks 
           over to the corner and stares up at the industrial hell the 
           North Pole has become.

           What should be the jolliest place on earth looks instead like 
           the capital of a dictatorship.

           Factories spew black smoke into the air, turning the red-
           brick buildings gray and the snow into slush and soot.

           On every wall and rooftop, crows perch like surveillance 
           cameras, watching the courtyard below.

           In the center of the city towers the North Pole itself: a 
           giant, candy-cane-striped pole that rises hundreds of feet in 
           the air before being finally topped by a golden bauble.

           Surrounding the Pole is a fifty-foot tall, impenetrable fence 
           of candy canes. Their tops are all sharpened to a point, and 
           a sign on the fence reads “No Trespassing Under Bucklebee’s 
           Orders.”
           A thunderous ROAR erupts from a nearby CHAINED OFF BUILDING, 
           and Sophia flinches back into the alley.

                                 ELF GUARD (O.S.)
                        Come on, prisoners, keep it moving!

           Sophia peaks back around the corner and spots an ELF GUARD 
           leading Georgy and Clover into a gargantuan factory. 

           Clover pauses before a tall, spherical building and sniffs at 
           it, curious.

           The Elf Guard yanks him forward, leading Clover and Georgy to 
           a towering security station in front of the huge factory. 

           From up in the tower comes a STATION GUARD's voice.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        Orders?

                                 ELF GUARD
                        Bucklebee wants to add these two to 
                        his personal ornament collection.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        Is that right? Put 'em to work 
                        while they're waiting! Move along!

           The gates creak open. The Elf Guard shoves Georgy and Clover 
           forward, and the gates slam shut behind them. 

           Sophia watches intently. She's never going to get through 
           dressed like she is.

                                 ELF PATROLMAN (O.S.)
                        What're you doing out here?!

           There's an ELF PATROLMAN standing right behind Sophia. She 
           sizes him up, sees he's exactly her height.

           Sophia points at something above the Patrolman's head.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Oh my god, is that mistletoe?

                                 ELF PATROLMAN
                             (looking up)
                        What?

           Sophia sucker-punches the Patrolman in the gut and he 
           collapses to the ground.
                                 SOPHIA
                             (to herself)
                        Thanks, Caitlin.

           EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT

           Now wearing the awkward-fitting Patrolman's uniform, Sophia 
           approaches the gate to the factory and waves to the station.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        Orders?

                                 SOPHIA
                             (in her best elf voice)
                        Just checking on the prisoners.

           There's a pause.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        Shouldn't you be on patrol?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Uh, I was. But now I'm checking the 
                        prisoners.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        I thought Horace was on prisoner 
                        duty today.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Horace... is out sick today.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        Sick? With what?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Uhh... stomachache. Really bad 
                        stomachache.

                                 STATION GUARD (V.O.)
                        I told him not to drink so much 
                        eggnog! All right, on your way 
                        then.

           The factory gates open and Sophia walks inside.

           INT. FACTORY BOTTOM FLOOR - NIGHT

           Bucklebee's factory is a scene of pure Dickensian misery.
           On the first floor, mine shaft entrances line the walls and 
           from their gaping doors, kids push out mine carts on 
           rotation, bearing fresh loads of coal. The coal is then 
           shoveled into a great, flaming furnace with synchronized 
           precision by an army of soot-covered children.

           On the floors above, hundreds of children work in assembly 
           lines, silently constructing clothes, tools, and weaponry for 
           the elves.

           Each floor is cut away in the middle, leaving an empty space 
           through which a black skeleton of a tree rises all the way to 
           the top of the factory.

           Dangling like ornaments from each of its spindly branches 
           hang the petrified, porcelain victims of Bucklebee’s staff: 
           hundreds and hundreds of ELVES and CHILDREN alike, captured 
           and frozen by Bucklebee ever since the Rebellion.

           At the tree’s very top, like some sort of monstrous Christmas 
           star, a cauldron-like machine sits beneath two glass vats 
           boiling with hot cocoa and green sedative.

           On the wall, a single clock hand races around an enormous 
           clock face.

           Sophia hides behind a pile of coal and watches the Elf Guard 
           lead Georgy and Clover to an empty place by the conveyor 
           belt. 

           The Guard drops a metal cup at Clover's feet and thrusts 
           another into Georgy's hands before walking away.

           Georgy turns to the girl next to him, and we recognize her as 
           the German Girl who Sophia bumped into back on the Christmas 
           Carriage.

                                 GEORGY
                        Psst! Young woman!

           The German Girl doesn't even look up. She just keeps 
           shoveling.

                                 GEORGY (CONT’D)
                        What are we supposed to do with 
                        these?

           The clock hand reaches the top, and a bell rings throughout 
           the factory.

           At the top level of the factory, a FOREMAN ELF leans over a 
           handrail and yells for everyone to hear.
                                 FOREMAN
                        Cups out!

           In unison, all the kids in the factory reach down and hold 
           metal cups out expectantly.

           Georgy jumps in surprise and quickly does the same, and 
           Clover pushes his dish forward.

           The machine at the top of the tree begins to churn. Through 
           the right glass tube flows a velvety, chocolate liquid; 
           through the left, a toxic green drug.

           Both chocolate and poison meet in the cauldron, which is 
           connected to an intricate series of tubes that run throughout 
           the whole factory.

           Nozzles descend from the ceiling and come to a stop directly 
           above each kid's cup.

           The drugged hot cocoa flows through the pipes, and the 
           nozzles all spit a ration into the kids' cups.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        Drink!

           In unison, every single kid raises their cups to their lips 
           and gulps the liquid down.

           They set their cups aside and immediately resume working.

           Georgy and Clover watch in horror. The Elf Guard prods Georgy 
           in the back.

                                 ELF GUARD
                        Drink.

                                 GEORGY
                        Georgy, uh, only drink vodka.

           The Elf Guard grabs Georgy by the beard and pulls him in 
           close.

                                 ELF GUARD
                        You drink...

           He points his baton at the tree covered in petrified 
           children.

                                 ELF GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Or you hang.

           Georgy shudders. He and Clover exchange one last look before 
           they finally drink their cocoa together.  
           When they look up, their eyes have glassed over.

                                 ELF GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Now back to work.

           Georgy starts shoveling in perfect unison with the other 
           kids, as if he's been working in the factory his whole life.

           Clover marches over to the mine carts and begins pushing one 
           down the track.

           The Elf Guard walks away and Sophia sees her chance.

           She carefully runs across the floor of the factory, ducking 
           behind coal piles and conveyor belts as she goes.

           She approaches Georgy and Clover, who don't even look up from 
           their work.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Guys, it's me!

           She takes off her Elf uniform disguise. Neither react.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Guys!

           She grabs Georgy's arm and shakes him, but it's like shaking 
           a giant rag doll. Clover turns his head for a moment and 
           Sophia looks with horror into his white glazed eyes.

           She lets go of Georgy and he turns back to work.

           Sophia looks over and realizes the Elf Guard is making his 
           way back.

           She grabs a shovel and falls into line with the other kids' 
           clockwork movements, acting like just another factory worker.

           The Guard stops for a moment, glances at her, then continues 
           on his route.

           Sophia searches around in despair as the mechanical lifting 
           and slamming of the factory parts almost form a beat.

           She looks up at the clock on the wall, which has reset and is 
           starting to tick back down again. Then she glances up at the 
           cauldron on top of the tree.

           She knows what she has to do. Sophia squeezes Georgy's hand 
           and kisses Clover's muzzle.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        I'll be back, I promise.

           She heads for the tree in the middle of the factory.

           At the base of the tree, Sophia looks up at the dizzying 
           climb she has before her. Nevertheless, she takes a deep 
           breath and begins to make her way up. 

           Branch by branch, Sophia heads towards the top, passing 
           porcelain children and elves frozen in expressions of horror.

           As she gets higher, more of the factory levels come into view 
           and the branches become thinner.

           As Sophia climbs onto a new branch, the petrified face of the 
           Stowaway from the carriage suddenly appears before her.

           Before she can stop herself, Sophia lets out a gasp.

           An ELF GUARD from the nearest factory floor spins around and 
           peers into the tree.

           Sophia freezes in terror, blending right in with the 
           porcelain children around her.

           The Guard shrugs and looks away, and Sophia heaves a sigh of 
           relief before pressing on.

           The clock on the wall ticks louder as Sophia nears the top. 
           Mere seconds remain before the next drink drop. She's running 
           out of time.

           Sophia sees the liquid in the glass tubes starting to bubble 
           and begins to climb even faster.

           As the clock hand reaches the top, the bell rings and Sophia 
           clambers up onto the glass tubes.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Cups out!

           The Foreman looks over and his eyes go wide as he sees Sophia 
           wrestling with the glass vat full of green poison.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey you! Get down!

           Sophia squeals as the Foreman rushes toward her.

           In the factory floors below, all the workers, including 
           Georgy and Clover, robotically hold out their mugs.
           Sophia tugs at the vat but it won't budge.

           Finally, the Foreman grabs her by the foot. Sophia screams 
           but holds tight to the tube.

           As the Foreman yanks her down, his added strength pulls the 
           vat out of its socket, spraying poison all over the Foreman's 
           face.

           He screams, lets go of Sophia, and drops to the ground.

           With no vat to spew poison, fresh cocoa churns down from the 
           machine and the nozzles spray it into every worker's mug.

           Sophia yells at the top of her lungs:

                                 SOPHIA
                        Drink!!

           The workers automatically lift the cups to their lips and 
           gulp the cocoa down.

           When they set their drinks back down again, something has 
           changed. Their eyes are sharp and clear, and they look around 
           as if finally awake. For the first time, drinking the cocoa 
           has actually refreshed them.

           On the bottom floor, Georgy and Clover blink too, looking 
           like themselves again.

           The Elf Guard approaches, baton raised.

                                 ELF GUARD
                        Oy! Back to work!

           The kids don't respond.

                                 ELF GUARD (CONT’D)
                        I said back to work!

           The Guard prods the German Girl in the back.

                                 GERMAN GIRL
                        Achtung!

                                 ELF GUARD
                        What did you...

           The German Girl rises to her full height and towers over the 
           Elf Guard.

                                 ELF GUARD (CONT’D)
                        ...say to me?
           The German Girl shoves the Guard backwards into the conveyor 
           belt, knocking coal to the floor.

           The kids and elves stare in unison. In the same instance, 
           everyone realizes that there are way more kids in the factory 
           than there are elves.

           All at once the kids rise up and charge the guards.

           The factory becomes total chaos as the children take their 
           revenge on their captors. Elves flee from a mass mob of kids.

           We watch as one group sends an elf crashing through a window. 
           Another binds a pair of elves with cords from the assembly 
           line.

           The German Girl is grabbing her former captors and bashing 
           them into each other.

           From the top of the factory, dangling from the cocoa 
           dispenser, Sophia watches as the chaos she's created unfolds 
           below her.

           The cocoa dispenser gives an ominous creak.

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, no, no--

           The machine tears itself free from the ceiling and Sophia 
           screams as she hurtles toward the ground.

           At the last second, right when she's about to hit the floor, 
           two large hands dart out and catch her. 

           Sophia opens her eyes and stares into a familiar face. It's 
           Georgy. 

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Georgy! Clover! You're all right!

           She hugs Georgy and Clover brays and leaps up to lick 
           Sophia's face.

                                 GEORGY
                        Thanks to Sophia! Very smart girl! 
                        You save us both! Save everyone!

           Georgy sets Sophia down.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Come on, we can still save the 
                        North Pole too. We just have to get 
                        to Santa.
           They hear yelling coming from outside and move towards the 
           courtyard.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           In the courtyard, the freed kids have come to a halt.

           Sophia, Georgy, and Clover are pushed forward by the crowd of 
           kids into the front lines as the sound of marching draws 
           near.

           Tight ranks of elves are moving in formation into the 
           courtyard. They're outfitted with red-and-green riot gear, 
           ice shields, and candy-cane batons.

           Crows line the ramparts, watching the kids like vultures.

           As the elves push forward, the kids draw back, until finally, 
           they're trapped with their backs against the factory.

           In unison, the elves stop. The kids shuffle nervously, unsure 
           what's coming next.

           Up on the ramparts, Bucklebee appears in the middle of the 
           crows.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Children, children... I've never 
                        seen so many naughty boys and girls 
                        in my whole life.

           He slowly descends a staircase to the courtyard as the 
           children and elves wait in tense silence.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Spilling your cocoa, breaking your 
                        tools... And now you want to start 
                        a fight? What has gotten into you?

           Bucklebee spies Sophia in the front lines.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Ah, of course. Sophia's back from 
                        the dead yet again. It only takes 
                        one bad egg to ruin the batch.

           The German Girl who first attacked an elf watches in terror 
           as a big Elf Soldier menacingly licks his candy cane baton.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        I must confess, I don't see this 
                        ending well for you, children, I 
                        really don't.
           He taps his chin theatrically.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        From where I'm standing, this ends 
                        one of two ways. One, you all head 
                        back into the nice warm factory, 
                        help yourselves to an extra big cup 
                        of cocoa, and enjoy a lovely, pain-
                        free Christmas. Or two...

           The Elf Army steps forward and the kids all lurch back.

           Bucklebee reaches the foot of the stairs and smiles at the 
           captive children.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        So what’s it going to be? The 
                        cocoa... Or the canes?

                                 JUNIPER (O.S.)
                        Neither.

           Bucklebee turns. Everyone turns.

           Juniper is standing in the courtyard beneath the North Pole, 
           staff in hand, ragged cape flowing majestically in the arctic 
           wind. 

           Amidst the crowd of kids, Sophia, Georgy, and Clover stare in 
           joyful disbelief.

           Bucklebee stares at the young elf too, a little more 
           incredulous.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        I'm sorry, you keep popping up and 
                        I'm a little unclear what your role 
                        in all this is. Who are you again? 
                        Are you even human?

           Juniper glares at Bucklebee.

                                 JUNIPER
                        No, Bucklebee. I am an elf. The 
                        last elf loyal to Santa there is. 
                        You thought you'd wiped us all out, 
                        but I'm here to prove you made a 
                        deadly oversight. My name is 
                        Juniper, and tonight, we're taking 
                        back the North Pole.

           Bucklebee folds his arms, a grin stretching across his face.
           Juniper looks very small compared to the fully outfitted elf 
           battalion he's apparently going to take on.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Oh really? And how, exactly, do you 
                        plan to take on my army?

                                 JUNIPER
                        With one of my own.

           Juniper taps his staff on the sewer grate below him, and 
           there's a deep rumbling from down in the sewers.

           The elf troops glance at one another nervously, unsure of 
           what's coming.

           A jester's head appears in the sewer grate, and a battered 
           but resilient Jack-in-the-Box hops out of the sewers and 
           stands at Juniper's feet.

           The elf troops laugh and Bucklebee's grin widens.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        A toy?

                                 JUNIPER
                        No, Bucklebee. All the toys.

           The sewer grate bursts open as toy airplanes, helicopters, 
           dinosaurs, ballerinas, baby dolls, teddy bears, and every 
           other toy from the cave charges out, led by Patches in a 
           biplane and Hotspur on the back of a miniature stegosaurus.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Chaaaarge!!!

           Before Bucklebee and the elves have time to react, they're 
           swarmed by a huge wave of angry toys.

           The kids need no further invitation.

           The German Girl lets out a war whoop and everyone joins the 
           fray. They rush forward, pelting the elves with snowballs and 
           ramming them with mining equipment.

           Juniper follows the kids and toys into battle, whacking and 
           slamming Bucklebee's elves.

           Hotspur leads plastic army men, knights, dinosaurs, animals, 
           and Indians in an all-out attack against the elves. 

           In the air, Patches heads up a squadron of biplanes in a 
           WWII-style dog fight with the crows, firing tiny bullets and 
           dodging claws and beaks.
           Patches zooms by Hotspur, a crow closing in behind her.

                                 HOTSPUR (CONT’D)
                        You've got a friendly on your tail!

                                 PATCHES
                        Roger that! Coming at ya!

           Patches pulls up hard and sends the plane shooting straight 
           up. She flips the plane and heads right back down to Hotspur, 
           whose stegosaurus rears up and smashes the crow with its 
           spiky tail.

           Bucklebee snarls and fights viciously against this new 
           attack, freezing every toy and child that comes within range 
           of his gnarled staff.

           Amidst the chaos, Juniper spots Sophia, Georgy, and Clover 
           through the battle.

                                 GEORGY
                        Juniper! You came back!

           Clover pounces on Juniper and tries to lick his face. Juniper 
           manages to push Clover aside as Sophia approaches.

                                 SOPHIA
                        What made you change your mind?

                                 JUNIPER
                        I guess I realized I'd rather go 
                        down fighting with you guys than be 
                        stuck by myself in the mountains. 
                        Better to die for something than 
                        live for nothing, right?

           Sophia smiles at Juniper and he smiles back. Georgy claps him 
           on the shoulder.

                                 GEORGY
                        Thank you for vote of confidence. 
                        Very reassuring.

           There's an explosion from nearby as some of the toys topple a 
           tower and everyone jolts back to the situation at hand.

                                 JUNIPER 
                        Okay, so what's the plan? Is there 
                        a plan?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Bucklebee still has the staff so 
                        we've got to get that first.
           Juniper and Georgy exchange a look, and Georgy cracks his 
           knuckles.

                                 GEORGY
                        Leave Bucklebee to us.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Clover and I will try to find a way 
                        up to Santa.

           Clover brays and stamps his feet to get her attention.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        What is it, Clover?

                                 JUNIPER
                        He says he needs to show you 
                        something.

           Clover grabs Sophia's sleeve in his mouth and pulls her away 
           from the battle towards the Pole. 

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        Go! We'll hold them off!

           Juniper and Georgy head back into the battle as Sophia and 
           Clover head the other way.

           In the sky, Red Eye finishes crushing a biplane in its beak 
           and sees Sophia and Clover sprinting away from the 
           battlefield.

           The bird's red eye narrows and it takes off after them.

           EXT. REINDEER STABLES - NIGHT

           Clover leads Sophia to a tall building that looks like a 
           cross between a grain silo and a prison.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Clover, where are we going? What is 
                        this place?

           Clover barks to urge her forward. He clearly knows exactly 
           what's inside. 

           Clover kicks open the doors with his rear legs. Sophia gasps 
           at what's inside and we move from her reaction to...

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Juniper and Georgy fighting back to back in the courtyard. 
           Georgy is grabbing one elf after another and tossing them out 
           of the way, as Juniper dodges attack after attack. Slowly but 
           surely, they're advancing across the battlefield toward 
           Bucklebee.

           A HUGE ELF armed with a particularly sharp-looking candy cane 
           spear sprint towards them. 

                                 JUNIPER
                        Georgy! Snowball!

           Georgy sweeps up a handful of snow and in one fluid motion 
           makes a snowball and tosses it through the air. 

           Juniper expertly whacks the snowball with his staff, line 
           driving it into the big elf's face. 

           From across the courtyard, Bucklebee and an ELF LIEUTENANT 
           are watching Juniper and Georgy tear a path of destruction.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Unleash the one we found in the 
                        cave.

                                 ELF LIEUTENANT
                        But sir!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Do it!!

           A new sound rises above the chaos of the battle: elves 
           pulling open the doors of the CHAINED OFF BUILDING where 
           Sophia heard roaring when she first arrived.

           SOMETHING growls from the darkness. A colossal, clawed foot 
           slams into the snow, shaking the ground beneath it.

           We tilt up from this monstrous foot to white fur so matted 
           with snow, it could very well be made of it. Rows of sharp 
           teeth and lightning blue eyes glow in a massive shaggy head.

           It's the ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN.

           The beast throws its head back and roars into the night sky.

           Georgy hears this and turns. Time slows down. The RUSSIAN 
           ANTHEM starts to play. If Georgy were a cartoon, right now 
           his eyes would be hearts.

           In slow motion, the monster charges and knocks a dozen elves 
           out of his path.

           As everyone runs away from the Snowman, Georgy runs toward 
           it, a huge smile on his face. 
           Georgy sticks two fingers in his mouth and whistles a sharp 
           note that cuts across the battlefield. 

           The Abominable Snowman slows and cocks its head. 

           Monster and man meet in the center of the courtyard. 

           Without breaking eye contact, Georgy picks a fallen beam of 
           wood up off the ground and holds it out.

           The Snowman snaps at it, but Georgy pulls it out of reach and 
           scratches the Snowman under the chin.

           The Snowman lets out a happy groan. He starts to purr and 
           kick his rear leg, then collapses to the ground, tongue 
           lolling out like a dog.

           Georgy gives the Snowman a belly rub as Juniper approaches.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Georgy... Is this--?

                                 GEORGY
                             (the height of smugness)
                        Georgy find Snowman.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (O.S.)
                        Useless idiots!

           Across the courtyard, Juniper sees Bucklebee freezing the 
           Lieutenant with his staff. The two elves make eye contact.

           Juniper charges across the courtyard.

           INT. REINDEER STABLES - NIGHT

           Inside the Stables, Sophia and Clover look up in awe at NINE 
           FULLY GROWN REINDEER locked in cages that are dangling from 
           the ceiling. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        I can't believe it... Santa's 
                        reindeer...

           Sophia begins to climb a ladder up to the nearest reindeer 
           cell, while Clover circles anxiously below.

           As Sophia approaches, the reindeer stomps its hooves and 
           snorts in protest. For some reason, this reindeer is wearing 
           a muzzle. The cage swings dangerously in the air.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Shh, no, it's okay! We're here to 
                        get you to Santa!

           Clover brays from down below, and the reindeer calms down.

           Sophia leans off the ladder and pulls at the cage door.

           Before she can open it, however, a caw cuts through the 
           stables.

           Sophia turns around and sees Red Eye landing on the open 
           window sill.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, not again.

           The bird caws into the night, and moments later, a full 
           murder of crows arrives. Hundreds of birds pour through the 
           windows.

           The crows rush Sophia, pecking and tearing at her with their 
           beaks and talons. 

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           In the courtyard, Juniper rushes Bucklebee with his staff.

           He takes a mighty swing at Bucklebee, but the old elf easily 
           parries Juniper's blow. 

           With one powerful crack of his staff, Bucklebee snaps 
           Juniper's weapon in two.

           Bucklebee plunges his staff forward and Juniper can only 
           dodge the blow by falling over backward, onto his back.

           A grinning Bucklebee approaches as Juniper backs away from 
           the tip of the staff, right into the wall of the factory. 
           He's trapped. 

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        You should have stayed in the 
                        mountains, boy.

           Bucklebee raises the staff just as Juniper spies a row of 
           icicles hanging off the edge of the roof above him.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Didn't your family teach you 
                        anything?
           Bucklebee brings the staff down on Juniper who, at the very 
           last second, moves his head out of the way.

           The force of the blow shakes the building and tears the 
           icicles loose from the roof. They come raining down from 
           above.

           Bucklebee leaps backward as they smash into the snow, and 
           Juniper handily catches an icicle before it hits the ground.

           He stands back up and levels the icicle at Bucklebee like a 
           sword.

                                 JUNIPER
                        They taught me how to fight.

           Enraged, Bucklebee snarls and attacks with new fury. 

           INT. REINDEER STABLES - NIGHT

           Meanwhile, the Stable is a blur of black feathers and talons.

           The reindeer buck wildly in their cells, and Sophia struggles 
           to hold onto the ladder for support as Clover yelps 
           helplessly from the ground.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I can't hold on! There's too many 
                        of them!

           Clover tries jumping into the air but barely makes it off the 
           ground. 

           He tries again but falls painfully to the floor. He looks up 
           at the swarm high above him, just as Red Eye pries Sophia's 
           last fingers off the ladder.

           Sophia screams and tumbles through the air.

           Clover's eyes lock on Sophia falling. He kicks off from the 
           ground and...

           SOARS THROUGH THE AIR.

           Clover bursts through the swarm of crows and catches Sophia 
           on his back.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        Clover! You're flying!

           Clover bats the reindeer cage with his antlers, and the door 
           flings open, releasing the reindeer inside. 
           The reindeer rips its muzzle off and the stable EXPLODES IN 
           RED LIGHT.

           The crows screech, and as the light disappears, Sophia looks 
           around to find all the birds have become smoky piles of ash 
           on the floor.

           Sophia and Clover look up at RUDOLPH as his nose flickers red 
           light and the familiar melody of "Rudolph the Red-Nose 
           Reindeer" plays over the soundtrack.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        No way.

           Red Eye gives a last weak caw as Clover knocks the bird into 
           the wall with his antlers and he disintegrates into soot.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Back on the ground, Juniper and Bucklebee are engaged in a 
           fierce duel.

           Juniper manages to hit Bucklebee's hand, sending him reeling 
           backwards in pain. Juniper lunges forward and gets a grip on 
           the staff.

           Before he can wrench it free, however, Bucklebee kicks sleet 
           into his eyes.

           As Juniper stumbles back, blinded, Bucklebee knocks Juniper's 
           icicle out of his hand, seizes Juniper by the scruff of his 
           coat, and holds the staff high in the air.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        End of the line, boy.

           Bucklebee grins, and so to his surprise does Juniper.

                                 JUNIPER
                        End of yours.

           He points over Bucklebee's shoulder. 

           Bucklebee whirls around to find Sophia, swooping in on 
           Rudolph's back. She neatly plucks the raised staff out of 
           Bucklebee's hand.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        You little brat! I'll wring your 
                        neck!
           Out of nowhere, Clover charges through the air, knocking 
           Juniper from Bucklebee's grip and sending Bucklebee flying 
           into a snowdrift.

           Georgy hurries over to help Juniper up and they both stare in 
           wonder at their little reindeer friend. 

                                 JUNIPER
                        Clover...

                                 GEORGY
                        Bòzhe mòi! He can fly!!

           Bucklebee glares up at Sophia as Juniper, Georgy, and Clover 
           surround him.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Sophia, go! We've got this! Get to 
                        Santa!

           Sophia takes off on Rudolph. Bucklebee snarls and with a wave 
           of his cloak, disappears in a whirlwind of soot.

           EXT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Rudolph lands on the circular walkway surrounding the golden 
           bauble at the top of the Pole.

           Sophia dismounts and approaches the door embedded in the 
           sphere.

           She takes out the staff and slides it into a matching lock. 
           The staff turns easily, like a giant key, and Sophia pushes 
           the door open.

           INT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE - NIGHT

           For the first time since she set foot in the carriage, Sophia 
           is in a place that actually looks festive.

           There’s a roaring fireplace framed by stockings hung with 
           care. A fully decorated Christmas tree glistens in the 
           corner, surrounded by beautifully wrapped gifts.

           A small table sits in front of the fireplace, a plate of 
           half-eaten cookies and a glass of half-drunk milk atop it.

           The sound of gentle snoring emanates from a massive leather 
           chair beside the fire.

           Sophia approaches the chair and discovers a slumbering SANTA 
           CLAUS fast asleep.
           For a moment, she forgets everything that’s going on and 
           she’s a kid again.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Santa?

           Santa wakes up. He looks at her. A smile--that glorious, 
           perfect smile you've seen on countless Christmas decorations 
           all your life, a smile that warms you to the bottom of your 
           heart--spreads across his rosy cheeks.

           Santa sits up and gazes at Sophia with pure love. Tears well 
           up in his eyes.

                                 SANTA
                        Could it be? A child come to see me 
                        after all these long years...

                                 SOPHIA
                        I... I brought you your staff.

           He takes it and stares with wonder.

                                 SANTA
                        You brought this for me?

           Now there are tears in Sophia's eyes too. She nods.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my dear girl.

           He opens his arms and Sophia hugs him.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        I'd almost given up on the outside 
                        world. I thought surely I'd been 
                        forgotten.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I knew you were real. I always knew 
                        it.

           Sophia rests in Santa's arms, feeling finally at peace. 
           Everything she's done has been for this moment.

           Their embrace is cut short by the sound of sneering.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (O.S.)
                        Aww, what a touching scene. 

           Bucklebee is standing in the doorway. Santa steps in front of 
           Sophia, holding up the staff protectively.
                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Santa Claus is giving a big hug to 
                        a little girl! Maybe he'll even ask 
                        her what she wants for Christmas.

                                 SANTA
                        Enough, Bucklebee! Don't take 
                        another step! 

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Or what? You'll "ho ho ho" at me? 
                        Don't be a fool, old man. Your time 
                        is past. The North Pole belongs to 
                        me now.

                                 SOPHIA
                        And look what you've done with it!

           Sophia points out the doorway at the chaos of battle below.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        You drove out the good elves, you 
                        threw away the toys, you kidnapped 
                        children. You've ruined Christmas 
                        for everyone!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Is that right, Sophia? You think 
                        that's my fault?

           Bucklebee glares at Santa.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Why don't I tell her what really 
                        happened all those years ago?

           Bucklebee draws the snow globe from inside his jacket and 
           gives it a violent shake.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Who really ruined Christmas?

           He slams the snow globe down on the table, and an image 
           swirls into focus within the glass...

           INT. BUCKLEBEE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        It wasn't always this way, you 
                        know. I was once Santa's most 
                        trusted adviser. The Official List 
                        Keeper, in fact.
           In a dark office we now recognize as the room from the 
           opening credits, a YOUNG BUCKLEBEE sits at a tiny desk with a 
           quill, a snow globe, and a giant list before him.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My job was to keep careful track of 
                        all the children. Who had been 
                        naughty and who had been nice.

           Bucklebee watches almost hungrily as a scene plays out in the 
           snow globe of a boy shoving his little sister off a swing. 

           Bucklebee cackles and jots a name down on the list.

           A bell rings outside, and Bucklebee jumps up. He grabs the 
           list and runs out the door.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        That was the order of the world. 
                        The good children got presents, and 
                        the bad children got coal.

           Bucklebee hurries off into the courtyard, where elves are 
           gathering for the big night. Gifts are being loaded onto the 
           sleigh from the factory, which at this time is just Santa’s 
           Workshop. 

           One of the toys we see going by is the Jack-in-the-Box, all 
           brand new and freshly painted as he's wound inside his box.

           Bucklebee steps onto a lift at the base of the North Pole and 
           pulls the lever. It takes him up, up, up to the golden sphere 
           where he enters Santa’s office.

           INT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE - NIGHT

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        Or at least, so I thought.

           Bucklebee finds Santa's office empty so he sets the Naughty 
           List down on Santa's desk.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That Christmas Eve, I made a 
                        terrible discovery.

           The weight of the list knocks open the bottom drawer of the 
           desk, and curious, Bucklebee opens it.
           Inside he finds... Last year's Naughty List, covered in dust 
           and cobwebs. 

           His eyes widen. His hands start to tremble. He keeps 
           searching the drawer.

           Beneath that list is the one from the year before that, and 
           the one from the year before that and so on and so on...

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Santa had stopped using the Naughty 
                        List.

           Santa enters his office and finds Bucklebee in anguish, 
           clutching years' worth of unused Naughty Lists.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, he tried to explain himself! 
                        Bad children didn't deserve coal, 
                        he said. Such practices were 
                        outdated and cruel. Everyone should 
                        have gifts on Christmas.

           A furious Bucklebee rips off the holly-and-ivy brooch, throws 
           it to the ground, and storms out of Santa's office, brushing 
           past an astonished Mrs. Claus.

           INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        I couldn't believe it.

           Bucklebee bursts into Santa's Workshop, where the upper 
           floors are empty as the toys have already been loaded onto 
           the sleigh.

           The only elves left are on the bottom floor, shoveling piles 
           of coal they believe are intended for naughty children.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Those children behaved like brats 
                        all year and he just wanted to 
                        forgive them?!

           The elves surround Bucklebee as he holds up the Naughty List 
           and shakes his head. They stare in disbelief.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was an outrage! An abomination!

           Bucklebee stares, burning with anger, at the mountain of 
           coal. He clutches the Naughty List in a tight fist.
                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We'd worked all year to deliver 
                        that coal. 

           The elves grab the bellows and begin pumping it up and down, 
           and the furnace glows red.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And with or without Santa's 
                        permission...

           Two of the elves start to pound a crude, bird-like shape out 
           of a pile of black coal in front of Bucklebee. 

           Bucklebee reaches into the furnace and plucks out a burning 
           chip of coal. He whispers a spell, then places the chip into 
           the hole where the bird's eye should be.

           Once the chip is in place, the coal bird comes to life. It 
           shakes off the soot and ash and caws up at its creator.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We were going to use it.

           Bucklebee grins down at a crow with a glowing red eye as the 
           flames of the furnace rise behind him.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Outside the factory, elves, reindeer, and Mrs. Claus alike 
           are gathered in the courtyard as Santa steps into his sleigh 
           loaded with the sack of toys.

           The festivities come to a halt at the sound of distant 
           cawing.

           Everyone looks in confusion at the factory, where a black 
           cloud has risen over the roof.

           Thousands of crows screech at the assembled crowd and drop 
           flaming chunks of coal from their talons.

           Elves scream. The reindeer start bucking at their reins.

           The courtyard devolves into total chaos as the birds attack. 
           The good elves and the reindeer are totally unprepared for a 
           fight, and the birds easily terrorize them.

           A crow swoops down on Mrs. Claus and Santa smashes it into 
           coal dust with his staff. When the black dust clears, he 
           looks across the battlefield through the chaos and stares in 
           disbelief at his right-hand man turned traitor.
           Bucklebee grins at his former master, leading a group of 
           other elves from the factory, all dressed to the hilt in 
           mining gear.

           HOURS LATER

           Bucklebee and the bad elves wander the smoking ruins of the 
           North Pole. 

           The sleigh is charred black. The factory has been ransacked. 
           A cackling murder of crows has picked up the sack of toys and 
           is carrying it off into the distance.

           Bucklebee steps onto the lift at the base of the Pole.

           INT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE - NIGHT

           The door is already open, and Santa is inside, slumped over 
           in his chair, clutching a wounded arm.

           Santa moves to grab the staff, but a pair of black talons 
           grab it first. 

           With a flutter of dark wings, Red Eye drops the staff in his 
           creator's waiting hand.

           Bucklebee closes the door on Santa, sealing him inside.

           EXT. NORTH POLE BASE - NIGHT

           We watch as Bucklebee, staff in hand, descends the lift.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.)
                        And just like that, the reign of 
                        Santa Claus was over.        

           Bucklebee sets fire to the lift behind him so that no one can 
           reach Santa ever again.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The reign of Bucklebee had begun.

           As the bad elves cheer, Bucklebee holds the Naughty List high 
           in the air.

           END FLASHBACK.
           INT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE - NIGHT

           In the present day, Bucklebee glares at Santa, who's still 
           standing protectively in front of Sophia.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You started the Rebellion... over 
                        the Naughty List?

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Weren't you listening?! What about 
                        him?! All those children 
                        misbehaving and he didn't want to 
                        do a thing about it! I worked so 
                        hard to make that list, and I was 
                        the one who got punished?! It 
                        wasn't fair!

           Santa hesitates, then approaches Bucklebee carefully.

                                 SANTA
                        Bucklebee, I'm sorry if you felt I 
                        was throwing away your hard work, 
                        but Christmas should be a time for 
                        forgiveness, not punishment. 

           Santa, staff still in hand, steps closer to Bucklebee.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Please, Bucklebee... after all 
                        these years, can't you find it in 
                        your heart to forgive?

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Forgive? You want me to forgive?

           Regret plays across Bucklebee’s face. He seems to be 
           genuinely struggling with the idea.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        I... I'm sorry, Santa...

           For a moment, he looks as if he means it.

           Santa lowers the staff, just the tiniest bit.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        But it's much too late for that.

           Bucklebee grabs the staff and twists it into Santa’s chest.

           Sophia screams as Santa transforms into an ornament before 
           her eyes. 
           She turns and runs for her life out the door.

           EXT. NORTH POLE BAUBLE WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Bucklebee emerges onto the walkway. By now, he looks much 
           different than the jolly elf who first invited Sophia aboard 
           the Christmas Carriage.

           His ears are long and twisted. His teeth and claws are sharp. 
           His eyes are as black as his soul.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Come now, Sophia! Don't you want 
                        your Christmas present?

           There’s a ladder carved into the side of the globe, and 
           Sophia sprints up it as fast as she can.

           She hears Bucklebee cackling and looks down to see him 
           swiping at her leg.

           He’s not even using the ladder, he’s just climbing up the 
           globe with his claws.

           She pulls her leg away from his nails and scrambles up the 
           rest of the ladder.

           Now she’s at the very top of the North Pole itself, totally 
           exposed to the howling blizzard winds.

           Bucklebee crawls to the top of the globe and begins slowly 
           advancing towards her.

                                 SOPHIA
                        You don't have to do this!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        Oh but I do, Sophia! It's a wicked 
                        world full of wicked people. 
                        Remember? You said it yourself. 
                        Everyone should get exactly what 
                        they deserve! And it's my job to 
                        punish them!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes, sometimes people deserve to be 
                        punished but unless you learn to 
                        forgive them...

           Sophia realizes what she's saying.
                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        You end up on the Naughty List.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        The time for forgiveness is over.

           He levels his staff at her. There's nowhere left to run.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Your friends are going to spend the 
                        rest of their lives watching you 
                        dangle from the top of my tree.

           Sophia closes her eyes and whispers the words her family will 
           never get to hear...

                                 SOPHIA
                        I’m sorry.

           Bucklebee thrusts the staff forward... 

           And it's pushed back by a protective magical dome that forms 
           around Sophia.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        What?!

           Sophia opens her eyes.

           Bucklebee pokes the staff forward, hitting the shield again. 
           With each push of the staff, the force field pushes it right 
           back.

                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        Why isn't it working?!

           Realization creeps into Bucklebee’s face and he reaches into 
           his jacket and pulls out the Naughty List.

           At the very bottom, “Sophia” is vanishing letter by letter.

           They both watch in astonishment as her name disappears 
           entirely.

           Bucklebee slowly turns the list over, and written on the 
           other side in huge golden letters is the title:

           "The Nice List."

           Here, the name “Sophia” is slowly writing itself beneath 
           hundreds of other names.
                                 BUCKLEBEE (CONT’D)
                        No! No, this is impossible!

                                 SOPHIA
                        You can't do a thing to kids on the 
                        Nice List, can you?

           Bucklebee growls and lunges at Sophia with his bare hands, 
           only to singe them on the dome surrounding her.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                             (recoiling in pain)
                        Gahhh!!

                                 JUNIPER (O.S.)
                        Give it up, Bucklebee.

           Bucklebee and Sophia turn around to find the whole gang 
           approaching on the backs of reindeer.

           Juniper, Georgy, Clover, Jack, and other toys, kids, and 
           reindeer land on the roof.

           He backs up, snarling at them, gripping his staff.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        The war is over. You're finished.

           Bucklebee takes a step back toward the edge of the globe, 
           staff raised.

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        You think I can be overthrown by a 
                        bunch of toys and children?

           He takes another step back.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Bucklebee, stop!

                                 BUCKLEBEE
                        I'll never give in! The North Pole 
                        is mine! Do you hear me?! Mine!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Look out!

           Bucklebee takes one step back too far. He slips on the icy 
           curve of the globe and topples backwards.

           He hastily tries to use his staff to balance himself. 
           Instead, he trips and lands directly on its point.
           As everyone watches in horror, Bucklebee realizes what he’s 
           done too late.

           The magic is already taking effect. Porcelain spreads across 
           his body.

           Bucklebee lets out one final scream as his frozen form 
           plunges over the edge of the Pole and plummets down, down, 
           down.

           Everyone can only watch as the ornament that was once 
           Bucklebee smashes into the spiked candy cane fence encircling 
           the base of the Pole.

           His body explodes into soot, and the black powder whooshes 
           away into the night, until finally, the North Pole is silent 
           once more.

           EXT. NORTH POLE BASE - NIGHT

           As the group reaches the ground on the backs of reindeer,  
           they find Mrs. Claus disembarking a sleigh pulled by her two  
           pet wolves.

           She smiles at the victorious heroes and picks the fallen 
           staff up off the ground.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Bucklebee's magic has finally been 
                        broken.

           She taps the staff to her porcelain leg, which heals itself 
           back to normal.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        It is time to set the North Pole in 
                        order.

           EXT. NORTH POLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Later, in the courtyard below, a procession of kids has begun 
           carefully removing the frozen ornaments from the tree in the 
           factory and bringing them to Mrs. Claus. 

           We watch as Mrs. Claus raises the staff and touches it to the 
           Stowaway's petrified form. The porcelain cracks like an 
           eggshell and falls from the Stowaway's skin. The boy blinks 
           as he comes unfrozen and looks around in terror.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        It's all right. You're safe now.
           The German Girl lays a blanket around the Stowaway's 
           shoulders and leads him to a bonfire in the courtyard, where 
           Patches, Hotspur, Jack, and the other toys are waiting.

           Sophia smiles and waves at the Stowaway as he goes by.

           Juniper catches Sophia's eye and they smile at one another.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Well, kid... you journeyed across 
                        the North Pole, you overthrew an 
                        evil tyrant, and most impressive of 
                        all, you got me out of the 
                        mountains. Not half bad.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It's been a long night.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Tell me about it.

           Clover comes flying out of the air and performs a series of 
           twirls around Juniper and Sophia.

                                 JUNIPER (CONT’D)
                        And speaking of impressive, I never 
                        thought I'd finally see the day 
                        when this one learned to fly.

           Sophia laughs as Clover licks her face, this time from above.

                                 SOPHIA
                        I think your problem now will be 
                        getting him back to the ground.

           Before anyone has a chance to say more, Georgy pulls everyone 
           into a big group hug. 

                                 GEORGY
                        My friends, we did it!

                                 JUNIPER
                        You're crushing my back!

                                 SOPHIA
                        Yes, Georgy. We saved Santa.

                                 GEORGY
                        What? Oh, that. No, Georgy meant we 
                        find Snowman! Clover, meet new big 
                        brother!
           The Abominable Snowman thuds down next to the group, smiling 
           like an oversized puppy. His breath hits them like a gust of 
           wind.

                                 JUNIPER
                        There's no way he's staying with 
                        us.

           Mrs. Claus approaches and smiles at the victorious group.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Against all odds, you have saved 
                        the North Pole and you have saved 
                        my husband. I thank you with all my 
                        heart.

                                 SANTA (O.S.)
                        And I with mine.

           Everyone turns to see a now unfrozen Santa approaching, 
           finally reunited with his staff.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Oh, you don't know how good it is 
                        to hear your voice again, dear.

                                 SANTA.
                        Not nearly as good as hearing 
                        yours, my little sugar plum.

           He wraps her up in a hug and gives her an Eskimo kiss. 

           Santa and Mrs. Claus start giggling together as Sophia, 
           Clover, Georgy, and Juniper awkwardly stand there. 

           Finally, Mrs. Claus clears her throat and Santa turns back to 
           address to the group.

                                 SANTA
                        Yes, but as I was saying, thanks to 
                        all of you, the North Pole is free 
                        once again. Your bravery this night 
                        will never be forgotten.

           Sophia beams, then looks around in embarrassment at the 
           smoking wreck the North Pole has become in the wake of the 
           battle.

                                 SOPHIA
                        We're, uh, sorry about the mess.

                                 SANTA
                        Returning the North Pole to its 
                        former glory will be no easy task.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        I'll need someone to help me. A 
                        right-hand man who can take on the 
                        challenge of banding together 
                        elves, toys, and reindeer alike... 
                        Or should I say, a right-hand elf.

           Santa gives Juniper a meaningful look.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Me? You want me?

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        There's no elf better for the job.

           Out of thin air, Santa plucks a holly-and-ivy brooch, the 
           same one Bucklebee cast aside so many years ago, and offers 
           it to Juniper. 

                                 JUNIPER
                        Sir, I... I don’t know if I can 
                        accept this.

                                 SANTA
                        That is exactly why I want you to 
                        have it.
                             (confidentially)
                        I can guarantee you'll do a better 
                        job than the last elf who had it.

           Juniper stares at the brooch. Finally, he nods and Santa pins 
           it to his chest.

           The newly unfrozen elves all let out a cheer and Juniper 
           looks up in amazement to see the family he's never known 
           rushing toward him.

           Elves surround Juniper, cheering his name, clapping him on 
           the back, and shaking his hand. Juniper looks just about the 
           happiest we've ever seen him.

           Sophia grins at the sight and Santa winks at her.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Now... let's see if we can't do 
                        something about this mess.

           Santa brings his staff to the ground and a golden wave of 
           light sweeps over the whole city.

           The soot and sludge vanish, replaced by fresh snow and green 
           wreaths. 

           Black char peels off the Christmas Carriage, revealing the 
           red sleigh of Santa underneath.
           Rudolph and the other reindeer swoop down from the sky and 
           encircle their master.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Children, toys, elves, and 
                        reindeer! Thanks to all of you, the 
                        North Pole will celebrate Christmas 
                        once again!

           The kids and elves all cheer, the toys flip and twirl, and 
           the reindeer prance and kick in celebration.

           MONTAGE: RETURN FROM THE NORTH POLE

           -Elves help the kids board Santa's sleigh, finally ready to 
           go home.

           -Sophia gives Georgy a last hug goodbye.

           -Sophia and Clover nuzzle up together one last time.

           -Sophia and Juniper hug. He gives her a playful punch on the 
           arm.

           -Santa climbs onto the sleigh, reaches into his sack, and 
           tosses Georgy a new pair of boots.

           -Clover watches wide-eyed as the reindeer step into the reins 
           of the sleigh. Rudolph gives Clover a nod and beckons him 
           forward. Clover takes his place beside Rudolph at the front 
           of the sleigh. 

           -As the sleigh takes off, Mrs. Claus, Juniper, and Georgy (on 
           the shoulders of the Abominable Snowman) wave them goodbye.

           -The sleigh soars over the night sky, racing away from the 
           North Pole. 

           -We see the sleigh pulling up in front of the roof window of 
           a picturesque house.

           -The Stowaway steps out, carrying the Jack-in-the-Box with 
           him. The Stowaway and Jack wave goodbye as the sleigh takes 
           off again.

           -The sleigh pulls onto the top of an apartment complex in 
           Berlin, and the German Girl runs out with Patches tucked 
           under her arm and Hotspur in the palm of her hand. They all 
           wave as the sleigh takes off.

           -We watch this process happen again and again as the night 
           sky grows lighter: The sleigh returns the kids from the North 
           Pole home and pairs them off with an abandoned toy.
           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE ROOF - DAWN

           Santa's sleigh pulls to a final stop on the roof of Sophia's 
           Grandma's House. 

           Sophia climbs out of the sleigh and back onto the roof.

           As she steps back through her window, she turns to Santa. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        I'm never going to forget you.

                                 SANTA
                        How could you? I'll be back every 
                        Christmas!

           He gives her a wink, snaps the reins, and takes off.

           Sophia watches as the sleigh heads for the rising sun.

                                 SANTA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

                                                           FADE TO WHITE.

                                 TOMMY (V.O.)
                        Sophia! Sophia, wake up!

                                                                 FADE IN:

           INT. SOPHIA'S ROOM - DAY

           Back home, Sophia wakes up in her tiny bed in the room in 
           Grandma’s house. Someone is standing over her, shaking her 
           awake. It’s her little brother Tommy.

                                 TOMMY
                        Sophia, wake up already! It’s 
                        Christmas!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sophia follows Tommy downstairs to the Christmas tree, which 
           is now half-buried in gifts.

           Her siblings are digging through the presents while her 
           parents and Grandma sit on the couch, sipping mugs of coffee.
                                 RICHARD
                        Well aren't you the sleepy head?

                                 GRANDMA
                        Must have had a long night.

           Matt rips open a box and finds a huge speaker system inside.

                                 MATT
                        Awesome! New subwoofers! I'm never 
                        gonna use my headphones again!

                                 COLLEEN
                        Oh, that's great, honey!
                             (whispering to Richard)
                        You saved the receipt, right?

           Baby Sarah is covered in wrapping paper with a bow on her 
           head while a giggling Caitlin takes pictures on her phone. 

           Caitlin looks up at Sophia as she plops down on a nearby 
           couch.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Hey, about last night... sorry I 
                        threw a plate at your head.

                                 CAITLIN
                        It's cool, I was acting like a 
                        jerk. Sorry about the cookies.

                                 SOPHIA
                        It's okay. 
                             (motioning to the 
                              presents)
                        I think Santa came without them.

           Colleen overhears her two daughters making up and smiles.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Sophia? Don't you want to open any 
                        of your presents? I think this 
                        one's for you.

           Colleen hands a small box to Sophia, who stares at it, 
           intrigued.

           She tugs the box open and finds inside... 

           A snow globe.

           Sophia picks it up and gives it a shake. The snow swirls 
           inside, revealing for an instant the City of the North Pole.
                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                             (to Grandma)
                        A snow globe? We didn’t get her 
                        that, did you get her that?

                                 GRANDMA
                        Don't look at me. I got everyone 
                        cold hard cash. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It must've been lying around when I 
                        wrapped the presents.

           Sophia smiles up at her elders.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Maybe Santa brought it.

           Colleen smiles back.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Maybe so, sweetie.

           Sophia stands up and wraps her mom in a tight hug. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Merry Christmas, Mom.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Merry Christmas, Sophia.

           Behind this touching scene, Tommy starts swinging a roll of 
           wrapping paper like a sword.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        Tommy, please don't do that!

                                 TOMMY
                        En garde!

           He hits Caitlin in the back on the head.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Ow! Watch it, Tommy!

                                 RICHARD
                        Guys, come on, no fighting on 
                        Christmas.

           Matt cranks up the volume on his new sub-woofers and starts 
           blasting music.
                                 COLLEEN
                        Matt, please. How about some 
                        Christmas music instead?

           Matt reluctantly changes the channel to Christmas music.

           Sophia settles back against the couch, the snow globe still 
           swirling with snow on her lap.

           EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - DAY

           We pan out from the Christmas tree...

           To the cozy little house covered in fresh snow...

           To the rustic wooden mailbox on which is perched...

           A black crow.

           It turns toward us, caws, and flies off.

                                                                FADE OUT.
