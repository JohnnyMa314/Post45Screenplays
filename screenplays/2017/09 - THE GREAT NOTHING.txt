           ... as we go through several TOMBSTONES. Framed photographs. 
           Flowers.

           EPITAPHS. Some commonplace:

           -’Beloved father and husband.’

           -’Wonderful friend, caring wife.’

           Others unusual:

           -’It’s cold down here.’

           -’Never did quite learn how to play Wonderwall.’

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           A young girl threads through the tombs.

           Stops on a particular gravestone. Drops her backpack on the 
           grass.

                                 MELISSA MORGAN

                                  1975 -- 2016

           Empty all around. Windy. Overcast. The prelude to a storm.

           This is JUNE MORGAN. She is thirteen. When she speaks, it’s 
           in the casual tone usually reserved for the living:

                                 JUNE
                        Sorry I’m late, ma. Mrs. Simpson 
                        held me back for another lecture.

           She sits on the grass, her back against the stone. Fishes 
           into her backpack, produces a TEST PAPER. Shows it to the 
           tomb as if it could see it.

                                 JUNE
                        Last assignment. Another C. Minus. 
                        Yeah, I know. Sorry. But let’s face 
                        it, you’re not really in a position 
                        to ground me. Hehe. ‘Ground’ me. 
                        Get it?

           A beat.
                                 JUNE
                        How’ve you been? I’ve been kinda
                        shitty. Heather’s being a bitch 
                        again. Even more than usual. Like, 
                        I feel like she’s an eye-roll and a 
                        smirk away from actually barking. 
                        Someone should neuter her, see if 
                        that helps. Dad’s all right. Well, 
                        no. Not really. He looks like crap 
                        and he’s still sleeping in the 
                        guest room.
                           (beat)
                        Taylor Swift released a new single.

           June pulls a breath, looks up to the sky.

                                 JUNE
                        You know I had a dream about you 
                        last night? Remember Erica Staten? 
                        The girl who was held back twice? 
                        And now everyone calls her dinosaur 
                        girl ‘cause she’s taller than 
                        everyone in her class?

           June turns her face to the stone here and there, as if to 
           catch her mother’s reaction in her name and date of death.

                                 JUNE
                        So, I dreamed I was held back -- 
                        which might actually happen, by the 
                        way, but whatever, you’re dead, you 
                        don’t mind -- anyway, and I was 
                        really scared to tell you. But when 
                        I did you just smiled and you said 
                        ‘You should be happy. Seventh grade 
                        is the best grade ever, and you’re 
                        lucky to do it again.’ And then the 
                        next day it was the end of the year 
                        again, and then I failed again, and 
                        I was held back again. And this 
                        kept happening, every new day was 
                        the end of the year and I’d fail, 
                        again and again until I was a real 
                        old lady, still in the seventh 
                        grade. And I kept crying and 
                        telling you how sorry I was, but 
                        you just kept saying ‘you should be 
                        happy, you should be happy, you 
                        should be happy’.

           As she finishes, our TITLE CARD fades in and out, brief and 
           subtle:

                              The Great Nothing.
           June rests her head against her mother’s death year. Eyes up 
           to the gray sky.

           The first drops of rain pluck against her face. She doesn’t 
           mind.

                                 JUNE
                        And then I woke up.

           Closes her eyes.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        “Loneliness in the face of death is 
                        the defining trait of humankind.”

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           The MAN’S VOICE belongs to COOPER, 50s, elbow-patches-jacket 
           professor.

           Behind him, in chalk: 

            POST-MODERN NIHILISM: A STUDY ON DAN HOPKINS’ ‘THE GREAT 
            NOTHING’

           Cooper reads on from a book: The Great Nothing.

                                 COOPER
                        “We alone are expected to live with 
                        the notion of mortality,” Hopkins 
                        goes on, in Chapter two, “Is it 
                        fair that we should carry this 
                        burden? Doesn’t it feel cruel from 
                        the part of the universe that we’re 
                        wired to acknowledge that we exist, 
                        but not to understand the nature of 
                        what ‘existing’ means? To 
                        understand death, but never conquer 
                        it?”

           He looks up to the class. Undergrads. Full classroom.

                                 COOPER
                        It just gets more depressing from 
                        here.

           Sparse chuckles.

                                 COOPER
                        How many of you read the book prior 
                        to this class?
           About a third of the class raises their hands. Cooper picks 
           one. A YOUNG GIRL.

                                 COOPER
                        Pink jacket. Thoughts?

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I thought it was... sad. But very 
                        honest. As a nihilist philosopher, 
                        I feel like Hopkins --

                                 COOPER
                        You would call Hopkins a nihilist?

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Well, it says so on the board, 
                        so...

           Chuckles. Cooper looks back and smiles.

           We focus on a particular student. Back row. A man. A lot 
           older than the rest. Early forties, but his beard looks twice 
           as old.

           He is not laughing.

           Unkempt. Bum-like. Bags under his eyes. Bag also under his 
           chair, bottle-shaped.

           Back to Cooper:

                                 COOPER
                        Hopkins’ work does usually fall 
                        under the umbrella of nihilism, 
                        among other schools of thought. But 
                        there’s also a message of hope in 
                        his book, that I think is not 
                        present in other nihilists’ works. 
                        Wouldn’t you say so?

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Not from the passage you just read.

           More chuckles.

                                 COOPER
                        The Great Nothing is bleak at 
                        times, and very dark. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COOPER (CONT'D)
                        But as we read on throughout the 
                        quarter, I think you’ll see that, 
                        while Hopkins’ theory does seem 
                        pessimistic at first glance, the 
                        message in The Great Nothing is 
                        that, despite the randomness of 
                        existence, there’s joy and meaning 
                        to be found in life.

           The class considers this. The BUM in the back row speaks:

                                 BUM
                        I disagree.

           It’s mostly to himself, but Cooper hears it.

                                 COOPER
                        Excuse me?

                                 BUM
                        I disagree. There’s no joy in 
                        randomness, I think the book makes 
                        that very clear. It’s a theory of 
                        despair.

                                 COOPER
                        What is your name?

                                 BUM
                        Daniel.

           Cooper runs his eyes through a ROLL CALL list.

                                 COOPER
                        Daniel... Daniel...

                                 BUM
                        I’m not there, I’m auditing.

           Cooper looks up.

                                 COOPER
                        Okay. Well, I like your point of 
                        view, Daniel. And I’d be interested 
                        to hear more about it as the class 
                        progresses, but right now let’s 
                        stick to the most accepted 
                        interpretation of --

                                 BUM
                        It’s not a point of view.

                                 COOPER
                        Excuse me?
                                 BUM
                        It’s not a point of view. My 
                        disagreeing with you. I’m right and 
                        you’re wrong. There’s no point of 
                        view.

           After a beat:

                                 COOPER
                           (dismissive)
                        Uh-huh. We’ll come back to that, 
                        okay?
                           (to the class)
                        So, the second Chapter establishes -
                        -

           INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

           Students flood off the classroom and stop in little chat 
           groups by the water fountain.

           The BUM goes on his way, backpack dangling from his quasi-
           rags. Alone.

           He is stopped by the door. A student. The Young Woman from 
           class.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Excuse me.

           She has the book -- The Great Nothing -- in her hands. The 
           acknowledgements page. And a pen.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Would you?
                           (whispering)
                        I recognized you from the back 
                        cover picture. Didn’t wanna make a 
                        fuss.

           That’s how we find out: the bum is no bum at all. He’s DAN 
           HOPKINS, and he wrote that book.

           Dan’s eyes stop on the BACK COVER PICTURE for a beat. He’s 
           young there. Beardless. Smiling. It’s barely the same man.

           He signs the book and returns it.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Thanks!

           Dan steps out into the night.
           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Quiet. Carpet, stains, messy. Single man’s place no doubt 
           about it. Bad even for that standard.

           The door comes open to Dan. He stops by the untouched PILE OF 
           MAIL:

           A lot of past due bills. A stack of copies of THE GREAT 
           NOTHING. On top of it, a post-it: 

           ‘Fan-mail, autograph requests. Please sign (or not)’ and the 
           stamp from a literary agency.

           Dan pushes the pile off the edge directly into a trash bin. 

           Throws himself on the couch. Laptop. E-mail:

           -MIT Guest Lecture Invitation pending.

           -Interview for Philosophy Now?

           -Your Book Changed my Life. Please Read.

           All deleted, click, click, click.

           Stops on the most recent one:

           -Thought you’d want to see her.

           The mouse hovers over it. A beat.

           Click.

           It’s an ultrasound picture. A baby. Final months of 
           gestation. We stay on it for a beat. Then... 

           Click. Deleted.

           Dan heads for the fridge and grabs a beer. Back to the couch. 
           Pushes the laptop away. Lights a cigarette. Pulls a ZIPLOC
           BAG from his pocket. White powder inside. Heroin.

           He pours it over a spoon, the back caked black from past 
           burns.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           Dan drools on the couch. Knock, knock, knock on the door 
           wakes him up. 

           The word ‘hangover’ doesn’t even begin to cover it.
           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan opens the front door to CRUSTY, 14, big 1980s hacker 
           glasses, button-up shirt, mild Aspergers.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Professor.

                                 DAN
                        I said ‘noon’, Crusty. You woke me.

                                 CRUSTY
                        It’s four o’clock, professor.

           Crusty pulls out a brand new ZIPLOC OF HEROIN from his 
           pocket. Business as usual.

           Dan extends his hand. Then stops. Hesitates. Chooses honesty:

                                 DAN
                        I’m short. Is that okay?

           Crusty pauses for a second, then turns around to leave.

                                 DAN
                        Crusty.

           Turns back.

                                 DAN
                        Come on.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I’m sorry, professor.

                                 DAN
                        Please.

                                 CRUSTY
                        You are a well-established academia 
                        writer, professor. And a scholar.

                                 DAN
                        Book money isn’t mine to give away. 
                        Teaching money only comes in when 
                        I’m teaching. Which I’m not. You 
                        know my story, Crusty, come on. I 
                        didn’t even pay my electric bill 
                        this month.

           Crusty just stares.

                                 DAN
                        Help a brother out.
                                 CRUSTY
                        You should go back to teaching. Or 
                        write a new book.

                                 DAN
                        You know I can’t, Crusty. Come on. 
                        Just one.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I sympathize with your situation, 
                        professor. Nothingness haunts 
                        being. I’d want to be on narcotics 
                        all the time too, if I were you. 

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        So...?

                                 CRUSTY
                        I can’t. I’m sorry, professor.

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                           (deadpan)
                        You suck, Crusty.

           Crusty fishes in his backpack and gives Dan a copy of an old 
           book: Kierkegaard’s Sickness Unto Death.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Thank you for the Kierkegaard.

                                 DAN
                        Right. How’d you like it?

                                 CRUSTY
                        Very enlightening. And then my dad 
                        found it.

           Crusty turns his face, showing Dan a black eye.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I have learned that I should be 
                        focusing on ‘gettin sum focken
                        pussy’ instead of spending my time 
                        reading these ‘faggotry manuals’.

                                 DAN
                        Shit. I’m sorry, Crusty.
                                 CRUSTY
                        It’s quite all right, professor. 
                        Good luck with the financial 
                        crisis.

           He turns without saying goodbye. Dan watches him go.

                                 DAN
                        Thanks, Crusty.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Couch. Cigarette. Beer. 

           Dan half-watches some bullshit on TV, drunken eyes. 

           With a CLACK, the light dies out. TV shuts off. Darkness. 
           That ever-present hum of electricity dims away to a full 
           silence.

           Dan sighs. Stews in the dark.

           EXT. PARK -- MORNING

           A small CITY PARK in front of Dan’s apartment building.

           We find Dan in front of a DEAD TREE, eyes up to the crooked, 
           swirling branches. Sunlight straining through.

           Kids and families around, laughter, distant happy hollers. 
           Dan sticks out like a tumor in the green.

           A GIRL passes him by, smoking a CIGARETTE.

                                 DAN
                        Hey, can I bum one?

           She pauses. Hesitates. Dan’s a homeless man in her eyes.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll buy it off you.

           He opens his wallet. No bills. Counts pennies.

                                 DAN
                        Hang on, I think I have --

                                 GIRL
                        Here.

           The girl gives him her lit cigarette, eager to get away.
           Dan turns back to the tree, now smoking. Sighs a puff of 
           gray. Watches the birds on the branches.

           Someone steps in front of him, glues a FLYER to the tree 
           trunk, keeps on their way.

           The flyer reads: “Private Tutor -- Math ($50 hourly)” and a 
           phone number.

           Something dawns on Dan.

           INT. COLLEGE HALLWAY -- MORNING

           A hand staples a BLACK AND WHITE FLYER to a bulletin board:

                               PRIVATE TUTOR

                             Philosophy, Pol-Sci

                    (Non-fiction Pulitzer Prize Winner)

                              (Flexible Hours)

           ... along with a photograph of Dan that looks like it was 
           taken on a DUI arrest.

           We’re in the hallway of a college campus building. Dan’s 
           putting up the flyers.

           The SCHOOL OFFICIAL notices.

                                 OFFICIAL
                        Sir. Sir. You’re not allowed to put

                                 DAN
                        Yes I am.

                        No.

                        I audit.

                        I used to work here.

           The official stops, unconvinced.

                                 DAN
                        I was head of Philosophy.

           Obviously not buying this.

                                 DAN
                        I have a Pulitzer prize for a book 
                        I wrote while heading this 
                        university’s Philosophy Department.

                        you don’t come.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Dan!?

           BILL MORGAN -- 40s, as professor-looking as a professor can 
           get -- stops by the two:

                                 DAN
                        Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Oh my God!

                           (to Bill)
                        Do you know this man, professor 
                        Morgan?

                                 BILL
                        Do I know this... yes, I know this 
                        man! This man was the youngest head 
                        of Philosophy of this university 
                        not three years ago! This is Dan 
                        Hopkins!

           The official looks from Bill to Dan, speechless.

                                 DAN
                           (to Official)
                        Ask him about the Pulitzer. Go on.

           An awkward beat.

           LATER

           Bill and Dan walk down the hallway together.
                                 BILL
                        It’s been...

                                 DAN
                        Two years.

                                 BILL
                        That’s right. You look -- good.

           Of course he doesn’t.

                                 BILL
                        I mean, we all thought you were --

           A beat.

                                 BILL
                        How are you? Are you still -- 

           Bill stops, uncomfortable. Dan sighs, stops too.

                                 DAN
                        Terminal, yes. Metastasized. Lungs, 
                        liver, kidneys. Thank you for 
                        asking.

                                 BILL
                        Oh. And. I. How long --

                                 DAN
                        Months. Maybe less.

                                 BILL
                        And chemo? Treatme --

                                 DAN
                        It would buy me weeks. Bad weeks.

                                 BILL
                        Shit, Dan...

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        We don’t have to talk about it.

           Dan resumes the walk, stopping here and there to staple a 
           flyer to a bulletin board. Bill follows -- still processing 
           the information:

                                 BILL
                        You... you’re tutoring?
                                 DAN
                        Just for heroin money. It’s not 
                        long term.
                           (thinks about it)
                        I suppose nothing I do is long term 
                        now.

           Dan gives Bill a couple of flyers.

                                 DAN
                        If you know any dumb grad students. 
                        Or undergrad, I’ll take what I can.

           Bill stops again, Dan turns back. Awkward silence.

                                 DAN
                        I can still make small talk, Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Right. Right.

           But he doesn’t say anything else. Can’t get over the cancer 
           elephant in the room. Dan eye-rolls. Takes the lead:

                                 DAN
                        How’s Melissa?

           Bill snaps out of his loss for words at the name. 

                                 BILL
                        Oh, shit. You haven’t heard.

           Beat.

                                 BILL
                        There was a car accident. 
                        Melissa...
                           (long beat)
                        ... well, she -- passed.

           Bill says it like it hurts to say it.

                                 DAN
                           (emotionless)
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 BILL
                        Yeah. Yeah, June took it hard. 
                        Well, we both did. I was actually 
                        on my way to the photo lab right 
                        now. I found some negatives Melissa 
                        never got around to developing and 
                        I thought... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        maybe it’s something worth 
                        publishing, you know? Like in a 
                        posthumous collection?

                                 DAN
                        Right.

           A beat in silence.

                                 BILL
                        You wanna come with me? See the 
                        pictures?

           He pulls from his pocket and shows Dan a couple of FILM 
           ROLLS.

                                 DAN
                        Am I in any of them?

           A long, awkward beat.

                                 BILL
                        Huh... I don’t think --

                                 DAN
                        That was a joke, Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Oh!

           Bill laughs. It’s awkward.

           Dan hands out a couple more flyers.

                                 DAN
                        Give those to your students, will 
                        you? Good seeing you, Bill. Shame 
                        about the death.

           Dan walks away.

           Sunset behind the branches of the DEAD TREE in the park.

           Dan watches it from his window, leaned against the sill. 

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           On TV, a Youtube video: Dan being interviewed.
           If we can call that Dan. No beard. Well built. Smiling. 
           Groomed hair. A different, pre-cancer, pre-misery Dan.

           Watching it, real life Dan is slumped on the couch like a 
           ragdoll, high as kites.

           Onscreen:

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        And it doesn’t bother you? The 
                        thought that someday we’ll all ‘die 
                        alone under a godless sky’, like 
                        you put it in your book? Isn’t that 
                        a depressing way to see the world?

                                 DAN
                        Well, you can’t choose to believe 
                        in something, can you? You either 
                        do or you don’t. And when it comes 
                        to life after death... well, I 
                        don’t. So to me death is the end 
                        and that’s that. Yeah, it’s 
                        horrible, but what can I do? 
                        Except... I don’t know, hope I 
                        don’t die for a very long time.

           TV Dan is confident and handsome and all smiles and charm. 

           Real Dan drools on his beard from the heroin.

           Back on TV:

                                 DAN
                        Humans revolt against 
                        meaninglessness, it’s our nature. 
                        And with good cause, too. It’s... 
                        insulting. That we live to die. 
                        That we get to know that we die as 
                        we live.
                           (beat)
                        It’s almost degrading.

           Dan passes out.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK

           A DOODLE

           ... of a HAND SPROUTING OUT OF A GRAVE, zombie-like. The 
           pencil tip scratches back and forth inside the contours of 
           the TOMBSTONE, painting it black.
           It stops. Then the pencil slips, a single line snaking out of 
           the drawing’s frame, down until it slips from the paper 
           itself.

           We’re in a:

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Full room. Seventh grade. MRS. SIMPSON is the teacher, and 
           her happiness borders on annoying:

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        -- you will all be picking your 
                        topic for the end of year 
                        assignment next class, and it will
                        be random and no trades. Are you 
                        excited!? I know I am! In the 
                        meantime, I have your grades for 
                        last week’s test.

           She goes through the classroom delivering tests. Stops on a 
           hooded figure. On the desk, the DOODLE we just saw.

           The figure scored a D.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June...

           No reaction.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June?

           Nothing.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June.

           Nothing.

           Mrs. Simpson pulls the hood. June, our cemetery girl. Eyes 
           closed. Sleeping.

           Mrs. Simpson pulls the buds from her ear (loud MEGADETH or 
           something equality trash-metalish).

                                 JUNE
                        Uh!? What!?

           Mrs. Simpson nods at her grade.

                                 JUNE
                        Uh? Oh. Oh. 
                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Do you wanna talk about this?

           June grabs her test.

                                 JUNE
                        Is there any chance it will affect 
                        my grade?

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        No.

                                 JUNE
                        Then I’ll pass.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        No you won’t. Not if you don’t 
                        improve your grades.

           Nothing from June.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Look at me, June.

           She does.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        I know you’re going through a rough 
                        patch in your family life, but I 
                        can’t sweep subpar work under the 
                        rug for you the whole year. Do you 
                        understand? I can’t help you if you 
                        don’t help yourself.

                                 JUNE
                        Noted. Dead-mommy benefits run out 
                        after six months. 
                           (beat)
                        What if my dad dies too? Do I get 
                        any more special treatment? ‘Cause 
                        he’s been kind of annoying lately, 
                        and I think I’ve watched enough CSI
                        to make it look like an accident.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        You have to improve your work, 
                        June, or you’ll be held back. 
                        Understood?

           A long beat as June stares at Mrs. Simpson intently. Finally:

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        What?
           June’s gaze goes past Mrs. Simpson into the void.

                                 JUNE
                        I wonder if there’s a way to tell 
                        the difference between a 
                        psychological need to pee and the 
                        real one without actually having to 
                        go to the bathroom. That would save 
                        me a lot of time.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June...

                                 JUNE
                        You know what? I’m not risking it.

           Mrs. Simpson sighs and shakes her head. June gets up, goes 
           around her.

           Halfway out, she notices two girls. Future sorority material. 
           Whispering, eyes on June.

           One of them is HEATHER, and she’s a bitch. The other doesn’t 
           matter. (But she’s also a bitch.)

           Heather shows something on her phone to her friend. Eyes on 
           June.

           June notices. Heather notices June noticing:

                                 HEATHER
                        Hey, June. Did you see Erica Staten 
                        today? They said she’s wearing an 
                        actual dinosaur shirt.

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah, so?

                                 HEATHER
                        You should take her out shopping -- 
                        she’d get better clothes and you’d 
                        get a friend. Win win.

           June rolls her eyes. Steps out into the...

           INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR

           Stops by a DOOR ajar in front of her. Another classroom.

           June’s eyes stops on a TALL GIRL in the first row. Tall and 
           out-of-place amongst younger kids. Nerdy-looking. Dinosaur 
           shirt.
           ERICA STATEN. The ‘girl-who-was-held-back-twice’.

           A PAPER BALL bounces off her head. O.S. GIGGLES. Erica barely 
           reacts.

           On June’s somber expression.

           EXT. CEMETERY -- AFTERNOON

           June has her back against Melissa Morgan’s grave, hood up, 
           playing a PORTABLE VIDEOGAME.

                                 JUNE
                           (playing her game)
                        You know I blame you for why I have 
                        no friends at school? I read this 
                        article where this psychology dude 
                        explains that children of absent 
                        parents develop better social 
                        skills than other kids, cause they 
                        have to look for validation outside 
                        their home.
                           (beat)
                        Heather’s mom is, like, barely 
                        around. And everyone likes Heather.

           June plays on.

                                 JUNE
                        But you had to be the best friend 
                        mom who understood me and made me 
                        feel validated and all that crap, 
                        so I never really cared about, you 
                        know, making actual friends.
                           (beat)
                        And that was really selfish of you.

           She says all of it nonchalantly. Half-joking.

           Puts her game down. More serious now:

                                 JUNE
                        Am I a loser, mom?

           The stone has no reaction.

                                 JUNE
                        Remain dead if the answer is ‘No, 
                        June, you are and will forever be 
                        awesome.’

           After a beat, June smiles. Returns to her game.
           INT. MORGAN HOME, OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Bill’s got his back to us, leaned over a desk.

           He’s studying a PILE of RECENTLY DEVELOPED PHOTOGRAPHS. All 
           black and white. All featuring old people looking straight at 
           the camera.

           The sound of the front door OPENING and CLOSING. A second 
           later June stops by.

                                 JUNE
                        Yo, progenitor.

           She puts her homework on his desk and turns to leave.

                                 BILL
                        Where were you all day?

                                 JUNE
                        Lesbian orgy. No drugs, though.

                                 BILL
                        Cute.

           He notices the ‘D’ on her test, turns back... 

           FOOTSTEPS as June climbs up the stairs to her bedroom.

           Meh.

           He leans back to work. Flips through the photographs, 
           studying the many old faces, intrigued.

           INT. JUNE’S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           June fires up her computer, biting onto a sandwich dinner. No 
           family meals in this house.

           Click, click to the school’s Blackboard page.

           Check Partial Grades. 

           Not good. She’s a hair away from flunking out.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           June paces back and forth, on the phone.

                                 JUNE
                        Is this Raymond Cross? From the -- 
                        hi, no, it’s June. June Morgan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        We have Social Studies together? 
                        Mrs. Simpson? No, not Jane Hoffman. 
                        June Morgan. God, does anybody know 
                        me in this school at all?
                           (beat)
                        I’m the one in the back row. You 
                        know, the one who’s mommy died? 
                        Yeah, oooh, that June. So, 
                        listen... I heard you stole Mr. 
                        Pinker’s midterms last year. Now, 
                        for how much would you be willing 
                        to do the same for --

           She stops by the coffee table. Eyes down on...

           Dan’s flyers. Private tutor. Grabs one.

                                 JUNE
                        You know what? I’ll call you back, 
                        Ray-Ray.

           Bill emerges from the hallway:

                                 BILL
                        Who was that?

           June folds Dan’s flyer, stuffs it in her pocket.

                                 JUNE
                        Just... wrong number.

           Starts the way up the stairs.

                                 BILL
                        June?

           She stops, turns. Bill has her test in hands. Showcases it 
           like evidence in a courtroom.

                                 BILL
                        Huh... study harder. Okay?

           All the assertion of a plankton.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING

           Dan opens his eyes to a big belly blocking the window sun.

           This is his unborn daughter, and she’s nested inside 
           MICHELLE’s body, mid-20s. Ex-hookup. Very pregnant.

           Dan gets up.
                                 DAN
                        Did you break in?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Good morning.

                                 DAN
                        Good morning. Did you break in?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You don’t lock your door, Daniel.

           Dan rubs his eyes awake.

                                 DAN
                        Well. Who am I afraid of? 
                        Murderers?

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           Dan makes coffee, Michelle sits at the table.

                                 MICHELLE
                        -- I didn’t hear back from your e-
                        mail, so I thought --

           Dan throws fruit in a BLENDER and Michelle has to speak over 
           it:

                                 MICHELLE
                        -- I’d drop by, you know, at least 
                      to see if --

           The blender dies out.

                                 MICHELLE
                        -- you’re still alive.

           Dan stops, but doesn’t turn back.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I mean... I’m sorry, Dan. I didn’t 
                        mean it like that. I. Crap. Crap. 
                        Sorry. It’s just an expression. 
                        Crap.

                                 DAN
                        What are you doing here, Michelle?

           He turns back, gives her juice, sits down, sips his coffee, 
           dead serious.
                                 MICHELLE
                        I have a Lamaze class this week.

                                 DAN
                        How much?

                                 MICHELLE
                        A hundred.

           Dan nods.

                                 DAN
                        Okay. I have to call the bank 
                        first. Her money’s in a savings 
                        account, I don’t have the --

                                 MICHELLE
                        You could come with me.

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        Maybe. We’ll see. I don’t think I’m 
                        free.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I didn’t tell you the day yet.

           Awkward.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You never come to these things with 
                        me.

           Dan just stares.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I know you pay for everything, and 
                        I know you’re saving all your money 
                        for her but...

                        Money’s not everything.

                        Michelle...

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m not asking you to be my 
                        boyfriend, okay? I know I was a 
                        Tinder fuck, I have no... 
                        delusions... in that area. But --
                                 DAN
                        And you know that I’m dying, so why 
                        are you --

                                 MICHELLE
                        -- there were two people there that 
                        night. She’s your daughter too. She 
                        needs you.
                           (beat)
                        I could use some help too.

           A tense beat. Dan gets up. Heads for the fridge. Beer time.

                                 DAN
                        Why did you send me the ultrasound?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

           He leans back against the counter.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t wanna see her, Michelle. I 
                        told you that.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You don’t wanna see your daughter?

                                 DAN
                        No. I don’t.

           A quiet beat. Michelle looks down. Gets up, heads for the 
           door.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll send you a check. For the 
                        class.

                                 MICHELLE
                           (quiet)
                        Thanks.

           Michelle sniffs. Dan sighs.

           A quiet beat. Then:

                                 DAN
                        What do you want me to do, 
                        Michelle? Cure cancer? 

           Before Michelle can answer, the DOORBELL rings.
           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- SAME

           Outside, June is by the door, which comes open to a sniffing 
           Michelle. She goes around June hurriedly, disappears down the 
           stairs.

                                 JUNE
                        That is a big girl.

           Dan shows up close behind.

                                 DAN
                        May I help you?

                        Hi. Dan Hopkins, right? Can I talk 
                        to you for a second?

                                 DAN
                        Do you sell cookies?

                                 JUNE
                        No.
                           (beat -- hopeful:)
                        Why, do you?

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM  -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan reads an ASSIGNMENT PAPER, leaned against the counter.

           June paces restlessly around the apartment: opens cabinets, 
           drawers, cupboards. Opens the fridge, comes out with orange 
           juice.

           More cupboards. Finds a cup. Fridge again.

                                 JUNE
                        Do you have any ice?

           Dan looks up. She dangles the cup in front of his eyes:

                                 JUNE
                        Ice?

                                 DAN
                        Freezer. Left drawer.

           She gets her ice. Drinks it. Grimaces.

                                 JUNE
                        Do you have like sugar or Splenda
                        or whatever?
           Walking back and forth as she speaks:

                                 JUNE
                        So, are you really like a genius?

                        My dad used to say you’re like one 
                        of the most intelligent men in 
                        North America. And mom used to say 
                        you’re really smart, but a prick. 
                        You never looked like much to me,

                                 JUNE
                        Is it a trophy? Can I see it?

                        Just a certificate? That’s boring.

                        socks for Christmas. I hated them.

           Nothing from Dan. Then:

                        Can I have a pudding cup?

           She doesn’t wait for him to answer. Heads for the fridge. 
           Grabs a pudding cup. Looks around for a spoon.

           Opens a drawer. No spoons here, but a sea of HYPODERMIC 
           NEEDLES.

                                 JUNE
                        Jesus on a stick, that’s a lot 
                        needles.

           Dan makes his way across the room, puts himself between June 
           and the drawer.

                                 DAN
                        Can I do something for you, June

                                 JUNE
                        Yes. I’m flunking Social Studies. 
                        You can help me stop that from 
                        happening.

           Dan offers the assignment paper back.

                                 DAN
                        Sounds like a hard life. Good luck

           He goes around her.

                        And I wasn’t asking you to tutor 
                        me.

           Dan waits.

                                 JUNE
                        I was going to offer you money to

                           (re: messy room)
                        I get a feeling you’re not much of 
                        a material person.

                                 DAN
                        What do you mean, do your 
                        assignments for you?

           June speaks as she eats the pudding. Her sales pitch:

                                 JUNE
                        I get a pretty big allowance now 
                        that my mom’s dead, and I’m willing 
                        to spend it on not flunking out. I 
                        saw your flyer and I remembered mom 
                        and dad always talked about you 
                        like you’re this sort of maverick 
                        professor, you know, the kind of 
                        guy that might just accept money 
                        from a thirteen year-old to help 
                        her cheat on her assignments. And I 
                        know what you’re thinking: is it 
                        moral to take money from a kid to 
                        do her homework for her? But 
                        listen, I really think --

                                 DAN
                        Hundred bucks. A week.

           She stops. That was easy.

                                 DAN
                        Plus, if I ever call you and tell 
                        you I need money for my medication
                           (nods at needle-drawer)
                        -- you have to give me an advance.

           A beat.
                                 DAN
                        And I want twenty bucks now.

           June smiles and offers a hand.

                                 JUNE
                        Deal.

           Dan shakes it. June gives him her paper back.

                                 JUNE
                        A minuses at the very least or no 
                        pay. 
                           (re: empty pudding cup)
                        This is fucking amazing, by the 
                        way. Can I get another one?

           She doesn’t wait for an answer, heads for the fridge.

           On Dan’s face, watching June.

                                                               CUT TO:

           AN OLD MAN

           ... stares straight into our soul. Still. Black and white. 
           Deep wrinkles around his eyes. A PHOTOGRAPH.

           We’re in: 

           INT. MORGAN HOME, OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Bill studies the photograph. It’s one from the pile he 
           developed earlier. We see the full picture now:

           It’s an old man standing in front of DOZENS OF CLOCKS. Wall 
           clocks, grandfather clocks, small, big, old, new...

           June pops up behind Bill, pizza slice in hand.

                                 JUNE
                        Dad. Dad?

           Nothing. Bill is absorbed, almost hypnotized by the man. June 
           crumples a piece of paper, bounces it off his head.

                                 JUNE
                        Yo, MC Daddy.

                                 BILL
                           (snapping out of it)
                        June?
                                 JUNE
                        I ordered food, ‘cause there was no 
                        dinner.

                                 BILL
                        There was none? I’m sorry. Where 
                        were you all day?

                                 JUNE
                        Just out. If you don’t wanna eat 
                        now, there’ll be leftovers. I 
                        think. Don’t quote me on it. No 
                        promises.

           She leans over his shoulder to look at the photo.

                                 JUNE
                        Who’s that?

                                 BILL
                        It’s one of your mom’s photographs. 
                        She was working on this new series 
                        on old people, I think, but she 
                        never got around to developing 
                        these photos.
                           (beat)
                        I think she was planning a new 
                        book. I think I can finish it for 
                        her, too.

                                 JUNE
                        Cool. Thank God it’s not a series 
                        on self-portraits, right?
                           (beat)
                        Get it? Cause she’s dead and all. 
                        She’s dead and so we can’t take any 
                        more pictures of her to finish the 
                        book. I mean we could, but that’d
                        be creepy. She’s like a spooky 
                        skeleton by now, probably, right? 
                        Though that could be cool. You 
                        know, ‘Evolution of Life: From 
                        Healthy and Alive to Dead and 
                        Decomposing’, or whatever.

                                 BILL
                        Don’t talk like that, June.

                                 JUNE
                        Sorry.
                           (beat)
                        ‘From Mommy to Mummy.’
                           (cuts it out)
                        Sorry, that’s fucked up. I’ll stop.
           Bill turns back to Melissa’s pile of photographs. June waits 
           a bit, but he’s absorbed again already.

                                 JUNE
                        Right. Okay. I’ll be upstairs.

           June heads out...

                                 JUNE
                        Don’t forget to eat dinner!

           ... and disappears down the hallway.

           Bill looks up to his laptop, wiggles the mouse...

           ... and the BACKGROUND IMAGE of his computer stares back at 
           us: Bill, Melissa and June. Together. Happy. Oblivious to 
           what’s coming.

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           A GIGANTIC SMILEY FACE drawn on the blackboard.

           Mrs. Simpson steps in front of it, her super-smile lighting 
           up the whole classroom.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Okaaay now! Before we start, I’d 
                        like to say that most of you did 
                        really, really well on the Eastern 
                        Religions assignment. 

           She stops her eyes on June, back row.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        I’m glad to see there’s progress 
                        happening.

           Smiles.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        I’m giving you your papers back at 
                        the end of the day, but right now 
                        we’re gonna talk about the --
                           (fake scary voice)
                        -- end of the year assignment.

           No one laughs. It’s cringe-worthy. June eye-rolls.
                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        We’ve covered the majority of 
                        faiths along the semester, and you 
                        all did great jobs researching its 
                        elements on the surface. What I 
                        would like from you now, though, is 
                        that you dig a liiitle deeper in 
                        the fertile soil of knowledge. 

           A smirk at her own remark. The classroom is not amused.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        So. For the end of the year 
                        assignment, each of you is going to 
                        pick one subject and study its 
                        development across aaalll the 
                        faiths we studied throughout the 
                        semester. These will be random 
                        subjects, you don’t get to pick 
                        them. And. No. Trades!

           She produces a big jar filled with folded little post-it 
           notes.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        You can do this assignment by 
                        yourselves or in groups of two or 
                        three, but no more than that, 
                        please.

           People shuffle around choosing pairs and groups. June 
           watches. Tries to catch someone’s eye. But no one looks her 
           way.

           It takes seconds. All the groups are picked and June’s left 
           groupless.

           Mrs. Simpson approaches.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June? Who’s your group?

           June looks around one last time, tentatively. Sighs.

           Grabs a POST-IT from the jar. Opens it:

                                  THE AFTERLIFE

           Mrs. Simpson’s on her way past her when she takes notice:

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Oh. June. Give that back, pick 
                        something else.
                                 JUNE
                        You said no trades.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Well, yes, but I think it’s best if 
                        --

           She tries to grab the paper. June pulls back.

                                 JUNE
                        Nope. Mine.

           Holds on to her teacher’s stare.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Okay. If you think you can do -- 
                        okay. Okay, that’s fine.
                           (super-smile)
                        Of course it’s fine, honey.

           Off she goes. June raises her eyes.

           Heather (that bitch), is showing something to a friend on her 
           phone again. Eyes on June. Whispering.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

           Dan trades bucks for dope with Crusty by the door. Behind 
           them, June pops up from the stairs, quick-stepping towards 
           Dan, a TEST PAPER raised to cover her face.

                                 JUNE
                        Ta-dah! A plus!

           She notices Crusty.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh. Hi. You’re... odd.

           At fourteen, Crusty’s a year older than June, but that won’t 
           stop him from feeling intimidated. He has no reply.

           June dangles the assignment in front of Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Congratulations.
                           (to Crusty)
                        Thanks, Crusty.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Do you have the Becker, professor?
           Dan produces a copy of the book DENIAL OF DEATH by Ernest 
           Becker.

                                 DAN
                        Hide it better than the last one.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Will do, professor.

           As they speak, June goes under Dan’s arm into the apartment. 
           Disappears inside.

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Your money’s on the counter!

           Crusty peeks over at June, interested. Then leaves. Dan turns 
           back to...

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM 

           ... closes the door.

                                 DAN
                           (under his breath)
                        Make yourself at home...

           He stops by the counter, grabs his money. Heads for the 
           living room to find...

           ... June staring down at his spoon, lighter and needle on the 
           table.

           Shit.

           She doesn’t say a word, just looks at it. Dan approaches. She 
           looks at his hand:

           The Ziploc packet. Filled with HEROIN he just got from 
           Crusty.

                                 DAN
                        It’s medicinal.

                                 JUNE
                        My ass it is.

                                 DAN
                        Not legally medicinal. But still.

                                 JUNE
                        You’re a junkie?
                                 DAN
                        I have terminal cancer.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, shit. Really?

           Dan sits on the couch. Throws the Ziploc on the coffee table.

                                 JUNE
                        Like. How terminal?

           June sits too, eyes on Dan.

                                 JUNE
                        Like. Do you have time to finish 
                        today’s assignment?

           She gives him today’s paper. Dan skims it.

           June studies Dan’s syringe as she speaks:

                                 JUNE
                        I have something else for you, if 
                        you wanna make more money. And now 
                        I’m guessing you do. How much is a 
                        gram of cocaine?

                                 DAN
                        Hundred bucks from the right buyer. 
                        But this isn’t cocaine. This is 
                        heroin.

           Dan starts working on the new assignment. June studies the 
           packet of heroin.

           Opens it. Brings it close to her nose to SMELL it. Dan 
           notices.

           Snatches the packet from her.

                                 JUNE
                        Rude.

                                 DAN
                           (back to assignment)
                        So? What can’t wait?

                                 JUNE
                        Most things in life. But I was 
                        talking about my end-of-year 
                        assignment.

           Dan waits for more.
                                 JUNE
                        We have to give a ten minute 
                        presentation on a particular aspect 
                        of faith across religions. I got 
                        ‘the afterlife’.

                                 DAN
                        ‘The afterlife’?

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t believe in it, but if you 
                        do die and it turns out there is 
                        one, that’d be a huge help if you 
                        could Snapchat it for me or 
                        whatever. 

           Dan looks up.

                                 JUNE
                        It’s cool, my mom died recently, so 
                        I can joke about it.

           Dan’s eyes go back down to the paper. June waits, patient.

                                 JUNE
                        Is it because you do drugs?

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 JUNE
                        Do you have cancer because you do 
                        drugs?

                                 DAN
                        No, I do drugs because I have 
                        cancer.

           June considers this, then accepts it. Then something crosses 
           her mind:

                                 JUNE
                        Was that pregnant girl your wife? 
                        The one that was here last time?

                                 DAN
                        No.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh. Okay. That’d be really sad if 
                        it was your kid she was pregnant 
                        with.

           Dan pauses at the weight of these words.
           Then snaps out of it -- gives June the finished assignment. 
           Gets up. Kitchen. Beer.

           June follows.

                                 JUNE
                        So? Will you help me?

           He grabs a bottle, offers her one.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m thirteen.

           Another beat.

                                 DAN
                        Right.

           He puts the bottle back in the fridge.

                                 JUNE
                        So? Afterlife?

                                 DAN
                        What do you have to do?

                                 JUNE
                        Just talk to a bunch of people. 
                        Priests, rabbis, whatever the 
                        Muslim guy is called --

                                 DAN
                        -- they’re called Imam --

                                 JUNE
                        -- whatever -- and ask them about 
                        the afterlife and then write about 
                        it.

                                 DAN
                        Can’t you just copy it from a nerd 
                        friend like the normal kids?

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t have a lot of friends at 
                        school. 
                           (beat)
                        But not in a dorky, she-has-no-
                        friends way. More in a lone-wolf 
                        Aragorn vibe, you know? Like I’m 
                        too awesome and intimidating and I 
                        keep to myself and everyone thinks 
                        I’m cool.

                        Plus the teacher wants us to have 
                        the interviews on video.

           Dan sips his beer.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t know how much you 
                        researched me, but I don’t have a 
                        very good relationship with 
                        religious figures.

                                 JUNE
                        So what? You have an Emmy, that’s 
                        like, guaranteed to give me a few 
                        extra points.

                                 DAN

                                 JUNE
                        Whatever. You can smoke your heroin 
                        the whole time, I won’t mind.

           A beat. Dan notices something. Frowns:

                                 DAN
                        What do you have in your pockets?

           We notice the BULGE in June’s pockets. She sighs, busted. 
           Pulls PUDDING CUPS from it.

                                 JUNE
                        Sorry, they’re just really, really 
                        good. You should lock your fridge -- 
                        I’ll try again soon.

           On Dan, sighing.

           EXT. MORGAN HOME -- AFTERNOON

           Establishing. June climbing the front steps.

           INT. MORGAN HOME -- AFTERNOON

           June gets home. All quiet. Stops as soon as she crosses the 
           door.

           What the...

           The living room is TURNED UPSIDE DOWN like the aftermath of a 
           hurricane.
           Very messy.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           June’s startled face emerges from the living room into the 
           kitchen.

           She finds Bill. The table in front of him covered in 
           PHOTOGRAPHS. He stares blankly at one in particular.

                                 JUNE
                        Dad?

                                 BILL
                           (eyes on the photograph)
                        Hey, June.

                                 JUNE
                        Are you aware that our living room 
                        has exploded?

                                 BILL
                        Right. That was me. I knew your mom 
                        had another roll of film somewhere 
                        and...

           He finally looks up. Taps his pen on the photographs:

                                 BILL
                           (smiles)
                        Took me a while, but I found it.

                                 JUNE
                        Okay...

           Bill looks back at the picture in his hands. Transfixed.

           A long beat goes by. June doesn’t move. Finally:

                                 BILL
                        I don’t know where this photo was 
                        taken.

           June goes around him, looks over his shoulder at the 
           photograph -- AN OLD LADY standing in front of a bunch of 
           Arabian-style carpets, rugs, quilts, etc.

                                 JUNE
                        Looks like... wherever they shot 
                        Aladdin. 
                                 BILL
                        The sign is in arabic. But we never 
                        went to an Arab-speaking country.

           He runs his eyes through an undeveloped film roll on the 
           table, where we make out SIMILAR SHOTS. Some including 
           Melissa -- doing the old lady’s hair, makeup, etc. A MAKING 
           OF of the shot Bill has in hands.

                                 JUNE
                        Maybe it wasn’t out of the country.

                                 BILL
                        Maybe...

           Bill’s pretty much in his own world, looking from frame to 
           frame on the roll, taking Melissa in. Her smile. Her gentle 
           touch on the lady’s hair. Her eyes.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m gonna order something from 
                        Grubhub, okay, Dad?

           June waits for an answer, but Bill’s not listening. She turns 
           around to leave.

           When she’s almost by the door:

                                 BILL
                        June.

           Turns back. Bill stares at her intently. A long beat. Then:

                                 BILL
                        Never mind.

           On June. She looks down.

           INT. JUNE’S BEDROOM -- LATER

           June by herself, reading on the afterlife.

           We stop on STILLS of the WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE she’s reading: 

           Medieval paintings of HEAVEN and HELL -- faces contorted in 
           pain bathed in hellfire contrasted with heavenly angelic 
           faces (somehow still gloomy-looking) over the clouds.

           June’s eyes go from the screen to the FRAMED PICTURE by the 
           nightstand:

           June, Bill and Melissa. The background picture from Bill’s 
           laptop. A happy family. Mom looks alive. Bill looks present.
           A lot has changed.

           EXT. PARK -- NIGHT

           Sundown behind the branches of the dead tree. All dark and 
           quiet and lonesome.

           INT. DAN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Dan lies wide awake, eyes on the ceiling, emotionless.

           He pulls in a breath as if about to scream. But he doesn’t.

           Silent. Passive. Eyes open.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MORNING

           Knock, knock. June waits by the door.

           She hears the footsteps inside and tippytoes to reach the 
           peephole viewframe. Knocks again.

           Dan opens the door. Tired.

                                 JUNE
                        You got pudding cups, right? We’re 
                        gonna need pudding cups. It’s 
                        essential that we have pudding 
                        cups.

           INT. CHURCH -- DAY

           Dan and June walk down the long aisle. A couple of faithfuls
           left and right, but mostly empty.

           They reach the CONFESSIONAL. June knocks. The PRIEST walks 
           out. June BOWS to him.

                                 JUNE
                        Your Majesty. I’m June Morgan, we 
                        spoke over the phone about a school 
                        assignment?

           He looks at Dan (who’s eating a pudding cup).

                                 DAN
                           (mouth full)
                        I’m Dan. I just have cancer.

           Confused priest.
           INT. CHURCH -- LATER

           A CELL PHONE CAMERA POV. STATIC.

           The priest sits on a plastic chair. June comes into frame. 
           Then turns back.

                                 JUNE
                        Come on!

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Why do I have to be in it?

                                 JUNE
                        I told you! You have an Oscar, I’ll 
                        get mad respect for bringing you 
                        into this!

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Pulitzer.

                                 JUNE
                        Whatever. Come, come. We’ll have 
                        like a little debate and I’ll be 
                        the host.

           A reluctant Dan shows up from behind the camera. They both 
           take sits across from the priest.

           June, eyes down to her notes:

                                 JUNE
                        All right. So. You’re a Catholic 
                        Priest.

                                 PRIEST
                        Yes.

                                 JUNE
                        And you believe in God and Jesus 
                        and all that shit -- sorry -- all 
                        that crap?

           The priest nods.

                                 JUNE
                        Okay. And Dan, what do you have to 
                        say about all of it?

                                 DAN
                        What does my opinion matter?

           June speaks like a seasoned talk show host, smiling eyes on 
           the camera:
                                 JUNE
                        You’re a famous academic, surely 
                        people would be interested to know 
                        how your opinion differs from Our 
                        Holiness.

                                 DAN
                        Why? I’m not a theologian, I don’t 
                        see how --

                                 JUNE
                           (angry-whisper)
                        Just talk goddammit, I have to fill 
                        fifteen minutes to get the full 
                        grade.

           Dan concedes. To the priest:

                                 DAN
                        Okay. I think it’s a very pretty 
                        story.

                                 PRIEST
                        But you don’t believe it.

                                 DAN
                        Not a word, no.

                                 JUNE
                        Uuh. Isn’t that something? And why 
                        not, Dr. Hopkins?

                                 DAN
                        Because it’s stupid.
                           (to the Priest)
                        No offense.

           The priest looks a little offended.

           We go into a...

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           ... of Dan and June interviewing several religious figures.

           A RABBI

                                 DAN
                        Why would God put Job through all 
                        that shit just to prove a point to 
                        the Devil? That sounds 
                        unnecessarily mean.

           The Rabbi -- making an effort not to roll his eyes.
           AN ISLAMIC SCHOLAR AT A UNIVERSITY

           This guy’s also annoyed. Dan’s getting a kick out of messing 
           with all of them:

                                 DAN
                        Do I have to speak Arabic in Muslim 
                        heaven? Or do they have those 
                        museum headphones with English 
                        translation for all the shows and 
                        attractions and stuff?

                                 JUNE
                        There’s shows in Muslim heaven?

                                 DAN
                        I’m assuming there’s some sort of 
                        entertainment. Right?

           The guy sighs.

           A BUDDHIST MONK

           The Monk sits, eyes closed, lotus position, meditating. June 
           stares at him for a beat. Awkward.

           Lean closer. Puts a finger under his nose.

                                 JUNE
                           (to the camera)
                        Is he dead?

           No reaction.

           THE RABBI AGAIN

                                 DAN
                        I do like the hats, I’ll give you 
                        that.

                                 JUNE
                        The hats are awesome.

           The Rabbi seems pleased.

           THE PRIEST

                                 DAN
                        How long must the line to meet 
                        Jesus in Heaven be, huh? I mean, 
                        that guy’s gotta be tired of posing 
                        for selfies.
                                 JUNE
                           (genuine)
                        You think Jesus poses for selfies?

                                 DAN
                        Oh, definitely.

           They both turn to the priest. Who shrugs.

                                 PRIEST
                        I don’t see why not.

           A FIFTH GUY, UNDETERMINED RELIGION

           This guy’s staring at the wall chanting in a dead language in 
           a sort of trance, wearing ancient robes.

           Dan looks from him to the camera.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t even know what that is.

           THE MUSLIM

           Heated argument:

                                 MUSLIM SCHOLAR
                        No, no, no, no, it was in 
                        Constantinople!

                                 DAN
                        Yes, but it has existed in the 
                        region for a lot longer than the 
                        Muslim religion. During the Ottoman 
                        Empire --

                                 MUSLIM SCHOLAR
                        That is not relevant to the 
                        discussion, you are neglecting --

           June shows up on frame.

                                 JUNE
                        What are you guys talking about?

                                 DAN
                        June, Google this: who invented the 
                        kebab?

           June sighs.

           FIFTH GUY, UNDETERMINED RELIGION
           The guy leans progressively closer to Dan, caressing the wall 
           and dancing a sort of tribal dance.

           Dan leans away. Turns to the camera.

                                 DAN
                        It’s kind of creeping me out.

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, let’s get the hell out of 
                        here.

           Dan disappears off frame. Dude keeps dancing. We end the 
           montage in the:

           INT. CHURCH   

           ... as Dan and June collect their things and make their way 
           out.

                                 PRIEST
                        Daniel.

           Dan turns back. The priest walks to him. His steps echo 
           across the wide chamber.

                                 PRIEST
                        I’m sorry about your sickness.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, sorry seems to be the 
                        consensus.

           The priest stops in front of Dan.

                                 PRIEST
                        My father was not a Christian.

           He’s serious now.

                                 PRIEST
                        In his deathbed, I asked him if he 
                        was scared to die, and he said he 
                        wasn’t. I asked him how could he 
                        not be scared if he thought he 
                        wasn’t going anywhere. If he had no 
                        soul, that meant that all that 
                        exists -- everything he knew -- 
                        would die with him when his brain 
                        stopped working. His death would 
                        effectively mean the death of the 
                        whole universe.

                        And he smiled and said to me: it’s 
                        a good universe, son. I don’t mind 
                        taking it with me.

           Dan considers this, maybe seriously for a second. Then:

                                 DAN
                        I have no idea what that’s supposed 
                        to mean.

           The priest smiles a resigned smile.

                                 PRIEST
                        I hope you find peace, Daniel.

           He turns back towards the confessional.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           June takes notes on her laptop, sitting by the coffee table.

           Dan steps out from the bathroom, beer in hand.

                                 DAN
                        Can’t you do this at home?

                                 JUNE
                           (typing)
                        I can, but I like it better here.

           Dan throws himself on the couch. Clearly uncomfortable with 
           June’s presence in his personal space.

                                 DAN
                        Well, hurry up with it, will you?

                                 JUNE
                        I’m just taking notes, chilax.

                                 DAN
                        I’m chilaxed.

                                 JUNE
                        No you’re not. And chilaxed is not 
                        a word.

                                 DAN
                        Oh, because ‘chilax’ is in the 
                        Merrian Webster Dic -- what am I 
                        doing? Why am I arguing?
                                 JUNE
                        There. Done. Come here. I need to 
                        teach you something.

           Dan groans -- moves to her side on her couch.

                                 JUNE
                        See that? That’s my school’s 
                        blackboard page.

                                 DAN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JUNE
                        Now, our next assignments are all

                        Do you know what a website is?

           Dan stares, blank-faced.

                                 JUNE
                        A website is --

                                 JUNE
                        Okay. So what you’re gonna do is 
                        log in with my e-mail --

           That look from Dan again.

                                 JUNE
                        Okay, okay. You know what log in 
                        means. So you log in and upload the 
                        answers to Mrs. Simpson here --
                           (clicks)

                        First one is due tomorrow, so don’t 
                        forget.

                                 DAN
                        Can’t you do that?

                                 JUNE
                        Hey, what am I paying you for?

           Dan concedes.
                                 DAN
                        What’s the password?

                                 JUNE
                           (bright)
                        Pudding.

           Dan nods.

                                 JUNE
                        Speaking of which --

                                 DAN
                        Second drawer, by the milk carton.

           June goes for the fridge, sticks her head in, looking for 
           pudding.

                                 JUNE
                           (head in-fridge)
                        Hey, can I ask you something?

                                 DAN
                        Huh.

                                 JUNE
                        It’s awkward.

                                 DAN
                        Okay.

                                 JUNE
                        Really. You can say no and I won’t 
                        ask.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t know what you’re gonna ask.

                                 JUNE
                        But I told you it’s awkward, so if 
                        you don’t want me to ask you 
                        something awkward, you can say no 
                        and I won’t --

                                 DAN
                        Dear God just ask it.

           June makes her way back, throws herself by Dan’s side on the 
           couch.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s it like to be dying?

           Dan pauses.
                                 JUNE
                        Sorry. Is it too awkward? Sorry.

                                 DAN
                        It’s fine.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m just... curious. Must be weird 
                        to live. Like that. Like. Knowing. 
                        Sorry. Like. My mom died out of the 
                        blue. Just driving her car one day 
                        and oh gee is that a stop sign BAM. 
                        Dead. But you, like... you know 
                        it’s happening. That’s... 
                        different.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah. It’s different.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m not sure if it’s better.

                                 DAN
                        Well, I never died in a car crash, 
                        so I don’t know. But this sucks a 
                        lot.

                                 JUNE
                        But what’s it feel like?

           Dan leans forward. Puffs his cheeks. Mutes the priest 
           speaking on TV.

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        It’s like... standing on the edge 
                        of a very tall cliff, with the city 
                        lights shining way down below your 
                        feet. And you look down at it all 
                        and it slowly dawns on you that 
                        every one of those window lights 
                        shining down there is a life. A 
                        person with their own hopes, 
                        dreams, demons, thoughts and quirks 
                        that you’ll never know about... and 
                        it’s so beautiful, and you realize 
                        you want nothing more than to jump 
                        down and dive into this ocean of 
                        light and life shimmering down 
                        there... but you can’t. You can’t, 
                        so you just watch them from far 
                        away. And it’s really lonely.

                        And then you turn back, and there’s 
                        a guy standing right behind you in 
                        scrubs, and he’s like: “Hey, Dan, 
                        guess what? You have cancer, you 
                        piece of shit.”

           On June’s expression. Somber and serious for a beat. Then a 
           single SNORT. Maybe a chuckle, maybe not.

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- AFTERNOON

           The SUNROOF frames a blue sky stroked with light clouds. 
           Treetops rushing by tell us the car’s moving.

           Then DARKNESS. All black.

           Then the sunroof again.

           DARKNESS. Sunroof. DARKNESS. Sunroof.

           We see the whole picture:

           We’re in Dan’s car as he drives June home. 

           June has her face up to the sunroof, eyes opening and closing 
           repeatedly.

                                 JUNE
                        Sometimes I think the world only 
                        exists when my eyes are open. Like 
                        the universe mini-explodes whenever 
                        I blink, and then rearranges itself 
                        in a hurry before I open my eyes 
                        again.

                                 DAN
                        That’s very solipsist of you.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s soplizipits?

                                 DAN
                        Solipsist. Google it.

           They drive in silence for a beat.

                                 JUNE
                        Hey, what do you want on your 
                        grave?

                                 DAN
                        What?
                                 JUNE
                        I see all kinds of weird 
                        inscriptions on people’s tombstones 
                        at my mother’s cemetery. 
                           (beat)
                        What will you put on yours?

           Dan thinks for a beat.

                                 DAN
                        Nothing.

                                 JUNE
                        Nothing?

                                 DAN
                        Nothing. Just an unmarked grave. 
                        Like Steve Jobs. Or capital 
                        punishment offenders.

           June frowns. Dan explains:

                                 DAN
                        Gravestones are for the living.

           Dan pulls over in front of June’s house. She steps out. Dan 
           honks ever-so-lightly. Extends his palm.

           June walks back. Pays him. A deal is a deal.

           EXT. MORGAN HOME -- MOMENTS LATER  

           June heads straight for the door, fishes in her pockets 
           for...

           ... nothing. Shit.

           She turns back in time to see Dan’s car rolling away.

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- SAME

           Dan’s eyes go to the rear view. June’s waving her arms in the 
           middle of the road for him to come back.

           He turns his head and looks back to make sure. Sure enough. 
           There she is.

           Hesitates. Keeps driving. She keeps waving. 

           Nope. Not my problem. Keeps driving.

           June’s head goes down to her phone. A beat later:
           BEEP. Dan’s phone. Message: ‘I know you saw me, asshole.’

           EXT. MORGAN HOME -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan’s car pulls over. June gets up from the porch, heads for 
           the driver’s window.

                                 JUNE
                        I forgot my keys.

                                 DAN
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t know. Take me for ice cream 
                        or whatever. I don’t wanna stand 
                        here all day waiting for my dad to 
                        get back.

           Dan sighs.

           INT. DIVIEST BAR IN CALIFORNIA -- DAY

           The SADDEST ICE CREAM BOWL travels its way through the shady 
           crowd of the bar to end on June and Dan’s table. The waitress 
           drops a spoon by its side and leaves, no smiles, no ‘enjoy’.

           This is not the kind of place that serves ice cream.

           June doesn’t mind it, though. She scoops a spoonful and drops 
           it in her coke glass. Makes a float.

           Dan does the same. With his Scotch. Why not?

           They eat/drink in silence for a beat. Dan checks his watch.

                                 DAN
                        A friend’s house? How about a 
                        friend’s house? I can drop you off.

                                 JUNE
                           (mouthful of ice cream)
                        I don’t have any friends.

                                 DAN
                        How come?

                                 JUNE
                        It’s like I told you. I’m too 
                        awesome for my school.

                        They don’t let me talk to anyone 
                        ‘cause they’re too afraid it’ll 
                        ruin the other student’s self-
                        esteem.

           On Dan, not amused. June looks up. Goes for honesty:

                                 JUNE
                        Nobody likes me. I don’t know why.

           A rare moment with her mask off. She looks down. Dan presses:

                                 DAN
                        Does it bother you?

                                 JUNE
                        Whatever.

           A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        It’d be nice to have friends, but 
                        whatever. Who cares?

           A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        I just don’t wanna be another dino-

                        Dinosaur girl. It’s like. There’s 
                        this girl, Erica Staten. She was 
                        held back twice, and now she’s gone 
                        through puberty so she has boobs 
                        and pimples and she’s like a foot 
                        taller than all the other girls. 
                        She sticks out in the crowd. You 
                        know, like a dinosaur? And no one 
                        talks to her, ‘cause of course, 
                        she’s the ‘big weird girl who was 
                        held back twice’. I don’t think 
                        I’ve ever heard her voice, 
                        seriously.

           A beat.

                        I just. I’m afraid. She doesn’t 
                        belong. And I’m afraid I’ll end up 
                        like her.

                        I don’t like being alone.

           Dan doesn’t react.

                        Does that mean I’m a loser?

                        friends?

           He reaches over and pulls June’s EARBUD -- she was wearing it 
           in one ear, half-listening to music.

                                 DAN
                        Being present.

           She looks up. Concedes.

                        How about you?

                                 DAN
                        What about me?

                                 JUNE
                        Do you have any friends?

                                 DAN
                        No one wants to be friends with a 
                        dying person.

                                 JUNE
                        How come?

                                 DAN
                        Cause they feel like they have to 
                        filter everything they say.

                        They feel guilty if they say the 
                        word ‘death’ around me, ‘cause they 
                        think it reminds me that I’m dying. 
                        Like it’s something that slips my 
                        mind every now and then if no one 
                        mentions it.

           June gets it:

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah, that sucks. I had a girl 
                        apologize for mentioning her mom in 
                        front of me. It’s like ‘hey, it’s 
                        cool, I’m not gonna steal your mom 
                        just ‘cause I know you have one 
                        now.’

           Dan chuckles. Common ground.

                                 JUNE
                        What about the pregnant chick?

                                 DAN
                        She’s just a pregnant chick.

                                 JUNE
                        What is she, like a friend? A 
                        tinder date? Are you one of those 
                        guys that have the hots for 
                        pregnant chicks? I know they exist, 
                        I saw a website once by accident, 
                        dude, it was like --

                                 DAN
                        She’s just... 

           Dan doesn’t finish the sentence right away.

                                 DAN
                        ... just someone.

           June considers this. A quiet beat. Then:

                                 JUNE
                        Sad.

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 JUNE
                        You. You’re sad.

                                 DAN

                        You’re more. Way more. You’re like 
                        that sad lonely man that lives in 
                        the house at the end of the street 
                        all the kids are afraid of getting 
                        close to.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, well, at least I was never 
                        held back in school.

           June opens her mouth, flabbergasted (but not really).

                                 JUNE
                        I wasn’t held back yet. And you’re 
                        dying. That’s way worse than being 
                        held back.

                                 DAN
                        We’re all dying, just at different 
                        paces.

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah, but you’re like, dying right 
                        now. Like, you probably don’t have 
                        another Christmas in you.

           Dan doesn’t answer right away.

                                 JUNE
                        Sorry. Was that too far? Shit. 
                        Sorry.

           Dan shrugs.

                                 DAN
                        At least my mom’s alive.

           Open-mouth silent gasp from June:

                                 JUNE
                        Is she really? Can I steal her?

                                 DAN
                        Nah, she’s dead. Eat your ice 
                        cream.

           June smiles. Dan gets up.
           INT. BAR RESTROOM -- LATER

           Dan exits the stall. Washes his hands. Pauses.

           His breathing grows shallow. His eyelids go down. He has to 
           lean against the sink for support.

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Hey man, you all right?

           The guy rests a hand on Dan’s shoulder. Dan pulls himself 
           together. Regains his balance.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

           Dan stares at his frail figure in the mirror. A gentle 
           reminder of impending death.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           A FETUS on a laptop screen, Rorschach-shaped in black and 
           white. The ultrasound picture we saw earlier.

           Dan on the couch. Staring at the picture, laptop in front of 
           him.

           A melancholic mood.

           Right click with his mouse: ‘Are you sure you want to recycle 
           this picture from the DELETED FOLDER?’

           Before he can click YES or NO:

           The FRONT DOOR comes open. Crusty walks in. Dan doesn’t move.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Professor?

           He gets closer. Extends the DENIAL OF DEATH book back to Dan.

                                 CRUSTY
                        “We are Gods with anuses”. Great 
                        stuff. Real page-turner.

           Beat. Dan is still looking at the picture of his daughter.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Professor?

                                 DAN
                        Yes, Crusty?
                                 CRUSTY
                        Your book.

           Dan snaps out of his ultrasound-picture-induced trance.

                                 DAN
                        Right. Thank you, Crusty.

           Takes the book.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Who was that girl that was here 
                        before, professor?

           Dan heads for the fridge for a new beer.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Short, pony-tailed, face like a 
                        preteen Sylvia Plath?

                                 DAN
                        Her name’s June.

                                 CRUSTY
                        June. She’s quite alluring.

                                 DAN
                        Don’t get dreamy, Crusty. She would 
                        ruin your summer.

           Crusty heads for the fridge too. Grabs a beer. Drinks it.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I don’t like summers.

           Dan sits back down. Nods, eyes back at the ultrasound 
           picture, distracted.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Professor?

                                 DAN
                        I’ll let her know, Crusty. I’ll let 
                        her know.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM  -- NIGHT

           Dan wakes up. Something’s off. Something smells.

           He pulls the blanket, looks down.

           He’s wet himself.
           INT, DAN’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB. By the sink, in his underwear, Dan tries 
           to get the pee stain off of his pants.

           SCRUB. SCRUB. SCRUB. SCRUB.

           It starts with a sob. He fights it, almost confused by the 
           tear. Wipes it away. Keeps scrubbing.

           Then another. Sob. Sob again. Scrub. Scrub. Sob. Scrub. Sob.

           Stop it stop it stop it!

           Then he’s done. Drops the pants, the sponge, himself. Slides 
           to the floor.

                                 DAN
                        God...

           Curls and folds onto himself in fetal position by the toilet. 
           Dan in tears. Swollen face and red eyes, big, big desperation 
           tears.

           Quiet, but furious like a storm.

           He punches his naked leg again and again. Cut it out cut it 
           out cut it out!

           But it won’t.

           Head down between his legs.

           Defeated.

                        “We must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Back at the class on Dan’s book. And Dan’s here again. Back 
           row. A contained mess.

           Cooper, the teacher, continues reading from Dan’s book:

                                 COOPER
                        “Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus states 
                        that the human condition mirrors 
                        that of Sisyphus, the Greek hero 
                        condemned to forever roll a boulder 
                        up a mountain, only to see it roll 
                        down again and have to repeat the 
                        task the next day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COOPER (CONT'D)
                        To Camus, life in the face of death 
                        would be much like the punishment 
                        of Sisyphus -- an absurdist
                        exercise in futility. And yet, 
                        despite knowing the truth of our 
                        insignificance, we have to keep on 
                        living. We have to, in Camus’
                        words, ‘imagine Sisyphus happy’.”
                           (beat)
                        Hopkins, of course, will defend 
                        that to try and imagine Sisyphus
                        happy is itself absurd.

           He looks up.

                                 COOPER
                        Thoughts?

           A STUDENT raises his hand:

                                 STUDENT
                        I disagree. I think it’s our 
                        mortality that makes our time alive 
                        precious and meaningful. I mean, we 
                        all love life, but living forever 
                        would be much worse than dying.

                                 DAN
                        How do you know?

           The class turns back.

                                 STUDENT
                        Well.

                                 DAN
                        If you had to choose between dying 
                        right now or living forever, what 
                        would you choose?

           The student doesn’t answer.

                                 DAN
                        There is only mortal life. Of 
                        course you cherish it, it’s all 
                        you’ve ever known. 
                           (beat)
                        You don’t love life. You have 
                        Stockholm Syndrome.

           Silence.

           MELISSA MORGAN

           ... suddenly alive. Right in front of us. Looking right at 
           the camera.

                                 MELISSA
                        Come here.

           She’s outside. In a backyard. Sunny. Green. Grainy. Dream-
           like.

                                 MELISSA
                        Come on, let me show you.

           Our frame shakes with footsteps, the cameraman getting 
           closer. Melissa extends her hands, TOUCHES US...

           ... turns the camera on herself and a six-year-old JUNE.

                                 MELISSA
                           (laughing)
                        You’re filming! See here? That’s 
                        for filming. For pictures, you 
                        press riiight he --

           BLACK.

           We’re in:

           INT. JUNE’S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Present-day June keeps her eyes on the blackness of the 
           computer screen. Then she hits PLAY. The video starts again: 
           Melissa saying “Come here” to the camera.

           June’s been watching this on repeat for a while.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, MASTER BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           June walks in. The room is spotless.

           Too spotless. Bill hasn’t slept here since the accident. 

           She steps in. Stops by the nightstand.

           Her mother’s glasses rest on top of a Stephen King paperback.

           June takes the book. Opens it. The edge of a page folded down 
           to mark the spot still.

           Forever unfinished.
           INT. MORGAN HOME, OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           June walks in. Looking for support. Down. Sad. Stephen King 
           still in hands.

           The room is draped in PHOTOGRAPH PRINTOUTS. All share that 
           same formula: old people staring straight at the camera with 
           different objects stacked behind them. There’s:

           -The old man with the clocks behind him.

           -An old lady standing in front of piles and piles of paper.

           -A man in front of hundreds of BUILDING PLAN SKETCHES taped 
           to the wall behind him.

           ... etc.

           Bill is not here.

           June looks from picture to picture -- curiosity slowly giving 
           way to a sort of anguish as the faces seem to grow sadder, 
           older, even scarier, as she browses them.

           She stops on the OLD MAN in front of the CLOCKS. Looks right 
           into his eyes. He seems to look right back.

           Staring straight into her soul.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           The long corridor, deserted but for a single figure sitting 
           against the wall under a flickering light. Knees up, hood on.

           Dan emerges from the stairs. Walks towards the figure. 

           Dan gets closer. Stops. It’s Crusty. Bloody nose. He looks 
           up.

                                 CRUSTY
                        It’s quite all right, Professor. 
                        But I’m afraid I can’t hook you up 
                        right now.

           Dan just watches.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I have to wait for him to fall 
                        asleep before I can go in.

           Faint CRASHING NOISES from the other side of the door in 
           front of Crusty. His father.
           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan steps in, throws his stuff aside and...

           ... notices June on the couch. Her back to Dan. Watching a 
           CARTOON. Something innocent.

           All lights out, an eerie vibe to the room.

                                 DAN
                        I think Game of Thrones is on HBO.
                           (to himself)
                        I gotta start locking my door.

           Dan makes his way round the couch.

                                 DAN
                        What are you doing here?

           Stops when he notices she’s crying. Eyes straight at the TV.

                                 DAN
                        June?

                                 JUNE
                        I finished editing the interviews. 
                        I wanted to show it to you so I 
                        burned you a copy.

           She says all of that crying. Points at a DVD on the coffee 
           table.

                                 JUNE
                        There.

           Dan sits.

                                 DAN
                        What happened?

           Still crying:

                                 JUNE
                        Do you wanna watch it?

                                 DAN
                        June.

                                 JUNE
                           (crying harder)
                        I think it turned out really good.

                                 DAN
                        June. What’s wrong?
           A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        Why do people die?

           Dan looks down.

                                 DAN
                        Fuck, June.

                                 JUNE
                        No. You tell me.

           Nothing from Dan. She pushes him.

                                 JUNE
                        You tell me!

           Sobs.

           Dan holds her. She cries and cries and cries into his 
           shoulder.

                                 JUNE
                           (quieter)
                        You tell me.

           He strokes her hair. She just cries.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK

           A 1950’S SITCOM SCENE:

                                 MALE CHARACTER
                        Before he dies, a man must plant a 
                        tree, have a child and write a 
                        book! 

                                 MALE CHARACTER 2
                        That sounds like a lot of work. 
                        Can’t I write a tree, have a book 
                        and forget the child?

           Canned laughter.

           We’re in:

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           The sitcom plays on the living room TV. 

           Sleepy-eyed Dan wakes up on the couch, a SEA OF EMPTY PUDDING 
           CUPS OVER HIS CHEST.
           He heads for the...

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM  

           ... where June’s asleep in bed (holding an empty pudding 
           cup).

           Dan towers over her. Doesn’t wake her up. But notices the 
           tear stains on her pillow. 

           INT. COLLEGE OFFICE -- MORNING

           Bill looks like he hasn’t slept in years. He’s on the phone.

                                 BILL
                        Yes. No, I need to -- my wife, 
                        Melissa Morgan? She took a picture 
                        of your father back in May? Yes, 
                        exactly. Well, I’m compiling a book 
                        and -- no, she’s not. She’s... out. 
                        But I can speak for her.

           Dan walks in. Kind of pissed.

                                 DAN
                        Hey, father of the year.

           Bill looks up.

                                 BILL
                        I’ll call you back.

           Hangs up.

                                 BILL
                        Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Your daughter’s in my apartment.

                                 BILL
                        She is?

           Dan steps closer.

                                 DAN
                        How long have you been here?

                                 BILL
                        You have no idea how hard it is to 
                        track these people from Melissa’s 
                        photographs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        And I have to get everyone’s 
                        authorization, it’s a nightmare. 
                        But look at this, the whole thing 
                        was a series on old age and legacy 
                        she was doing.

           Bill shuffles PHOTOGRAPHS on the table for Dan to see. Same 
           style: old people standing in front of different objects, 
           collections, etc.

                                 BILL
                        She took people at the end of their 
                        lives and photographed them 
                        standing in front of their life’s 
                        work. Like this guy, he fixed 
                        bicycles for a living, so she --

                                 DAN
                        Bill. Bill. Your thirteen-year-old 
                        daughter didn’t sleep at home last 
                        night and you don’t care. You 
                        didn’t even answer your phone. I 
                        had to call the university to find 
                        you.

                                 BILL
                        What? She told me she was taking 
                        classes with you, right?

           Dan shakes his head.

                                 BILL
                        She’s fine. She’s a real grownup.

                                 DAN
                        Go be with your daughter.

           Dan turns back.

                                 BILL
                        Dan, come on.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t need a kid, Bill, I already 
                        have a tumor.

           Dan turns around. Slams the door.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- DAY

           June wakes up. Confused for a second (”where the hell -- oh, 
           right”). She blinks herself awake.
           A NOTE on the nightstand reads: ‘Pudding in the fridge.’

           She grabs her stuff, heads for the...

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM   

           ... where she finds Michelle stepping in from the front door. 
           MEDICAL EXAMS in her hands.

           A beat. Both confused as they stare at each other.

                                 JUNE
                        Hi.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh. Hi. Is Dan home?

           June looks around.

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t know.
                           (beat -- smile)
                        But we have pudding.

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- DAY

           Dan drives. Checks in his pocket -- an EMPTY ZIPLOC. Pulls 
           his phone. Dials. Crusty. No answer.

           Sigh.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Dan gets home, dopeless. June’s gone already. The place is 
           empty.

           He opens a beer. Drinks half the can in a sip. 

           Notices the exam papers Michelle brought with her on the 
           coffee table. Pulls them from the envelope, reads. We focus 
           on one part of it:

           Expected due date.

           It’s soon. 

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM-- NIGHT

           Dan; sweaty, restless, trashing. The joys of sleeping through 
           heroin withdrawal.
           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           Dan, wrapped in a blanket, emerges from the bedroom to face 
           the morning. Looking like shit.

           Throws himself on the couch. Deep, bloodshot eyes stop on the 
           DUE DATE on Michelle’s exams again.

           Grabs a ZIPLOC. Runs his finger inside, rubs it against his 
           gums. Nothing.

           He grabs a stale beer bottle from the coffee table and sips. 
           Out the window, the first drops of a rain shower patter the 
           glass.

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           Heavy rain.

           June sits, leaning against her mother’s gravestone, eyes 
           closed, rain pouring down.

           A melancholic mood.

                                 COOPER (V.O.)
                        Dan Hopkins chose to end his book 
                        by quoting the last paragraph from 
                        Camus’ novel The Stranger, which 
                        describes the main character’s 
                        thoughts shortly after being 
                        sentenced to death.

                                 JUNE
                        People suck, mom.

           She sighs.

                                 COOPER (V.O.)
                        “As if this great outburst of anger 
                        had purged all my ills, killed all 
                        my hopes, I looked up at the mass 
                        of signs and stars in the night sky 
                        and laid myself open for the first 
                        time to the benign indifference of 
                        the world.”

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Dan, back row. The V.O. is Cooper reading the last pages from 
           his book:
                                 COOPER
                        “And finding it so much like 
                        myself, in fact so fraternal, I 
                        realized that I’d been happy, and 
                        that I was still happy.”

           INT. MORGAN HOME, LIVING ROOM -- SAME

           Bill by the coffee table, surrounded by the PICTURES of OLD 
           PEOPLE, working tirelessly. Flipping through the photos, he 
           bumps into a peculiar one:

           Melissa and Bill. A selfie. Something she took in between 
           professional shots.

           Bill stares at it, intently.

                                 COOPER (V.O.)
                        “For the final consummation and for 
                        me to feel less lonely, my last 
                        wish was that there would be a 
                        crowd of spectators at my execution 
                        --”

           EXT. CEMETERY -- SAME

           June again, curled up under the rain, hugging her knees. 

                                 COOPER (V.O.)
                        “-- and that they should greet me 
                        with cries of hatred.”

           June grabs a few twigs from the ground and stick them in the 
           dirt of her mother’s grave. Five of them, in the vague shape 
           of five fingers. 

           Like a hand sprouting out of the grave.

           June smiles. Now just the rain sounding around her.

                                 JUNE
                        Zombie mom.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Dan PUKES violently in the toilet. He’s thinner. Weaker.

           Cancer taking its toll.
           Marches back to the...

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM  

           ... and throws himself on the couch. Exhausted. His PHONE 
           BEEPS, but he’s too tired to move.

           Falls asleep.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           Dan wakes up. Grabs his phone. It’s a CALENDAR REMINDER:

           Pay Lamaze Class.

           INT. LAMAZE CLASS -- DAY

           Dan walks into the mommy-crowded room. Plastic toy babies and 
           parents sitting in circle on the floor.

           They are doing breathing techniques. Fathers behind the 
           mothers, supporting their necks. The INSTRUCTOR guides them:

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Breathe in... breathe out...

           Dan spots Michelle. The only lonely mom. Approaches.

                                 MICHELLE
                           (whispering)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DAN
                        Where do I pay? I forgot, sorry -- 
                        where’s the... cashier?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        -- breathe out. Breathe in --

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s paid for already, don’t worry.

                                 DAN
                        I said I’d pay for it. I wanna pay 
                        for it.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        -- breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe

                           (angry-whispering)
                        Dan, it’s taken care of, okay? Now 
                        please. You’re interrupting.

           Dan pulls his wallet. Fishes a hundred.

                                 DAN
                        Here.

                                 MICHELLE
                        No, Dan, I -- stop it!

                                 DAN
                        I wanna pay for it, just --

           On cue, a TALL MAN emerges from a bathroom door and joins 
           Michelle. Looks from her to Dan.

                                 TALL MAN
                        What’s the problem here?

           One or two couples turn mean looks their way now -- could you 
           please?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No problem. Dan was just leaving.
                           (to Dan)
                        Dan, please. The class’ paid for, 
                        okay? Everything’s fine. Just go. 
                        Spend that on beer. Heroin. 
                        Whatever.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Is this Dan?

                                 DAN
                           (re: Tall Guy)
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 TALL MAN
                        I’m her brother and you need to 
                        back off, okay?

           Dan steps back, money in hand still.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        -- breathe in... focus on your 
                        lungs inflating and deflating --

           His eyes go around the room: all the couples holding their 
           plastic babies, doing their exercises.
           Their hands intertwined. A husband stroking a wife’s hair. 
           Another holding a plastic baby, smiling. Someone chuckles at 
           something their partner said.

           All this life, all this love, and he’s not a part of any of 
           it.

           Slowly, Dan back-steps towards the door. 

           EXT. LAMAZE CLASS 

           He closes the door and leans against it, lost look on his 
           face. Lights a cigarette.

           Looks down at his phone. The CALENDAR reads:

           THINGS TO DO:

           -- Pay Lamaze Class.

           And that’s all. Dan has nothing else.

           He pulls a drag from his cigarette. Drops it, steps on it, 
           turns back to the class.

           INT. LAMAZE CLASS  

           More decided now, Dan marches across the room, money in hand.

                                 DAN
                        Take it.

           Michelle can’t believe him.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Dan, for God’s sake, I --

                                 DAN
                        Take the money. I want to pay for 
                        it.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Hey, hey!

           Tall Man puts himself between Dan and Michelle. Dan tries to 
           squeeze through.

                                 DAN
                        Take the money!

                        I wanna pay for it! She’s my 
                        daughter!

           Michelle’s had enough:

                                 MICHELLE
                        No she’s not! Fuck off!

           Dan pauses -- he’s never seen Michelle lose her temper like 
           this. She’s up on her feet:

                                 MICHELLE
                        Fuck off! You don’t care about her, 
                        you don’t care about me, you just 
                        care about yourself!
                           (beat)
                        So fuck off!

           A beat.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Fuck off, Dan!

                                 DAN
                        No, you fuck off, you get to raise 
                        her!

           A deafening silence. Even Dan looks surprised at his words, 
           like he’s just realized where his anger comes from.

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Behind the wheel, car pulled over, Dan smokes the anger away.

           His phone BUZZES on the passenger.

           BILL CALLING.

           INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR -- LATER

           June zigzags through the crowd of cheerful and talkative 
           students, earbuds plugged in.
           Mrs. Simpson pops out from the crowd, suddenly a feet from 
           June.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June.

                                 JUNE
                           (startled)
                        Jesus Christ!

           Mrs. Simpson looks weird. No super-smile.

           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 

           June sits across from Mrs Simpson, who runs her eyes through 
           papers. Looks up a grave stare at June.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s wrong, Mrs. S?
                           (beat)
                        Shit, that didn’t sound good.

           Mrs. Simpson turns a paper June’s way.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        This is your in-class test from 
                        last week, June.

           A ‘D’.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Yeah. Oh.

                                 JUNE
                           (reading the test)
                        Is question four really wrong? 
                        Because I checked on the textbook 
                        and --

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June, I am going to ask you 
                        something, and I want you to be 
                        very honest, okay?

           A beat.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Do you feel like you’ve learned 
                        enough this year?
                                 JUNE
                        What?

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Do you feel like you’re ready for 
                        eighth grade?

                                 JUNE
                        Ready for -- of course I’m ready. 
                        It’s eighth grade, Mrs. Simpson 
                        not... Xavier’s School for Gifted 
                        Youngsters. 

           It dawns on June where this might be going:

                                 JUNE
                        What are you saying?

           Mrs. Simpson struggles with her words. Puffs her cheeks:

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June, we really don’t have enough 
                        here to approve you. You were doing 
                        better with the assignments, but 
                        this --

                                 JUNE
                        What? Nonono! It’s one test! I can 
                        improve!

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        -- just shows us that you’re not 
                        ready yet, and you don’t --

                                 JUNE
                        -- I can do better, I can study 
                        harder, please --

           Mrs. Simpson raises a hand for silence.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        Being held back is not a bad thing, 
                        June. Especially considering what 
                        you went through, it’s natural to 
                        have some difficulty. There’s no 
                        shame in it. 

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, the hell there isn’t! I’m being 
                        dinosaured!

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        What’s that?
           June pleads:

                                 JUNE
                        I’ll do better, Mrs. Simpson. I 
                        promise. Straight ‘A’s from now on. 
                        And I’ll wow your ass off on the 
                        final presentation, I swear.
                           (beat -- pleading)
                        Please. Please don’t dinosaur me 
                        over one bad test! 
                           (remembering:)
                        What about the assignments!? I’ve 
                        been acing all of them!

           A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        What?

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        June, come on. You didn’t even 
                        deliver the online ones. To 
                        underperform is one thing, but to 
                        not even try...

                                 JUNE
                           (almost to herself)
                        No, those were the ones Dan was 
                        supposed to...

           She shuts up in time. Mrs. Simpson doesn’t pick up on it. 
           Closes her file.

                                 MRS. SIMPSON
                        We’ll call your father before the 
                        weekend.

           June just stares, the floor giving out under her.

           She’s been dinosaured.

           EXT. SCHOOL YARD -- DAY

           June heavy steps through the clusters of shiny-happy-people. 
           Bad, bad mood.

           She goes by Erica, dino-girl, lonely under a tree. June’s 
           gaze lingers, only for a second.

           And then she turns and -- 

           Heather. Showing her phone to yet ANOTHER BITCHY GIRL. Eyes 
           on June.
           That’s it.

           June marches towards her. Heather tries to pull away, but 
           June’s faster.

           Snatches the phone.

                                 JUNE
                        What do you keep showing every --

           She freezes.

           Onscreen is a photo of her mother, face a pulp of blood and 
           shattered glass, arms at odd angles, lifeless behind a 
           steering wheel.

           A PAGE from a TABLOID NEWS WEBSITE -- RENOWNED PHOTOGRAPHER 
           DIES IN CAR ACCIDENT.

           June looks up, ‘confused’ too mild a word.

                                 HEATHER
                           (stuttering)
                        Big Head was the one who found it. 
                        I just showed it to the girls 
                        because they kept asking me to.

           June is frozen, speechless, emotionless, phone still in 
           hands, eyes still on Heather.

           Heather takes a careful step forward.

           This jolts June into action.

           She FLINGS the phone at Heather, who barely dodges in time.

           Then June lunges at her, vicious. A circle opens up. People 
           watch.

           By the curb, Dan’s car pulls over. He sees the commotion. 
           Steps out of the car.

           The school OFFICIAL approaches from the other end.

           June gets up. KICKS Heather on the ground. Brutal. 

                                 OFFICIAL
                        What is going -- oh my God!

           Dan gets to June faster. Picks her up like a sack of 
           potatoes. Drags her away.

           The official tends to Heather. Dan gets June in his car.
           INT. DAN’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan drives, June doesn’t look at him.

                                 DAN
                        What did she do?

                                 JUNE
                        Why are you here?

                                 DAN
                        ‘cause your dad doesn’t love you 
                        enough to pick you up from school, 
                        so he calls people who don’t love 
                        you at all to do it for him. What 
                        did she do?

           June reaches for Dan’s CIGARETTE PACK and grabs one.

           Dan takes it out of her mouth. She grabs another. Dan takes 
           it out again.

                                 DAN
                        Stop it.

           She grabs another. He pulls it out.

                                 DAN
                        Stop it! What happened?

                                 JUNE
                        Nothing. Whatever. Just drive. 
                        Idiot.

           Dan raises an eyebrow. A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        I saw my mom.

           Dan glances.

                                 DAN
                        Was she suddenly behind you in the 
                        bathroom mirror when you closed the 
                        medicine cabinet?

                                 JUNE
                        That’s not funny.

                                 DAN
                        Okay. Where did you see your mom?

                                 JUNE
                        I don’t wanna talk about it.
                                 DAN
                        Hey, I get that you’re angry, but 
                        why are you angry at me?

           Nothing.

                                 DAN
                        All right, then. Talk, don’t talk, 
                        I don’t care.

           After a beat, deadpan:

                                 JUNE
                        You didn’t send in my online 
                        assignments. I flunked out.

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        Oh, shit, June.

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah.

                                 DAN
                        I forgot. Sorry. Shit. I’ll call 
                        them. Tell them that --

                                 JUNE
                        -- that I’ve been paying you to do 
                        the assignments for me and you 
                        forgot to send them in? Yeah, 
                        that’s gonna play out just fine.
                           (beat)
                        Whatever, I’d probably have flunked 
                        out anyway.

           A beat.

                                 DAN
                        June, I --

                                 JUNE
                        Can you just... let me out of the 
                        car? I really don’t wanna be around 
                        anyone right now. Especially you.

           Dan pulls over by the curb. June just stares. An awkward 
           beat.

                                 DAN
                        You didn’t expect me to actually 
                        pull over, did you?
           She’s in no joking mood:

                                 JUNE
                        Fuck you.

           Steps out of the car. Dan rolls the window down.

                                 DAN
                        Hey, hey, come on! Don’t make me 
                        the bad guy here.

           June stops, but doesn’t turn.

                                 DAN
                        You’re the one who decided to cheat 
                        on your assignments. Don’t blame me
                        cause your little scheme didn’t 
                        work out. I’ll give you your money 
                        back, but don’t try to make me an 
                        asshole ‘cause I missed a couple of 
                        deadlines you were supposed to be 
                        keeping track of.

           June turns back. Now angry. Marches towards Dan.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, yeah? Can I make you an asshole 
                        ‘cause you abandoned your unborn 
                        daughter?

                                 DAN
                        How did you --

                                 JUNE
                        That chick came by your house to 
                        tell you the due date, even though 
                        you told her you wouldn’t be there.
                        So excuse me if I won’t let the 
                        heroin addict deadbeat dad take the 
                        moral high ground against me for 
                        cheating on my homework.

                                 DAN
                        It’s not that simple, June.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, fuck off, that’s just something 
                        grownups say when they screw up. 
                        You suck.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t suck.
                                 JUNE
                        You do suck. You’re this junkie... 
                        abandoner... asshole person who 
                        doesn’t give a shit about anyone. 
                        That girl needs you! You can’t 
                        abandon her like that! What gives 
                        you the right to -- you don’t 
                        abandon someone just cause...

           She pauses, tries to keep it together.

                                 JUNE
                           (realization)
                        You’re a terrible person.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, well, I’m dying, I’m allowed.

                                 JUNE
                           (serious, calm)
                        No you’re not. You’re not allowed. 
                        You think the world exists for your 
                        benefit and that nothing matters 
                        after you die, but it’s not true.

           A beat.

                                 JUNE
                        Yeah, I googled solipsism. It’s 
                        bullshit. The world doesn’t stop 
                        existing when you die. Other people 
                        go on living. And they have to 
                        clean your mess after you’re gone.

           She takes a few steps back, turns her back on Dan.

                                 DAN
                        What do you know? You’re a fucking 
                        kid!

           She stops. Turns back one more time.

                                 JUNE
                        I know you don’t abandon someone 
                        who needs you just cause you’re
                        suffering.

           She’s talking about Dan but she’s talking about Bill too.
           EXT. PARK -- NIGHT

           Dead quiet around the dead tree. A HOMELESS MAN leaned 
           against it, perhaps, singing ‘Molly Malone’, Clockwork Orange 
           style.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM 

           Dan on the couch. Wrapped in a blanket. Defeated. Drunk.

           A KNOCK on the door.

                                 DAN
                        Go die a death!

           Crusty walks in. 

                                 CRUSTY
                        Hi, professor.

                                 DAN
                        Not a good time, Crusty.

                                 CRUSTY
                        There are no good times, professor. 
                        You said that to me once.
                           (beat)
                        And I just came for the Campbell.

           Dan frowns.

                                 CRUSTY
                        The Hero With a Thousand Faces, 
                        professor.

                                 DAN
                        It’s in the --

                                 CRUSTY
                        I got it.

           Crusty removes JOSEPH CAMPBELL’S THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND 
           FACES from Dan’s book shelf. 

                                 CRUSTY
                        Thank you, professor.

           Then heads for the fridge, opens, grabs a beer. 

                                 DAN
                        No.

           Crusty freezes.
                                 DAN
                        No. Put it back.

           Puts the beer back in the fridge, confused. He never gave a --

                                 DAN
                        You’re fourteen. Stop drinking my 
                        beer. Stop drinking beer. Go bully 
                        people online. Go... make a tree 
                        house. Go have pimples.

           Crusty steps away. Heads for the door. Not mad, just 
           confused.

           Walks out, closes the door.

                                 DAN
                        And stop selling heroin!

           INT. JUNE’S BEDROOM -- MORNING

           June in bed, eyes open, staring at the ceiling.

           NOISES downstairs. FOOTSTEPS and THUDS.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           June stops on the last few steps to find her father packing 
           in the living room.

                                 JUNE
                        Dad?

           Bill stops, turns. Smiles.

                                 BILL
                        June. Morning! I was waiting for 
                        you to wake up.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s all this?

                                 BILL
                        We’re moving! Well. For a while.

                                 JUNE
                        Moving?

                                 BILL
                           (beaming)
                        Yeah! With Grandma.
                                 JUNE
                        Grandma as in Grandma, Arizona?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah. Just for a year or two, until 
                        we sell the house. It’s for the 
                        best, right? Moving on and all 
                        that.
                           (beat)
                        Plus it gives us time to finish 
                        organizing your mother’s new book!

           Bill resumes packing, all smiles. All excitement. Full on 
           denial.

                                 JUNE
                           (hazed)
                        What about school?

                                 BILL
                           (still packing)
                        It’s a year off, you’ll catch up, 
                        right? You’re smarter than the 
                        whole lot of ‘em.

           June, lost.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, KITCHEN -- LATER

           Cereal. Milk. Spoon. Pour.

           June throws herself on the chair in front. Grabs the spoon. 
           It slips to the floor. 

           Some cereal and milk spilled. Not a lot. But. Ugh. God. 
           Jesus.

           June. Indifferent. Eyes on the spilled milk and cereal.

           She SLAPS the bowl from the table to the floor. Not angry, 
           just bored. Like a cat would.

           It crashes in an explosion of milk and Cheerios.

           INT. STARBUCKS -- AFTERNOON

           Dan at the end of the cashier line. He’s frail. Thinner than 
           ever.

           The VALLEY GIRL, first in line, ordering:
                                 GIRL
                        Can I get it with, like, half two 
                        percent milk and half half and 
                        half?

           BARISTA is confused.

                                 BARISTA
                        Half half and half?

                                 GIRL
                        Like, pour a little bit of two 
                        percent, then a little bit of half 
                        and half, like, half and half of 
                        half and half and two percent. Can 
                        you do that?

           On Dan, annoyed. 

                                 GIRL
                        And the Macadamia nuts too. Oh, no, 
                        wait. How many calories in it?

                                 BARISTA
                        You have to check the label.

           She does so, no hurry.

           Dan, more upset.

           After a beat, he’s had enough. Pushes past the line to the 
           front.

           Nudges the girl.

                                 DAN
                        Hi. Excuse me.

           The girl turns.

           Dan stares at her. About to say something, but... doesn’t.

           Just stares.

                                 GIRL
                        Sir?

           Blank stare. His breathing goes shallow.

                                 GIRL
                        Sir?

           He collapses.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           A TUBE TELEVISION on the wall shows an ad for some bank 
           insurance bullshit: a perfect family on a perfect lawn, 
           smiling and waving.

           In front of the TV on a gurney, Dan watches it, his body 
           barely lumping the white blanket it’s under. 

           A lone and dying man. Big contrast with the family ad.

           A NURSE walks in. Busy. Indifferent.

                                 NURSE
                           (in one bored breath)
                        Hello Mr. Hopkins I’m Sandy how are 
                        you how long have you know about 
                        your stage four carcinoma?

                                 DAN
                        Don’t call it that.

           She looks up at him.

                                 DAN
                        Carcinoma. Creeps me out.

           She looks down at her papers.

                                 NURSE
                        Well, good news. You’re just having 
                        some oxygenation issues, which 
                        sounds bad, but really, it’s 
                        nothing to be alarmed about for 
                        now. But it is bound to happen 
                        again.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll be on alert.

                                 NURSE
                        Are you married?

                                 DAN
                        Like what you see?

           Nurse doesn’t even register the joke. Keeps talking:

                                 NURSE
                        You should consider hiring 
                        professional in-home care if you 
                        don’t have anyone in your life. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        It’s highly recommended that you 
                        don’t spend time by yourself in 
                        your situation. Do you have anyone? 
                        To take care of you?

           Dan stares at her. Doesn’t say anything. The nurse gives him 
           a CARD.

                                 NURSE
                        This is for a Home Care service. 
                        They mostly deal with old people, 
                        but they have experience with 
                        patients in your situation as well.

           She turns around and a second later she’s gone. Dan keeps his 
           eyes on the door, ajar. Then looks at the card.

           It dawns on him: he has no one in his life.

           A HAND closes in on the door knob. Small. Girly. 

           June?

           Dan raises his head from the pillow.

           But a random YOUNG GIRL walks in, sees Dan, pauses. Eye-to-
           eye. Wrong room.

           Then she’s gone, closing the door behind her.

           Dan rests his head back on the pillow. 

           Alone.

           INT. BILL’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Bill drives.

           June is in the backseat. Depressed. Indifferent. Angry.

           She has her head leaned against the window. Raindrops, pushed 
           backwards by the wind, race each other on the glass.

           EXT. BABY STORE -- NIGHT

           Dan stares at a ONESIE, newborn sized, on the window display. 
           His thin reflection stares back, translucent, dark, 
           superimposed over the piece of clothing.

           He’s now sporting an oxygen tank, tubes going into his 
           nostrils.
           The onesie reads: “They shake me.”

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- LATER

           Dan drives, the onesie by his side on the passenger seat.

           EXT. MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATER

           Dan climbs the steps, onesie in hand. He RINGS the DOORBELL.

           A beat.

           The door comes open just a crack. It’s not Michelle, but an 
           OLDER WOMAN.

                                 DAN
                        Michelle there?

           This lady doesn’t like Dan.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        She’s busy.

           Dan shows the onesie.

                                 DAN
                        I --

           She snatches the onesie.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Thank you.

           Dan peeks into the room. The glimpse of a stroller. A baby 
           hand sprouting from it, reaching for a mobile.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        You should go.

                                 DAN
                        Where’s Michelle?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        She’s resting.

           The Tall Man from Lamaze -- Michelle’s brother -- shows up 
           behind the woman.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Is there a problem here?

           Dan keeps trying to peek inside. See his baby.
                                 DAN
                        No, I --

                                 TALL MAN
                        Michelle doesn’t want you here, 
                        okay, buddy? Let’s not start 
                        anything.

           Dan gets one more peek, between the two, at the baby. Sees a 
           face. His daughter.

           For a second. It’s all he gets. The door SLAMS in his face.

           EXT. PARK -- NIGHT

           Dan, oxygen mask and all, stands in front of the dead tree.

           The HOMELESS GUY that was here earlier stops by his side, 
           studies the tree too.

                                 DAN
                        Did you know I planted this tree?

                                 HOMELESS
                        That true?

           Homeless guy goes on his way, uninterested. 

           Dan keeps looking at the tree.

                                 DAN
                           (to himself)
                        No.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- LATER

           Miserable Dan climbs the stairs with difficulty. Cancer’s 
           taking its toll hard now.

           He reaches the right floor to BANGS and THUDS and YELLS.

           Stops.

           At the end of the corridor, next to his door, a FAT MAN in a 
           stained sleeveless shirt bangs against Crusty’s door.

           Crusty’s father.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Open the fucking door you faggot 
                        fucking --
           BANG BANG BANG.

           The man body-slams the door. It doesn’t come open. He’s drunk 
           as shit. Turns around. Notices Dan.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Did I shit my pants or sumthin?

           Dan walks. His dragging feet and oxygen tank betray his 
           condition, but his face is fierce. Deep, dark eyes.

           Stops an inch from the man’s face. Eye-to-eye, breath-to-
           breath.

           A long, tense beat. Then:

                                 DAN
                        One day there will be a family 
                        album and you won’t be in it. And 
                        no one will know your name, and it 
                        will be like you never happened.

           Dan lingers for a beat more, then turns back and drags 
           himself and his oxygen tank towards his door.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan, eyes closed, couch. No beer. No cigarette.

           He opens his eyes. Notices the DVD on his coffee table. 
           June’s assignment.

           Then closes his eyes. 

           Maybe this is how he dies. Maybe he hopes it.

           EXT. FLAGSTAFF HOUSE -- MORNING

           Establish. Beautiful and idyllic under the first snow. 

           INT. FLAGSTAFF HOUSE, KITCHEN -- SAME

           Scrambled eggs HISSING in a pan.

           June is at the table. GRANDMA at the stove. Turns; frying pan 
           in hands.

                                 GRANDMA
                        How’d you like your eggs, Junebug?
                                 JUNE
                        Stillborn.

           Grandma pauses.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Scrambled’s all we got.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Scrambled is fine.

           Grandma pours some scrambled for June. Turns back to the 
           stove.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Should we expect your father for 
                        breakfast?

                                 JUNE
                        You know him longer than I do.

           Grandma turns a look inside the house. Then back at June.

                                 GRANDMA
                        We shouldn’t.

           INT. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

           Dan, back row.

           Cooper:

                                 COOPER
                        Now that we went through the book 
                        together, I’d like to organize a 
                        more comprehensive debate on the 
                        themes explored in The Great 
                        Nothing.

           Dan fiddles with June’s DVD, distracted. Something on his 
           mind.

                                 COOPER
                        It’s a very divisive book, as I’m 
                        sure you’re all well aware, and 
                        what I’d like us to do now is --

           Something clicks on Dan’s mind. He gets up, starts for the 
           door. Cooper takes notice.

                                 COOPER
                        Ah, shame. I was looking forward to 
                        your intake.
           Dan stops.

                                 COOPER
                        Well? Did I manage to change your 
                        mind at least?

           Dan sighs. Heads for Cooper’s table. Grabs his copy of the 
           book. Turns it around.

           Raises the back cover to his face, smiles like his smile in 
           the author photo.

           Cooper sees through the beard and the sickness into who Dan 
           is.

                                 COOPER
                        You’re --

                                 DAN
                        Life sucks, we all die, there’s no 
                        hope, you suck at interpreting 
                        things. Deal with it.

           He grabs Cooper’s PEN from his shirt pocket, opens the book, 
           signs it and throws it back to Cooper.

           Walks out.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           A DRAWER pulls open. Needles rattle back and forth inside.

           A pair of hands grab them all.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM  

           Dan pours the needles into the toilet.

           Turns around. Looks at himself in the mirror. Broken, bum-
           like and cancer-thin.

           Something crosses his mind. He grabs a RAZOR.

           ANGLE ON

           Thick clumps of hair dripping down to the sink.

           LATER

           Beardless Dan stares into the mirror. Pale. Sunken eyes. 
           Really thin. 
           But it’s a person again. There’s life behind the eyes.

           He flushes the needle-filled toilet. Leaves the bathroom.

           We stay on it, just enough to see the toilet overflowing, 
           needles pouring out in waves.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           Dan on the phone.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah. Bill Morgan, please. Daniel 
                        Hopkins.
                           (beat)
                        Flagstaff?
                           (beat)
                        No, I know his mother lives there, 
                        I’ve --
                           (beat)
                        Thank you.

           Dan hangs up. Dials a different number now. Bill’s.

           INT. DAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- DAY

           Dan steps out. Stops. A small commotion is going on.

           Paramedics remove a LARGE BODY covered from head to toe from 
           Crusty’s apartment.

           Crusty’s father. Dead.

           Crusty stands by the door, watching as they take his father 
           away. In shock.

           Dan locks eyes on him. He looks lost, so lost.

           Dan approaches.

                                 CRUSTY
                        He ODed.

           A beat.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I wasn’t even there. 
                           (beat)
                        I swear.

           He says it almost as if he’s explaining himself.
                                 DAN
                        I wouldn’t judge.

           A beat. Then Crusty hugs Dan hard. Cries.

           They break off.

                                 CRUSTY
                        How soon are you dying, professor?

                                 DAN
                        I don’t know, Crusty. Pretty soon.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I was looking forward to having you 
                        as a substitute father figure.

           Dan makes a fist.

                                 DAN
                        I do have a good left.

           Crusty chuckles.

                                 CRUSTY
                           (through chuckles)
                        That is incredibly sad.

           They smile. Then they don’t.

                                 CRUSTY
                        It’s going to be quieter without 
                        you, professor.

           Dan nods.

                                 DAN
                        Are you gonna stop dealing heroin?

           A beat.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I don’t really deal heroin, 
                        professor.

           Dan frowns.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Zack, on the fifth floor, sells it, 
                        I just get it from him and sell it 
                        to you for a profit.

           Dan chuckles. Nods. Pats Crusty on the back.
                                 DAN
                        You’re gonna be fine, Crusty.

           He turns.

                                 CRUSTY
                        Professor.

           Dan turns. Crusty holds his book up, the one he borrowed: The 
           Hero With a Thousand Faces. Quotes by heart:

                                 CRUSTY
                        “The hero must put aside his pride, 
                        his virtue, beauty and life, and 
                        bow or submit to the absolutely 
                        intolerable.”

           Dan nods.

           INT. DAN’S CAR -- AFTERNOON

           Dan drives down a highway.

           INT. CLASSROOM -- SAME

           Mrs. Simpson sits in front of the empty classroom, grading 
           students.

           The school OFFICIAL walks in. DVD in hand.

                                 OFFICIAL
                        Someone left this for you.

           Puts it on top of her desk. Walks away.

           Mrs. Simpson sticks the DVD in her computer. Curious.

           The screen comes alive. The priest, from the interviews.

                        What’s Christian Heaven like?

                                 PRIEST
                        Well, there’s no real descriptions 
                        of ‘heaven’. But the Book of 
                        Revelations describes New Jerusalem 
                        like this:
                           (reading from Bible)
                        A river, clear as crystal, will 
                        flow from the throne of God and of 
                        the Lamb down the middle of the 
                        city.
           INT. DAN’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Dan drives. The road sign reads STATE LIMIT CALIFORNIA 
           ARIZONA.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        On each side of the river there 
                        will be a tree of life, yielding 
                        twelve kinds of fruit every month. 
                        The streets will be pure gold.
                        There will be no more death or 
                        mourning or crying or pain, for the 
                        old order of things will have 
                        passed away.

                        -- there are Jews who believe.

                        What about you?

                        I don’t know.

           INT. DAN’S CAR 

           Dan’s PHONE rings. Skype call.

           He pulls to the side of the road. Takes the call.

           It’s Michelle.

           As the Rabbi speaks, Michelle takes Dan’s DAUGHTER on her lap 
           and shows her to Dan.

                                 RABBI (V.O.)
                        But I think we worry too much about 
                        what comes next. I think here is 
                        where we should focus our hearts 
                        and minds. This life we lead. These 
                        people we love. This world we get 
                        to inhabit with all its wonderful, 
                        wonderful things to experience.
           Dan, emotional. Waves at his daughter. Cries.

           He’s at his frailest here. Weak and thin. But there’s joy in 
           his tears.

                        Many are just muslins of tradition,

           EXT. FLAGSTAFF HOME  -- NIGHT

           Dan pulls over in front of June’s Grandma’s farmhouse. Dials 
           his phone. Steps out.

                                 MUSLIM SCHOLAR (V.O.)
                        No, who can be sure?

                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        What makes you believe, then?

           Bill steps out of the house. Goes for Dan.

                                 MUSLIM SCHOLAR (V.O.)
                        Faith? I don’t know. It would be 
                        very sad if all of this beauty, 
                        this wonder around us was for 
                        nothing. I hope there is more to 
                        it. I really do.

           Bill reaches Dan. It’s all dark and cold and it’s dead quiet.
                                 MUSLIM SCHOLAR (V.O.)
                        I really do.

                                 DAN
                        Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Dan. Is everything all --

                                 DAN
                        Bill. Look at me. What are you 
                        doing?

           Watching through the window inside the house is June. She 
           makes no attempt to get Dan’s attention, and he doesn’t 
           notice her.

                                 BILL
                        What?

                                 DAN
                        What are you doing here, Bill?

                                 BILL
                        Oh. I just needed some time away 
                        from it all. To work on Melissa’s 
                        book. You know how LA can be if -- 

                                 DAN
                        Bill, she’s dead.

                                 DAN
                        Say it. I’ll say it and then you 
                        say it, okay?

           A beat.

                                 BILL
                        Dan, what are you --

                                 DAN
                        I’m going to die, Bill. I’m going 
                        to die this month.

           Bill looks horrified. Dan pulls him close. Breathing fast. 
           Urgent.
                                 DAN
                        I’m going to die and it’s horrible, 
                        and I hate it. It makes me want to 
                        scream, and every time I see 
                        someone smiling I take it 
                        personally, because how can anyone 
                        be happy when I’m dying? I want 
                        them to die with me, to die instead 
                        of me. I want them to suffer too. I
                        want everyone to feel what I’m 
                        feeling because I don’t think it’s 
                        fair that the world will go on 
                        without me, that there’ll be a 
                        Superbowl after I die and new popes 
                        and presidents and rainy Sunday 
                        mornings I’ll never get to see, and 
                        I feel horrible for feeling like 
                        this and I feel so, so alone and 
                        I’m so scared, Bill, I’m so scared 
                        I can’t even say my name out loud. 
                        I don’t wanna die Bill, I don’t. I 
                        really, really don’t. I’m 
                        terrified.
                           (beat)
                        But I’m here. I’m still here.

                        I’m still here.

                                 BILL
                        I don’t have --

                                 DAN
                        Say it. Say she’s dead. 

                                 BILL
                        Dan...

                                 DAN
                        You’re never gonna hear her voice. 
                        Say it. You’re never going to wake 
                        up next to her again. Say it. The 
                        smell on her side of the mattress 
                        is gone already. Whenever something 
                        happens to you, whenever you see 
                        something on your way to work, you 
                        won’t have her to tell later. Ever. 
                        It was all for nothing. Say it. 
                        That’s how you feel. So say it. Say 
                        that she’s --
                                 BILL
                        Fuck you.

                                 DAN
                        Say it.

           Bill looks up. Crying.

                                 BILL
                        Fuck you. She’s dead. Melissa’s 
                        dead. Fuck you.

                                 DAN
                        Yes, she’s dead. She’s dead. She’ll 
                        always be dead now. Always. It’s 
                        over, forever.

                                 BILL
                        She’s dead! Fuck you! What do you 
                        want from me!?

           Dan pulls Bill close. Bill pushes him, Dan tries again. Bill 
           fights. Then he doesn’t.

                                 BILL
                        She’s dead, Dan! She’s dead! She’s 
                        dead...

           Breaks down in tears, holding Dan tight.

                                 BILL
                           (sobbing)
                        She’s dead.

                                 DAN
                        She’s dead...

           Bill is almost on his knees.

                                 DAN
                        ... but she’s not.

           Over Bill’s shoulder, Dan locks eyes with June across the 
           window in the distance, inside the house.

           Bill sobs and sobs.

                                 DAN
                        She needs you, Bill. Your daughter 
                        needs you.

           EXT. FLAGSTAFF HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dan steps back into the car as a broken Bill makes his way to 
           the house again.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        And some day yonder, we’ll never 
                        more wander.
                        But walk on streets that are purest 
                        gold.
                           (chuckles)
                        That’s what I hope it’s like, 
                        anyway.

           Dan starts the engine. Eyes straight ahead.

           Then a figure runs from the house towards the car. June, in a 
           childlike sprint, barefoot on the grass, past her father, 
           urgent bordering on desperate.

           The way from house to car seems awfully long. The distance 
           much too great between them. But June gallops on.

           She finally reaches Dan. Stops by the car.

           Dan looks so old and frail and almost done.

           Her eyes stop dead on his.

           The driver’s window between them. Neither smile. Both look 
           scared.

           The moment is not beautiful and it’s not sad. It’s intense.

           June takes a step back, almost trips, startled by his sick 
           appearance, highlighted by the lack of beard.

           Dan keeps his wide eyes on June. She breathes fast, confused, 
           startled, horrified, depressed, dizzy, lonely, angry, sad.

           A long, tense beat.

           Dan shifts the gear. Turns ahead. Starts driving away.
                                 JUNE
                           (whisper)
                        No.

           The car starts down the dirt road.

           June’s eyes are fierce. Mad. No he won’t.

                                 JUNE
                           (louder)
                        No. No!

           She kneels. Grabs a pebble. Runs after the car, throws it, it 
           BANGS against the back window.

           Dan keeps driving, eyes ahead, forcing himself to ignore.

           June throws another stone, bigger. The car faster by the 
           second. She struggles to catch up, running faster, faster, 
           faster --

                                 JUNE
                        No! No!

           Finally grabs a stone big enough to do some damage. LUNGES 
           it.

           It crashes the back window, and the car finally stops.

           June pants. Her breath foggy puffs of cold. Her shoulders up 
           and down.

           Then the car door comes open. 

           Dan steps out.

           A showdown, eye-to-eye. A long beat.

           Then she runs towards him and BAM -- the hug almost brings 
           him down.

           He doesn’t hug back right away. Then he does.

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           ... Bill watches the scene through a window -- Dan and June 
           two small figures in the barren cold outside.

           Around him, the whole room a mess of black-and-white-old-
           people photographs hanging from the walls.

                        That I’m sure.

           He smiles.

                                 DAN
                        Or... you know: nothing means 
                        anything, death is the end, 
                        everything is horrible.

           The priest nods in agreement.

                                 PRIEST
                        Either way.

           They both smile.

           INT. JUNE’S BEDROOM -- DAY

           June sleeps like a drunken sailor -- arms dangling off the 
           bed, mouth open, snoring.

           The door comes open to Bill, looking better than we’ve seen 
           him yet. We get a sense that a few days have passed.

                                 BILL
                        June. Breakfast. Help. Need

           BANGS the door shut and June wakes up with a start.

           INT. MORGAN HOME, KITCHEN -- LATER

           June takes her place at the table.

           Bill pours some food on her plate, some on his, takes a seat.

           Grabs an ENVELOPE from the table.

                                 BILL
                        Arrived today. They still want you

                        pick up your stuff from your 
                        locker, but...
                                 JUNE
                        What’s -- oooh, nooo!

           She SNATCHES the SCORECARD from his hand. Pulls it from the 
           envelope (it’s open already). Reads it.

                                 BILL
                        Mrs. Simpson called, and I

                           (beat)
                        Well. She said that someone 
                        delivered your final assignment to 
                        her.

           June looks up.

                                 BILL
                        She was very impressed. But it 
                        still took a lot to convince her.

           June. Grateful beyond words -- for Dan and Bill.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        It’s still a bad grade, even if you 
                        passed. I was never a C student. 
                           (beat)
                        And neither was your mother. 

           June looks up and, in this brief moment, they both 
           acknowledge Melissa’s absence -- now in acceptance. 

           INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR -- DAY

           June rains down her belongings from her locker to her 
           backpack. Closes it. End of semester.

           Turns to look at the deserted school corridor.

           EXT. SCHOOL YARD -- MOMENTS LATER

           June emerges out to the yard. A few scattered students, but 
           mostly empty.

           She spots ERICA STATEN under a tree. The girl-who-was-held-
           back-twice. Lonely.

           A beat. Then: Why not?

           June approaches, stands between Erica and the sun.

                                 JUNE
                        Hey.
           Erica turns a look like June’s an alien. June offers her a 
           hand.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m June.

           Erica scoffs. Gets up.

                                 ERICA STATEN
                        Freak.

           She makes her way past June towards the street in clumsy 
           steps. 

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           Bright and sunny and beautiful -- the polar opposite of our 
           overcast opening scene.

           June plays her videogame at her usual spot, sitting against 
           her mother’s tombstone.

           Onscreen, her character dies. GAME OVER.

           She puts the game down. Gets up. Looks at her mom’s stone.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh! Right.

           Fishes in her backpack. Pulls a PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK.

           The cover is the old man in front of the clocks we’ve seen 
           before. The title reads LEGACY -- A COLLECTION BY M. MORGAN.

                                 JUNE
                        Dad wanted you to have this.

           She rests the book by the stone. Pauses.

           Stops her eyes on the zombie twig hand she made earlier.

                                 JUNE
                        High five, zombie mom.

           High fives it. The twigs collapse. June gets up. One final 
           SIGH. Peace.

           Makes her way back, threading between the stones...

           ... stops by a particular one. From behind, we can’t see the 
           name or the inscription.

           She hangs for a beat.
           Then REVERSE ANGLE...

           ... shows us the headstone. Unmarked. 

           June fishes in her backpack, grabs a PUDDING CUP and rests it 
           by the stone. 

           A beat as she stares, emotional.

                                 CRUSTY (O.S.)
                        How horrible it is, to love 
                        something death can touch.

           June turns. Crusty’s here.

                                 CRUSTY
                        It’s a saying. Often attributed to 
                        Judah Halevi, a Spanish poet from 
                        the eleventh century.

                                 JUNE
                        Huh.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I think it’s the most real thing 
                        anyone’s ever said about death.

                                 JUNE
                        I like ‘How lucky I am to have 
                        something that makes saying goodbye 
                        so hard.’

                                 CRUSTY
                        Who said that one?

                                 JUNE
                        Winnie the Pooh.

           A beat. Crusty offers his hand.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I’m Crusty. I liked Daniel.

                                 JUNE
                        June. I liked Daniel too.

           They shake.  

           There’s a moment here. This is nice. This is oddly familiar.

           Crusty pulls something from his backpack and rests it against 
           the stone by June’s pudding cup.

           She kneels by his side to look. It’s a FRAMED CERTIFICATE:
           THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK

                   Make known to all men by these presents that

                     Daniel Francis Hopkins has been awarded

                   The Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction

                                      for

                              ‘The Great Nothing’

           Crusty nods at the certificate.

                                 CRUSTY
                        I found it in his apartment. 
                        Thought he’d want it close.

                                 JUNE
                        Kind of defeats the purpose of the 
                        whole ‘unmarked grave’ thing, 
                        dontcha think?

           Crusty turns the certificate so it’s facing the stone now.

                                 CRUSTY
                        There.

           He sits on the grass, and June does too. A beat goes by. 

                                 CRUSTY
                        He was a nice person.

                                 JUNE
                        No, he wasn’t.
                           (beat)
                        But so what?

           June fishes for PUDDING CUPS in her backpack. We PULL BACK.

                                 JUNE
                        You want one?

           Crusty takes one. We keep pulling back. He says something. 
           June pulls the single EARBUD she has on to hear him better.

           We keep pulling. It’s sunny. It’s a beautiful day.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK

                                  THE END
