                   our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable 
                    of both inflicting injury, or remedying it.”

           EXT. THE TRAIN — ENGLAND — NIGHT

           Black stratus clouds sprawl across a soot-stained sky, 
           blanketing a STALLED PASSENGER TRAIN in nebulous film.

           A FALLEN PINE TREE blocks the train tracks, uprooted by A 
           BABY BLUE FORD ANGLIA 105E DELUXE smashed into the base of 
           the tree. It steams in curled spirals towards the sky.

           THREE RAILROAD WORKERS rush towards the chaos in the storm.

           The CRACKLE of thunder rolls against the top of the caravan. 
           Fat raindrops pound the train's window, blurring the image 
           of—

           INT. THE TRAIN — ENGLAND — NIGHT

           JOANNE ROWLING, 25, who gazes out onto the obliterated 
           English countryside, mind elsewhere.

           The thunderstorm builds, GROWLS into the train, causing a 
           SLEEPING ELDERLY WOMAN to stir in the seat next to her.

           TWO BROTHERS, a BESPECTACLED GRADE-SCHOOLER and a PIMPLE-
           FACED MIDDLE SCHOOLER, play with twigs in seats across the 
           aisle.

           They hit their sticks together like sparring swords.

           A SNACK CART pushed by a petite, ELFISH MAN, with large ears 
           and bushy eyebrows, rolls by, exploding with treats—

           Chocolate clusters, candy canes, multi-colored jelly beans, 
           lollipops, rock cakes, marshmallows...

           Spotting a potential sale, the Elfish Man yanks the cart to a 
           halt in front of the boys, now salivating.

                                 ELFISH MAN
                        Any sweeties, gents?

           The boys whip their heads towards their MOTHER. The littler 
           brother tugs on her sleeve.

                                 BROTHERS
                             (in unison)
                        Mum. Mum. Mummmmmmm.

                                 MOTHER
                        No.

           The boys huff.
                                 ELFISH MAN
                        Better luck next time, eh?

           The Elfish Man heaves the cart down the aisle.

           The little brother picks up his stick, slashes it against his 
           big brother's arm.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        Got you!

           The big brother grips his bicep.

                                 BIG BROTHER
                        You cheated.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        Never let your guard down, big 
                        brother.

                                 BIG BROTHER
                        Fine, but mine isn't a sword 
                        anymore... it's a light saber.

           He hums the lightsaber's VRUMMMMMM! as he clashes his stick 
           against his sibling’s.

                                 BIG BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        And I just sliced through your 
                        sword.

           The little boy frowns.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        This isn't a sword.

                                 BIG BROTHER
                        What is it, then?

           A mischievous grin lights up the boy's face.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        A wand.

           Joanne's head pivots towards the children.

                                 BIG BROTHER
                        A wand?

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        AVADA KEDAVRA!

           He swishes his stick at his big brother.
           The older boy drops his stick and CLUTCHES HIS THROAT. He 
           CHOKES loudly.

           The little brother holds steady, his eyes narrow as his wand 
           trembles ever so slightly in his hand.

           The big brother fights for breath. His face balloons up, 
           turns purple. He takes a final, choppy breath, then—

           Joanne blinks, SNAPS OUT OF IT.

           The kids are fine.

                                                      BACK TO:

                                 LITTLE BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        This isn't a sword.

                                 BIG BROTHER
                        What is it, then?

           The same mischievous grin lights up the little boy's face.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        It's a Red-Ryder-carbine-action-air-
                        rifle. PEW PEW PEW PEW!

           Joanne sighs, turns towards the wet window.

           EXT. THE TRAIN — ENGLAND — NIGHT

           Through the glass we see Joanne, who stares down towards the 
           ashen-cloaked ground, watching rain bounce off the metal 
           tracks.

           But her daydream is interrupted by A LITERAL BOLT OF 
           LIGHTENING that strikes outside, the reflection of which 
           SLICES DOWN HER FOREHEAD.

           Joanne's eyes dart upwards.

           INT. THE TRAIN — ENGLAND — NIGHT

           She yanks a large bag up from under her seat, tears through 
           it. She pulls out books, hair ties, chapstick, tissues, empty 
           food wrappers...

           She GROANS, throws the bag to the ground.

           Her eyes move around the train, scanning the VARIOUS 
           PASSENGERS.
           She eyes the elderly woman next to her — still asleep.

           She spins around in her chair. TWO GOTH TEENAGERS make out 
           and grope each other aggressively.

                                 JOANNE
                        Um.

           They continue to consume one another.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           Nada.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (louder)
                        So sorry to bother you—

           The couple pulls apart, the girl's lips BRIGHT RED from 
           snogging.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Do either of you happen to have a 
                        pen?

           The boy READJUSTS his shorts. Joanne looks down, immediately 
           looks back up.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Oh! ...Never mind.

           She spins back around, gnaws at her lip.

           She stands, pushes past the elderly woman, who finally wakes 
           up as she squeezes by.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

           Joanne steps into the aisle.

           She approaches TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN sharing a paper bag of 
           chips (that's french fries, you Yankee wanker).

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Hi there, hello. Do either of you 
                        have a pen I could borrow?

                                 MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                        Oh, a pen. Hmmm. I don't think so. 
                        Milly, you got a pen?
                                 MILLY
                        No pen, love. Would you like a 
                        chip?

           She extends the greasy bag.

                                 JOANNE
                        That's alright, thanks.

           Joanne advances down the aisle.

           She stops in front of a YOUNG MOTHER, who rocks her NEWBORN 
           to sleep in her lap.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Hi. Do you have a pen?

                                 MOTHER
                        What?

                                 JOANNE
                             (louder)
                        A PEN!

           The sleeping baby wakes, cries.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, so sorry!

           She rushes further down the train car, spots a BUSINESS MAN 
           with a trendy '90s haircut and spray-tan. He stares at his 
           BLINKING PAGER.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Hi there—

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                             (without looking up)
                        Not interested.

           Joanne startles.

                                 JOANNE
                        No, I—

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        I'm married.

                                 JOANNE
                        Uh... Right.

           She turns towards the entire train.
                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (loudly)
                        Hello, everyone. Sorry to bother 
                        you. Does anyone have a pen?

           A few people look up.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        It would be a huge help if I could 
                        borrow one. I'm a writer — aspiring 
                        writer — and I've just had an idea 
                        for my first book. But if I don't 
                        write it down I'll lose it!

           No one cares.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        A pencil would do. Or a marker, 
                        even a crayon, really. An eyeliner 
                        pencil?!

           She laughs nervously.

           The passengers resume reading, stare at their laps, look out 
           the window.

           She huffs, squints further down the aisle.

           There, a dozen rows back, is a UNIVERSITY STUDENT in a 
           Cambridge sweatshirt doing a crossword... with a PEN!

           Joanne's eyes light up, she makes a run for it.

           She stops, composes herself.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to bother, but may I borrow 
                        your pen, just for a moment? It is 
                        unimaginably important.

           The student looks to his pen, frowns.

                                 STUDENT
                        I'm in the middle of a life-
                        changing crossword. Sorry lass.

           Joanne tries not to explode.

                                 JOANNE
                        Right, of course. Sorry to bother 
                        you then.

           But she doesn't leave. She just stands there, eyes huge.
           Another BOLT OF LIGHTENING lights up the train car.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        So... I'll just be going.

           In an instant, Joanne snatches the pen from the student's 
           hand, BOOKS IT down the train towards the loo.

                                 STUDENT
                        Bloody hell!

           She rips open the door to the lavatory and ducks inside.

           INT. TRAIN BATHROOM — NIGHT

           Joanne hurriedly locks the door behind her. She secures the 
           pen in her teeth, scans the room.

           She unravels a square of toilet paper and rips it off. She 
           plucks the pen from her mouth and writes, but the soft tissue 
           immediately RIPS.

           She pants, thinks.

           Her hand reaches into the TRASH BIN. She digs around, 
           extracts a cardboard toilet paper roll.

           She rips the roll down the center, flattens it.

           She presses it to the door, brings the pen to the cardboard, 
           scribbles.

           Her face hardens, her eyes dart from word to word — utter 
           focus.

           Then, she relaxes.

           She slides the pen behind her ear, examines her work, and 
           smiles.

                           TITLE CARD: “WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES”

           EXT. ROWLING RESIDENCE, TUTSHILL, ENGLAND — NIGHT

           A modest Scottish cottage. No frills, no fuss. A stony, vine-
           covered exterior and a crumbling brick roof. A wreath of 
           holly leaves festoons a heavy wooden door.
           INT. ROWLING DINING ROOM, TUTSHILL, ENGLAND — NIGHT

           Outdated furniture. An ornate rug. Rosebud wallpaper covered 
           in family photographs: two little girls and their adoring 
           parents — on holiday, birthdays, and most recently, at 
           Joanne's graduation from University. Ornamented green 
           garlands drape across the wall.

           It's a quaint, sweet home — if not a little sad.

           Joanne, wearing a bright red paper crown, sits at the dining 
           room table next to her sister DIANNE, two years younger and 
           in a similarly vibrant headdress.

           Adjacent to the girls is their father, PETER, a clinically 
           serious and no-nonsense man. No Christmas hat for this 
           Grinch.

           A meat pie, potatoes, carrots, a jug of wine, and four plates 
           adorn the table. The fourth plate, situated across from 
           Peter, sits above an empty wooden chair.

                                 DIANNE
                        It's about a magical boy?

                                 JOANNE
                        A wizard, yeah.

                                 DIANNE
                        And it's a children's book?

                                 JOANNE
                        Seven children's books. For his 
                        seven years at Hogwarts.

                                 DIANNE
                        Hogwarts?!

                                 JOANNE
                        I know it sounds mental Di, but the 
                        school, the professors, the 
                        spells... it was less of an idea 
                        than a real place.

           Peter kneads his forehead in his hand.

                                 DIANNE
                        Wow. Jo. It sounds... ambitious. I 
                        can't wait to read it.

                                 PETER
                        Please don't talk about this in 
                        front of your mother.
                                 DIANNE
                        Dad—

                                 PETER
                        She doesn't need to hear it. Not on 
                        Christmas.

                                 JOANNE
                        Mom's always supported my writing.

                                 PETER
                        When you were a child, yes, but 
                        where has it gotten you since? We 
                        don't want you to end up penniless, 
                        Jo. You graduated from college with 
                        a degree, something you can use. 
                        But you want to waste it by penning 
                        fantastical stories? She doesn't 
                        need to hear it.

           Joanne bites down on her lip, fights a response.

           ANNE, 45, skin and bones, in the final stages of multiple 
           sclerosis, unsteadily hobbles towards the table.

           Dianne rises, helps her mother to her seat. She hands her a 
           green paper crown.

           The silence between Peter and Jo is uncomfortable, bitter.

                                 ANNE
                        Thank you, love. What did I miss?

           Peter shoots Joanne a stern glare.

                                 JOANNE
                        Nothing, mum. I was just telling 
                        Dad I got promoted at Amnesty.

           A smile fills in Anne's hollow features.

                                 ANNE
                        Did you now?

                                 JOANNE
                        Mmm.

                                 ANNE
                        Well that's something to celebrate.

           Anne reaches for the wine jug. She picks it up, but her hand 
           trembles uncontrollably.
                                 PETER
                        Here.

           Peter takes the jug from his wife and pours the wine into 
           their glasses.

           Anne sighs — she didn't ask for help, but won't make a fuss 
           in front of her girls.

           Anne picks up her glass, wine splashing from side to side.

                                 ANNE
                        To Jo.

           Dianne and Peter raise their glasses, too.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Our working girl.

           INT. ROWLING RESIDENCE — MASTER BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Jo walks into her parents' plain bedroom, a patchwork quilt 
           under her arm.

           Anne reclines in bed, two pillows propped under her head. Her 
           hair is spread out in curls on the cotton. She's angelic.

           Jo drapes the quilt over her mother, tucks the edges around 
           her shoulders.

                                 ANNE
                        Do you remember when you were in 
                        secondary, and you'd crawl into my 
                        bed and tell me outlandish lies 
                        about what you did in school that 
                        day?

           Jo smirks.

                                 JOANNE
                        They weren't all lies.

                                 ANNE
                        You said Angus Colley had a horn 
                        growing between his eyes and that 
                        he chased you ‘round the yard with 
                        it.

                                 JOANNE
                        I think that was a metaphor for his 
                        stiffy.

           Anne bursts out laughing, playfully smacks her daughter.
                                 ANNE
                        You had quite the imagination.

           She glances towards the wall. The framed pages of "RABBIT, by 
           Joanne Rowling, age 6" are mounted proudly.

           Anne's eyes immediately well with tears.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I hope you still do.

                                 JOANNE
                        Oh, mum.

           She rubs her mother's hand.

                                 ANNE
                        You're so special. My Jo. My 
                        writer.

           She puts her hand over her heart.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        My chridhe. (heart)

           Joanne is on the verge of tears now, too.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I've got something for you.

           She pulls a brown paper-wrapped package covered in ink 
           drawings — little girls, a Christmas tree, stars, etc. out 
           from under the bed. She hands it to Jo.

                                 JOANNE
                        Aw, thanks mum.

           Joanne admires the drawings for a beat, then carefully peels 
           it open —

           A hand-knitted red sweater with the letter "J" in messy, gold 
           writing.

           Joanne examines the gift, the letter "J" is a almost 
           unreadable.

                                 ANNE
                        Wouldn't be Christmas without a new 
                        jumper. If only my hands were 
                        steady enough to make it legible.

           Joanne swallows, fights tears she doesn't dare let her mother 
           see.
           She squeeze's her mother's hand.

                                 JOANNE
                        It's your best yet.

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HALLWAY — DAY

           A MAIL CART, overflowing with a multitude of poorly wrapped 
           packages and letters haphazardly taped together, rolls across 
           a nondescript gray carpet.

           All of the envelopes are internationally post-marked from 
           SOUTH AFRICA.

           The office is loud, cluttered, phones ringing and people 
           yelling — a space too small for the employees it holds.

           The brick walls are covered in tribal artifacts, maps of 
           South Africa marked up in ink, and the organization's mission 
           statement—

           "We are independent of any government, political ideology, 
           economic interest or religion. Our vision is a world in which 
           every person enjoys all human rights."

           The Mail Cart, pushed by a BEARDED EMPLOYEE, passes MEN and 
           WOMEN hard at work — answering phones, delivering paperwork.

           The cart arrives at a door marked REFUGEE AFFAIRS. The door 
           opens and a hefty stack of envelopes is hurled from the cart, 
           landing at the feet of—

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, REFUGEE AFFAIRS — LONDON — DAY

           Joanne, who sits on the floor, sorting through a debris of 
           weathered, hand-written notes and dog-eared photographs of 
           AFRICAN MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.

           Legs crossed, she studies the mess of memories in front of 
           her. She plucks a letter from the disarray, her eyes move 
           over the words—

           "My name is Baako. I am 8. My mom and dad are dead and I am 
           in detention for 27 months. I feel so sad. Scared. I cut my 
           hand twice, but no one knows. I want to be free."

           Joanne lowers the letter, picks up a photograph of BAAKO — 
           wide-set eyes, dimples, and a picket-fence grin of white 
           teeth.
                                 MASON
                             (O.S.)
                        Joanne Rowling.

           Joanne looks up and sees MASON, 30, with horribly bleached-
           blonde hair and a sneer from ear-to-ear.

                                 JOANNE
                        What do you need, Mason?

           He walks into the room, STEPS on one of her letters.

                                 MASON
                        Nothing, really. Why aren’t you at 
                        the desk?

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm on lunch.

           Mason glances at his non-existent watch.

                                 MASON
                        Awfully long lunch.

           Joanne swallows, gathers up the letters from the floor.

           Mason looks out the doorway.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                             (yelling out the door)
                        Hey Alistair, found her.

           Mason turns back to Joanne, gives her a malicious grin.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Have fun.

           He SLITHERS out of the office.

           ALASTAIR, 40s, pale as a sheet with greasy, slicked-back onyx 
           hair and a hooked nose, comes to the doorway.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOANNE
                        Sorry Alastair, I was taking lunch.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Your lunch ended 20 minutes ago. We 
                        need you at the phones.

                                 JOANNE
                        Right. Won't happen again.
           Joanne plucks the letters from the floor.

           She brushes past a SEETHING Alastair on her way out. His eyes 
           NARROW as he watches her walk down the hall.

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, FRONT DESK — DAY

           DAVID BECKHAM clutches an ENERGY DRINK on the page of a 
           glossy advertisement. He smiles at us, his foot resting on 
           top of a FOOTBALL (that's a soccer ball, you American 
           tosser).

           Joanne shades in the football with a pen, adds slender wings 
           that sprout from each side.

           The phone on her desk RINGS, but Jo doesn’t seem to hear it. 

           The wings on the football FLUTTER.

           RING. RING.

           She watches her creation FLY OFF THE PAGE and BUZZ ACROSS THE 
           OFFICE.

           RING. RING. RI—

           It SMASHES against the wall, breaks.

           She snaps to, hurriedly grabs the receiver. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Amnesty International, African 
                        Research.

           A pause.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello?

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello? ...Hello?
                             (sotto)
                        Bullocks.

           She hangs up the phone, slinks down in her chair. 

           Her eyes peer nervously around the office. They find Mason, 
           who shakes his head in disapproval. 

           Like clockwork, Alastair appears at her desk, moue 
           intensified.
                                 ALASTAIR
                        Joanne! What did we just talk 
                        about?! 

                                 JOANNE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 ALISTAIR
                        I’m in meetings all day. I can’t 
                        answer the phones, that’s what we 
                        pay you for!

                                 JOANNE
                        I know. I—

                                 ALISTAIR
                        I don’t want to hear it. We need to 
                        talk.

                                 JOANNE
                        OK.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        In my office.

           Joanne's COWORKERS look up from their work with wide eyes — 
           like classmates ogling a student sent to the headmaster's 
           office.

           Mason WINKS at her.

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL — ALASTAIR'S OFFICE — DAY

           Alistair closes the door behind him.

           The room, like the rest of the office, is too small, stuffed 
           to the gills with unopened packages.

           He circles around to his wooden desk, also piled with third-
           world pleas, and lowers himself to a creaking chair.

           He speaks with a HISS, almost like a snake.

                                 ALISTAIR
                        Sit.

           She takes the seat across from him.

                                 JOANNE
                        I can’t apologize enough. 

           Alistair exhales deeply, tries not to explode.
                                 ALISTAIR
                        Joanne, I do believe you want to 
                        help these people... but this is 
                        not the place for you.

                                 JOANNE
                        Alistair. 

                                 ALISTAIR
                        We missed a call from our refugee 
                        representative in Sassou. There's 
                        no telling when he'll be able to 
                        call again. This is a huge set 
                        back.

           Joanne's mouth drops.

                                 ALISTAIR (CONT’D)
                        And this isn't an isolated 
                        incident. You are rarely where 
                        you're supposed to be. And when you 
                        are at the desk your mind is 
                        somewhere else entirely.

                                 JOANNE
                        I swear I will answer every phone 
                        call. I'll eat lunch at my desk, I 
                        won't take breaks—

                                 ALISTAIR
                        We have to let you go.

                                 JOANNE
                        Please.

                                 ALISTAR
                        We need someone who's committed, 
                        and you've disappointed me too many 
                        times.

           Joanne's spine stiffens.

           INT. KING'S CROSS STATION — NIGHT

           Joanne trudges through the train station.

           She carries a box of her office belongings: books, notebooks, 
           a stack of her drawings. The half-finished illustration of 
           David Beckham's transformed football rests on top. The famed 
           footballer seems to frown.
           INT. THE TRAIN — NIGHT

           A mostly empty train. Old and worn. The lights flicker.

           Joanne slumps down into a graffiti-covered seat.

           She pulls her drawings from the box, apathetically looks 
           through them: A three-headed dog, a deteriorating wizard's 
           hat with a quizzical face, a nearly-beheaded ghost.

                                 FATHER
                             (O.S.)
                        I told you not to touch it.

           Joanne glances across the aisle. A FATHER yanks a glass 
           ornament out of his FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON's hand.

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        It's to look at. Not to touch.

           He sets it down on the seat beside them, buries his head in a 
           newspaper.

           The little boy swings his legs back and forth from the train 
           seat. He gazes at the ornament, mesmerized.

           The boy reaches out a hand, strokes it gently.

           His father turns the page of his paper, bump's his son's arm.

           The ornament crashes to the ground, breaks in half.

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        For God's sake Charlie, what did I 
                        say?!

           His father reaches down, picks up the pieces.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'm sorry, daddy.

           The little boy hangs his head.

                                 FATHER
                        This was for your mother. She'll be 
                        so disappointed.

           His father shakes his head, resumes reading his paper.

           Charlie's brown eyes brim with tears.

                                 JOANNE
                             (O.S.)
                        Psst!
           Charlie looks around.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (O.S.)
                        Pssssst!

           The boy spots Joanne.

           She raises an eyebrow at him, points inside her box.

           The little boy rubs tears from his wet eyes.

           Jo reaches into the box with both hands, rummages around, and 
           extracts A BOW AND ARROW — that is, her hands miming holding 
           a bow and arrow.

           Her face is dead serious. She pulls the bowstring back, 
           squints one eye, aims, and SHOOTS.

           Charlie is stunned — what the hell just happened?

           Then, his face lights up with a huge grin.

           Joanne fights her own smile.

           Charlie turns away from Joanne, clasps his tiny hands around 
           his own makeshift weapon, and turns back to her.

           Joanne feigns terror at the sight of his bow.

           He mimics her same squint, pulls his hands back, shoots—

           And nails her right in the chest. The impact sends her FLYING 
           BACKWARDS.

           She clutches the fake arrow stuck in her heart. She pulls it 
           out, throws it to the floor.

           Her arms go slack at her side, her tongue falls dramatically 
           from her mouth.

           She stays eerily still for a beat, then cracks one of her 
           eyes open, peeks at Charlie.

           He explodes with giggles, presses his little hands to his 
           mouth.

           Jo grins back at him.

           INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX HALLWAY — NIGHT

           Joanne drags her feet down the splotchy carpet towards her 
           apartment.
           The sound of an ARGUING COUPLE YELLING echoes down the hall.

           She stops in front of her door, number 7, pulls off an 
           EVICTION NOTICE stuck with tape. She secures it between her 
           teeth, fumbles to stick the key in the door.

           INT. JOANNE'S STUDIO — DAY

           A shoe-box. Outdated and dirty. Minimalist — not by choice.

           A mattress with a comforter, a single pillow. A few piles of 
           clothes, and books — loads of them — lining the walls and 
           scattered in small stacks.

           Joanne drops the box of her things to the floor, kicks it to 
           the side.

           She sets the EVICTION NOTICE on the kitchen counter next to a 
           handful of other UNOPENED BILLS.

           She cracks open the fridge: half a loaf of bread, a block of 
           cheese, random condiments.

           She pulls out the bread, cheese, and a bottle of mustard.

           The cheese is camouflaged in mold. She carefully cuts the 
           fuzzy green bits off, is left with a small, edible chunk.

           She abandons it, spreads mustard on a piece of bread.

           She looks out her kitchen window onto the London street 
           — smoky, littered with trash, gray on gray on gray. A 
           HOMELESS MAN pushes a cart down the road.

           She takes a bite of her bread.

           INT. JOANNE'S STUDIO — NIGHT

           Joanne lies upside down on the cot, her feet on the pillow.

           She stares up at the ceiling. A WATER STAIN looks vaguely 
           like AN OWL.

           She twists her head, examines it.

           Her hand extends beyond her head to the floor. She grabs at a 
           book, a worn paperback of HONS & REBELS, by Jessica Mitford.

           She pulls out a pencil tucked in the back, flips through it, 
           finds a rare margin that hasn't been written in.

           She writes: "Harry... Owl. Ron..."
           She looks out of the corner of her eye and sees A MOUSE 
           scurry across the kitchen floor into a hole in the wall.

           "Ron... rat."

           She groans, puts the book down.

           INT. JOANNE'S STUDIO — NIGHT

           Joanne is asleep, right where we left her. Still upside down, 
           though the comforter is pulled around her torso.

           INT. JOANNE'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM — NIGHT — DREAM

           A CHILD'S MOBILE twists above a BLUE-EYED BABY GIRL.

           The infant gapes up at the toy, which creates a kaleidoscope 
           of dancing shadows on the wall.

           She blinks at the sound of a DOOR CREAKING OPEN.

           A MASSIVE SHADOW sweeps across the wall, falling across the 
           baby in her crib.

           The child gapes up at whatever is above her.

           A distant, blood-curdling SHRIEK.

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS rush into the room.

                                 MOTHER
                             (O.S.)
                        Get away from her!

           The baby's face contorts at the sound of her worried mum.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                             (O.S.)
                        Get back! Don't touch her!

           The woman's BREATH CATCHES.

           The shadow moves rapidly across the baby's face.

           The woman CHOKES, SUFFOCATES.

           The baby's eyes dart around the ceiling: the shadow dancing, 
           her mother's hair, and a flailing hand.

           Another moment of struggle, then SILENCE.

           The THUD of a body hitting the floor.
           The shadow moves over the little girl again. It gets closer, 
           and closer, enveloping the baby in darkness until her eyes 
           seem to turn black.

                                                      MATCH TO:

           INT. JOANNE'S STUDIO — BEDROOM — DAY

           Joanne's blue eyes open, blonde tendrils plastered to her 
           forehead with sweat.

           Her landline RINGS.

           She falls out of bed, grabs the phone corded to the wall.

                                 JOANNA
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello?

           Her expression shifts, hardens. The blood seems to drain from 
           her face.

           EXT. TUTSHILL, CHURCH — DAY

           Joanne sits against an ancient, twisted oak tree in a lush 
           garden. In a black dress and black Mary Janes she is the only 
           dark thing blooming in a garden of pastel roses.

           She looks out onto a PATCH OF GRAVESTONES, a tiny CHAPEL to 
           her right.

           A CROWD OF MOURNERS, all sheathed in ebony, gather outside 
           the church.

           Dianne steps across the gravestones towards her sister.

           She joins Jo, lowers herself to the dirt.

                                 DIANNE
                        Well that was horrible.

                                 JOANNE
                        Beyond. Do you think mum would have 
                        cared that the priest's fly was 
                        undone?

           Dianne guffaws.

                                 DIANNE
                        Was it?!
                                 JOANNE
                        Mmm. And he called her Anna.

                                 DIANNE
                        Bloody brilliant. He had one job to 
                        do.

           They sit in uncomfortable silence for a beat.

                                 JOANNE
                        What are we going to do with her 
                        ashes?

                                 DIANNE
                        Dad wants to hide them away. Out of 
                        sight, out of mind.

                                 JOANNE
                        Sounds like dad.

                                 DIANNE
                        What do you think she'd want us to 
                        do with her holy remains?

                                 JOANNE
                        Flush them down the toilet, 
                        probably.

                                 DIANNE
                        You're right. Good riddance, she’d 
                        say. Get me the hell out of here.

           Joanne smiles halfheartedly.

                                 JOANNE
                        Di... I'm leaving. I got a job in 
                        Portugal, teaching English.

                                 DIANNE
                        Portugal? What about Amnesty?

           Joanne offers a knowing look.

                                 JOANNE
                        I've been fired from every job in 
                        London. Mum's gone. I need 
                        something to change.

                                 DIANNE
                        But Portugal? You don't speak 
                        Portuguese.
                                 JOANNE
                        Not a lick. But it'll be a 
                        distraction. I don't know anyone. 
                        Plenty of time to write. Besides, I 
                        leave tomorrow.

                                 DIANNE
                        Tomorrow?

                                 JOANNE
                        Why wait?

                                 DIANNE
                        Well, can I visit?

                                 JOANNE
                        You'd better, you little shit.

                                 DIANNE
                        Good. I'll get a nice tan.

           The girls spot Peter standing across the graveyard, frowning.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        I'd better go help dad. See you 
                        after, yeah?

           Joanne nods. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Would you say bye for me? 

           Dianne’s eyebrows raise in shock. 

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Please?

                                 DIANNE
                        OK.

           Jo smiles at her sister. Dianne walks across the grass.

           Joanne and Peter's eyes meet. They stare at each other for a 
           tension-filled beat.

           INT. JOANNE'S STUDIO — DAY

           The bed is stripped, her comforter and sheets balled up on 
           the mattress.

           She throws clothes and shoes haphazardly into a suitcase. She 
           sits on the case, squishes everything down.
           She examines her many piles of books, pulls out a select few 
           from the stacks — BLACK BEAUTY, EMMA, and a well-thumbed copy 
           of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.

           With novels in one hand and her suitcase in the other, 
           Rowling takes a final look at her sad abode.

           She eyes THE LORD OF THE RINGS in her arm.

                                 JOANNE
                             (sotto)
                        "It's dangerous bussiness, Frodo — 
                        going out your door."

           She swallows, then slams the door shut behind her.

           EXT. PORTO, PORTUGAL, OLD QUARTER, STREET — DAY

           An ELDERLY SAILOR ties his small boat, LUNA, to a weathered 
           dock in the harbor of the DOURO RIVER.

           Joanne, with a deep tan and sun-kissed tendrils, walks along 
           a cobblestone street by the water. Her sundress sways in the 
           salty ocean air.

           Brightly colored shops spill into the road. MEN AND WOMEN in 
           linen shirts and swimsuits meander towards fruit stands and 
           cafes, in absolutely no hurry at all.

           It's a vibrant, lively contrast to the cinereal and bustling 
           streets of London.

           EXT. COLLEGIATE HALL  — DAY

           An aqua-colored, colonial-style building. A FEW STUDENTS eat 
           lunch on the crumbling steps.

           Joanne stretches past them towards the canary yellow 
           entrance.

           INT. CLASSROOM — DAY

           The classroom is filled with TWO DOZEN PORTUGUESE STUDENTS, 
           ranging in age from eight to sixty-eight.

           They sit in mismatched chairs, hunch over papers, scribble 
           with pencils.

           Joanne sits at the front of the class, glances at her watch.
                                 JOANNE
                        OK. Terminar. Turn in your papers.

           The students set down pencils, pack up their things.

           Papers form a pile on top her wooden desk as students exit 
           the class.

           One pupil, a 12-year-old Portuguese girl, HARRIET, with a 
           long frizzy braid, hands her paper to Joanne directly.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Harriet.

                                 HARRIET
                        Will we be graded on a curve?

                                 JOANNE
                        It's a pass or no pass test. It's 
                        only to determine if you're ready 
                        to move on to the next class.

           Harriet frowns.

                                 HARRIET
                        Would you grade mine fully, please?

                                 JOANNE
                        Well, I have a lot of papers to get 
                        through...

                                 HARRIET
                        I am paying hard-earned babysitting 
                        dollars for this course, miss 
                        Joanne, and I'd like to know my 
                        full potential.

                                 JOANNE
                        Are you studying to become a 
                        lawyer, Harriet?

                                 HARRIET
                        No, I'm not. I'm hoping to do some 
                        good in the world.

           Joanne grins.

                                 JOANNE
                        Alright then. A full letter grade 
                        coming your way.

                                 HARRIET
                        Thank you.
           Harriet adjusts her backpack, marches out of class.

           Joanne reaches into her teacher's desk, pulls out a pad of 
           paper. She writes—

           "I'm hoping to do some good in the world."

           EXT. PORTO STREET — NIGHT

           The street overflows with nightlife. People eat at sidewalk 
           cafes, a man plays a harmonica in front of a fedora filled 
           with tips, a drunk couple kisses against a stone, vine-
           covered wall.

           Joanne saunters down the narrow road.

           She passes a YOUNG COUPLE who slow dance in front of a street-
           side BAND playing traditional FADO music. They bend to the 
           beat of the humming string instruments.

           INT. JOANNE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne opens the door to her three-bedroom apartment. She 
           quietly steps inside, leaves her shoes at the door.

           The house is festively decorated but modest. Still, it's a 
           huge step up from her deteriorating London flat.

           Her roommates, AINE, Irish, 20s, and JILL, British, 20s, 
           gossip over dinner in the living room.

           Joanne tip-toes past them.

           She reaches her door, creaks it open.

           INT. JOANNE'S BEDROOM — NIGHT

           A twin bed, a writing desk, a lamp, a bookshelf for her many 
           paperbacks. Some of her drawings and scribbled notes are 
           pinned to the walls.

           Joanne sets her bag down, pulls her hair up into a ponytail, 
           plops down at her desk.

           She opens a drawer full of notebooks, pulls one out.

           She flips to a page titled, "Hagrid's Beasts" with various 
           half-finished drawings of fantastical creatures, accompanied 
           by their names —

           Buckbeak, Fang, Mosag, Norbert, etc.
           She turns the page. The drawing of the THREE-HEADED-DOG is 
           taped inside.

           She thinks, writes— "Flu-"

           But a knock on the door interrupts her.

                                 AINE
                             (O.S.)
                        Jo? You home?

           Joanne presses her notebook closed.

                                 JOANNE
                        What is it, Aine?

           Aine creaks open the door. Jill's right behind her.

                                 JILL
                        We were thinking we'd go out 
                        tonight.

                                 JOANNE
                        You go out every night.

           The young women burst into her room. Aine flings herself on 
           Joanne's bed.

           Jill grabs the notebook from Joanne's desk, joins Aine on the 
           bed.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        That's... private.

                                 AINE
                        And you stay in and write, or draw, 
                        or whatever it is you do, every 
                        night.

           They flip the notebook open.

                                 JOANNE
                        I had a long day teaching. I'm just 
                        tired.

                                 JILL
                        We all had a long day teaching. But 
                        it doesn't stop us from engaging 
                        with the world.

                                 AINE
                        ...Especially on a Friday night.

           Jill flips to the page of Hagrid's Beasts.
                                 JILL
                        I think a night away from... 
                        Norbert... couldn't hurt.

                                 JOANNE
                        This is the only time I can write. 
                        Can I have my book back?

                                 AINE
                        How are you supposed to have 
                        anything worth writing about if you 
                        stay in your room? You're young, 
                        Jo. You're in a gorgeous city. 
                        Experience the world!

                                 JOANNE
                        I've experienced plenty.

                                 AINE
                        I don't buy it. Vamos Jo, we're 
                        going out. We're going to get 
                        smashed and I for one am getting 
                        laid. I suggest you acquire 
                        similarly shallow goals.

           The girls stand from the bed, Jill hands the book back.

                                 JILL
                        We're leaving in 20. Find something 
                        slutty to wear.

           With a grin, they shut the door behind them.

           Jo opens the notebook again, stares at the page.

           She taps her pencil against the table, looks towards the 
           door.

           INT. MEIA CAVA JAZZ CLUB — NIGHT

           A trumpet's horn SHOUTS from a stage overlooking a dense, 
           energetic, and dimly-lit jazz club.

           Wall to wall patrons. A diverse, young, spirited CROWD swing 
           their hips to the band's bright bravado.

           Aine leads the way through the throng. She drags a train of 
           Jill and Joanne, glued together with clasped hands, behind 
           her.

           The female trio is an eye-catching spectacle, as proven by 
           the heads that turn as they pass.
           Aine spots a FEMALE FRIEND, breaks the chain to say hello, 
           kiss her cheek.

           Joanne looks around the club, takes in the revelry — So this 
           is what she's been missing.

           INT. MEIA CAVA BAR — NIGHT

           The women sit on three stools against the bar, overcrowded 
           with empty glasses.

           They clutch shot glasses of clear liquid.

                                 JILL
                        Um, dois, três!

           They clink their shot glasses together, down them.

           The BARTENDER pours them a second round. And a third.

           Joanne spills some of her shot on the floor, laughs, shots 
           the rest.

           INT. MEIA CAVA DANCE FLOOR — NIGHT

           The women are three specs in a sea of VIBRATING BODIES. They 
           grasp sloshing drinks as their limbs whirl to the frenetic 
           jazz beat.

           Jill chugs her gin and tonic as her feet tap to the rhythm.

                                 JILL
                        I'm gonna grab another. Anyone?

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm good.

           Anie has her eyes glued to a young PORTUGUESE MAN nearby.

                                 ANIE
                        Me too.

           Anie gives him a seductive grin, beckons him with twirling 
           arms. He dances towards her.

           She takes his hands, and the two attempt a very drunken 
           version of a swing dance.

           A similarly sloshed Joanne takes another chug of her drink.

           She tilts her head upwards, watches the gleam from a disco 
           ball splatter the ceiling in a disarray of light.
           The jazz intensifies, the instruments build towards a 
           rumbling climax.

           She closes her eyes. Soaks it in. The specks of light dance 
           across her face.

           A smile rounds her cheeks... the music reaches apex...

                                 DANCING MAN
                             (O.S.)
                        Want to dance, darling?

           Jo's eyes open. She returns her gaze to the dance floor to 
           see—

           An overweight, middle-aged DANCING MAN, nearly salivating.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm sorry?

           He rocks back and forth on his feet, extends a hand.

                                 DANCING MAN
                        Indulge an old cocker with a dance?

                                 JOANNE
                        I...

           Joanne looks to Aine, now grinding up against her prospect.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        ...have to piss, actually.

           She spins away from the man, hurriedly pushes past GYRATING 
           BODIES towards the loo.

           INT. MEIA CAVA HALLYWAY — NIGHT

           Joanne joins the end of a line, A DOZEN WOMEN waiting to use 
           the loo in front of her.

           She sizes up the tedious line, walks to the front.

           She peaks inside the bathroom. There's a SINGLE STALL and a 
           row of women fixing their makeup in a elongated mirror.

           She grimaces, abandons the bathroom. She walks towards the 
           opposite end of the hall towards the men's bathroom.

           There are FOUR MEN waiting. She joins the end of the line 
           behind a BALD MAN who gives her an odd look.
                                 JOANNE
                        How many stalls are in there?

                                 BALD MAN
                        Uh, two I think. Are you a...?

                                 JOANNE
                        Man?

           Joanne shrugs.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        I am many things.

           The Bald Man nods, confused.

           She looks down the hall and a Portuguese man, JORGE ARANTES, 
           24, bookish but cocky, catches her eye.

           He strolls towards her, steps behind her in line.

           They stand in silence for a beat.

           He checks her out, clears his throat.

                                 JORGE
                        You do know this is the line for 
                        the men's bathroom?

                                 JOANNE
                        Was that a statement or a question?

                                 JORGE
                        Um, both?

                                 JOANNE
                        To answer your question, yes, I do 
                        realize the stick figure on the 
                        door isn't wearing a triangle 
                        skirt. To your statement, you 
                        guessed correctly.

                                 JORGE
                        Guessed what?

                                 JOANNE
                        That I realize this is the men's 
                        room.

           He scratches his head.

                                 JORGE
                        Well, we're off to a smashing 
                        start. I'm Jorge. What's your name?
           He extends a hand.

           She hesitates, doesn't take it.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jo. Joanne.

           He lowers his hand.

                                 JORGE
                        Lovely to meet you, Joanne. But, 
                        it's a bit unfair that you, who is 
                        clearly not a man...
                             (eyes her up and down)
                        gets to cut me in line.

                                 JOANNE
                        Have you seen the queue for the 
                        women's loo? We have one stall, and 
                        you boys have two, plus, a load of 
                        urinals. That's what isn't fair.

                                 JORGE
                        Still, the rules are the rules.

                                 JOANNE
                        Alright. If rules are rules, and 
                        boys and girls must be separated to 
                        urinate... then I'll just change my 
                        name.

           His brow furrows.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        What if my name was Joseph, not 
                        Joanne. Could I stay then?

           Jorge laughs nervously.

                                 JORGE
                        It would certainly make things more 
                        complicated for me.

                                 JOANNE
                        Why's that?

           The Bald Man walks out of the stall. He passes Jo—

                                 MUSTACHED MAN
                        You're up, Mister.

           Joanne raises an eyebrow at Jorge.
           INT. MEIA CAVA DANCE FLOOR — NIGHT

           Joanne pushes back through the dancing crowd towards her 
           friends.

           Her eyes peer around the room, looking for a certain brooding 
           Portuguese man. 

           She spots him — at the bar, surrounded by a DOZEN FRIENDS, 
           pounding shots. 

           She pauses, considers approaching him...

           He slams another shot glass down. His friends cheer. 

           ...better not. 

           She looks around the room and sees Aine, now slow dancing 
           with her partner despite the upbeat music.

           Joanne walks to her, taps her on the shoulder.

                                 JOANNE
                        Hey. Where's Jill?

                                 AINE
                        Jo!

           Aine spins around in her date's arms.

                                 AINE (CONT’D)
                        She's outside, I think. Bumming a 
                        fag, maybe.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm gonna go find her. Have fun!

           Aine nods her head up and down enthusiastically, mimes some 
           not-so-subtle thrusting motions. Oh she's getting laaaaid.

           EXT. MEIA CAVA COURTYARD — NIGHT

           Less crowded, but still lively.

           Lit by strings of twinkling lights. Half drunken glasses of 
           red wine and cigarette butts garnish table tops.

           Joanne scans the debauchery, spots Jill in a circle of 
           smokers.

           Joanne approaches, and Jill throws her arms around her.
                                 JILL
                        Hey, slag.

                                 JOANNE
                        I think I'm gonna take off...

                                 JILL
                        Oh, no. Stay! It's barely midnight. 
                        Want a smoke?

           Jill brings the cigarette to Joanne's mouth. She waves it 
           away.

                                 JOANNE
                        No, I'm OK. It's late. I'm sober. 
                        The magic is fading.

                                 JILL
                        Well... alright. Back to your book 
                        of beasts then.

           She gives her a playful shove.

                                 JOANNE
                             (shouting back)
                        Use a condom, eh?

           Jill waves her away.

           EXT. PORTO STREET — NIGHT

           Joanne walks past the jazz club, a handful of booze-filled 
           night owls topple to the street.

                                 JORGE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Joseph.

           Joanne turns.

           Jorge sits on the curb, his collared-shirt a few more buttons 
           undone. He screws the cap onto a SILVER FLASK, and moseys 
           towards her.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Leaving so soon?

           He pockets the flask. 

           Joanne keeps walking, Jorge follows a few feet behind.

                                 JOANNE
                        It's past my bedtime.
                                 JORGE
                        Past your bed time?

                                 JOANNE
                        I have work in the morning.

           Jorge cocks his head, looks at her sideways.

                                 JORGE
                        And here I fancied you a Marianne 
                        Dashwood, but you've been Elinor 
                        all along.

           Joanne stops dead in her tracks, spins 180 towards him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Excuse me?

                                 JORGE
                        It's from a book—

                                 JOANNE
                        Yes, I get the reference. You've 
                        read Sense and Sensibility?

           Jorge grins like a goddamn idiot.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Bloody hell, is that your party 
                        trick? Is that how you get laid?

           Jorge shrugs.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        How very Mr. Willoughby of you.

           Jorge laughs.

                                 JORGE
                        Is it working?

                                 JOANNE
                        Hardly. I'm just surprised.

                                 JORGE
                        Because...

                                 JOANNE
                        You're just... you don't seem the 
                        type to appreciate Austen.
                                 JORGE
                        Because I'm not a white woman of a 
                        certain age? Look at you, being as 
                        prejudice as can be.

                                 JOANNE
                        You've certainly got the pride 
                        covered. And you know what, I 
                        resent being called Elinor, or 
                        Marianne. I'm not the virgin or the 
                        whore. 

           She steps away from the club.

           Jorge skips to catch up with her.

                                 JORGE
                        OK, who are you then? What do you 
                        do? Enlighten me.

                                 JOANNE
                        I teach. And I write.

                                 JORGE
                        You write, eh? Now that’s irony. 
                        What do you write?

           Joanne cocks her head, doesn’t understand his comment.

                                 JOANNE
                        Nothing much. Yet. I'm working on a 
                        children's series. But I can't talk 
                        about it.

                                 JORGE
                        How come? Is your publisher keeping 
                        it a secret?

                                 JOANNE
                        Publisher? Ha. Oh, no. I don't have 
                        a publisher, or an agent, or even a 
                        completed first chapter. I'm 
                        just... musing... at the moment.

           Jorge raises an eyebrow.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        I sound mad, I know.

                                 JORGE
                        No, you sound like a writer. Only 
                        an idiot puts pen to paper without 
                        thinking.
                                 JOANNE
                        I could stand to be a bit more 
                        idiotic. What do you do then, 
                        Casanova?

           Jorge pulls out the FLASK from his back pocket. He takes a 
           swig. 

                                 JORGE
                        I'm a writer, too. A journalist.

                                 JOANNE
                        Oh?

           He extends the flask to her. 

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        No thanks.

           He shrugs, takes another gulp.

                                 JORGE
                        Yep. Freelance. So I get the whole 
                        not-writing thing.

                                 JOANNE
                        I see...

           Jorge leans forward, as if it's a secret—

                                 JORGE
                        But it gives me plenty of time to 
                        read...

           Joanne cracks.

           EXT. PORTO SHORE, THE ATLANTIC OCEAN — NIGHT

           The deep blue tide caresses the shore, inhales glassy water 
           and exhales it back out again.

           EXT. PORTO SEASIDE STREET — NIGHT

           Joanne and Jorge stroll down a path by the water. Less lit. 
           Less people. Calm and quiet.

           They pause, admire the lulling tide.

                                 JOANNE
                        She died of multiple sclerosis, a 
                        year ago. She never knew I was 
                        writing again.
                                 JORGE
                        You didn’t tell her?

                                 JOANNE
                        What was there to tell? My dad... I 
                        didn't want her to think I was 
                        wasting my time.

                                 JORGE
                        How would your time be better 
                        spent? Chained to a desk? Working 
                        thankless hours for peanuts at a 
                        vocation you hate?

                                 JOANNE
                        I guess. But I regret it now. Mum 
                        would have loved Harry.

                                 JORGE
                        Harry is the magician?

                                 JOANNE
                        Wizard.

                                 JORGE
                        What's the difference?

           Joanne squints at him.

                                 JOANNE
                        You know for someone who can recite 
                        Austen—

                                 JORGE
                        "It is a truth universally 
                        acknowledged—"

                                 JOANNE
                        Stop. Oh dear god, please stop.

           He fights laughter.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        You don't know some fairly common 
                        words.

                                 JORGE
                        Well, English is not my first 
                        language, Joanne. And I do not 
                        possess your — how do you say — 
                        acute stubbornness. So, what is the 
                        difference?

           She studies the water, considers the question.
                                 JOANNE
                        A magician is someone who fakes 
                        magic, with smoke and mirrors and 
                        tricks. A wizard has magic within 
                        him, he must only learn to conjure 
                        it.

           Jorge's eyes move from the water to her face.

                                 JORGE
                        I like this Harry fellow. I'm 
                        excited to meet him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Me too.

           The sun's orange rays ache to emerge over the city.

           Joanne and Jorge approach Jo's doorstep.

           A predictable, awkward silence ensues.

                                 JOANNE
                        Well, thanks for walking me home.

                                 JORGE
                        Oh. I wasn't walking you home.

                                 JOANNE
                        No?

                                 JORGE

                        You must still be drunk.

           He shrugs.

                                 JORGE
                        Maybe. But isn't it the Willoughby 
                        thing to do?

           She smirks.

           He grabs her hand, kisses it sweetly.
                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight.

           And without a word, he turns, walks away from her.

           Joanne is speechless. Her mouth tries to form words—

                                 JOANNE
                        Wait!

           Jorge spins on his heels.

           She steps to him.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Will I see you again?

           Jorge shrugs.

                                 JORGE
                        I've got a very long library queue 
                        to get through.

           Joanne reaches up and grabs his face, pulls him towards her, 
           plants a sultry kiss on his lips.

           Her hands move from his face to his chest.

           He wraps his hands around her waist, pulls her closer. It's 
           steamy, passionate, red-hot—

           But he pulls away.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Boa noite, Joseph.

           He flashes her a smoldering smile, and vanishes towards the 
           sunrise.

           INT. JOANNE’S BEDROOM — DAY

           Joanne lies in bed. Her eyes creak open. She glances at the 
           clock: 1 pm.

           She scans the various novels on her bookshelf, halting at 
           Sense and Sensibility.

           She smirks, buries her face in her pillow.
           INT. JOANNE’S APARTMENT — DAY

           Jill, in sweatpants and a T-shirt, stretches her leg against 
           the kitchen counter. Anie pours herself a cup of coffee.

           Joanne saunters in. 

                                 ANIE
                        Well, well, well.

                                 JILL
                        Is there a boy in your bed?

                                 ANIE
                        Does he want some café? 

           Joanne tries to hide her smile.

                                 JOANNE
                        No boy. 

                                 JILL
                        Oh really? So who was that tall, 
                        tanned thing you were snogging at 
                        sunrise? 

           The girls look at her expectantly. Jo feigns outrage.

                                 JOANNE
                        You were spying on me?

                                 ANIE
                        Yeah, so, what’s his name then?

           The landline RINGS.

           All three women LEAP towards the wall to get it. 

           Anie gets to it first, then Jill rips it away, then finally 
           Jo gets a hold of it. 

                                 JOANNE
                             (breathlessly)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WTIH—

           Jorge, curled over the balcony of his apartment. He stretches 
           a hand into the afternoon air. 

                                 JORGE
                        “You pierce my soul. I am half 
                        agony, half hope. I have loved none 
                        but you...”
           Joanne grins and rolls her eyes simultaneously.

                                 JOANNE
                        Hi, Jorge.

                                 ANIE/JILL
                             (mouthing)
                        JOOOOOOOORGE!

           Anie grabs Jill and pretends to kiss her. 

                                 JORGE
                        What are you doing right now?

           Anie dips Jill backwards onto the kitchen table and pretends 
           to ravish her. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Now?

           Anie and Jill continue the sultry, dramatic charade. 

                                 JORGE
                        Yes. I’m taking you to lunch. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Um.. I don’t know...

                                 JORGE
                        Don’t be difficult, Joseph. I’m 
                        determined to awaken your sensible 
                        English tastebuds with authentic 
                        Portuguese comida!

           Anie and Jill are losing it. They fall off the table onto the 
           floor and cackle with laughter. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Well, I was actually hoping to do 
                        some writing today—

           Anie leaps up from the floor, grabs the phone from Jo. Jill 
           holds back a flailing Jo.

                                 ANIE
                             (into the phone)
                        Jorge? She’d love to. Come by in 
                        20? 

           Jo’s mouth drops. 

                                 ANIE (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Great. 
           Anie hangs up the phone and the three women explode with 
           laughter. 

           MONTAGE — VARIOUS

           -INT. CAFE — DAY — Joanne sits across the table from Jorge. 
           They talk, laugh, eat, drink. They drain a bottle of wine. 
           Then another.

           -INT. BOOK STORE — DAY — Joanne and Jorge scan isles of 
           books, pull some out, flip through them, steal kisses.

           -INT. THE SHORE — DAY — Joanne rides on Jorge's back as he 
           wades into the water. She's scared. He drops her, she 
           splashes under the tide. He quickly dives under the waves, 
           hides, holds his breath. She emerges, furious, looks for him. 
           He comes up for air. She tackles him.

           —INT. THE CLASSROOM — DAY — Joanne lectures at the front of 
           the class. Jorge pokes his head into the door, waves slyly.

           -INT. DISCOTHEQUE — NIGHT — A mess of bodies. Joanne and 
           Jorge drip with sweat, grind up against one another, kiss 
           passionately.

           -INT. JOANNE'S BEDROOM — NIGHT — Jo and Jorge fall onto her 
           bed. She crawls on top of him. They kiss. Undress.

           -INT. JOANNE'S LIVING ROOM — DAY — Jo writes in a notebook. 
           Jorge reads nearby. Jo stops, puts the pen between her teeth. 
           She hands the notebook to Jorge. He reads the pages intently.

           -INT. JOANNE'S ROOM — DAY — Everything in boxes. Jo stuffs 
           clothes and books into cardboard containers.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY — DAY

           Joanne stands in front of the open front door. 

           Anie has her arm supportively draped around Jill as they 
           watch her leave. 

           Joanne picks up a cardboard box resting at her feet.

                                 JOANNE
                        Am I mad? It’s only been a month. 

                                 ANIE
                        Romeo and Juliet fell in love in 
                        one night.
                                 JILL
                        And then... they killed themselves. 

                                 ANIE
                        Yes, well, we've already subleted 
                        your room, so there's no turning 
                        back now is there?

                                 JOANNE
                        Suppose not.

                                 JILL
                        Cheer up, chum. You love him, don’t 
                        you?

           Jo smiles, almost convincingly. 

           EXT. ALLEY — NIGHT

           Brightly colored buildings stacked on top of each other are a 
           festive backdrop for pavement cafes and narrow alleyways 
           below.

           Jo and Jorge, arm in arm, stroll down a picturesque 
           passageway towards the sound of a PORTUGUESE PIMBA band.

           EXT. STREET FESTIVAL — NIGHT

           They emerge from the bottleneck opening of the alley and 
           spill into a STREET FESTIVAL —

           Throngs of people eating, laughing, DANCING.

           A MEAT VENDOR haggles a tourist. A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE share a 
           plate of peppered cod. A LITTLE BOY dodges kisses from a 
           LITTLE GIRL behind his mother's skirt.

           Jorge pulls his SILVER FLASK from his back pocket. He takes a 
           long pull. 

           He pockets it, pulls Jo confidently towards the PIMPA band, 
           complete with string instruments and a lavishly dressed 
           ACCORDION PLAYER, who waxes and wanes with utter zeal.

           Jorge drops her hand, and waltzes backwards onto the 
           cobblestones in front of the band, joining a FEW COUPLES half-
           heartily swaying back and forth.

                                 JORGE
                        A dance, m'lady?

           Joanne raises her eyebrows.
                                 JOANNE
                        Hell no.

           Jorge rolls his eyes, his feet tap to the music.

                                 JORGE
                             (louder)
                        Dance with me, darling!

           Joanne looks around, embarrassed.

                                 JOANNE
                             (quietly)
                        Stop it.

           His hips sway. His arms move in fluid motion to the sound. 
           He's feeling it.

           Joanne smirks, shakes her head.

           He raises his hands in the air, becoming more animated. He 
           draws a crowd.

                                 JORGE
                             (shouting)
                        My sweet Joanne! Joanne Rowling!

           The crowd gapes at her — will she indulge him?

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge.

           She's bright red.

           A WOMAN from the crowd engages her.

                                 WOMAN
                        Go to him! He needs you. Dança!

                                 JOANNE
                        I... no.

           The Accordion Player rises from his seat. He walks to Joanne, 
           still playing his instrument, and stops in front of her. He 
           opens his mouth, and beings TO SING.

                                 ACCORDION PLAYER
                        (singing)
                        Assista as ondas do oceano, e o céu 
                        tão azul...

           She tries to hide her face.

           He walks behind her, pushes her forward.
                                 ACCORDION PLAYER (CONT’D)
                        ...sente a brisa do mar, é o que eu 
                        desejo fazer!

           Jorge awaits her with an extended hand.

           She reluctantly takes his hand, and he SPINS HER AROUND IN A 
           CIRCLE.

           The crowd CHEERS in delight.

           The band strums their instruments with even more fervor. Jo’s 
           frown softens.

           Jorge grabs Jo's waist, and they twirl and sway and vibrate 
           to the rhythm.

           Joanne's bashfulness facade is all but gone. She grins from 
           ear to ear in Jorge's arms.

           The song comes to a close, and Jorge DIPS JO BACKWARDS 
           dramatically.

           The crowd erupts in APPLAUSE.

           Her blue eyes meet his, and for a moment, all is well.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           A bachelor pad. Scarce and unorganized. Walls of books. A few 
           pieces of mid-century modern furniture. Impersonal and 
           uninspired.

           Jorge stirs a pot of pasta next to the stove. He picks up a 
           bottle of port, tips it into his mouth.

           Joanne sits with her back against the foot of the bed, 
           scribbling in a notebook.

                                 JORGE
                        Do you want marinara or pesto?

                                 JOANNE
                        We have pesto?

           He shrugs.

                                 JORGE
                        I can make some.

                                 JOANNE
                        Alright.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOANNE (CONT'D)
                        Which house do you think you'd 
                        belong to? At Hogwarts.

           He takes another swig from the bottle.

                                 JORGE
                        Well Gryffindor, of course. Home of 
                        the chivalrous and the brave?

                                 JOANNE
                        No true Gryffindor would say 
                        they're a Griffindor. You're 
                        probably a Hufflepuff.

           She eyes him up and down.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe a Slytherin.

                                 JORGE
                        Isn't that the bad one?

                                 JOANNE
                        There are no bad houses, only badly 
                        behaved students.

           Jorge perks up.

                                 JORGE
                        Hmm.

           He saunters over, kneels in front of her on the floor.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        In that case... I've been quite 
                        bad.

           He gives her a kiss. She pulls away.

                                 JOANNE
                        God, you reek of port. Did you 
                        drink the whole bottle?

           Jorge smiles, kisses her again.

           She pushes him away, again.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        I need to work. And there's water 
                        on the stove.

                                 JORGE
                        C'mon, love. Just one kiss.
                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge, I'm working.

           He pouts, moves in again, bites her neck.

           She pushes him away forcefully.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        STOP.

                                 JORGE
                        What?!

           Joanne's face hardens. She gets up from her seat on the 
           floor.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm not hungry.

           She walks into the small adjacent bathroom, shuts the door.

           Jorge scoffs, trips back to the stove.

           He pours the remaining bit of port into his mouth.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne has the covers pulled around her neck, her back to 
           Jorge.

           He nervously climbs into bed.

                                 JORGE
                             (softly)
                        Jo, I'm so sorry.

           She squeezes her eyes closed.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Jo...

           He sighs, gives up.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           Joanne sleeps in an empty bed streaked in sunlight. She turns 
           over, cracks her eyes open.

           A brassy, caramel-colored band glints on her pillow. She 
           opens her eyes further, it comes into focus: A slender golden 
           band. A ring.
           She sits up in bed, plucks it from the pillow.

           She looks around the empty room, but then—

           Jorge comes out of the bathroom.

           She holds the ring up.

                                 JOANNE
                        What is this?

           He smiles sheepishly, sits on the edge of the bed.

                                 JORGE
                        I'm sorry about last night, 
                        darling. I shouldn't have tried to 
                        force it.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge, what is this?

                                 JORGE
                        An apology. An offering.

                                 JOANNE
                        A ring?

                                 JORGE
                        A promise — I'll never be so stupid 
                        again. I'll spend a lifetime being 
                        worthy of your love. An engagement 
                        ring.

           Joanne runs a hand through her hair.

                                 JOANNE
                        We can't get engaged.

                                 JORGE
                        Why? I love you.

                                 JOANNE
                        I love you, too. But it's too soon. 
                        We're young.

                                 JORGE
                        We're not that young.

                                 JOANNE
                        I have plans. I'm going to write, 
                        and travel. I can't marry you. Not 
                        yet.
                                 JORGE
                        I want to do those things, too. 
                        Let's do them together.

                                 JOANNE
                        But why do we need to be married?

                                 JORGE
                        I just... I want to be fully 
                        committed to you. No other 
                        distractions.

           Joanne's brow furrows: What does that mean?

                                 JOANNE
                        I need to get ready for class.

           She leans towards him, kisses his cheek.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        I'll think about it.

           She pushes the ring into his palm.

           EXT. COLLEGIATE HALL — DAY

           Joanne sits on the well-trodden steps, the lofty bell tower 
           of the Clérigos Church casts a shadow over her legs.

           She pulls the back of her hair up with a free hand, waves it 
           up and down, cools herself.

           Harriet runs up the steps towards her.

                                 HARRIET
                        Miss Joanne.

                                 JOANNE
                        Harriet. How are you?

                                 HARRIET
                        Fine. Um. Can I sit with you?

                                 JOANNE
                        Yeah. Here.

           Jo moves her bag, Harriet sits.

                                 HARRIET
                        My mum, my foster mum, wants me to 
                        stop taking your class.
                                 JOANNE
                        I didn't know you were in foster 
                        care.

           Harriet nods.

                                 HARRIET
                        She says any money I make 
                        babysitting has to go to the house, 
                        for supplies and rent.

                                 JOANNE
                        Hmm. That doesn't seem fair. But, 
                        your English is excellent, Harriet. 
                        I'm not sure you need to be in my 
                        class. And besides, there are more 
                        important things than school and 
                        cleverness. 

           Harriet squints at Jo.

                                 HARRIET
                        Like what?

                                 JOANNE
                        Like... friendship. Bravery. Love.

                                 HARRIET
                        But I need to be in school. I need 
                        to speak like you.

                                 JOANNE
                        Why?

                                 HARRIET
                        To go to college. Get far away from 
                        here. Have my own life.

                                 JOANNE
                        I get that. You know I wanted to 
                        leave London so I came here to 
                        teach. I wanted change, just like 
                        you. But there are some things you 
                        just can’t control. Who your 
                        parents are, who you lose... but 
                        you can control who you love. 
                        Finding people who support you, who 
                        love you... that’s the most 
                        important thing. More than anything 
                        else.

           Harriet picks at her fingernail, thinks about it.
                                 HARRIET
                        I still want to leave.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne comes through the front door. She drops her bags, 
           kicks off her shoes.

           Jorge reads a book on the bed. Jo climbs next to him.

           She curls up on his chest, hugs him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Why do you want to marry me?

           He sets his book down, brushes her hair with his hand.

                                 JORGE
                        Well, you make me smile, laugh. 
                        Your imagination is... I’m jealous 
                        of everything you come up with. 
                        You’re opinionated and stubborn as 
                        hell, but I’m not sure I can live 
                        without you. It’s selfish, really.

           Jo smiles.

                                 JOANNE
                        OK.

           She looks up at him.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s bloody do it then.

           He looks down at her. 

           He kisses her, she kisses him back, but her eyes well with 
           tears.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Jorge is asleep next to Jo, his arms sprawled over her. Her 
           eyes are open.

           She turns from side to side, restless.

           INT. KING'S CROSS STATION, 1964 — DAY — FLASHBACK/DREAM

           A CROWD OF PASSENGERS in vintage winter coats stained with 
           snow crowd the platform.
           A YOUNG BRUNETTE WOMAN, 18, with a short, fringed haircut, 
           and in a '60s style dress, stands on the platform at King's 
           Cross Station, SHIVERING.

           She rubs her bare arms with her hands.

           The TRAIN comes to a halt in front of the passengers. She 
           exhales in relief.

           INT. THE TRAIN — NIGHT

           The young woman finds her way to an empty seat, still 
           shaking.

           AN 18-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH SUNKEN EYES does a double-take as she 
           sits down. 

           He leaps out of his seat and slides into the seat RIGHT NEXT 
           TO HERS.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Well you're shaking up a storm.

           The young woman is taken aback.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Yeah? So? Left my coat on the last 
                        train.

           The young man peels his own jacket from his shoulders.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Lucky for you, I don't need this. 

           He hands it to her.

                                 YOUNG WOMEN
                        I'm... fine. Really.

           He points to her arms.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Look at those goose pimples! Your 
                        arms are about to fall off and I'm 
                        not about to sit here and talk to 
                        some freak with no arms. Put on the 
                        jumper.

           She reluctantly drapes the coat over her torso.

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Good. You want to hear something 
                        wild?
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I fear you're going to tell me 
                        regardless.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Right you are. Alright, listen to 
                        this gem: There's a tomb buried 
                        beneath King's Cross Station. And 
                        it's not just any 'ol tomb — it's 
                        Boudica's tomb.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Boo-dick-a?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Oh, you don't know Boudica?! She 
                        was an ancient British queen who 
                        led a rebellion against the Romans.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Oh?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Very cool chick. Flaming red 
                        hair... a real fox. Total badass.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hmm. Where's she buried?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        No one knows for sure. But it's 
                        supposedly between platforms 9 and 
                        10. A little closer to 10, I think.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        How do you know all this?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        I know many things. Except... your 
                        name.

           The train SLOWS. A handful of passengers rise from their 
           seats, gather their things.

           The young woman hands the coat back to the young man. She 
           stands up.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I'm Anne.

            The young man takes her hand, kisses it.
                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Anne. I'm Peter. Peter Rowling. 
                        When will I see you again?

           She shrugs.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Soon. Maybe.

           She steps into the isle.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Where?

                                 ANNE
                        At the platform.

           She heads for the door.

                                 PETER
                        Which platform?

                                 ANNE
                        Boudicca's tomb.

           Peter cocks his head.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Platform 9 and 3/4.

           And with that, Joanne’s would-be-mother flashes her would-be-
           father a smile, and vanishes from the train.

           INT. THE BATHROOM — DAY

           Joanne, in her pajamas, brushes her teeth over the sink at a 
           rapid pace. Then suddenly, she stops, clutches her stomach.

           She pulls the toothbrush from her mouth, looks at her 
           reflection.

           She grimaces, spits the toothpaste out.

           She rubs her abdomen — something's not right.

           INT. JORGE’S APARTMENT — DAY

           Joanne grabs her bag from a hook on the door, looks to Jorge, 
           sitting at the kitchen table. 

           He pours liquid from a DARK BOTTLE into a coffee cup.
                                 JOANNE
                        What’s that?

           Jorge eyes the bottle.

                                 JORGE
                        Uh. Agave sweetener. Better than 
                        sugar, eh?

           Joanne looks at him skeptically.

                                 JOANNE
                        Are you working today?

                                 JORGE
                        Mmm. Got a lead for a story in Rio 
                        Tinto. I’ll call my guy after 
                        breakfast. 

           Joanne opens the front door.

                                 JOANNE
                        See you tonight. 

           Jorge nods, she leaves.

           He empties the rest of the bottle into his coffee — 
           definitely not sweetner. 

           INT. CLASSROOM — DAY

           Joanne lectures at the front of the class. Her students are 
           half paying attention, except for Harriet, who leans forward 
           and hangs on every word.

                                 JOANNE
                        ...Do you see the difference?

           She points to a sentence on the board.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        "The bandage was wound around his 
                        leg to cover the wound." They are 
                        spelled the same, but different...

           Her face is flushed, forehead sweaty.

           She blinks, clutches her stomach again.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Different...
           She’s green.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           Jo darts out of the classroom.

           INT. CLASSROOM — HALLWAY

           The hall is empty — thank god — because Jo just barely makes 
           it to a DRINKING FOUNTAIN before her body curls over it and 
           she VOMITS into the basin.

           She stands, dizzy, wipes her mouth.

           INT. DRUG STORE BATHROOM — DAY

           Tight on Jo as she concentrates intensely. She bites her lip, 
           closes her eyes for a beat — then opens them.

           She's staring at a POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST, denoted with a 
           PINK PLUS SIGN on the white plastic tip.

           She exhales, drops the stick to the floor next to TWO OTHER 
           IDENTICAL PICK-TIPPED TESTS.

           She shakes her head back and forth.

                                 JOANNE
                             (sotto)
                        Bollocks.

           INT. RESTAURANT PATIO — NIGHT

           A candle-lit table holding empty plates of food and two 
           bottles of wine. 

           Jorge fills his glass with more port.  

           He tips the bottle towards her glass, but she covers the 
           opening with her palm.

                                 JORGE
                        You don't want any?

                                 JOANNE
                        Probably shouldn't.
                                 JORGE
                        You haven’t had a drink all night. 
                        You can't live in Porto and not 
                        drink port with dinner.

                                 JOANNE
                        You can if you're pregnant.

           He nearly drops the bottle.

                                 JORGE
                        What?

           He sets it down, grabs her hand.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Pregnant?

                                 JOANNE
                        Yeah. I took a test today. Three 
                        tests.

                                 JORGE
                        Darling... that's wonderful.

           He leans in to kiss her. She turns head away.

                                 JOANNE
                        We can't have a child, Jorge. We 
                        have no money. We aren't ready.

                                 JORGE
                        We have plenty of money... Er, 
                        we'll get more money. I'll get a 
                        steady job. Your book will sell.

                                 JOANNE
                        My book?! My book is a box of 
                        scraps that may never see the light 
                        of day. Jorge. I'm serious. We 
                        can't have a kid.

           He strokes her hand.

                                 JORGE
                        Don't you want it? Our own little 
                        family? Think of how lovely it 
                        would be.

           Joanne tries to fight the tears swelling in her eyes.

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't want our child to come into 
                        this world in poverty...
           Her eyes find the table.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        ...with a father who drinks.

           Jorge drops her hand.

                                 JORGE
                        I don’t. I wouldn't. I swear, I 
                        would never... not with a baby.

           Joanne eyes him skeptically.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        You're going to be my wife. Let's 
                        start a family. Our child will be 
                        rich in love, and culture, and... 
                        stories.

           The sides of Jo's mouth form the slightest smile.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        You can tell her about Harry, and 
                        I'll read her my articles.

           Jorge mimes holding a PRETEND NEWSPAPER out in front of him.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                             (pretend reading)
                        "Dear baby, today in Porto, three 
                        fireman were burned alive when they 
                        failed to evacuate a building

                        She'll love it!

           Joanne laughs.

           He gives her puppy dog eyes.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           He moves his hand to her stomach.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        It's our baby.

           INT. JORGE’S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne, Jorge, Anie, Jill, and two of Jorge's friends, EMILIO 
           and GUALTER, sit around a cramped table, covered in a 
           tablecloth, plates of food and several bottles of port. 
           There’s one empty seat at the table.

           They smile and laugh in general merriment.

                                 GUALTER
                        Onde está o anel?

           Jorge laughs.

                                 JORGE
                             (to Joanne)
                        He wants to know where your 
                        engagement ring is.

           Anie grabs Jo's hand.

                                 ANIE
                        Yeah, where's the sparkler?

           Joanne smirks at Jorge.

                                 JOANNE
                        I never got one. He proposed with a 
                        wedding band, so we're saving it 
                        for tomorrow.

                                 JORGE

                        I am...
                             (he points to himself)
                        Idiota.

                                 JILL
                        No ring? And no Honeymoon either? 
                        How'd you get away with that?

                                 JORGE
                        I have no money. Diamonds and 
                        islands cannot be bought on a 
                        journalist's salary.

                                 ANIE
                        But all this wine can?

           Everyone chuckles, except for Joanne – Clearly this is a 
           point of contention.

           A KNOCK at the door. Joanne leaps up, runs to the entryway. 

           She swings the door open. Dianne beams in the hallway. 

           The women shriek with delight, embrace one another. 
           Jorge is right behind Jo. He grabs Dianne a bit too 
           forcefully and gives her a handsy, drunk hug.

                                 JORGE
                        My beautiful sister!

                                 JOANNE
                        I can’t believe you actually came.

                                 DIANNE
                        And miss this? Not a chance. 

           Jo leads Dianne to the table.

                                 ANIE
                        She made it!

           The table perks up at the sight of Dianne.

                                 JOANNE
                        This is my sister, Dianne. In from 
                        Scotland. 

           The table cheers, pounds their fists against the table.

                                 DIANNE
                        Hello!

           Jorge pulls her seat out.

                                 JORGE
                        Here. Have a seat. Have some wine!

           He pours her a glass. Then he pours himself one, too. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Don’t you think we should slow down 
                        a bit?

                                 JORGE

                             (to Dianne)
                        I... I don’t know. We haven’t even 
                        talked about it.

                                 JORGE
                        Where did I put that extra bottle?
           Jorge stands from the table, nearly trips.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge, I think we've had enough.

                                 DIANNE
                        Yeah. It's a big day tomorrow. 
                        Let’s take it easy.

           Jorge SCOFFS loudly.

                                 JORGE
                        We are just beginning to have fun! 
                        Emilio, pass me that bottle.

           Emilio hands Jorge a bottle of port.

           Jorge flips it upside down. Nothing comes out.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        And our fun is nearly gone. 

                                 JOANNE
                             (quietly)
                        Jorge, it’s too late for this. I'm 
                        tired. Dianne’s had a long day of 
                        travel... 

                                 JORGE
                        My love, my love! You need to 
                        relax. Enjoy this.

           Joanne gives him a stern look.

                                 JOANNE
                        Please.

           Jorge flounders towards Joanne's chair.

           He wraps his arms around her from behind.

                                 JORGE
                        Of course. Anything for you.

           He kisses her cheek. Then her neck. Then her collarbone. It's 
           getting inappropriate.

           Anie tries to hold back laughter.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge, stop.

           He doesn't stop.
                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        STOP.

           He nibbles at her neck. She pushes him away.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        You're DRUNK.

           Jorge stands, recoils at the word.

           He puffs his chest out, slicks his hair back with a hand.

                                 JORGE
                        I'm sorry, everyone. I'll just... 
                        excuse me.

           He stumbles towards the front door, leaving his guests alone 
           in his home.

           Their guests gape at Joanne. She's bright red — furious, 
           embarrassed.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'd better go after him.

                                 ANIE
                        Of course. We'll be fine.

           Anie shoves Jill.

                                 JILL
                        Yeah, please, go.

           Dianne grabs Joanne's arm. Her eyes scream with concern.

                                 JOANNE
                             (to Dianne)
                        It's OK.
                             (to the table)
                        I'll be back.

           EXT. STREET — NIGHT

           Jorge is hunched over on the curb. He stares at the ground, 
           takes a long drag from a cigarette.

           Joanne's sandals step in front him.

           He grimaces, waits to be reprimanded.

           Joanne squats, lowers herself to his level.
                                 JOANNE
                        You have to stop drinking.

           Jorge digs his foot against a cobblestone.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        And I don't mean drink less. I mean 
                        stop. Forever.

           Jorge's face contorts, he fights tears.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s out of control. I'm not going 
                        to marry an alcoholic.

           His eyes shoot upwards.

                                 JORGE
                        I'm not an...

           His pupils find the pavement again.

                                 JOANNE
                        I love you, Jorge, but every ounce 
                        of me despises you right now. I 
                        won't stay if you drink, but I 
                        won't beg you to stop. 

           Jorge chokes down his tears, his face hardens.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand?

           He brings himself to look at her, unsteadily nods.

           EXT. PORTO SHORE — DAY

           Rare rain-filled clouds cast shadows over the ocean. The 
           sun's amber glow fights to break through the leaden sky.

           A YOUNG BAREFOOT BOY throws a fishing line into the tide.

           INT. PAY PHONE — DAY

           Joanne stares at the receiver inside the rusty phone booth. 

           She rubs her slightly more swollen belly, swallows.

           She reaches towards the phone, only to draw her hand back 
           again. 
           She gnaws on her lip, then picks up the phone. She quickly 
           deposits coins into the slot and hits the keys before she can 
           reconsider.

           RING. RING. RING. 

           No one answers.

           RING.

           She pulls the phone from her ear as she hears—

                                 PETER
                             (though the phone)
                        Hello?

           Joanne brings the receiver back to her ear. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Dad. It’s me.

                                 PETER
                        Joanne?

           An awkward, silent beat. Joanne fights to get words out.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Are you OK? What’s wrong?

                                 JOANNE
                        I just wanted to call to tell 
                        you... to tell you that, um... I’m 
                        getting married.

           The sound of a WOMAN’S VOICE mubmles on the other end of the 
           line. 

           Jo startles. 

                                 PETER
                        Huh? What did you say?

           More of the woman’s voice. 

                                 JOANNE
                        ...Nothing. I shouldn’t have 
                        called. This was a mistake.

           She slams the receiver down. 
           INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE BATHROOM — DAY

           A bright blue eye. A mascara wand passes over it, coating 
           blonde eyelashes in black.

           Joanne, wearing a clinical black blazer and a strand of 
           pearls, tilts over a ceramic sink, switches the wand to her 
           other eye. She’s dressed for a wake, not a wedding.

                                 DIANNE
                        I always thought you'd wear mum's 
                        dress.

           Jo turns towards her sister.

                                 JOANNE
                        Well... now you can.

                                 DIANNE
                        I wish she was here to see you. And 
                        dad. Did you invite him?

                                 JOANNE
                        I tried. He’s busy with whats-her-
                        face.

           Dianne crosses her arms, stares at Jo's reflection. She 
           swallows, musters the courage to say—

                                 DIANNE
                        You know you don't have to do this.

           Joanne stops, sets the brush down.

                                 JOANNE
                        What?

                                 DIANNE
                        He's a drunk, Jo. He's not going to 
                        change.

                                 JOANNE
                        He will. He is.

                                 DIANNE
                        Come home with me. Stay with me and 
                        Roger in Edinburgh. You can marry 
                        Jorge if you want to but just take 
                        some time to think about it first.

           Joanne steadies herself on the sink.

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't have time.
                                 DIANNE
                        What? Why?

           A heavy beat.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm pregnant.

                                 DIANNE
                        Oh, Jo.

           Dianne moves towards her, puts her arms around her.

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't want my kid to grow up 
                        without a father. And I love him... 
                        usually. I have to give it a fair 
                        shot.

                                 DIANNE
                        What if he doesn't stop? What if he 
                        drinks around the baby?

                                 JOANNE
                        He wouldn't.

           Dianne pulls away, studies her big sister.

                                 DIANNE
                        How can you know that?

           Joanne pivots from Dianne, examines at her own somber 
           reflection.

           INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE — DAY

           Filing cabinets, a creaking ceiling fan, a Portuguese flag, 
           and generic landscape paintings weigh down beige walls. No 
           little girl would ever dream of getting married here.

           A BALDING MAN in a sweater rummages through a heavy wooden 
           desk in front of him.

                                 BALDING MAN
                        Ah.

           He pulls out a few creased pieces of paper from a drawer, 
           looks up towards—

           Joanne and Jorge, who stand in front of the desk wearing 
           nervous smiles.
           Dianne sits in a chair in a corner of the room.

                                 BALDING MAN (CONT’D)
                        Shall we begin?

           Jorge pulls Joanne's hands into his, turns her towards him.

           He smiles.

           She doesn't.

           INT. JORGE’S BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Darkness. Joanne and Jorge are curled towards one another 
           under the covers. Their hands touch. A sweet, serene moment.

           But their slumber is interrupted by a CRYING BABY. 

           Joanne’s eyes open. Jorge groans, rolls over away from Jo.

           She sighs, pulls the covers from her body.

           She walks to the baby’s crib in the corner of the room, picks 
           up her newborn daughter, JESSICA. 

           She swaddles her in a blanket, carries her to the window.

           The BRIGHT ORANGE MOON glows into the room. Jessica is 
           mesmerized by it. Her crying ceases.

           Jo kisses her baby’s forehead, looks to Jorge — sound asleep.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           An overturned bottle of baby formula leaks onto the kitchen 
           counter. A fly lands in it.

           Joanne, with bags under her eyes and uncombed hair, clutches 
           JESSICA, now five-months-old, in one arm.

           She pounds on the bedroom door with her free fist.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge.

           She waits, raps on the door again.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Jorge!

           A CLATTER of dishes falling, the THUD of footsteps from 
           within.
           Joanne tugs on the locked door handle, rattles it.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Jorge, please! You need to watch 
                        her. I have to write.

           She waits for a beat, holds her breath — nothing.

           She GROANS loudly, kicks the door.

           INT. KITCHEN — DAY

           Joanne sits on the edge of a kitchen chair in front of the 
           table. Jessica is balanced in her arm, breast-feeding under 
           her shirt.

           She clutches a pen with her free hand, scribbles on the 
           bottom of a piece of paper covered in notes.

           Her breath catches.

                                 JOANNE
                        OW!

           She pulls Jessica up from under her shirt.

           Jessica coughs, spits up milk all over Joanne's pages.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

           With the baby pressed to her chest, she uses the edge of her 
           T-shirt to soak up the mess, but the ink BLEEDS and the 
           cotton SMEARS it across the page. Her work is ruined.

           The sound of the BEDROOM DOOR OPENING. Footsteps.

           Joanne abandons her pages, rushes out of the room.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT, DOORWAY — DAY

           Jorge reaches towards the front door handle, but Jo steps in 
           front of him, blocks the way.

                                 JOANNE
                        What are you doing?

           He looks down, avoids her eyes.

                                 JORGE
                        I need to go.
                                 JOANNE
                        What? Where?

                                 JORGE
                        Move.

                                 JOANNE
                        Where are you going?

           Jorge grabs her arm forcefully, pushes her out of the way.

           Joanne is shocked, stunned. She lets him leave.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Jessica sleeps in her crib with a WHITE STUFFED OWL beside 
           her. A MOBILE, akin to the one in Joanne's nightmare, twists 
           above her head.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN — NIGHT

           Night has fallen over the ruined pages of Jo's writing, now 
           dried and stiffened.

           She sits in the same kitchen table chair, runs a hand through 
           her greasy hair.

           She perks up to the sound of the front door creaking open, 
           soft footsteps shuffle inside.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT, DOORWAY — NIGHT

           With blood-shot eyes and a PURPLE BRUISE covering his left 
           eye, Jorge lumbers through the front door, falls into the 
           entryway.

           He closes the door behind him, tries to focus on his 
           surroundings. He's hammered.

           A blurry Joanne comes in and out of focus.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge, your face.

           He grimaces.

           She steps towards him, arm outstretched, but he swats her 
           away.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, you're wasted.
                                 JORGE
                        I'm fine. Just need some rest.

                                 JOANNE
                        You're fucking sloshed. You can't 
                        even stand up straight.

                                 JORGE
                        Silence, woman. Leave me be.

           Joanne shakes her head.

                                 JOANNE
                             (interrupting)
                        Do you think I want to be this 
                        person?...Worried about you, 
                        nagging you...I hate who I've 
                        become because of you.

                                 JORGE
                        Because of me?!

                                 JOANNE
                        I work twice as hard because you 
                        don't have a job. You never take 
                        care of Jessica and I don't have 
                        any time to write. I have lost all 
                        semblance of myself.

           He looks at her sympathetically. A bit of blood drops down 
           his eyebrow.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        It's killing me, Jorge.

           Unsteadily, he steps towards her. Puts his hands on her 
           shoulders. Looks her in the eyes.

           They stare at each other for a beat, a look of understanding, 
           empathy...

                                 JORGE
                        Get. Out.

           Or not.

                                 JOANNE
                        What?

                                 JORGE
                        Leave.

           He takes her shoulders and SHOVES her towards the door.
           Jo hesitates, looks towards the bedroom where Jessica sleeps.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                                 JOANNE
                        Jorge. Calm down.

                                 JORGE
                        GO!

                                 JOANNE
                        OK. I'll go. Let me get Jessica.

           Jorge sneers, points to the door.

                                 JORGE
                        Out.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm not leaving without her.

                                 JORGE
                        You stupid bitch, go!

           She holds her ground, jaw clenched.

           Jorge sighs, grabs her arms, and PICKS HER UP.

           She kicks and flails her limbs, but his muscled arms are too 
           strong to fight.

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRS — NIGHT

           Jorge propels her down the stairs as she SCREAMS OUT, tries 
           to break free.

           EXT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           His blood-speckled hands heave Joanne into the street.

           She turns back around to face him. Her lip quivers.

                                 JOANNE
                        I need Jess.

           His body barricades the stairway.

           She ducks her head downwards, pulls her arms to her chest, 
           and thrusts all of her weight at him.

           He holds her back, but she keeps coming.
           She grits her teeth, hurls herself at him again.

                                 JORGE
                        STOP IT!

           He winds his arm back, brings his hand down hard, HITS HER 
           ACROSS THE FACE.

           The blow sends her flying back. She lands on all fours on the 
           cobblestones.

           She reaches up to her lip, fingers blood.

           Her eyes close, she swallows, musters all the strength she 
           has left, and rises to her feet. She faces Jorge.

           His eyes widen at the sight of her bloody face, his mouth 
           drops.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jo...

           She doesn't blink, races past him back.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        Jo, WAIT!

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRS — NIGHT

           Jo sprints as fast as she can up the stairs.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           She bursts through the front door, slams it shut, fumbles to 
           lock it behind her.

           She heads straight for the bedroom.

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM — NIGHT

           The mobile spins faster above sleeping Jessica.

           Joanne rushes to the baby, she reaches to pick her up, then 
           hesitates.

           She looks over her shoulder towards the closet.

           She runs to open the closet door, reaches up towards the top 
           shelf on her tip-toes.
           Her face strains, she struggles. Her fingers finds the edge 
           of a box. She wills it down, but the box falls open and the 
           papers cascade to the floor in a mess.

           She scrambles on her hands and knees to collect them, shoves 
           them back in the box.

           She secures the box under her arm, moves towards the crib.

           She softly picks up the baby, swaddles her tightly in the 
           blanket that covers her.

           EXT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne emerges from the stairs into the street. Jorge is 
           waiting for her.

                                 JORGE
                        I'm sorry.

           Joanne avoids eye contact, pushes past him. But he reaches 
           out and GRABS HER ARM.

           She whips towards him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Let us go.

                                 JORGE
                        No, darling, you must stay.

           In one swift movement, Joanne rips her arm free.

           She clutches Jessica tightly to her chest, SPRINTS down the 
           middle of the empty street.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        STOP!

           Thunder clouds RUMBLE above them.

           She runs faster.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        You can't leave me!

           Her eyes start to water. The blood on her cheek mixes with 
           salty tears.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        JOANNE!
           She runs. The thunder GROWLS louder.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        GET BACK HERE!

           And runs.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        YOU ARE MY WIFE. COME BACK!

           And runs — towards God knows where — into the thunderous, 
           pitch-black night.

           INT. THE TRAIN — NIGHT

           Rain PELTS the top of the tin canopy. Thunder BOOMS into the 
           train. 

           The edge of Jessica's baby blanket sweeps under Joanne's eye, 
           collecting blood. She tucks the tainted edge back into the 
           bundle that holds her daughter.

           She sheepishly looks around the train — A MIDDLE AGED MAN 
           holding a construction hat, already up for work, and TWO 
           TEENAGE BOYS still wired from a night at the club, ride the 
           otherwise empty train.

           She looks down at Jessica, who cracks open a sleepy eye, then 
           looks to the tattered box of writing scraps.

           Another BOOM of thunder. A piercing strike of LIGHTNING 
           lights up the train car. 

           But this time, the bolt of light that once inspired her makes 
           her tremble. She grits her teeth, tightens her grip on the 
           two things she cares about most.

           EXT. EDINBURGH COUNTRYSIDE — DAY

           A handful of sheep in desperate need of a sheer huddle under 
           an Oak tree as overhead clouds start to rumble.

           EXT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           Sleek, modern, with every luxury but none of the charm of 
           their childhood home.

           Dianne opens the front door, her mouth drops.

           Joanne stands in front of her, with a bruised face and a 
           crying baby.
           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT, OFFICE — DAY

           A cluttered storage room. A desk and a chair, and tons of 
           boxes marked in ink: "Books", "kitchen", "bedroom".

           Joanne, with wet hair and a towel over her shoulder, lays 
           Jessica down on a small cot in a corner of the messy room.

           Dianne hands her a pillow and a blanket.

                                 DIANNE
                        It's not a real bed, but it'll do 
                        for now.

                                 JOANNE
                        I feel horrible crashing, Di. Roger 
                        must hate me. Newlyweds and already 
                        the extended family has come to 
                        stay.

                                 DIANNE
                        Nonsense. We want you here.

                                 JOANNE
                        Only for a little while. I'll find 
                        a job, my own place.

                                 DIANNE
                        Shh. Get some sleep.

           She heads to the door.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        And I'm right across the hall if 
                        you need me, alright?

           She nods.

           Dianne closes the door behind her.

           Joanne exhales. She climbs onto the cot next to Jessica, tugs 
           the blanket around them both.

           She picks up a box of photographs on the floor, fingers 
           through them —

           Dianne and ROGER, Dianne’s husband, on their wedding day; 
           Dianne and Joanne as little girls; Peter's black and white 
           high school graduation portrait, and a photo of Anne on the 
           beach, about 30, feet stuck in the sand and a killer smile 
           decorating her sun-kissed features.

           She holds up the picture, admires it in her hand. But her 
           smile fades as she catches sight of her wedding band.
           She twists it off, sets it down next to the photograph of her 
           mother. Look how far she’s come.

           She clicks off the lamp next to her.

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, HALLWAY — FLASHBACK/DREAM

           The same familiar MAIL CART, overflowing with a multitude of 
           packages and letters, rolls across a familiar gray carpet.

           It rolls past offices and a CONFERENCE ROOM, where we see—

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, CONFERENCE ROOM — FLASHBACK/DREAM

           Joanne sitting in the empty room. She adjusts a stationary 
           video camera pointed at an empty seat in front of her.

           A RAPPING on the open wooden door.

                                 JOANNE
                        Come in.

           A WOMAN in a blazer and slacks ushers in a 20-YEAR-OLD 
           AFRICAN MAN who TREMBLES.

                                 WOMAN
                        Take a seat here.

           The man LIMPS across the room, finds his seat with great 
           effort.

           The woman sits next to Joanne.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to ask you a few 
                        questions, and we're going to do it 
                        on camera, alright?

           The man says nothing.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Joanne)
                        Ready?

           Joanne nods, clicks the video camera ON.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Please say your name and age.

           The man looks to the camera, hesitates.

           Joanne watches him through the camera lense.
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        When you're ready.

                                 AFRICAN MAN
                        My name is Thato.

                                 WOMAN
                        And your age?

                                 THATO
                        I am 19.

                                 WOMAN
                        Where did you grow up, Thato?

                                 THATO
                        I lived in Harare with my father, 
                        but we had no money, so I moved to 
                        Cape Town for a job herding cattle. 
                        It was good. The work was hard but 
                        I had a bed. I never slept in a bed 
                        before.

                                 WOMAN
                        Why did you leave?

                                 THATO
                        My boss was suspicious. He thought 
                        I was stealing cows. He was always 
                        drunk. He stopped paying me. I had 
                        no money to send to my father, to 
                        feed myself. So I asked him for my 
                        money. He went to a back room. I 
                        thought he was getting my payment. 
                        But he brought out a gun. I ran.

                                 WOMAN
                        Where did you run?

           Joanne zooms in on Thato with the video camera.

                                 THATO
                        Into the trees.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FARM — NIGHT

           THATO, sweat pouring down his face, eyes frantic, races 
           across a CATTLE FIELD.

                                 FARMER
                             (O.S.)
                        THATO!
           Thato's eyes are huge, wild — he doesn't dare turn back.

           The farmer SHOUTS after him as he hurls himself across the 
           field.

           But he sees something, his BARE FEET skid forward in the 
           muddied dirt—

           He's trapped. A tall barbed-wire fence separates the farm 
           from the forest. 

                                 FARMER (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to kill you, THIEF!

           Thato turns around to see—

           A TOWERING, MIDDLE-AGED FARMER plodding through the mud 
           towards him, pistol raised.

           Thato inhales, LEAPS onto the barbed wire fence.

           He climbs it, struggles. His hands grip the thorny knots. He 
           SCREAMS OUT in pain.

           With every step upwards, another grimace. BLOOD trickles down 
           his wrists.

           But he's close — inches from the top.

           He swings a leg over the fence, the wire ripping into his 
           leg. He grits his teeth, pulls the other leg over when—

           A GUN SHOT RINGS OUT.

           Thato WAILS.

           His thigh eats the pistol's bullet, blood leaks towards the 
           forest floor.

           Thato FALLS a dozen feet down, THUDS to the ground.

           But the farmer doesn't stop shooting.

           BANG! he misses. BANG! BANG! He's closing in.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FOREST — NIGHT

           Thato drags himself into the woods, pulling the weight of his 
           dead leg behind him.

           Lush green trees twist towards the sky, blanketing the forest 
           in a dark emerald canopy.
           Thato heaves his body forward into the darkness.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FARM — NIGHT

                                 FARMER
                        YOU BASTARD!

           BANG! BANG! BANG! The farmer fires round after round into the 
           darkness.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FOREST — NIGHT

           Thato's eyes are heavy, he's losing consciousness.

           He musters all his remaining strength, pulls himself towards 
           a dead, fallen tree.

           He collapses behind it, examines his leg. Blood pours out 
           from the bullet wound, soaking the leaves around him a 
           sinister crimson.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FARM — NIGHT

           The farmer's face is bright red. He fires blindly into the 
           forest, his pupils ignite with the blaze of the gun.

           But then, his pistol clicks — no bullet comes out.

           He pulls the trigger again, but his ammo is gone.

           He GROWLS, the sound echoing to—

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, FOREST — NIGHT

           Thato, who lies behind the tree. He pulls the leaves around 
           his body and buries himself in dirt and fallen branches.

           He SHAKES beneath the brush. His breath is choppy, uneven.

           He looks up towards the ebony sky, and we look down at him 
           — dying, hopeless, buried alive.

           BACK TO—

           INT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY

           Joanne looks up from the camera at Thato, who VIOLENTLY 
           SHAKES in his chair. His voice trembles, barely able to form 
           words.
                                 THATO
                        I was terrified he would find me. 
                        That I would die hiding.

           As he speaks, an EBONY MIST floods the ceiling. From it, 
           THREE FACELESS FIGURES cloaked in black float down from the 
           fog.

                                 THATO (CONT’D)
                        I felt the blood seeping from my 
                        leg. I knew no one was coming for 
                        me. I knew I was going to die.

           The figures ascend towards Thato, surround him, shroud him in 
           darkness.

                                 THATO (CONT’D)
                        I feared for my father. I wanted to 
                        tell him where I was. I wanted him 
                        to know that I am sorry.

           The figures tilt their shadowed faces towards Thato, they 
           inhale deeply, and they suck the life from his body.

           Joanne watches in horror, unable to aid the man dying before 
           her eyes.

           The SOUND OF THE CREATURES' SOUL-SUCKING becomes louder. 
           Thato's face drains of color.

           One of the creatures reaches a skeletal hand out from under 
           his cloak. He winds his boned fingers around Thato's neck and 
           KISSES HIM deeply.

           Thato takes a final, pained breath. His eyes go dead.

                                 WOMAN
                             (O.S.)
                        Joanne.

           Joanne's eyes hold heavy tears.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                             (O.S.)
                        Joanne!

           Joanne snaps to. The tears leak down her cheeks.

           But the creatures are gone. The room is brightly lit. Thato 
           is alive.

           Joanne clicks the recorder off.
                                 JOANNE
                        I'm sorry, I just...

                                 WOMAN
                        Can you walk Thato to the train?

           Joanne looks at Thato, who continues to shake in his chair.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE, WAITING ROOM — DAY

           Joanne shades in the cloak of a SKELETAL CREATURE onto the 
           corner of a EDINBURGH newspaper, dated 2/13/1994.

           She sits in a cluttered office space, brown walls and brown 
           carpet, in a row of identical metal chairs filled with women 
           and men of all races and ages. Jessica sleeps in a stroller 
           next to her.

           Two toddlers play with Legos on the floor near her feet.

           The sound of babies crying drains out the sound of—

                                 SECRETARY
                        Rowling. John, Rowling?

           Joanne perks up.

                                 JOANNE
                        Joanne?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Oh, yes. Joanne Rowling.

           Joanne nods, stands.

           INT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE — DAY

           Joanne sits in front of a desk piled with stacks of papers. 
           NANCY, a middle-aged woman with a tightly pulled back bun, 
           flips through a clipboard of forms.

           Joanne taps her foot, waits to be addressed.

                                 NANCY
                        Hmmm.

                                 JOANNE
                        Yes?
                                 NANCY
                        It says you quit your job in 
                        Portos?

                                 JOANNE
                        That's correct.

                                 NANCY
                        Why did you quit?

                                 JOANNE
                        I had to leave.

                                 NANCY
                        Why?

                                 JOANNE
                        I needed to return to Edinburgh.

           Nancy sits back in her chair, studies Joanne.

                                 NANCY
                        Ms. Rowling, I can't award you any 
                        aid if you continue to be coy. Why 
                        should we give you state support if 
                        you willingly left a paying job? 
                        Please, help me out.

           Joanne looks at Jessica, swallows.

                                 JOANNE
                        My husband is abusive. I feared for 
                        my life and my daughter's life.

           Nancy doesn't even blink.

                                 NANCY
                        How did he abuse you?

                                 JOANNE
                        He drank. He hit me.

                                 NANCY
                        Where did he hit you?

                                 JOANNE
                        He slapped me across the face. 
                        Pushed me.

           Nancy writes on her clipboard, doesn't look up.

                                 NANCY
                        Did it leave a mark?
                                 JOANNE
                        Yes. I bruised and bled.

                                 NANCY
                        Did you take any photographs?

                                 JOANNE
                        No. I didn't.

           Nancy looks up.

                                 NANCY
                        You have to take photos. Did you 
                        report it?

                                 JOANNE
                        No, I fled. I had to leave 
                        immediately.

           Nancy shakes her head.

                                 NANCY
                        You're not making things very easy 
                        for me. Did you file for a 
                        restraining order? For divorce?

                                 JOANNE
                        No. I just left! We had to get away 
                        from him. I wasn't thinking about 
                        any of that.

                                 NANCY
                        Well does he know where you are? 
                        Where his daughter is?

                                 JOANNE
                        Did you hear what I said? He hit 
                        me. He could hurt her. There's no 
                        way in hell I'm telling him where I 
                        am. Ever.

           Nancy sighs.

                                 NANCY
                        Well, from the state's point of 
                        view, nothing criminal happened.
                        The only thing I can tell is that 
                        you quit your occupation in 
                        Portugal and moved to Scotland.

                                 JOANNE
                        But I had to leave! He's dangerous. 
                        He would have—
           Nancy lifts up her hand, silences her.

                                 NANCY
                        This is what I can do for you. 
                        Eighty pounds a week — with weekly 
                        check-ins and on the condition that 
                        you actively look for employment.

                                 JOANNE
                        Eighty pounds a week?! That's not 
                        even enough to put Jess in daycare. 
                        No job will let me bring a baby to 
                        work.

           Nancy shrugs.

                                 NANCY
                        Eighty pounds. Take it or leave it.

           INT. THE TRAIN — DAY

           Joanne stares out the fogged-over train window onto the 
           vibrant green landscape. A stony castle on a hill is 
           surrounded by a dozen cottages, miniature in comparison.

           Joanne lifts her hand to the window, draws a MOAT around the 
           castle with her finger on the foggy glass. She adds FLAGS 
           sticking up from the top. 

           Jess STIRS, whimpers in Jo's lap.

           Joanne reaches into a bag and pulls out a RED AND GOLD 
           KNITTED SCARF. She swaddles it around the baby, who coos in 
           contentment.

           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           A bowl of untouched oatmeal steams on the kitchen counter, 
           resting next to Joanne's arm, wrapped in the cord of a 
           landline phone.

                                 JOANNE
                             (into the phone)
                        I don’t have that certification, 
                        no, but I have experience teaching 
                        English in Portugal. I can manage 
                        without a— yes, I understand. I 
                        know. Fine. Thank you.

           She hangs up.
           She picks up a folded over newspaper, the classified section 
           is marked up in highlighter. She draws an "X" through one of 
           the highlighted listings.

           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           The untouched oatmeal has turned into hardened slush.

                                 JOANNE
                             (into the phone)
                        Just meet with me, please! I'm 
                        extremely qualified for this 
                        position. Sir—

           She GROANS. Slams the phone down.

           Picks up a pen, marks off the final highlighted item in a sea 
           of "X"s.

           She stares at the obliterated newspaper. But then, the phone 
           rings.

           Her eyes light up, she picks it up.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Moore and Rowling residence.

                                 MAN
                             (muffled through the 
                             phone)
                        Jo?

           Joanne's face turns stark-white.

                                                      INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. JORGE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           Jorge sits on the edge of his bed, an empty bottle of tequila 
           next to his pillow.

                                 JORGE
                        Joanne.

           Jo's breath quickens. She’s paralyzed.  

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        I miss you. I need you to come 
                        home.

           She slams the receiver down. Exhales.
           She looks to the floor. Jessica plays with a her white owl on 
           a blanket.

           Her jaw trembles.

           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT, DINING ROOM — DAY

           Dianne and ROGER; 30s, a business-minded suit, sit across 
           from Joanne, who wears an oversized pajama top. Her hair is a 
           mess, her face is oily, unwashed.

           She stares down at a plate of meat and vegetables.

                                 DIANNE
                             (O.S.)
                        Joanne.

           She looks up. Dianne and Roger stare at her with the faces of 
           concerned parents.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        I'm — we're — worried about you.

           Jo's brow furrows.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        You've lost weight. You're hardly 
                        speaking. You're not taking care of 
                        yourself.

           Roger grabs his wife's hand, squeezes it.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        I know you're upset, but he hasn't 
                        tried to call again.

                                 JOANNE
                        What if he comes here? What if he 
                        breaks in? He sounded drunk.

                                 DIANNE
                        We will never let him near you or 
                        Jessica. I swear it, Jo.

                                 ROGER
                        Look. I have a friend. A 
                        psychiatrist. We think you should 
                        see him.

                                 DIANNE
                        It could help. Talking to someone 
                        who isn't us.
                                 JOANNE
                        I can't afford a shrink.

                                 DIANNE
                        It's taken care of. And I'll watch 
                        Jess, OK? Do it for her. She needs 
                        her mum back.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE — DAY

           A baby blue couch. An aquarium. A sheepskin rug.

           Joanne slumps further down into the couch.

           A PSYCHIATRIST, Patrick, 40s, with round spectacles and jet-
           black hair, stares blankly at Jo.

                                 PATRICK
                        So. What brings you here?

                                 JOANNE
                        My sister wanted me to come.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why?

                                 JOANNE
                        Because I'm a mess, apparently.

                                 PATRICK
                        In what way?

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't know. I moved to Edinburgh 
                        about a month ago. I don't know 
                        anyone. I don't have a job. I'm a 
                        single mother. My husband is 
                        abusive. I haven't been eating. Or 
                        sleeping. But sometimes all I can 
                        do is sleep. I feel like a mass of 
                        flesh and bones just... taking up 
                        space.

           Patrick jots down some notes.

                                 PATRICK
                        Do you ever think of hurting 
                        yourself?

           Joanne picks at her nails.

                                 JOANNE
                        Doesn't everyone?
                                 PATRICK
                        No. They don't. Do you ever think 
                        of harming your daughter?

           Joanne's eyes shoot up.

                                 JOANNE
                        Never. I would never. Jessica is 
                        the only thing getting me through 
                        this. She is everything to me.

                                 PATRICK
                        So what hurts most?

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't know... Everything... I 
                        don't know.

           Patrick studies her, watches her fingers dig aggressively 
           into her nail beds.

                                 PATRICK
                        If you were to look into a mirror 
                        and see what you desire most, what 
                        would you see?

           Joanne's lip quivers.

                                 JOANNE
                        My mother. I would see my mum.

           Her eyes flood with tears.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        She would tell me what to do. She 
                        would make everything better.

           Patrick says nothing, lets her cry.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I feel like there's 
                        something sucking the life out of 
                        me. Like every happy moment and 
                        memory I've ever had is being bled 
                        from my body.

           Patrick jots some more, rips a note from his prescription 
           pad.

                                 PATRICK
                        This is a prescription for 
                        fluoxetine. It's a medication for 
                        depression, it should help you.
           He extends the paper to Jo.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        And, Joanne?

           She grabs the other end, but he doesn't let go yet.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You are not a waste of space.

           INT. PHARMACY — DAY

           Joanne approaches the pharmacy counter with a bundle of 
           diapers under her arm. A frizzy-haired PHARMACIST types on a 
           hefty grey computer.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Picking up?

                                 JOANNE
                        Yeah, Joanne Rowling.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Birthday?

                                 JOANNE
                        July 31, 1965.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        One moment.

           The pharmacist grabs a bottle behind the desk, sets it on the 
           counter.

                                 JOANNE
                        Oh, and these.

           She sets the diapers on the counter.

           The pharmacist scans the items.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        That'll be 147 pounds.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm sorry... 147 pounds?!

                                 PHARMACIST
                        That's right. Do you have 
                        insurance? It might cover the cost 
                        of the medication.
                                 JOANNE
                        No.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Then I'm afraid that's what it 
                        costs.

           Joanne looks to the pills, then the diapers.

                                 JOANNE
                        Fine. Just the nappies then.

           INT. TRAIN — NIGHT

           Joanne rests her head against the window, watches the 
           landscape blur by.

           But then her gaze changes focus, she concentrates on the 
           glass itself.

           She sits up straight, her eye caught by something in the 
           reflection.

           And then we see it — Jo's mother, Anne, appears to sit in the 
           seat behind her.

           Jo spins around. But of course — there's no one there.

           She shakes her head, slumps down in the seat, tries to hide 
           her tears.

           Her eyes close, and the sound of Patrick's voice floats over 
           her—

                                 PATRICK
                             (O.S.)
                        If you were to look into a mirror 
                        and see what you desire most, what 
                        would you see?

           Her eyes open. A CRUMPLED UP PIECE OF LIME GREEN PAPER 
           sticking out under her seat grabs her attention.

           She reaches down, smoothes it out — a band flyer for "CORNISH 
           PIXIES, Live at the Liquid Room, one night only!"

           She turns it over, flattens it. She grabs a pen from her bag, 
           writes— "D E S I R E"

           She studies the word. Then writes the letters in reverse 
           underneath: "E R I S E D"

           She folds the paper in half, pockets it.
           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT — DAY

           Joanne closes the front door behind her. Dianne and Jessica 
           wait for her in the entryway.

                                 DIANNE
                        Hey. How did it go?

           Jo takes her baby from her sister's arms, gives Jess a kiss.

                                 JOANNE
                        It was good. Thank you, Di.

                                 DIANNE
                        Did he give you anything to take?

                                 JOANNE
                        Yeah. Anti-depressants. I think 
                        they're helping already.

           Dianne smiles.

           From behind her, THEIR FATHER, Peter, steps into the hallway.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        ...Dad?

                                 PETER
                        Jo.

           They don't embrace, or even smile, really.

                                 DIANNE
                        I thought we could all have dinner. 
                        It's been so long.

           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT, DINING ROOM — NIGHT

           Dianne and Roger sit across from Joanne and Peter. Jessica is 
           in her high seat next to her mom, playing with a few bright 
           green peas on a tray.

           Joanne hasn't touched her food.

           She grimaces at the sound of her father's utensils dragging 
           across his plate. He stuffs a fork-full of meat into his 
           mouth.

           Dianne clears her throat.

                                 DIANNE
                        So. Dad. How's Jan?
           Joanne flinches at the name.

                                 PETER
                        She's good. We're going on vacation 
                        to Stratford. Got a little cottage.

                                 ROGER
                        Ooh, catch some Shakespeare? My 
                        mate is an extra in Hamlet there. I 
                        don't have the palette for it, 
                        really.

                                 DIANNE
                        Neither does Dad. He hates it.

                                 PETER
                        All that wordy nonsense. Seems self-
                        important. Not for me.

           Roger chuckles.

                                 ROGER
                        Cheers to that.

           They clink glasses.

                                 JOANNE
                        Mum loved Shakespeare.

           She turns to her father.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        It's a shame you couldn't have 
                        taken her.

           Roger sets down his glass.

                                 ROGER
                        I did take her. When you were a 
                        baby. We saw Much Ado About 
                        Something.

           Dianne laughs.

                                 DIANNE
                        Nothing, Dad.

                                 JOANNE
                        I was seven, and it wasn't 
                        Stratford. I remember.

                                 ROGER
                        Really? Mmm.
                                 DIANNE
                        Jo, you're not eating. Are you 
                        feeling alright?

                                 JOANNE
                        No. I'd better get some air.

           She pulls Jessica from her seat, swiftly leaves the room.

           EXT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

           Joanne sits on the cement curb, rocks a swaddled Jessica in 
           her arms.

           She looks up towards the night sky, a single star is visible. 
           It's huge, vibrant, glorious.

           But then— it moves. It's an airplane, not a star. 

           CLOSE ON: The sound of the front door opening.

           Peter walks outside, squats down on the curb next to Jo.

           They sit for a moment in silence.

                                 PETER
                        She's pretty, isn't she?

                                 JOANNE
                        She's strong.

                                 PETER
                        How'd you think of the name?

           Joanne strokes Jessica's cheek.

                                 JOANNE
                        Jessica Mitford. She's an author. A 
                        Civil Rights' advocate. An 
                        investigative journalist. She was 
                        ballsy. Stubborn, but tough.

                                 PETER
                        Perhaps the name would be better 
                        suited for her mother.

           Jo looks up, frowns. And then it comes—

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Jo, you know I loved your mum very 
                        much.

           Joanne squints sharply up at her father.
                                 JOANNE
                        She’s your secretary. The wedding 
                        was right after mom died. How could 
                        you do that?

                                 PETER
                        I needed to move on. There's no 
                        harm in that. You need to move on, 
                        too.

                                 JOANNE
                        What, and forget her? Replace her? 
                        She is my mother. Your wife.

                                 PETER
                        I haven't forgotten her.

           Joanne kneads her foot into the ground.

                                 JOANNE
                        You were gone when she was sick. 
                        You didn't help her. You forgot her 
                        before she was dead.

           It hits him, hard. His empathetic eyes turn cold.

                                 PETER
                        How dare you.

           He stands up.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What would she think if she saw you 
                        now? Penniless, alone, a single 
                        mother... still pretending to 
                        write. It kills me she never saw 
                        her eldest succeed.

           Looks down at her.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        And it could have killed her, too.

           Joanne CHOKES on her breath, her eyes flood with tears.

           Her father stomps inside the house.

           INT. DIANNE'S APARTMENT, OFFICE — NIGHT

           Joanne sits up in her cot, her eyes bloodshot from crying.
                                 DIANNE
                             (O.S.)
                        I don't know how much longer. A few 
                        months, maybe?

           Joanne looks towards the door.

                                 ROGER
                             (O.S.)
                        A few months?! Di, I love your 
                        sister. But I need my office back. 
                        And we need to start building our 
                        life together — alone.

                                 DIANNE
                        She is my sister! She's not well, 
                        Roger. She'll stay as long as she 
                        needs.

           The floorboards inside the office CREAK.

                                 DIANNE (CONT’D)
                        We can't talk about this here. 
                        C'mon.

           FOOTSTEPS shuffle down the hall.

           Joanne looks to Jess, whose miniature fingers wrap around her 
           stuffed white owl.

           INT. EMPTY FLAT — DAY

           Moldy carpet. A leaking ceiling. A real hell hole.

           A REALTOR in a T-shirt and flip flops scratches his head.

                                 REALTOR
                        So it's 250 pounds a month. First 
                        and last.

           Joanne looks around the deteriorating cube.

           CLOSE ON the sound of a million tiny nails SCRATCHING on the 
           walls. Joanne JUMPS.

                                 JOANNE
                        What is that?

                                 REALTOR
                        You don't wanna know, love.

           She sees a pile of mice droppings in the corner — she gets 
           it.
                                 JOANNE
                        I'll give you 250 for the first 
                        month, no last.

                                 REALTOR
                        You got yourself a deal, little 
                        lady!

           He extends a hairy hand to shake on it.

                        Welcome home.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Joanne throws a shirt, a pair of slacks, and a dress into the 
           closet.

           She puts a few books on the top shelf, next to her BOX OF 
           WRITING SCRAPS.

           INT. JOANNE’S FLAT, LIVING ROOM — DAY

           Joanne heaves an ancient typewriter, with the letters "JR" 
           engraved on its metal face, onto the table in front of a 
           window. 

           She runs a hand over the dusty keys. She steps back. Stares 
           at it. Paces.

           EXT. ROWLING BACKYARD — DAY — FLASHBACK

           Anne, Peter, Dianne (14), and Joanne (16), sit around a 
           wooden picnic table, paper plates of half-eaten birthday cake 
           around them.

                                 ANNE
                        Alright, present time. Close your 
                        eyes dear, I couldn't wrap this 
                        one.

           Joanne covers eyes face with her hands.

                                 JOANNE
                             (joking)
                        Ooh, is it a car?!

           Peter SCOFFS.

                                 ANNE
                        Keep them closed.
           Anne rolls THE TYPEWRITER, festooned with a big yellow bow, 
           next to Jo on a rolling cart.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        OK love, open 'em.

           Joanne's eyes pop open and she sees it — the carriage holding 
           a piece of paper with the words "Happy sweet 16, Joanne!" 
           typed in black ink.

           JOANNE jumps up, elated.

                                 JOANNE
                        Oh, mum.

                                 ANNE
                        For my writer. My chridhe. (heart)

           She runs to her mother, picks her up, spins her around.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Put me down, child!

           Anne playfully hits her daughter.

           Jo gives her mother a big kiss on the cheek.

                                 PETER
                        You can only use it when you've 
                        finished your homework. And only on 
                        weekends. Do you understand?

                                 DIANNE
                        It's gorgeous, mum. Well done!

                                 PETER
                        Jo. Did you hear?

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, hush. If she's going to be a 
                        bread-winning novelist she must 
                        practice.

           Joanne beams.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        It's a bit old, but it'll do the 
                        trick. For now.

                                 JOANNE
                        It's perfect mum. Thank you.

           END FLASHBACK.
           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, LIVING ROOM — DAY

           Jo stares at the piece of ancient machinery. She approaches 
           it, reaches her hands out, then steps back.

           She tries to approach it again, fails. She sighs. 

           She wraps her arms around it, picks it up.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Joanne hauls the typewriter into her closet. 

           She throws her knitted Christmas sweater, adorned with the 
           lopsided letter "J", over the machine, shuts the closet door 
           closed.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BEDROOM — DAY

           Joanne's eyes open to the sound of MICE SCRATCHING inside the 
           walls.

           She sighs, rolls over towards Jessica.

           She runs a hand over her daughter's wispy blonde baby hair.

                                 JOANNE
                        We've got to get out of here, Jess.

           EXT. LONDON STREET — DAY

           Jessica is strapped to Joanne's chest in a sling. They amble 
           down the busy London street. SUITS and WOMEN in high heels 
           and blazers push past them.

           The vibrant awning of PICKLED PEPPER BOOKS catches Jo's eye. 
           She pauses in front of the beckoning storefront.

           INT. PICKLED PEPPER BOOKS — DAY

           BELLS JINGLE as Joanne pushes the glass door open into the 
           irresistible children's book store.

           Paper cutouts of stars hang from the ceiling, twinkly lights 
           drape over windows, stuffed animals embellish every available 
           nook. And of course, walls and walls of beloved books.

           Joanne's eyes ignite at the sight of it all.
           She walks down an aisle, runs her hands over the bindings of 
           Good Night Moon, Where The Wild Things Are, Alice in 
           Wonderland, The Chronicles of Narnia.

           She extracts a copy of LITTLE WOMEN, settles into a kid-sized 
           chair.

           She opens the book, her eyes wander over a random passage:

           "And Jo said, 'I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm 
           out of my sphere now, for woman's special mission is supposed 
           to be drying tears and bearing burdens...'"

                                 WOMAN
                             (O.S.)
                        One of the greatest heroines in all 
                        of literature, Jo.

           Jo looks up. A WOMAN WITH FLAMING RED HAIR, clutching a stack 
           of books, stands behind her.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm sorry?

                                 WOMAN
                        Jo March, from Little Women. So 
                        bold. Daring. Outspoken. She never 
                        gave up. I heard Louisa May Alcott 
                        based the character on herself.

           Joanne smiles.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm not surprised.

                                 WOMAN
                        Wouldn't it be magical, to have a 
                        brain that could produce something 
                        that brilliant?

                                 JOANNE
                        It would be.

           Joanne closes the book. Her smile fades.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        Another life, maybe.

           She pushes the novel back into the shelf.
           EXT. LONDON STREET — DAY

           Familiar grey stratus clouds congregate above the populous 
           street. Thunder booms. Rain drips from the sky. Passing 
           PEDESTRIANS huddle under umbrellas.

           Joanne darts across the sidewalk, her sweater and Jessica's 
           sling entirely soaked.

           She ducks into the closest shop.

           INT. GROCERY STORE — DAY

           Joanne rings her hair out onto the linoleum floor.

           A MAN IN A SUIT hits her leg with his shopping cart as he 
           heads for the exit.

                                 JOANNE
                        Oy! Watch where you're going, eh?

                                 MAN
                        Sorry, didn't see yo— Joanne? 
                        Joanne Rowling?

           Joanne eyes the man up and down — well-kempt, handsome, but 
           with horribly bleached blonde hair — It's Mason, the fucker.

           Her face drops.

                                 MASON
                        Woah! I hardly recognized you. It's 
                        Mason... from Amnesty.

           Joanne flushes a bright red.

                                 JOANNE
                        Mason, hi.

                                 MASON
                        God, are you alright? You look... 
                        different. So... thin. Is that a 
                        baby?

           Joanne quickly wipes rainwater from Jessica's forehead.

                                 JOANNE
                        This is Jessica.

                                 MASON
                        So, you married then?
                                 JOANNE
                        Um, yeah. No. Not really. I mean I 
                        am, but... no.

           Mason cocks his head.

                                 MASON
                        OK. Well, where are you working 
                        these days? I remember when you got 
                        the boot from Amnesty. That was 
                        grim.

           He laughs stupidly — still a dick.

           Joanne bites her bottom lip, tries to puff herself up.

                                 JOANNE
                        I'm... writing. Books.

           He raises an eyebrow in disbelief.

           She swallows her pride.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        And how are you?

           Mason brushes a piece of lint off his suit.

                                 MASON
                        Meh. Told myself I'd never be a 
                        business wanker in a fancy suit, 
                        but here I am. Working for my 
                        father of all people.

           He slicks back his blonde hair, chuckles obnoxiously.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        It certainly pays the bills — more 
                        than reading letters from refugees, 
                        that's for sure. The old man’s 
                        company just sold, actually. So I’m 
                        bloody rich! 

           Jo tries to smile.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I'm engaged — to Laura — 
                        you remember Laura.

           Jessica, still soaking wet in her sling, cries out.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        You know. She worked in PR. Blonde. 
                        With the tits.
                                 JOANNE
                        Yeah, Laura. Right.

           Mason ignores the crying baby.

                                 MASON
                        She’s a weather girl now at Channel 
                        4. Have you seen her? She just got 
                        her own segment — she’s bloody 
                        viral now. 

                                 JOANNE
                        Mmm.

                                 MASON
                        Are you sure you're alright? You 
                        look... I mean if you need money, 
                        or...

           Jessica cries louder.

                                 JOANNE
                        Look, I gotta go.

           Joanne hoists Jess close to her chest, rushes out of the 
           grocery store.

           Mason guffaws to himself.

                                 MASON
                        Uh, bye...?

           EXT. LONDON STREET — DAY

           Joanne holds Jessica tight to her bosom as she speed-walks 
           through the rain. She chokes down tears. Her walk turns into 
           a run.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BATHROOM — NIGHT

           Water from the shower's faucet beats down the back of 
           Joanne's neck and scalp. She stands motionless, letting the 
           water cascade around her.

           She pushes the hair from her face, then rests her forehead 
           against the crumbling tile. Closes her eyes. Mascara spirals 
           down her cheeks towards the drain.
           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, KITCHEN — NIGHT

           The storm rages outside, pounding down on the roof with 
           vigor.

           Jessica bobs around in her high-seat at the kitchen table.

           With wet hair and in a bathrobe, Jo pours a can of soup into 
           a pot.

           She lights a gas burner with a match, sets the pot on the 
           stove.

           A robust POUNDING on the door is muffled by the storm. 
           Another THUD THUD THUD.

           Joanne perks up. She goes to the door, looks through the peep 
           hole, sees nothing.

           She unlocks the bolt, cracks the door open. Looks to her 
           left, to her right—

           And GASPS, attempts to push the door closed, but AN ARM 
           reaches in and thrusts it wide open, sending her flying back 
           into the house.

           There he is, in a drunken stupor, hair wild and wet — JORGE.

           The rain pounds the ground outside him, framing his bulky 
           stature.

                                 JORGE
                        My Joanne.

           He falters towards to her.

           Rising from the carpet, she throws her arms up to stop him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Don't come near me!

           He steps closer.

                                 JORGE
                        I came all this way. For you.

           Joanne's eyes dart around the room.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        For Jessica. Where is my baby?

                                 JOANNE
                        GET OUT.
                                 JORGE
                        I feel terrible about what I did. 
                        But I've changed. I can be a good 
                        husband. A father.

           Joanne backs into the kitchen, grabs the phone off the wall.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOANNE
                        Leave.

                                 JORGE
                        What are you—

           JORGE rushes at her. She quickly dials 9 9—

           But he grabs the receiver from her hands. They struggle, a 
           tug of war. She hits the final "9" before letting go, and he 
           trips backwards, dropping the phone. It dangles from the 
           cord.

           Jorge crawls towards her on the carpet, sweat and rain 
           greasing his hair and face.

                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        You horrible woman. I gave you 
                        everything and you took my only 
                        daughter from me?!

           He stands.

           Jessica cries.

           Joanne opens the kitchen drawer, fumbles for something — 
           anything. Her hand finds a BOX CUTTER.

           She thrusts it out in front of her.

                                 JOANNE
                        GO!

           But the tool doesn't scare him. He sneers at her.

                                 JORGE
                        No one will ever love you. You're 
                        worthless. A slut.

           He spots Jessica, stumbles towards her.
                                 JORGE (CONT’D)
                        You were never a good writer. You 
                        will never be anything. You're just 
                        a DUMB BITCH.

           Joanne bites her lip down hard, the razor shakes back and 
           forth in her hand.

           He steps closer to Jessica.

                                 JOANNE
                        DON'T TOUCH HER.

                                 JORGE
                        You don't deserve her. I'm taking 
                        her with me.

           Joanne LUNGES at Jorge with the box cutter, but he grabs her 
           wrist and pulls the blade from her grasp. It topples to the 
           floor.

           Joanne SCREAMS OUT. He slaps a hand on her mouth and pushes 
           her against the wall.

           She kicks at him with all her might.

           Jessica watches her mother's struggle, her father's hand 
           squeezing Jo's face hard.

           She kicks him again, hard, and he screams, drunkenly loses 
           his balance. He collapses backwards.

           Jo grabs Jessica from her high-seat, runs straight out the 
           door into the rain.

           Jorge growls, rises to his feet, chases after her.

           He reaches the door and sees A POLICE CAR pull up in front of 
           the apartment building.

           AN OFFICE on the passenger side of the car leaps out, draws 
           his gun, points it at Jorge.

                                 OFFICER
                        Don't move.

           Jorge slowly raises his hands into the air.

           EXT. POLICE STATION — NIGHT

           The rain has slowed to a sprinkle. A police car pulls up to a 
           local police station. The car's lights turn off.
           INT. POLICE STATION — DAY

           Dianne, sitting next to a shaken Jo, swaddles Jessica in the 
           waiting room.

           Roger talks to a POLICE OFFICER at the counter.

           Jo signs the bottom of a piece of paper on a clipboard. She 
           hands it to an OFFICER in front of her.

                                 OFFICER
                        This will go into effect 
                        immediately. He's not allowed 
                        anywhere near you or your child.

           The Officer walks off with the papers.

                                 DIANNE
                        I'm so sorry you had to endure 
                        that. But he's gone. He's not 
                        allowed to come near you.

                                 JOANNE
                        Do you think a piece of paper will 
                        stop him?

                                 DIANNE
                        Roger is making sure you're 
                        protected. Jorge is in police 
                        custody tonight, and then... we'll 
                        see. But we will make sure you and 
                        Jessica are safe. I promise.

           Joanne unsteadily nods.

                                 JOANNE
                        Can you watch Jess tonight?

                                 DIANNE
                        Aren't you staying over?

                                 JOANNE
                        I think I'd like some time alone. 
                        Just a night. It would be a huge 
                        help, Di.

           Dianne wears a look of protest.

                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        I will be fine. Really. I just need 
                        a night to myself. Please?

                                 DIANNE
                        Of course. Whatever you need.
                                 JOANNE
                        Thanks.

           Dianne kisses her big sister on the forehead.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT — NIGHT

           Jo opens the door into her decaying apartment. The soup is 
           still on the stove. The box cutter lies open on the floor.

           She closes the door behind her and immediately COLLAPSES on 
           the run-down rug.

           She digs her fingernails into the carpet and SCREAMS. She 
           pounds the floor with her fists.

           She CRIES OUT over and over. Sobs — big, guttural wails.

           But then, her screams turn into a whimper.

           She curls her feet up near her chest, tears soaking the 
           floor.

           She lies there, a hollow shell, eyes squeezed shut, expelling 
           every emotion kept bottled up inside.

           Her eyes open and she looks across the rug. The razor 
           glimmers across the carpet.

           INT. BATHROOM — NIGHT

           Water from the bath's faucet floods the tub.

           Joanne reaches down to crank the knob off.

           Her robe drops to the floor. She steps into the water.

           Her frail, bony body submerges in the liquid. 

           Her face is hollow, her eyes vacant. She's worlds away from 
           the woman who had a brilliant idea on the train.

           We expand to see the edges of the ceramic tub — on the edge 
           rests the BOX CUTTER.

           Joanne pulls her arm from the tub, turns her wrist over in 
           her palm, fingers the blue veins glowing through pale skin.

           She picks up the blade, grips it tightly in a trembling hand.

           Her head hits the back of the ceramic tub.
           She closes her eyes.

           INT. TRAIN STATION — DAY — FLASHBACK

           Joanne steps next to a limping Thato.

           There is an awkward distance between them. Jo can't find the 
           words to follow his heartbreaking confessional.

           They stop in front of Platform 3.

           Joanne bites her lip, inhales, turns to him.

                                 JOANNE
                        Thato. How did you survive?

           Thato looks at her with utter earnestness.

                                 THATO
                        I chose to live.

                                 JOANNE
                        What do you mean? You were shot, 
                        lost in the woods...

                                 THATO
                        I decided to survive.

                                 JOANNE
                        I don't understand.

                                 THATO
                        To live is a choice. I chose to see 
                        my father again. To come here. To 
                        tell my story. There is light and 
                        darkness in each of us. I did not 
                        let the darkness win.

           This hits Jo like a bullet to the chest.

                                 JOANNE
                        Will you be OK?

                                 THATO
                        I will be good. I am free.
                             (beat)
                        Will you be OK?

           Joanne is taken aback, struck by the question.

           She stares at him, cannot find the words to answer 
           truthfully.
           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BATHROOM — NIGHT

           Joanne opens her eyes. Her hand, still gripping the box 
           cutter, retracts the blade.

           She sets it on the edge of the tub and lifts herself from the 
           water.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, BEDROOM — NIGHT

           Wrapped in her robe, she heads for the closet.

           The rain has picked up again. Thunder GROWLS outside. 

           She digs through her closet until the dusty typewriter 
           emerges.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, DINING ROOM — NIGHT

           She heaves the typewriter onto the dining room table next to 
           her BOX OF WRITING SCRAPS and a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL— credit 
           card bills, heating bills, second and third notices — and a 
           letter addressed to Joanne in childish font.  

           A Portuguese stamp sticks out of the corner. Joanne grabs it. 
           Turns it over, hurriedly rips it open. But she unfolds it 
           with caution.

           “Miss Joanne. I’ve decided that you are right. I won’t focus 
           on the things I can’t change. It does not do to dwell on 
           dreams and forget to live. Love, Harriet” 

           Jo swallows. 

           She sits in front of her typewriter facing the window. Rain 
           beats down on the glass.

           She opens the lid to her box and peers inside—

           Scribbled on napkins, candy wrappers, a BARF BAG with the 
           names of the Hogwarts houses, the band flyer... everything 
           that would collectively become Harry Potter. 

           And, of course, the toilet paper roll from the train car. She 
           picks it up, and we finally see what it says. It reads, 
           simply: “You’re a wizard, Harry.”

           Jo picks up the letter from Harriet and places it INSIDE THE 
           BOX.
           RAIN assails the window harder.

           She turns to the typewriter, admires the piece of ancient 
           machinery. She luxuriates over each and every key.

           She winds the ribbon, threads a piece of paper into the 
           carriage.

           A deep breath, and she sets her hands onto the keys.

           She types: "Chapter One".

           MONTAGE — VARIOUS — FLASH FORWARDS TO REAL LIFE EVENTS 

           EXT. MAIL BOX — DAY — Joanne unlocks her mailbox with a key, 
           pulls out a letter from CHRISTOPHER LITTLE AGENCY. She yanks 
           it open, eyes huge, a massive grin envelops her face.

           INT. HOUSE — DAY — Joanne holds Jessica's hand, now a 
           TODDLER, as they walk into their new home. Modern, stylish, 
           warm. Movers haul boxes of books into the living room.

           Joanne kneels, points down the hall. Jessica lights up, runs 
           to find her room.

           INT. PICKLED PEPPER BOOK STORE — DAY — Joanne sits in a chair 
           in front of a CROWD OF CHILDREN gathered on the floor of the 
           familiar book store.

           She reads a passage from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's 
           Stone. Jessica is in the front row, beaming up at her mom.

           INT. PICKLED PEPPER BOOK STORE — DAY — Jo signs a copy of 
           Harry Potter, not as Jo, but as "JK ROWLING" in cursive 
           scrawl. She hands the book to a little boy.

           INT. CHAPEL — DAY — Joanne's hands clutch those of NEIL 
           MURRAY, a man with kind eyes and a warm smile.

           They are standing in a church — getting married. Dianne, 
           Roger, Peter, Anie, and Jill are all in attendance.

           INT. HOSPITAL — DAY — Joanne lies in a hospital bed clutching 
           a BABY BOY, DAVID, with 10-year-old Jessica and Neil on 
           either side of her.

           INT. FILM SET — DAY — Joanne steps onto the film set of Harry 
           Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

           She walks through Diagon Alley, which has sprung to vivid 
           life in front of her, as boom mics and craned cameras pass 
           overhead.
           EXT. RED CARPET — DAY — Joanne's high-heeled foot steps out 
           of a limousine onto a red carpet.

           Paparazzi cameras flash incessantly. She pulls a silk shall 
           around her shoulders, walks next to hoards of screaming fans 
           pushed up against a metal railing.

           A LITTLE GIRL, with a scar covering half of her face, falls 
           in the chaos, is nearly trampled by screaming fans.

           Joanne stops in front of her, extends her hand forward, and 
           pulls the child back to her feet. She pulls the shall from 
           her shoulders and hands it to the child.

           Joanne continues down the carpet. The paparazzi cameras flash 
           faster, brighter.

           They catch in Jo's eyes, reflecting like fireworks, exploding 
           one after another in her ice blue pupils.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. JOANNE'S FLAT, LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

           MATCH CUT TO: Joanne's eyes, dark and hollow, unaware of the 
           real life magic yet to come.

           The rain and thunder continue to HOWL. It builds, 
           intensifies, shakes the glass of the window.

           She takes a deep breath.

           Then Jo, alone and penniless, rests her wet fingers on the 
           keys.

           A BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes outside, lighting up her worn-out 
           features, igniting her golden hair like a halo.

           She holds steady, poised and deliberate.

           Then, she types—

           "The boy who lived."

                                                      FADE OUT:

                                 THE END.
