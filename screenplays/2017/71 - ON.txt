           INT. GRAMERCY TAVERN - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           In some upscale Flatiron restaurant, a host of HYPER-
           COMPATIBLE COUPLES (20s-60s) eat the same FOOD, wear the same 
           BRANDS, employ the same HAND GESTURES.

           It’s like a page out of NOAH’S ARK:

           A) Two BESPECTACLED NEUROTICS chatter fervently as they 
           remove PINE NUTS from their SALADS one-by-one...

                                 MARCH (O.S.)
                        Of course, I’ve never really cared 
                        about finding a perfect match.

           B) Two WALL STREET GAYS take equal bites from their CLUB 
           SANDWICHES, equal SIPS from their ARNOLD PALMERS... 

                                 MARCH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I mean -- yes, matching pairs are 
                        ideal...

           C) Two SHAMELESS PATRONS BELLY-LAUGH as they scoop marinara 
           sauce up with their INDEX FINGERS...

                                 MARCH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...but I think people who get hung 
                        up on that kind of thing have a 
                        little too much time on their 
                        hands.

           AT A NEARBY TWO-TOP

           We find MARCH BERGER dining with her fiancé, RED CORBY (late 
           20s). They’re both dressed in conservative EARTH TONES, eat 
           STEAK AND POTATOES. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        ...So, naturally, it’s not until we 
                        get to my boss’ apartment and she 
                        asks us to take off our shoes that 
                        I even realize I’m wearing two 
                        different socks -- let alone that 
                        one’s a beige ankle and the other’s 
                        a burgundy tube.
                             (beat)
                        In my defense: Shouldn’t the owners 
                        of shoeless households give some 
                        kind of advanced warning? 

           March waits on a laugh that doesn’t come. Looks up to catch 
           Red staring quizzically at her PLATE.
                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        ...Red? 

                                 RED
                        You haven’t touched it.

                                 MARCH
                        What?

                                 RED
                        The steak. You haven’t eaten any.

                                 MARCH
                        Sure I have. 

                                 RED
                        First you cut it up into small 
                        pieces, and now you’re pushing the 
                        pieces around on your plate. 

                                 MARCH
                        That’s ridiculous.

                                 RED
                             (pointing)
                        That triangular piece was over by 
                        the potatoes. Now it’s next to your 
                        peas. 

           March averts her gaze. Knows this is bad.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        ...You don’t really like 
                        tenderloin, do you, March?

           Her SILENCE affirms.

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        What are we doing?  

                                 MARCH
                        What do you mean? 

                                 RED
                        You and me. This. What are we doing 
                        getting married?

                                 MARCH 
                        You want to break up over one 
                        disparate preference? 
                                 RED
                        It’s not one disparate preference. 
                        It’s a mountain of disparate 
                        preferences. 
                             (for instance)
                        You use fragrance-free detergent. I 
                        like my clothes to smell like rain. 

                                 MARCH
                        I like my clothes to smell like 
                        rain, too. I just have sensitive 
                        skin. 

                                 RED
                        What about the music videos?

                                 MARCH
                        We hate music videos. We think 
                        they’re indulgent and trite.

                                 RED
                        I think they’re indulgent and 
                        trite. You love them. You watch 
                        them in the middle of the night 
                        while I’m asleep. 
                             (what’s more)
                        I don’t like using chopsticks when 
                        we eat Chinese food.

                                 MARCH
                        You agreed that chopsticks are a 
                        part of the cultural experience. 

                                 RED
                        I lied. 

                                 MARCH
                        Why?

                                 RED
                        The same reason you lied about 
                        liking Scrabble.  

                                 MARCH
                        We play Scrabble all the time. 

                                 RED
                        And you hate every minute of it, 
                        don’t you?

           She considers lying, then:
                                 MARCH
                        -- It’s a game of chance posing as 
                        a game of strategy. What’s “A-E”? 
                        That’s not a word. There are no 
                        consonants. It’s barely a sound. 

           Red FLUSHES, incredulous. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        So, fine, then. We disagree on a 
                        couple of things. Those are blips. 
                        Those are outliers. They hardly 
                        amount to a foundational mismatch.

           Just then, a WAITER appears with a PEPPER GRINDER. 

                            RED
                                                     MARCH (CONT'D)
                                                (to WAITER)
                 (to WAITER)
           No, thank you.  
                                              -- Please. 

           Red SIGHS. Insult to injury. 

                                 RED
                        Look, March. I’ve seen my fair 
                        share of traditionalist marriages.  
                        There’s a reason they’ve fallen out 
                        of favor. Affection is fleeting. 
                        Day-to-day preferences are forever. 
                        We can pretend all we want, but 
                        sooner or later, compromise breeds 
                        friction, and friction breeds 
                        resentment. It’s common sense.

           March finds his gaze. She’s TEARING UP. 

                                 MARCH
                        I want to spend the rest of my life 
                        with you, Red. So what if it 
                        doesn’t make sense? I love you. 
                        Isn’t that enough? 

           OFF Red’s conflicted glance, we 

                                                              SMASH TO:

                                CARD: “THREE MONTHS LATER”

           EXT. VARIOUS - NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

           AS CREDITS ROLL, we’re passed off to a string of TRAVELERS on 
           their way to work. Throughout this sequence, a host of clues 
           give us the sense that this particular Manhattan is a side- 
           step from our own, or perhaps in the very near FUTURE: 
           A) A YOUNG MAN traverses a crowded block, but there’s not a 
           SHUFFLE in sight... foot traffic is synchronized, and it 
           seems EVERYBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THEY’RE GOING. 

           B) A TEENAGER descends the stairs to the subway, approaches 
           the car in perfect time with its opening DOORS...

           C) An EXEC TYPE passes a STREET VENDOR, takes a pre-poured 
           COFFEE from Vendor’s hands WITHOUT STOPPING...

           This future Manhattan is less about GADGETS and more about 
           efficient SYSTEMS -- it’s as if everyone on the island is 
           operating in METHODICAL HARMONY. 

           EXT. THE-POINT-IS HEADQUARTERS - NYC - MORNING 

           Our last traveler is an INTERN (20) who arrives outside of a 
           ritzy glass tower. 

           INT. LOBBY, THE-POINT-IS HQ - CONTINUOUS

           Intern enters a blinding white lobby, where a fluorescent 
           emblem over the reception desk reads “ThePointIs Publishing.” 

           As he passes toward an elevator bank, we spot a collection of 
           FAMOUS PASSAGES overlaid on the wall: Shakespeare’s “All the 
           world’s a stage” quote, Newton’s second law, the American 
           Constitution...

           Each overlaid quotation is partially STRUCK THROUGH with 
           SLEEK RED LINES, seeming to insinuate that here, these famous 
           texts are “edited.” 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY

           March walks on a TREADMILL DESK, recites a tedious pitch from 
           a stack of NOTE CARDS. 

                                 MARCH
                        ...If chosen to lead, I would 
                        strive for an edit that favors the 
                        central -- and might I add the 
                        tumultuous -- relationship between 
                        Nick and Jay. By focusing on their 
                        sections in particular, we would be 
                        able to enter the story later, and 
                        futhermore -- 

           March DROPS A CARD, which gets caught on the moving belt. 
           A JUMP WIDE REVEALS

           This is, in fact, a conference room exclusively furnished 
           with TREADMILL DESKS. Eight-or-so EMPLOYEES face one another 
           as they stride dutifully in place. 

           On the WALLS, framed POSTERS spotlight abridged projects of 
           the past. Most prominently: Hamlet, A Tragedy in 20 Pages.

           March struggles to dismount, collect her notes, re-mount. 
           March’s boss, HOPE TRACER (50s, power suit) sips a macchiato, 
           unimpressed.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. Ah, anyway -- or, 
                        rather, furthermore, there’s a 
                        wonderful metaphor to be examined 
                        here vis-a-vis each man’s 
                        relationship to his insatiable 
                        yearning. For instance -- 

                                 HOPE
                        -- I think we’ve heard enough, 
                        March. 

                                 MARCH
                        If I could just -- 

                                 HOPE (O/L)
                        Do we have any other pitches? 

                                 CARBON (O.S.)
                        I say we strike him altogether. 

           NEW ANGLE REVEALS CARBON TRULY (30s)

           Striding briskly on a nearby desk. Carbon’s the walking 
           emblem of her hyper-efficient world: curt, tailored and 
           CONFIDENT -- with the emotional complexity of a No. 2 pencil.

                                 CARBON (CONT’D)
                        What’s left is the story of a young 
                        bond salesman who moves to New York 
                        and starts a relationship with a 
                        golfer. He drinks too much, and the 
                        romance falls apart. 

                                 HOPE
                             (chewing this)
                        A cautionary tale. 

                                 CARBON
                        That’s right. 
           Another employee, QUID CHALK (male, 30s, bridge-and-tunnel), 
           riffs on the concept. 

                                 QUID
                        The dangers of addiction. The 
                        disillusionment of addiction. 

                                 HOPE
                        Disillusionment. That’s good. 

                                 CARBON
                        We could keep his cousin’s husband, 
                        I think. They eat lunch together 
                        once or twice. 

                                 HOPE
                        On the golf course? 

           A female editor, BLUSH MEEKS (20s) chimes in. She’s 
           optimistic, somewhat OBLIVIOUS. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Maybe they talk about his drinking 
                        habit. 

                                 MARCH
                        -- What about the title? 

                                 HOPE
                        What about it? 

                                 MARCH
                        Well, I just think -- I mean that 
                        I’d assume -- they’re going to 
                        expect someone named Gatsby to 
                        appear at some point in the 
                        story... right? 

           March’s colleagues return blank stares. For a moment, only 
           the delicate squeak of loafers on rubber. 

                                 HOPE
                             (to CARBON)
                        It’s a great angle. I’ll have the 
                        team start culling next week. 

           A perfunctory smile from Carbon -- not the first project 
           she’s landed. 

           March stifles her disappointment. Squares her index cards.
           INT. MIDTOWN BAR - EVENING 

           March, Carbon, and Blush share a high-top at bougie happy 
           hour spot. 

                                 BLUSH
                        You each fill out a digital 
                        lifestyle survey. It’s mostly 
                        standard stuff: your preferred 
                        bedtime, your desired thermostat 
                        temperature. It’s called Snap 
                        Coding. It’s becoming very popular 
                        in Europe. 

                                 CARBON
                        How many questions are there? 

                                 BLUSH
                        About seven thousand, give-or-take. 
                        The more you answer, the more 
                        accurate your score. 
                             (gushing)
                        Mole and I are 92.7% compatible. 

           Carbon finishes her cocktail. No sooner does she set down her 
           empty glass than a PASSING WAITER exchanges it for a refill. 

                                 BLUSH (CONT’D)
                        Are you dating at all, March? 

                                 MARCH
                        Not yet. Soon. Just, you know. A 
                        lot on my plate. 

                                 CARBON
                        Have you gotten a Toy? 

                                 MARCH
                        Red and I were always more 
                        traditional with sex.

                        The newest generation is totally 
                        customizable. I taught mine to sync 
                        my orgasm with my morning coffee. 
                        Another one fucks me to sleep every 
                        night at 11:15. 

                                 BLUSH
                        You have two? 

           Carbon -- FOUR fingers.
                                 CARBON
                        The whole thing is incredibly 
                        efficient. I haven’t dated in 
                        months, and my sex life has never 
                        been better. Plus, with all the 
                        time I’ve saved on men, I’ve gained 
                        an extra thirteen minutes in my 
                        biweekly pilates sessions. 
                             (to BLUSH)

                                 BLUSH
                        Very taut. 

           Just then, a BELL CHIMES pleasantly overhead and, as if CUED, 
           the women collect their purses and jackets. 

                                 CARBON
                        So great to catch up, ladies. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Same time next week? 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m free to grab dinner, if 
                        anyone’s up for it. 

           Carbon and Blush STAND. 

                                 BLUSH
                             (”sorry”)
                        Mole and I are making dream 
                        catchers tonight. We both love 
                        crafts. And dreams. 

                                 CARBON
                        I have an orgasm scheduled for

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, alright. Well thanks again for 
                        inviting me. It’s really great to 
                        spend time together outside of -- 

                                 NEW PATRON (O/L)
                        -- Excuse me. 

           March turns to discover a NEW TRIO OF WOMEN waiting to sit. 
           All around the bar, the next “shift” of patrons have taken 
           over the tables. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, I’m sorry. 
           March stands, steps to the side. When she turns back around, 
           Carbon and Blush are GONE. 

           EXT. MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NEW YORK CITY - EVENING

           March arrives home to her Upper East Side brownstone, 
           approaches her stoop just as a passing MAILMAN hands off a 
           stack of envelopes. 

                                 MARCH
                             (to MAILMAN)
                        So much for the rain, right? 

           But he’s ALREADY GONE.

           INT. KITCHEN, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           March sits at the head of the dining table with a copy of 
           Little Women. Eats the world’s crunchiest salad in the 
           world’s quietest room. 

           March is dwarfed by the large, BARREN space. The room reads 
           like a parody of minimalist decor -- backless chairs, lamps 
           hanging from piano wire, a glass-blown bookshelf with a 
           single ledge. 

           Chic, functionless, and impossibly STERILE. Not a wall 
           decoration in sight. 

           March balls her SWEATER, sits on it. Fucking stool. 

           LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           March channel surfs on a pillowless couch. 

           ON THE TV -- RAPID SERIES:

           A) A POLITICAL COMMENTATOR addresses an INTERVIEWER.

                        forever... 

           D) We finally lands on a holdover MUSIC VIDEO NETWORK playing 
           Olivia Newton John’s “Physical.” Baked and buff THIGHS thrust 
           and gyrate against archaic WORKOUT EQUIPMENT. 

           MARCH

           Settles on it, satisfied. Mouths along under her breath.

           BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           March lies in the tub MASTURBATING with the SHOWER HEAD. It’s 
           not quite roomy enough for her to stretch out, but she’s 
           giving it her best. 

           She slides down onto her back, knees bent... Then sits up, 
           legs straight. Splits the difference. 

           Suddenly, the water takes a SCALDING TURN.

                                 MARCH
                        AH! -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           March hangs blouses in her closet. Her entire wardrobe looks 
           like it belongs on the OREGON TRAIL. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (rehearsing)
                        Little Women is, in the most basic 
                        sense, a story of mortality. But 
                        it’s also about women’s loss of 
                        innocence. Young women’s loss of 
                        innocence.

           Suddenly, something catches her eye on the top shelf --

           She reaches up and retrieves a SCRABBLE TILE. Flips it over. 
           It’s BLANK.

           She might cry -- STEELS HERSELF instead. Trashes it. Returns 
           to the closet. 
                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Little Women... is about LITTLE 
                        women’s loss of BIG innocence. 

           MIDNIGHT

           March lies awake in bed -- the recovered TILE now perched on 
           the nightstand. 

           After a beat, she retrieves her LAPTOP from beneath the bed. 
           Opens it, inputs a search.

           ON THE SCREEN

           Is a 3-D GALLERY OF MALE SEX TOYS. They look exactly like 
           HUMANS -- albeit NUDE and HAIRLESS. A banner at the top of 
           the screen reads “LIVE TOYS CUSTOM COMPANIONSHIP,” announces 
           the arrival of the GENERATION 7 MALES.

           These “Basic Models” cover a wide spectrum of sexual 
           proclivities: all races and ages -- some handsome, others 
           dowdy -- tall, short, fat, thin, queeny, deformed, athletic. 

           As March’s cursor TOGGLES over these models, a host of hyper- 
           customizable features hover in the foreground: eye color, 
           skin color, body type, teeth shade...

                                 COOING FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)

                                                          CURIOUS GAZE:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Another day. March stands over an open box, appraises its 
           contents. Hard to tell if this is intrigue or disgust. 

                                 COOING FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        As the owner of a custom-tailored 
                        Live Toy, discreet, one-of-a-kind 
                        intimacy is only a touch away. 

           IN THE BOX

           Is the contorted figure of a NAKED MAN, packed as efficiently 
           as a tract of small intestine. His thighs lay flat to his 
           stomach, like a fetus -- or maybe like a FUTON. His features 
           are mostly obscured beneath copious PACKING PEANUTS.

                        From the moment of activation, our 
                        positive reinforcement technology

                        your pleasure cues -- and only your 
                        pleasure cues. 

           MARCH 

           Looks wary as she finally reaches down, attempts to dislodge 
           her purchase from its casing. 

                                 COOING FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        The more often you use your 
                        device... 

           She tries to slide her arms around his torso... finally 
           manages a sad grip underneath his ARMPITS. She straddles the 
           box with her feet to keep it stationary as she YANKS! -- 

                                 COOING FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        ...the more aptly it will please 
                        you. 

           The figure lifts slightly, but catches on the edge of the 
           box. A second try, but no dice. March releases, leaving him 
           slumped in a semi-upright position.

           This thing is fucking HEAVY.

           BEDROOM - LATER

           On the duvet is March’s still-to-be-activated Toy, laid out 
           in the buff for our unflinching appraisal:

           He’s the proverbial CENTAUR of female fantasies: The bearded 
           hipster who’s also seen a gym... Hair on his chest, but none 
           on the nipples... Sun-tanned skin and clean fingernails...

                                 COOING FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (from PHONE)
                        March Berger: Your Toy, UNNAMED, 
                        has now been activated. Would you 
                        like to assign a name to your 
                        device? 

           ANGLE ON MARCH AT THE FOOT OF THE BED

           As she considers... then HANGS UP her automated call. 

           With equal parts fear and wonder, she clinically examines her 
           Toy’s construction: 
           A) She presses her thumb into his forearm -- surprised to see 
           the color drain from the site, just like HUMAN SKIN...

           B) She pushes the CUTICLES UP on his toenails...

           C) She quizzically squeezes his PENIS...

           D) She hesitantly puts two FINGERS in his mouth, withdraws 
           them to find their tips coated in SALIVA. From where? How? 

           Finally, she slides her hand down the base of his SCALP, 
           searches for a touch pad... 

           And HIS EYES BLINK OPEN. 

           Toy’s gaze SCANS THE ROOM for a moment, finally comes to rest 
           on MARCH’S FACE. His glance is inquisitive and unself- 
           conscious, like that of a passing TODDLER on the subway.

           With a lateral twitch, his eyes MAP the singularities of her 
           facial features. After a beat, his gaze travels down her 
           BODY... “memorizing” its arrangement and contours. 

           When he’s finished, his focus returns to March’s face. Awaits 
           instruction.

                                 MARCH 
                        Stand. 

           We watch as her Toy “PROCESSES” this command -- HIS PUPILS 
           DILATE, seeming to DOUBLE IN SIZE. 

           Once they’ve returned to their NORMAL SIZE, he pulls himself 
           up to standing. His nascent movement is stilted.

           March and her Toy stand nose-to-nose for a long beat.

           Finally, she reaches out and TOUCHES HIS FACE. His expression 
           is present, if imperceptible. 

           Then, without warning: 

                                 TOY
                        Hello, March.  

           March STARTLES -- 

           -- Instinctively POWERS HIM OFF. 

           Toy COLLAPSES ONTO THE CARPET. 

           March catches her breath. Embarrassed, in spite of herself. 
           EXT. PARK - NELSONVILLE, NEW YORK - DAY

           March’s portly nephew REGIS (11) clutches a FOOTBALL between 
           his legs, attempts a LONG SNAP that barely sputters half a

           BERGER (30s) coaches from the sidelines. 

                                 MARCH
                        That’s alright. You’re doing great. 

                                 DELL
                        Remember what your aunt March said 
                        about lining up your fingers? 

                                 REGIS
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 MARCH
                        You ready for another one?

                        Should I throw it faster?

                                 MARCH
                        Higher, bud. A little higher. 

           Regis nods. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Alright, here we go...  

           Regis assumes the position.

                        Set... HUT!

           The ball pops up LATERALLY, clips Dell’s THIGH.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (encouraging)
                        Yeah. Better. 

           LATER

           March and Dell look on from the BLEACHERS as Regis lumbers 
           through his SUICIDE SPRINTS. 
           This upstate town feels like a far cry from hyper-efficient 
           Manhattan -- neighbors stop to chat on the sidewalk, a crowd 
           idles outside of a cafe... there’s an air of community and 
           aimlessness that feels much more FAMILIAR to us.

                                 DELL 
                        It’s the only thing he enjoys 
                        outside of his VR headset. If he 
                        doesn’t make the team, I don’t 
                        think I’ll see his eyebrows again. 

                                 MARCH
                        Have you heard of the Snap Code?

                                 DELL
                        If it’s not a Birkenstock or a dry 
                        rub, you can assume it hasn’t 
                        reached Nelsonville yet.

                                 MARCH
                        It’s a new dating algorithm. 

                                 DELL
                        You know people got together before 
                        the ‘compatibility’ revolution, 
                        right?

                                 MARCH
                        Sure. And half of them got 
                        divorced. 

                                 DELL
                        Is this about Red?

                                 MARCH
                        No.

           Dell -- are you sure. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe he was right. Maybe we were 
                        doomed by our practical 
                        differences. 

                                 DELL
                        Or maybe he’s just an asshole. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m serious.

                                 DELL
                        So am I.
                                 MARCH
                        Looking back on it now, I can think 
                        of a million things I conceded to 
                        him. My friends, my career, my 
                        furniture... maybe it was only a 
                        matter of time before I resented 
                        him for it.  

                                 DELL
                        Or maybe you would’ve resented him 
                        anyway. 

                                 MARCH
                        You’re just a contrarian. 

                                 DELL
                        Do you really want to date 
                        yourself?

                                 MARCH
                        No. 
                             (on second thought)
                        I don’t know. I just think maybe 
                        next time around, I should approach 
                        things more practically.  

                                 DELL
                        Love doesn’t work that way. There’s 
                        no such thing as a sure bet.

                                 MARCH
                        But what if there was?

                                 DELL
                        Then maybe I wouldn’t be raising 
                        Dan Marino on my own.

           INT. ‘THE STRAND’ BOOKSTORE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           March peruses a bookshelf, stops at a spine: The Final Comet. 
           On the “About the Author” jacket, she finds a YOUNGER PHOTO 
           OF HERSELF. She looks BRIGHT-EYED. Optimistic. 

           March shuts the book. Shelves it.
           WIDE REVEALS

           She’s in the BACK CORNER of the store’s dingy BASEMENT, where 
           “Long-Form Literature” has come to die. Besides March, only a 
           handful of GERIATRICS linger. 

           UPSTAIRS - MINUTES LATER

           March emerges onto the bustling main floor, where full-length 
           novels have been replaced with “lit-lite.” Books are now as 
           thin as Playbills, organized by PAGE COUNT. 

           She approaches the ‘FEATURED READS’ table at the front of the 
           store, finds an abridged Romeo and Juliet, edited by Carbon. 

           INSIDE THE BOOK

           An entire scene reads as: 

                ROMEO: But, soft! What light through yonder window    
                       breaks? It is Juliet. 
                JULIET: Deny thy father and refuse thy name. 
                ROMEO: Henceforth I am not Romeo. 

           She replaces the book, notes an EMPTY PEDESTAL at the center 
           of the table. She gazes at it longingly...

           Until an EMPLOYEE sets out a new title: 60 Seconds to Sober.

           INT. BEDROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           March approaches her closet in a NIGHTIE. She pulls open the 
           double doors, finds her Toy deactivated -- and, as always, 
           NAKED -- in his wrought iron stand. 

           After a moment, she reaches for the TOUCH PAD at the base of 
           his scalp... his eyes FLUTTER OPEN, land on her face. 

                                 MARCH
                        Come down. 

           Toy PROCESSES, steps out onto the carpet. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Your name is David John.

           David John processes... NODS. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        I’d like you to kiss me.
           David John steps forward, takes her face in his hands, pulls 
           her lips into a soft KISS. The gesture is notably SMOOTHER 
           than their last session -- his physical development has 
           picked up where it left off. 

           After a beat, March moves toward the end of the bed. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        I want you to take my clothes off. 
                        Slowly, like this. 

           David John watches as March pulls a strap from her negligee. 
           Lets it drop. 

           He steps forward, gently releases the other strap. 

           March’s slip FALLS TO THE GROUND. 

           Next, she steps forward... TAKES HIM into her HAND. His gaze 
           remains impartial as she begins to STIMULATE HIM. The 
           exchange is STERILE, emotionless. Bizarre. 

           Once he’s reached a desirable “setting,” March pulls away. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Now, lie down on your back. 

           David John processes, lies back onto the bed. 

           Moments later, March slips her panties off, 

           Climbs onto the duvet beside him. 

           With a transition both abrupt and clinical, March pulls 
           herself on top of him,

           Straddles his torso,

           And, finally, GUIDES HIM INSIDE OF HERSELF. 

           She grips the top of her HEADBOARD as she rolls her hips 
           forward, plants his hands on her backside. 

           March’s eyes flutter as her head lolls backward in pleasure. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        God... 

           A soft moan. She bites her lip.

           WE STAY ON MARCH 

           As the action proceeds. She gradually loses herself to her 
           passion. Her breath quickens, and before long...
           ...she succumbs to a POWERFUL ORGASM.

           THE NEXT MORNING

           March’s eyes squint open in the early morning sunlight. 

           She smiles, warmed by thoughts of last night. But moments 
           later, she’s struck by a THOUGHT -- 

           -- Looks down to discover an ARM WRAPPED AROUND HER TORSO. 

           WIDE REVEALS

           David John’s still lying beside her, his gaze locked placidly 
           on the back of her head. She fell asleep in his arms.

           Disconcerted, March slips from his embrace, 

           Powers him OFF. 

           INT. HALLWAY, THE-POINT-IS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           March approaches Hope’s office, KNOCKS. 

                                 HOPE (O.S.)
                             (calling)
                        Yes. 

           INSIDE

           She finds Hope on her TREADMILL DESK talking into an 
           EARPIECE. 

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)

                        is fine. -- Flowers at the front, 
                        one violin. Arrange the rest at 
                        your discretion -- who cares what 
                        her hair looks like? It’s a closed 
                        casket. Uh-huh. Bye-bye. 

           In the absence of any CHAIRS, March is forced to stand in the 
           center of the CARPET in front of Hope’s desk.

                        March. I read your Jane Eyre pages,

                        landscape description. Drowning, 
                        March. I’m thirty thousand leagues

                        Twenty. 

                                 HOPE
                        Huh? 

                                 MARCH
                        I pulled a page and a half at 
                        Lowood, but the section about the 
                        frosted forest is -- one could 
                        argue that it’s an integral 
                        metaphor for Jane’s isolation. 

                                 HOPE
                        You’re eleven pages over par. Our 
                        educators are paying for digestible 
                        literature, not musings on the 
                        weather. Anyone who’s been outside 
                        can imagine a tree. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m just trying to preserve the 
                        author’s original intention. 

                                 HOPE
                        And that’s exactly why you’re still 
                        a secondary. Look at Carbon. You 
                        joined the same year and she’s got 
                        sixteen above-the-title credits. 
                        Even Quid’s taken projects, and he 
                        has the leadership skills of a wet 
                        noodle. 
                             (in sum)
                        I’m giving you until the end of the 
                        quarter to prove me wrong. 
                        Efficiency isn’t just our mantra, 
                        March. It’s our brand. If you’re 
                        not an asset, then you’re dead 
                        weight. 

           March ingests this, offers a bleak nod. 

           INT. MARCH’S OFFICE, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY

           March climbs onto her own personal treadmill desk, which 
           automatically begins to MOVE.

           ON MARCH’S TABLET

           A digital copy of Jane Eyre springs to life. She scrolls 
           through the document, 90% of which has been STRUCK THROUGH 
           with RED LINES.
           Moments later, Carbon pops her head in.

                        Coffee next week? 

           Without waiting for an answer, she’s OFF.

           March passes the basketball courts on West 4th street -- in 
           lieu of a pick-up game, teenagers wander the cage in VR 
           HELMETS. One collides with the FENCE. 

           March dials a number on her cell:

                                 MARCH 
                             (into PHONE)
                        Polly? This is March. I just wanted 
                        to see if maybe you were around 
                        tomorrow and wanted to -- 
                             (beat)
                        -- March Berger. 
                             (beat)
                        No, we did. We did break up. But I 
                        figured, you know, just because I’m 
                        not with Red anymore doesn’t mean 
                        we can’t still be friends, right? 
                             (beat)
                        Oh. I see. Well, when you put it 
                        that way...  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           March sits on her balled-up sweater on her shitty, saucer- 
           sized STOOL. She’s eating SALMON. It’s IMPOSSIBLY QUIET.
           After a long beat, she clears her throat. 

                                 MARCH
                        My ex didn’t like fish. I love 
                        salmon. So... now I get to eat it 
                        all the time. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s a superfood, you know. The 
                        amino acids repair damage to your 
                        cardiovascular tissue, and the 
                        Omega-3 Fatty Acids lower your 
                        cholesterol. 

           REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS

           On the other side of the table, David John sits activated in 
           a seat... STILL NUDE. He watches attentively as March eats.

           A lengthy beat of silence. March tables her fork. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        I’d like it if you would say 
                        something to me. The tutorial said 
                        you could speak. 

           David John PROCESSES a moment, his pupils dilating. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        “Custom speech.” Does that mean 
                        anything to you? I paid more for 
                        “custom speech.” 
                             (OFF silence)
                        ...because I’m a sucker. 

           She starts collecting her dishes -- this was a stupid idea. 

           Then, suddenly: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Salmon is good for your heart. 

           Mark looks up, stunned. 

                                 MARCH
                        What did you say? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        The fatty acids in salmon are good 
                        for your heart. 

                                 MARCH
                             (pleased)
                        That’s right. 
           March smiles. David John PROCESSES... smiles back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           March stands in the living room, reads from a stack of NOTE 
           CARDS. David John sits on the couch at full attention. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Ah, so. The Sun Also Rises is, in 
                        the most basic sense, a love story 
                        between Jake Barnes and Lady Brett 
                        Ashley... but it also explores the 
                        devolution of Jake’s masculinity 
                        against the backdrop of World War 
                        I, and also the changing sexual 
                        landscape of the 1920s. 
                             (revising)
                        -- The newfound sexual freedom of 
                        the 1920s. 
                             (not quite)
                        -- The 1920s’ newfound sexual 
                        ideals. 

           March edits her notes. As she does, David John PROCESSES her 
           text, regurgitates a condensed version: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        It’s a book about sex. 

                                 MARCH
                        Not exactly, no. I mean -- yes, in 
                        a way, but only insofar as sex 
                        relates to Jake’s masculinity. He’s 
                        impotent, and his impotence serves 
                        a larger theme of what it means to 
                        be a man. This then serves an even 
                        broader argument about the personal 
                        repercussions of World War I on its 
                        soldiers, and I’d say an even 
                        greater statement about strength. 
                        And, you know, by turn... weakness. 

           A beat, then: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        It’s a book about impotence. 

                                 MARCH
                             (deflating)
                        This is it. I lost my fiancé, and 
                        now I’m going to lose my job. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCH (CONT'D)
                        Pretty soon, I’ll have to move back 
                        to Dayton and sell corn out of my 
                        parents’ Winnebago. 
                             (beat)
                        It isn’t fair. Carbon only lands 
                        these projects because she’s self- 
                        assured in her ignorance. Because 
                        she wills people to believe that 
                        she knows what she’s talking about. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Ignorant people are successful. 

                                 MARCH
                        So that’s it, then -- “custom 
                        speech” just means you repeat 
                        whatever I say? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        If you’re the most confident 
                        person, you’re the most successful 
                        person. 

                                 MARCH
                             (agitated)
                        It’s not that simple. That’s a 
                        reductive take on the situation. 
                        There are lots of -- there are 
                        plenty of other reasons why things 
                        haven’t worked out for me. There 
                        are many factors at play that I 
                        haven’t told you about. 

           BEDROOM - LATER

           David John climbs into his CLOSET STAND. March reaches behind 
           his neck and POWERS HIM OFF. 

           IN BED - MINUTES LATER

           March lies awake, stares at the ceiling. Is it that simple? 

           INT. ELEVATOR/LOBBY, THE-POINT-IS HQ - MORNING 

           March boards the elevator with her nose in a copy of The Sun 
           Also Rises. She mumbles “key words” to herself, looks like 
           she hasn’t slept. 

           Moments later, a beaming Blush enters behind her. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Good morning, March. 
                                 MARCH
                        Hi, Blush. 

           The car begins to RISE. Blush notes the cards, keeps quiet... 
           until, abruptly: 

                                 BLUSH
                        -- I’M GETTING MARRIED! 

           Blush thrusts forth her ring finger, looks like she’s about 
           to SHIT HER PANTS. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, wow! That’s amazing. 
                             (hugging her)
                        Congratulations. 

                                 BLUSH
                        His proposal was so beautiful, 
                        March. 

                                 MARCH
                        I can’t wait to hear all about it. 

           Blush hits the EMERGENCY STOP button, dives right in.

                                 BLUSH
                        It all started around 8:15. Mole 
                        and I were eating lemon merengue 
                        pie -- citrus fruits are a Level 1 
                        Shared Preference of ours -- and 
                        when we were finished, he told me 
                        that he had to go inside to use the 
                        bathroom -- but he didn’t really 
                        have to use the bathroom... 

           March eyes her watch, antsy. Smiles politely. 

                                 MARCH
                        That’s wild. I think we should 
                        probably get to the office, though, 
                        before the meeting starts. 

           Blush looks momentarily stung, then:

                                 BLUSH
                             (realizing)
                        Oh my God. I’m so sorry, March. 
                        Here I am rambling on about my 
                        engagement, when you were dumped by 
                        your fiancé after eight years.

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, no -- that wasn’t -- 
                                 BLUSH
                        -- No, you were. You absolutely 
                        were. HR told me all about it on my 
                        first day. 

                                 MARCH
                        What? 

                                 BLUSH
                        It must have been traumatizing. 
                        You’re probably thinking about it 
                        right now, aren’t you. 

                                 MARCH
                        I wasn’t. I am now. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Listen, March -- just because you 
                        were savagely rejected by the 
                        person you trusted the most doesn’t 
                        mean you don’t have value as a 
                        human being. You have value. 

                                 MARCH
                        Thanks, Blush, but it’s really -- 

                                 BLUSH
                        -- It doesn’t matter if Red didn’t 
                        see it, or Hope doesn’t see it, or 
                        the interns downstairs don’t see 
                        it... 

                                 MARCH
                        The interns talk about me? 

                                 BLUSH
                        Look at me. 
                             (taking March’s FACE in 
                              her hands)
                        I see it. 

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           March emerges from the elevator in a COLD SWEAT. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY

           The weekly meeting is in full swing -- Carbon finishes 
           delivering a vibrant pitch.
                                 CARBON
                        ...the remaining edit leaves us 
                        with Jake Barnes: a man whose 
                        drinking problem ruins his vacation 
                        to Madrid. 

                                 HOPE
                        Biting stuff, Carbon. Very 
                        universal themes at play here. 
                             (then)
                        Is that all for Sun Also Rises? 

                                 MARCH
                        I have a proposal. 

                                 HOPE
                             (dubious)
                        Let’s hear it. 

           ON MARCH’S TREADMILL DESK

           Is the stack of NOTE CARDS, several PHOTO REFERENCES, the 
           NOVEL. She clears her throat, wipes her palms on her skirt, 
           begins reading off of her notes: 

                                 MARCH
                        The Sun Also Rises explores the 
                        devolution of Jake Barnes’ 
                        masculinity against the backdrop of 
                        World War I... 

           March hesitates, looks up from her cards. She’s losing them, 
           like always. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (going off script)
                        Impotence. The Sun Also Rises is 
                        the story of an impotent man. He 
                        wants to have sex, but his penis 
                        doesn’t work, and so... most other 
                        things in his life don’t work, 
                        either. 

           Hope considers this for a beat, then: 

                                 HOPE
                             (to MARCH)
                        Sounds fine. You’ll pick a team 
                        next week. 

                                 MARCH
                        Really? 
                                 HOPE
                             (moving on)
                        As I Lay Dying. For God’s sake, 
                        somebody tell me something good... 

           Across the room, Blush gives March a THUMBS UP. March beams, 
           tries to repress her excitement. 

           INT. KITCHEN, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Back at home, March GUSHES to David John over dinner.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She was impressed. 

                                 MARCH
                        She was definitely impressed. After 
                        the meeting she pulled me aside and 
                        said, “Nice work.” But the way she 
                        said it -- it wasn’t... 
                             (pedestrian)
                        “Nice work.” It was more like... 
                             (awestruck)
                        “Nice work.” 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She spoke in a low voice. 

                                 MARCH
                        No, what I mean is that she was 
                        genuinely pleased with the work I 
                        had done. And when it’s published, 
                        I’ll finally have a book on the top 
                        floor. It’s like my Nana used to 
                        say: “Fortune favors the bold.” 

           David John PROCESSES, then:

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re the smartest woman in your 
                        office. 

                                 MARCH
                        Well, I don’t know about that... 

           A beat, then: 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        You know what? I am the smartest 
                        woman in my office. 
                             (re: STOOL)
                        And I deserve to sit on a chair 
                        that’s as big as my ass. 
           March laughs. David John LAUGHS BACK. 

           March laughs harder. David John laughs harder. Their laughter 
           feeds each other... soon, March is laughing so hard she has 
           TEARS IN HER EYES. 

           Off their CRESCENDO, we 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - VARIOUS (MONTAGE)

           As time passes, David John is gradually integrated into 
           March’s household routines, his behaviors becoming more 
           NUANCED and COMPLEX with time. Meanwhile, March updates her 
           home, bringing the space some much-needed CHARACTER: 

           A) David John and March have sex in BED...

           B) March shows David John how to flip a cut of SALMON on the 
           stove...

           C) March and David John repaint the walls GREEN...

           D) March and David John have sex in the shower...

           E) March lies naked on the couch reciting passages from The 
           Sun Also Rises as David John rubs her FEET...

           F) David John serves March a perfectly-seared piece of 
           SALMON...

           G) March’s NECK REARS UPWARD as she ORGASMS...

           H) David John and March are further along in their painting: 
           she splatters him with her BRUSH. He deftly follows her lead, 
           and they wrestle each other to the FLOOR...

           I) March and David John reposition March’s PLUSHY NEW SOFA in 
           the living room, which is now fully-painted...

           J) March flops onto her back beside David John, post-coitus. 
           Satisfied.

                                                          END MONTAGE. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           David John sits on the couch watching Fatboy Slim’s “Weapon 
           of Choice” video. Christopher Walken spins in his BAGGAGE 
           CART. 
                                 MARCH (O.S.)
                        After his trip to the Sri Lankan 
                        temples, he got hooked on this new-
                        aged, pseudo-minimalist kick. Of 
                        course, he had no qualms about 
                        hanging on to his parents’ 
                        brownstone...

           We may notice that David John’s physical behavior has become 
           much more HUMAN-LIKE, and his “processing” of external 
           stimuli is significantly FASTER.

                                 MARCH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (from BEDROOM)
                        The funny thing is, I used to love 
                        clothes. I was actually voted “Miss 
                        Avante-Garde Ohio” at my sophomore 
                        hoedown.

           Through the bedroom door, we see March appraising herself in 
           a new, trendy CUT-OUT DRESS -- tag still attached. It’s the 
           first thing we’ve seen her in that doesn’t scream 
           ‘SCHOOLMARM.’

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        But then everything changed.

                                 MARCH
                        God, it was relentless. He spoke 
                        out against anything ‘loud’: 
                        Paintings, clothes. He once called 
                        my bomber jacket a “totem of 
                        Western gratuity,” and I was so 
                        ashamed that I gave it to my dry 
                        cleaner.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        He became an oppressive person. 
                        Someone you could hardly recognize. 

                                 MARCH
                        He used to tell me I was his ‘nice 
                        girl.’ Even worse -- I used to like 
                        it.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        He manipulated you.  

                                 MARCH
                        It was like brain-washing. Like 
                        mind control. 

           She emerges from her room in the DRESS.  
                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You look just like Vivien Leigh. 

                                 MARCH
                             (correcting)
                        Elizabeth Taylor. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You look just like Elizabeth 
                        Taylor. 

                                 MARCH
                        Anyway, I think my sister was 
                        right. I should look at this whole 
                        thing as a gift. An opportunity for 
                        self-discovery. 
                             (then)
                        Starting with cut-outs. 

           She tears the TAG from her dress. 

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           March sets a POTTED ORCHID in the center of the dinner table. 
           Fiddles with it. Steps back to appraise.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (pleased)
                        I have a plant. 

           When she turns back toward the foyer, she nearly trips over a 
           BOX labeled “RED’S STUFF.” On top, the SCRABBLE BOARD.

           She sighs. It’s time. 

           She picks up the PHONE and dials.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (PHONE)
                             (laughing)
                        Hello? 

           March bristles -- who are you?

                                 MARCH (INTO PHONE)
                        Is Red there? 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Red’s hands are covered in cheese 
                        right now. Can I help you? 
                                 RED (O.S.)
                             (from BACKGROUND)
                        Is it that Cincinnati number again? 
                        Tell them I’m dead. 

           Indiscernible clattering, laughter. Woman SQUEALS, giggles.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                             (to RED)
                        Quit it! 
                             (to MARCH)
                        Omigod. He’s such a butthead 
                        sometimes. 
                             (to RED)
                        Yes you are a butthead!
                             (to MARCH)
                        Sorry -- who is this?

           March stands there for a second, deflated. 

           ...HANGS UP. 

           INT. ST. MARK’S DIVE BAR - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           March sits at a hole-in-the-wall drinking Bourbon by herself. 
           She FINISHES HER GLASS, and a WAITER appears from behind with 
           a REFILL.

           She DOWNS it in one gulp -- ANOTHER WAITER comes out of the 
           woodwork with a THIRD.

           Moments later, a trail of CIGARETTE SMOKE wafts in from an 
           open window. 

           March COUGHS, looks outside for the source -- pissed. Covers 
           her mouth with her sleeve. 

           OUTSIDE THE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Fed up and now VERY TIPSY, March exits the bar, spots a guy 
           leaning against a tree, BACK TO CAMERA.

                                 MARCH
                        Hi, excuse me -- would you mind 
                        putting out your cigarette? Your 
                        smoke is wafting into the bar. 

           Beat. Smoker’s unresponsive. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I see. Thank you for that, kind 
                        sir. ‘
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Tis I who forgot that the streets 
                        of Manhattan are yours, and yours 
                        alone. But could you do me a favor 
                        when you’re finished? ...Would you 
                        mind going home, pulling out your 
                        thumb-sized penis, bending over the 
                        bathtub and -- 

                      MARCH (CONT’D)
           -- fucking yourself? 
                                                         SMOKER
                                              Sorry, did you say something? 

           Smoker turns, pulls out his EARBUDS. 

           Welp. This is embarrassing. 

           To make matters worse...

                                 SMOKER (CONT’D)
                        ...March Berger? 

                                 MARCH
                        Goz? 

           ...They RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER. This is GOZ PEERMAN (late 20s). 
           Handsome in an unassuming way. Probably owns more records 
           than shoes. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        You’re taller than you were in high 
                        school. 

                                 GOZ
                        That’ll happen sometimes. 

                                 MARCH
                        Do you live in the city? 

           Goz points to a BEDROOM WINDOW across the street. 

                                 GOZ
                        You? 

                                 MARCH
                        Uptown. 

           A beat, then: 

                                 GOZ
                        Sorry -- did you just tell me to 
                        fuck myself? 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, no -- that was just -- I 
                        thought you were somebody else.

                        Somebody -- you know. Shitty. 

           Goz smiles. Endeared to her. 

           INSIDE THE BAR - LATER 

           March and Goz are getting SAUCED -- whiskey for her, gin for 
           him. A palpable spark as they razz one another. 

                                 MARCH
                        ...Other than that, you were 
                        perfectly likable. 

                                 GOZ
                        Your friends. Another steep 
                        detraction. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh, so we’re not finished? 

                                 GOZ
                        What was her name? The one who 
                        always insisted we perform a “sun 
                        salutation” before homeroom.

                        Vine Phillips. She became a 
                        congresswoman. 

                                 GOZ
                        Vine Phillips. 

                                 MARCH
                        Your skateboard. 

                                 GOZ
                        What was wrong with my skateboard? 

                                 MARCH
                        You always carried it under your 
                        arm. It was very passé. Frankly, 
                        I’m not sure I ever saw you ride 
                        the thing. 

                                 GOZ
                        You were constantly apologizing. 
                        You apologized every time you 
                        raised your hand in class. “I’m 
                        sorry -- I just have a question.” 
                        Drove me nuts. 
                                 MARCH
                        You ruined my 15th birthday. 

           Goz mimes a gunshot to the chest. 

                                 GOZ
                        I ruined your birthday? 

                                 MARCH
                        I took Vine and a few other girls 
                        to the Summer Solstice Festival. 
                        You and Moorehouse were there -- 
                        skateboards in tow -- and you threw 
                        up Four Loko all over our picnic 
                        blanket. 

                                 GOZ
                        Oh, God. That was you? 

                                 MARCH
                        We had to toss the entire 
                        charcuterie plate. 

                                 GOZ
                        Jesus. I’m really sorry. Honestly. 
                             (beat)
                        You know what? I think there’s only 
                        one way to make this up to you. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           March and Goz sit on the steps of the Washington Square 
           fountain, where a TALENTLESS MUSICIAN belts along to an 
           acoustic, nearly-unrecognizable version of “Girls Just Want 
           to Have Fun.” Beside them, a deli-assembled CHEESE SPREAD. 

                                 GOZ
                             (re: SINGER)
                        To be fair, he’s a terrific 
                        showman. 

                                 MARCH
                        Excellent posture. 

                                 GOZ
                        God, do you remember that local DJ 
                        on WSNY? What was his name?

           March hesitates, then:
                                 MARCH
                        ...David John.

                                 GOZ
                             (remembering)
                        David John. That’s right. ‘DJ D.J.’ 
                        He was the only clean signal for 
                        like twelve miles. It was always 
                        this song and...

                                 MARCH
                        The Cure. “Just Like Heaven.”

           Goz -- impressed. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (explaining)
                        I used to call into the show when 
                        my parents were asleep. I told him 
                        I was a schoolteacher named Janey, 
                        and he’d played songs for me. 
                             (beat)
                        We used to talk. Never anything 
                        special -- the weather, new sales 
                        at the corner store. In my head, he 
                        smelled like maple syrup and looked 
                        just like Chachi Arcola.

                                 GOZ
                        You must’ve been heartbroken. 

           March doesn’t follow. 

                                 GOZ (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you hear? The guy bludgeoned 
                        his wife to death with a soldering 
                        iron. Must’ve been a few years 
                        ago...

                                 MARCH
                             (horrified)
                        ...What?

                                 TALENTLESS MUSICIAN (SINGING)
                        And girls, they want to have fun...

                                 GOZ
                        Yeah. Pretty gruesome stuff.

           March chews this, SHELL-SHOCKED. Vaguely ashamed. 

           Moments later, Goz extends a hand -- as in a DANCE 
           INVITATION. 
                                 MARCH
                        Oh -- no. I can’t -- I mean, I 
                        don’t dance. Publicly. 

                                 GOZ
                        Are you saying you’d like to go 
                        somewhere more private? 

           Goz grins -- half-kidding.

                                 GOZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey so, I read your book. The Final 
                        Comet. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yeah? 

                                 GOZ
                        It was good. Really good. 
                             (joke)
                        I’ve probably only read about nine 
                        books, but out of the nine it was 
                        at least, like -- number five. 
                        Maybe even four. 

                                 MARCH
                        You’re too kind. 

                                 GOZ
                        Have you done anything since? 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m an editor now. Except, I don’t 
                        add any words that weren’t already 
                        there -- so really, it’s more like 
                        culling. I’m actually leading my 
                        first project this month. 

                                 GOZ
                        Why’d you quit? 

                                 MARCH
                        Writing? I guess it just seemed 
                        like a dead end. Nobody reads long-
                        form anymore. 
                             (beat)
                        Plus, there’s something kind of 
                        amazing in short-form. The editors 
                        I work with -- they can boil 
                        anything down to a single sentence. 
                        Life, loss, romance. The way they 
                        look at the world... it’s like 
                        everything’s simple. It’s like 
                        everything’s clear. 
                                 GOZ
                        Maybe not every story’s a 
                        soundbite. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yeah, well. I made a choice.   

                                 GOZ
                        Gotcha. 
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        So then, you’re a pussy. 

           March bristles, defensive.

                                 MARCH
                        What about you? What’s the status 
                        on your grand plans? 

                                 GOZ
                        Work’s work. I never had any 
                        passions I could take to the bank, 
                        so when my uncle offered me a job, 
                        I moved to the city. That was years 
                        ago. 

                                 MARCH
                        And you’re happy? 

                                 GOZ
                        I’d probably be happier back in the 
                        cornfields. I’ve never been much 
                        for the city. 

                                 MARCH
                        Why don’t you leave? 

                                 GOZ
                        Yeah. I’m getting around to it. 

                                 MARCH
                        Got it. 
                             (beat)
                        So you’re a pussy. 

           Goz smiles. March smiles back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, GOZ’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Goz carries March through his bachelor pad as they ravenously 
           SUCK FACE. 
           IN HIS BEDROOM

           He throws her down onto the bed. 

           They pull each other’s clothes off -- heaving, moaning.

           But just as the action commences, something catches March’s 
           eye -- a BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN POSTER on the wall. 

           March suddenly PULLS AWAY. Sits up. Rubs her temples.

                                 MARCH
                        I can’t. I can’t do this. 

                                 GOZ
                        Why not?

                                 MARCH
                        You like Bruce. 

                                 GOZ
                        What?

                                 MARCH
                        Bruce Springsteen. You’re a Bruce 
                        Springsteen fan. 

                                 GOZ
                        So? 

                                 MARCH
                        So, I’m not. 

                                 GOZ
                        And...

                                 MARCH
                        What if we hang out again? Are we 
                        going to have to listen to his 
                        music?

                                 GOZ
                        Not if you don’t want to.

                                 MARCH
                        So if things progress between us -- 
                        then what? You’re just gonna give 
                        him up cold turkey? 

                                 GOZ
                        I think you’re getting ahead of 
                        yourself.
                                 MARCH
                        You smoke. I hate smokers. My uncle 
                        died of lung cancer. So then, that 
                        leaves us two options: either you 
                        quit and I become the ball-buster, 
                        or you don’t quit, and I spend the 
                        rest of my life quietly resenting 
                        you for it. Either way, we’re 
                        fucked. 
                             (beat)
                        This is the moment when it happens. 
                        When people start ignoring 
                        signposts. This moment right here. 

                                 GOZ
                        Look, I don’t know about our 
                        ‘practical compatibility.’ But I 
                        had fun with you tonight. We don’t 
                        have to have sex if you don’t want. 
                        We’ll talk. We’ll just catch up. 

                                 MARCH
                        We could...
                             (beat)
                        But why waste the time? 

           Goz -- crestfallen.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the drinks. 

           March gathers her things. 

           And with that, she’s GONE.

           INT./EXT. TAXI - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           March looks down, finds a TEAR in her new dress. Great. 

           Suddenly, her gaze snags on something: Outside in the 
           CROSSWALK, an OLDER MAN (70s) walks arm-in-arm with a woman 
           (20s) who perfectly resembles MARILYN MONROE. The dress, the 
           mole -- all of it. 

           Is that a LiveToy...?

           Before she can examine them further, her cab ACCELERATES.

           INT. BEDROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 

           March opens the closet doors, hesitates a moment... then 
           ACTIVATES David John. 
           His eyes flutter open. He smiles warmly. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Hi, March. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’d like you to come to bed with me 
                        tonight. 

           IN BED - SOON AFTER

           March and David John lie spooning.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        In an hour, you can quietly release 
                        me and roll onto your back. I sleep 
                        warm. 

           She shuts her eyes. He stares ahead, his motor WHIRRING. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - MORNING 

           The space is now decorated for the holidays -- wreaths, 
           garland, a CHRISTMAS TREE. 

           In addition to the orchid, three or four MORE PLANTS adorn 
           the room: a poinsettia, a couple FERNS... 

           Outside the window, a blanket of FRESH POWDER over Manhattan. 

                                 MARCH (O.S.)
                        It’s just that it might be hard for 
                        me to travel right now. I’m a week 
                        out from my deadline. -- Yes, it’s 
                        the same place... 

           In a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           A) David John draws the CURTAINS. 

           B) David John deftly operates a FRENCH PRESS. 

           C) David John squares the SILVERWARE for MARCH’S BREAKFAST.

           KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           David John sits across from March’s perfectly-prepared 
           BREAKFAST SPREAD as she talks on the phone in B.G. 
           She’s wearing a bright, boldly-patterned SKIRT SUIT. A little 
           more skin on display. She’s also sporting an angled BOB.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (into PHONE)
                        ...Because I don’t want to quit. 
                        I’m finally moving up. -- Uh-huh. 
                        Yes, Mom. Flights are expensive 
                        over the holidays. -- Uh-huh. If 
                        you think that’s best. -- Okay. 
                        Yeah, you too. Bye. 

           March hangs up, sighs. Sits down to eat.

           David John’s PUPILS DILATE as he scans her BODY LANGUAGE. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re upset. 

                                 MARCH 
                        What? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re chewing your cuticles, and 
                        your shoulders are pulling forward. 

           March sits up, self-conscious. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m fine. 

           She sips her coffee, scrolls through her TABLET. David John’s 
           PUPILS DILATE again... then: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Your mother’s disapproving. 

           March -- where did that come from? 

                                 DAVID JOHN(CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t trust you with your own 
                        wellbeing. And that’s not fair to 
                        you. 

           It’s as if he’s READ HER MIND.

           March stares at him, dumbstruck. Who IS this person? 

           FOYER - SOON AFTER

           March approaches the front door, where David John waits with 
           her mug of COFFEE and LUNCH. Familiar routine. 
           He leans in for their regular GOODBYE KISS. But this time, 
           March LINGERS A MOMENT LONGER in their embrace. 

           She gazes into his eyes, nose-to-nose. Seems to infer 
           something more.

                                 DAVID JOHN(CONT’D)
                        Have a great day, March. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yeah. You, too. 

           She turns for the door, tries the handle -- can’t open it. 
           Tries it again -- no dice. 

           Finally realizes she FORGOT TO TURN THE LOCK. Whoops.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY

           The editors are gathered for their weekly meeting, with Hope 
           at the helm. 

                                 CARBON
                        Personally, I think we should focus 
                        this quarter on expanding the 
                        definition of “classic.” Who 
                        decides which novels are “classic” 
                        anyway?

                                 QUID
                             (agreeing)
                        Lay’s wasn’t always the classic 
                        potato chip. 

                                 CARBON
                        No -- those are Lay’s Classics.

                                 QUID
                        Exactly.

                                 HOPE
                        You’re both missing the point. 
                        We’re not competing for better 
                        content.  

                                 MARCH 
                        -- We’re competing for form. 

           Hope looks up to find March striding briskly at her desk.

                                 HOPE
                             (surprised)
                        That’s right.
                                 MARCH
                        If I might pitch an idea. 

                                 HOPE
                        Please. 

           March reaches into a folder, retrieves a two-page TRAVEL 
           BROCHURE. Displays it to the group. 

                                 MARCH
                        I call it the ‘Pamph-Lit.’

                                 QUID
                        That’s a Catskills hiking guide.

                                 MARCH
                        Picture it. Novels culled to five 
                        hundred words or less. Classic 
                        American literature retrofitted to 
                        the length of a cocktail menu.

                                 CARBON
                             (mystified)
                        ...The most abridged publication in 
                        history.

                                 MARCH
                        Novelettes will be obsolete by the 
                        New Year. The future of fiction is 
                        single-fold.  

           The room chews this a minute. Not sure what to make of it.

           They look to Hope. Her gaze is INSCRUTABLE. 

           Finally: 

                                 HOPE
                        I’ll pitch it upward at the 
                        quarterly briefing. 
                             (beat)
                        Nice work. 

           March smiles. UPS THE PACE of her stride. 

           INT. MIDTOWN BAR - EVENING

           With the CHIME OF AN OVERHEAD BELL, March, Blush and Carbon 
           slide into the same table at the familiar happy hour spot. 
           Blush is notably TANNER, sports a half-head of CORNROWS. 

           No sooner have they pulled in their chairs than their drinks 
           are served by the arms of THREE SYNCHRONIZED WAITERS. 
                                 BLUSH
                        Mole and I spent the entire week 
                        betting on hermit crab races. We 
                        both just love them. Races, I mean. 
                        Hermit crabs, too. 

                                 MARCH
                             (laughs)
                        Oh -- for a minute I thought you 
                        were going to say that you spent 
                        the entire week having sex. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Right, well, that too. 
                             (beat)
                        Not every day, per se, but that’s 
                        just because Mole had a stomach 
                        ache on Monday and Tuesday, and I 
                        cut my knee on a piece of coral on 
                        Thursday. Right on the joint, so. 
                             (beat)
                        Plus, it’s not like everyone has 
                        sex on their honeymoon. I mean we 
                        did, of course. We were practically 
                        designed for each other. But 
                        generally speaking, that’s not 
                        always the case. 

           A beat.

                                 MARCH
                             (to CARBON)
                        How’s the holiday party coming 
                        along? 

                                 CARBON
                             (groans)
                        The whole guest list is imploding 
                        since I pushed the start time. 
                        Apparently, people need to get home 
                        to their “families.” 
                             (to MARCH)
                        Which reminds me -- are you seeing 
                        anyone? I have to nail down the 
                        plus-ones by tomorrow night. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh. No, I don’t think so. 

                                 CARBON
                        You don’t know if you’re seeing 
                        someone? 
                                 MARCH
                        No. I mean -- I’ve been spending 
                        time with someone, but it’s not a 
                        serious thing. It’s just for fun. 

           Blush and Carbon exchange glances. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Well...? 

                                 MARCH
                        Well, what? 

                                                         CARBON
                           BLUSH
           Do you like him? 
                                              Does he have a big dick? 

                                 MARCH
                        Sure. I like him. And -- yeah, the 
                        sex is great. It’s more than great. 
                        It’s the best sex I’ve ever had. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Is he compatible? 

                                 CARBON
                        Double check his mattress 
                        preferences. Pillow-tops have 
                        always been a deal-breaker for me.

                                 MARCH
                        That’s not the problem. He’s very 
                        compatible. He’s exactly my type. 
                        And he’s generous in a way that 
                        isn’t self-serving. He anticipates 
                        everything that I need before I 
                        even realize that I need it. We 
                        have the same sense of humor. We 
                        never fight. Plus, he knows my body 
                        better than any man I’ve ever met. 
                        He’s... basically perfect. 

                                 CARBON
                        So... what is the problem? 

           March considers this prospect, as if for the first time. 

           EXT. NELSONVILLE PARK - NELSONVILLE, NEW YORK - EVENING 

           Dell watches from the bleachers as Regis EATS DIRT in a 
           TACKLING DRILL. A COACH (40s) claps his COMPETITOR (12) on 
           the back as Regis struggles up onto his feet.  
                                 DELL
                             (into CELL PHONE)
                        I can’t watch. He’s gone down three 
                        times already. They just keep going 
                        through the line-up over and over 
                        again. It’s like an endless loop. 
                        God, March, it’s like some sort of 
                        torture cycle. 
                             (to REGIS)
                        Stretch it out, bud! 

           INT. BATHROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - SAME 

           On the other end of the line, March sits in a BUBBLE BATH, 
           surrounded by candles. 

           THROUGH THE CRACKED DOOR

           She watches David John vacuuming in the buff. His long, 
           graceful strokes are athletic... even SENSUAL. 

                                 DELL (O.S.)
                        ...Are you there? 

                                 MARCH
                             (into PHONE)
                        Sorry. 

           David John finishes with the vacuum. Takes a seat in the 
           armchair and cracks open a copy of The Feminine Mystique. His 
           PUPILS WIDEN as he begins to ingest the text. 

           I/C FOLLOWING:

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when you found that 
                        snapping turtle on Grandma’s farm? 
                        You carried it with you everywhere 
                        you went, and then finally one day 
                        Mom told you it was just an empty 
                        shell. 

                                 DELL
                        Shy Shirley. Yeah, I remember. 

                                 MARCH
                        But you kept carrying it around 
                        anyway. Even after you knew it was 
                        empty. Why’d you do that? 

                                 DELL
                        I guess it was a cool shell. 
                                 MARCH
                        But also -- because it made you 
                        happy, right? 

                                 DELL
                        I don’t know, March. I was six. 

                                 MARCH
                        And ultimately, it didn’t matter if 
                        Shirley was real or not, because 
                        the way you felt about her was 
                        real. And at the end of the day, 
                        who cares what anyone else thinks 
                        about it? 

                                 DELL
                        I guess so. 

                                 MARCH
                        Thanks, Dell. 

                                 DELL
                        For what? 

                                 MARCH
                        I gotta go. 

           March CLICKS OFF. Considers.

           EXT. MIDTOWN - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           Another night. A HEAVY SNOW is falling. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 

           March stands at the kitchen counter drinking a glass of WINE. 
           Fidgets with the seam of a green-and-red COCKTAIL DRESS. 

           On the nearby TV, Paula Abdul’s “Straight Up” video.

                                 MARCH
                             (calling O.S.)
                        Nothing about our sex life. Stay 
                        away from politics. Focus on the 
                        questions I gave you. And don’t 
                        pretend to eat anything, either. I 
                        think people might think that’s 
                        weird. 

           She eyes the clock, then, moments later -- 

           DAVID JOHN EMERGES FROM THE BEDROOM.
           For the first time, we see him FULLY CLOTHED in a freshly- 
           tailored SUIT. He makes Christian Grey look like SCREECH, may 
           as well be cut from stone. 

           March -- momentarily stupefied. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        You look... nice. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You look nice, too. 

                                 MARCH
                             (re: DRESS)
                        You don’t think maybe it’s too 
                        short? 

           He PROCESSES, pulls for a soundbite:

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        The women at your company show more 
                        skin in church. 

           March laughs feebly. Sucks in a sharp BREATH.

                                 DAVID JOHN(CONT’D)
                        You’re nervous. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m not the sort of person who goes 
                        against the grain. I’m the sort of 
                        person you ask to watch your laptop 
                        when you pee. 

           David John approaches, pulls her into a soft KISS. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Fortune favors the bold. 

                                 MARCH
                        That’s funny. My nana used to say 
                        that, too. 

           INT. THE BOOM-BOOM ROOM - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           ThePointIs’ holiday party is in full swing -- some sip themed 
           cocktails by the bar, others shuffle to a pared, synthetic 
           rendition of “Jingle Bell Rock.” 

           IN THE CORNER
           A group of ASSISTANTS participate in an “efficient” Secret 
           Santa exchange. One ASSISTANT (22) hands an UNWRAPPED GIFT to 
           ANOTHER ASSISTANT (22): 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I got you a wok. Because you asked 
                        for a wok. 

                                 ANOTHER ASSISTANT
                        Thanks. 

           BY THE BAR

           Blush two-steps beside her husband MOLE (30s). The pair wear 
           coordinated CHRISTMAS SWEATERS -- each making up one half of 
           the NATIVITY SCENE. 

           They’re a notable mismatch -- Mole is short, paunchy, and 
           haphazardly-bearded. Despite their “92.7%” compatibility, 
           this couple has ZERO CHEMISTRY.

                                 MOLE
                        This is my favorite Christmas song. 

                                 BLUSH
                        Mine too. 

           A beat. 

                                 MOLE
                        Hey, so -- where did Frosty keep 
                        his savings? 

                                 BLUSH
                        In a snow bank. 

                                 MOLE
                             (realizing)
                        You also read the Post this week. 

                                 BLUSH
                        It’s a Level 1 Preference. 

                                 MOLE
                        Right. For me, too. 

                                 BLUSH
                        That was a funny one. 

                                 MOLE
                        Yep. 

           Silence. 
                                 BLUSH
                        I’m so happy. 

                                 MOLE
                        Me too. 

           AT A NEARBY TABLE

           Quid chats up his DATE (20s). She’s pretty, in an EAST ORANGE 
           NEW JERSEY sort of way. 

                                 QUID
                        So you’ve been using the coding app 
                        for a while now? 

                                 QUID’S DATE
                        Only a couple months. It’s all the 
                        rage in Amsterdam. 

                                 QUID
                        I heard that, too. To tell you the 
                        truth though, the whole thing sorta 
                        freaked me out at first. 

           Just then, Date’s phone PINGS! She goes to silence it, but 
           something on the screen catches her eye. 

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                        I guess I worried it would make 
                        dating into some kinda competitive 
                        sport. Y’know, where everybody’s 
                        lookin’ over each other’s shoulders 
                        for the next more compatible Joe. 

           Date looks up from her phone, spots A HANDSOME GUY across the 
           room. Handsome Guy looks up from HIS phone. The pair lock 
           eyes, unbeknownst to Quid. They smile. 

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, just bein’ paranoid, I 
                        guess. 
                             (beat)
                        So, tell me more about your family. 

                                 QUID’S DATE
                        I’ll be right back. 

           Quid’s Date and her new match stand from their separate 
           tables in tandem, make their way to the EXIT together. 

           Quid hums to himself, sips from his glass. None the wiser. 

           CARBON
           Is standing with Hope and a few other EXECUTIVES when a 
           SHEEPISH MAN (30s) approaches... taps her on the shoulder. 

                                 SHEEPISH MAN
                             (to CARBON)
                        Hey there. My name’s Dice. I work 
                        in the math department. Third 
                        floor. Third-floor-for-sure. 

           He clears his throat, nervous. 

                                 CARBON
                        Are you religious? 

                                 SHEEPISH MAN
                        Not really. 

                                 CARBON
                        Kids? 

                                 SHEEPISH MAN
                        No. 

                                 CARBON
                        Spin for me? 

           Sheepish Man hesitates, reluctantly turns in a circle. 
           Mortified. Carbon scans his physique. 

                                 CARBON (CONT’D)
                        So sorry, Deuce. 

                                 SHEEPISH MAN
                        Dice. 

           Carbon turns back to her conversation, leaving Sheepish Man 
           crestfallen.

           Moments later, an EXECUTIVE’s (40) attention is pulled to the 
           ENTRANCE. We follow his gaze to -- 

           MARCH AND DAVID JOHN

           Descending the stairs arm-in-arm. As they make their way 
           toward the bar, various spectators take note:

           HOPE -- looks up from her conversation, stunned. 

           BLUSH -- gives David John a conspicuous ONCE-OVER. 

           FEMALE INTERNS -- nudge each other to attention.

           QUID -- instinctively sucks in his GUT. 
           AND, FINALLY, CARBON 

           Turns just in time to see March walking toward her -- SPILLS 
           HER MARTINI down the front of her dress. 

                                 CARBON
                        March. 

                                 MARCH
                             (to CARBON)
                        Carbon, this is David John.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                             (to CARBON)
                        It’s great to finally meet you. 

           Carbon GASPS. Nearby partygoers FALL SILENT, familiar with 
           his ARTIFICIAL VOICE. 

                                 CARBON
                             (private)
                        March... this isn’t... 

           March knows she’s in the spotlight. Takes a deep breath.

                                 MARCH
                             (to ALL)
                        He’s a 7+ model. I purchased him 
                        six months ago on the internet, and 
                        now we’re seeing each other. 

           Carbon stands slack-jawed. There is, one might say, a 

           HEAVY. 

              FUCKING. 

                 SILENCE.

           Onlookers watch, shell-shocked, as March and David John enact 
           a “routine” with sultry, almost PERFORMATIVE precision: 

           March shrugs out of her coat, and David John deftly CATCHES 
           IT as it falls from her shoulders.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                             (to MARCH)
                        A drink? 

                                 MARCH
                        My usual. 

           David John beelines for the bar, PARTS THE CROWD like the RED 
           SEA. 
           A stunned BARTENDER hands off a GLASS OF WINE. David John 
           turns on his heel, breezes back toward March. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (to DAVID JOHN)
                        Wait. 

           David John STOPS dead in his tracks. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        I’m not thirsty anymore. 

           David John pivots again, returns to the bar. Sets the glass 
           down. 

           NEARBY WOMEN exchange incredulous glances. There’s something 
           provocative -- downright SALACIOUS -- in their exchange. 

           David John returns to March’s side, HEELED like a Pointer.

           Finally, Hope steps forward from the group, comes face-to- 
           face with David John. 

           She studies him clinically, like a rare piece of art.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                             (to HOPE)
                        If you’re going to stare, you may 
                        as well introduce yourself. 

           Hope is taken aback, impressed by his spunk. 

                                 HOPE
                        I’m Hope Tracer. 

           She reaches for his hand. He shakes it. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Pleased to meet you, Hope. 

                                 HOPE
                        Likewise. 

           David John looks to March, who issues a small NOD.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                             (to HOPE)
                        Would you like to dance? 

           Carbon shoots March a glance -- what the fuck is happening. 

           But before anyone has a chance to intercede: 
                                 HOPE
                        Yes, I would. 

           David John extends an arm, leads Hope out onto the floor. 

           AN HOUR LATER

           David John is leading Hope through a choreography sequence we 
           may or may not recognize from Footloose as partygoers watch 
           from afar. The crowd seems to be SPLIT: Some attendees -- 
           primarily COUPLES -- SNEER at the spectacle. Others are 
           ENRAPTURED. 

           Blush sits in a corner with Mole, stares at David John with 
           obvious LONGING. 

                                 MOLE
                             (re: TART)
                        So tell me -- do think this is 
                        strawberry jam or strawberry 
                        preserves? 

                                 BLUSH
                             (distracted)
                        Me too. 

           Mole follows her gaze to David John. Deflates. 

           MEANWHILE -- MARCH

           Is surrounded by a group of FEMALE COLLEAGUES -- all ears. 
           Among them is: 

                                 CARBON
                        What kind of chores? Like, the 
                        dishes? 

           March nods. 

                                 A BRASH WOMAN
                        Can he play cards? Hold ‘Em? 

                                 MARCH
                             (nods)
                        He gets better each time. 

                                 BRASH WOMAN
                        My cousin took his 4+ out for ice 
                        cream once. 
                             (”though”)
                        Truth be told, he’s a bit of a 
                        queer. 
                                 PRUDISH WOMAN
                             (to MARCH)
                        And he actually -- does he know 
                        what to do down there? 

                                 CARBON
                             (to PRUDISH WOMAN)
                        Haven’t you ever used one? 

                                 BRASH WOMAN
                        They’re very receptive. Mine makes 
                        love to me just like Eminem in 8 
                        Mile. 

                                 PRUDISH WOMAN
                        My husband thinks they’re the 
                        devil’s work. 

                                 CARBON
                             (to MARCH)
                        You have conversations? 

                                 MARCH
                        All the time. He’s a great 
                        listener. And he remembers 
                        everything. 

                                 BRASH WOMAN
                        Any back-talk? You have to smack 
                        him around? 

                                 MARCH
                        Never. 

                                 BRASH WOMAN
                        Good. Can’t stand back-talk. 

           Across the room, David John gives Hope a final DIP. 

                                 PRUDISH WOMAN
                        He is awfully handsome. 

                                 MARCH
                        I was thinking about more of a coif 
                        in his hair, but -- 

                                 PRUDISH WOMAN
                        -- Oh, God no. The coif is trendy. 
                        Here today, gone tomorrow. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Quid drinks by himself, his date long gone. He sees David 
           John approaching from the dance floor, much to his chagrin. 
                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Hi. What’s your name? 

                                 QUID
                        Quid. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Are you having fun? 

                                 QUID
                        I dunno.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Do you like Christmas? 

                                 QUID
                        Not really. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Why not? 

           Quid shrugs. Fuck this guy.

                                 QUID
                        I dunno. I guess it’s always been a 
                        rough holiday for me. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Tell me more about that. 

           Quid hesitates for a long beat, then:

                                 QUID
                        I guess if you really want to know, 
                        it probably started when I was 
                        seven or eight. I mean -- don’t get 
                        me wrong, I was a well-mannered 
                        kid. Normal. I liked a present 
                        every now and then... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           TEN MINUTES LATER

           Quid has ostensibly opened up.

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                        ...And I’m sayin’ -- “No, Mom. Fuck 
                        YOU.” She starts pullin’ the 
                        stuffing out of the Elmo doll -- 
                        here I am, seven years old, still 
                        forming my anatomical -- y’know -- 
                        knowledge.

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                        And my own mother’s got his head in 
                        one hand, body in the other... 
                        YANKIN’ and YANKIN’... soon, 
                        there’s nothing. An arm here, a few 
                        tufts of cotton there. Nothing. 
                        Here I am in tears. 
                             (beat)
                        So eventually they pulled me off 
                        Santa’s lap, and that was our last 
                        trip to the Long Island Mini-Mall. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Thanks for sharing that. 

                                 QUID
                        Yeah. You know something -- you’re 
                        a pretty alright guy. 

           Beat, then: 

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                        You know, actually -- there was 
                        this other time at the Cheesecake 
                        Factory... 

           MIDNIGHT 

           Hope approaches March at the bar. In B.G., the party is 
           thinning out -- only a handful of guests remain scattered 
           throughout the room. 

                                 HOPE
                        I approved the final pass on Sun 
                        Also Rises. It’s official: You’re 
                        above the title. 
                             (beat)
                        I must say, while I hate surprises, 
                        I’ll always take my share of the 
                        pleasant ones. You’ve really turned 
                        it around, March. 

                                 MARCH
                        Thank you. I appreciate that. 

                                 HOPE
                        We’ve acquired George Orwell’s 
                        Animal Farm. I’d like to try it as 
                        a Pamph-Lit. 

                                 MARCH
                        They liked my idea? 
                                 HOPE
                        It’s ambitious -- but, if properly 
                        executed, it could change the face 
                        of the industry. I’d like to debut 
                        it at the Board of Education 
                        luncheon next month.
                             (OFF silence)
                        Assuming you can handle it. 

                                 MARCH
                        Of course. Yes. This is... yes.

                                 HOPE
                        Good.

           Hope finishes her drink. Stands.

                             (re: DAVID JOHN)
                        Honestly? I think it’s brilliant. 

           INT. ELEVATOR, THE BOOM-BOOM ROOM - NIGHT 

           March and David John board the elevator beside Blush and 
           Mole. David John KISSES MARCH’S NECK. She giggles. 

           Blush eyes them, forlorn. 

           The foursome begin a GLACIAL DESCENT. 

           EXT. THE BOOM-BOOM ROOM - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           March and David John step off the curb. A CAB appears, as if 
           from thin air. 

           INT. CAB - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 

           March lays her head on David John’s shoulder. Smiles. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re happy. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m happy. 

           INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY - VARIOUS (MONTAGE)

           As the Christmas season envelops Manhattan, we watch March 
           and David John explore the city as a couple. 
           All the while, we note David John “hard-wiring” statements, 
           cues, and other bits of INFORMATION from the outside world: 

           A) March and David John ride a horse-drawn carriage through 
           Central Park. David John’s PUPILS DILATE...

                                 CARRIAGE DRIVER (O.S.)
                        The horses aren’t actually abused, 
                        y’know. They got a good life. Not 
                        so many options in life as a horse. 

           B) March and David John walk hand-in-hand down Fifth 
           Avenue...

                                 STREET PROMOTER 
                        Comedy tickets, folks! -- 

                                 PETA ADVOCATE (O/L)
                        -- Do you have sixty seconds for 
                        human rights? 

                                 BUM (O/L)
                        Fuck your mother, motherfucker! 

           C) March and David John stroll through the MoMa in AUDIO 
           HEADSETS; a PASSERBY (18) seems to RECOGNIZE David John from 
           the Live Toys website -- nudges her FRIEND (18)...

                                 AUDIO RECORDING (V.O.)
                             (from HEADSET)
                        ...The symmetrical cubes are 
                        thought to symbolize a yearning for 
                        political harmony... 

           D) March and David John watch a Broadway Play beside a NOISY 
           COUPLE (40s)...

                                 CHARACTER (O.S.)
                             (from STAGE)
                        I come from nothin’, Pop. And 
                        nothin’ grows up into nothin’. 

                                 NOISY HUSBAND
                        ...Seat’s like a brick... 

           A nearby CELL PHONE RINGS. David John’s eyes grow WIDE.

           CLOSE ON DAVID JOHN’S FACE over a swelling COLLAGE OF SOUNDS: 
           exchanges, car horns, music, advertisements... OFF its 
           crescendo, we

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - DAY 

           March paces the room with a dog-eared copy of Animal Farm as 
           David John watches T.V.

           ON THE SCREEN: a CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR 
           references footage of a GRISLY OVERSEAS BOMBING. 

                                 CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR (ON TV)
                        Disagree all you like, but the fact 
                        of the matter is, if we’d 
                        intervened sooner, hundreds of 
                        civilian lives could have been -- 
                        and would have been -- spared. 

           A FEW MORE PLANTS line the window. We’re verging on OVERKILL.

           EXT. SUBWAY STATION, NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           As March and David John approach the subway, they’re forced 
           to weave through a crowd of POLITICAL PROTESTORS. 

                                 MARCH
                             (re: PROTESTERS)
                        It’s unbelievable. Do they really 
                        think that pulling troops out of a 
                        country we’ve all but crippled is a 
                        viable option? 

                                 PROTESTORS
                             (chanting)
                        Now means today! Now means today! 

                                 MARCH
                        They’ve been chanting the same 
                        thing ever since that idiot pop 
                        star tweeted it last week. It’s 
                        like the entire country’s rejected 
                        the notion of an independent 
                        thought.

                        If the U.S. had intervened sooner, 
                        we could have spared civilian

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           March and David John take a seat on the bench.

           AT THE OTHER END OF THE CAR

           March spots a GAY MAN (50s) sitting hand-in-hand with his 
           QUEENY TOY (30s/40s)... the Toy looks EXACTLY LIKE DAVID 
           JOHN, except that he sports EYELINER and a pair of PATENT-
           LEATHER CAPRIS. They were clearly designed from the same 
           basic model. 

           Suddenly, her attention is stolen by: 

                                 PANHANDLER
                        Spare some change, brother?

           A PANHANDLER (60s) approaches David John with his cup. David 
           John digests this -- then:  

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re either supporting the 
                        homeless, or you’re supporting 
                        homelessness. It’s really that 
                        simple, Ted.

                                 PANHANDLER
                        That’s right, brother. 

           Then, just as quickly, ANOTHER SOUNDBITE surfaces: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        So you can double down on your 
                        crack supply? Fuck off, man. 

           Nearby PASSENGERS turn and stare. A TEENAGED BOY snickers. 

                                 MARCH
                             (to DAVID JOHN, under her 
                              breath)
                        What are you doing?

           David John’s MOTOR WHIRS. Moments later:

                                 DAVID JOHN

                                 MARCH
                        -- Stop speaking.

           When the train finally rolls into Grand Central, March stands 
           and exits. David John follows. 

           GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           A BIRD’S EYE VIEW shows COMMUTERS walking through the station 
           with perfect economy -- foot traffic patterns appear almost 
           CHOREOGRAPHED.

           Emerges from the subway stairs, fuming.

                        That was humiliating. You can’t say 
                        things like that. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Teach me how to please you. 

                                 MARCH
                        I’d like you to forget what you 
                        said on the train. All of it.

           Regis sits in the middle of the carpet with his HEADSET on,

           Dell removes a GLAZED HAM from the oven as her mother STEM

                        Reminds me of my cousin Mew. Went 
                        through a divorce at 47 and started 
                        doing all kinds of crazy stuff. 
                        Turns out, the stress caused his 
                        brain to bleed slowly out into his 
                        nasal cavity. Slowly, but steadily.

                        people might... 
                             (struggling with it)
                        ...spend time with them, too.

           March takes David John’s hand. He squeezes it in solidarity.

                        And what does “real” mean to you, 
                        Mom? You married Dad because you 
                        both had phantom-sleep-apnea and 
                        acute “phobophobia.”

                                 FLICK
                        The fear of fear. Equal parts rare 
                        and debilitating.

                                 MARCH
                        So what?! Every morning, I wake up 
                        beside a gorgeous man. For 
                        breakfast, I eat the food that I 
                        want. Over dinner, I discuss the 
                        topics that interest me. When I’m 
                        down, I have someone who supports 
                        me unequivocally. Someone who knows 
                        me inside and out -- my secrets, my 
                        fears, my goals. I have the sex 
                        that I want, when I want, wherever 
                        I want. And for the first time in 
                        my entire life, I don’t have to 
                        compromise. Not ever. Do you have 
                        any idea what that feels like? 
                             (OFF silence)
                        It feels like the real thing. 

           A beat, then:

                        Let’s all regroup for a minute.

           Fed up, Stem stands. 

           March stands, too. 

                                 MARCH
                        No. That’s fine. We’ll go.

                        Do you agree with her? 

           Dell hesitates. Doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s nothing to talk about. 
                             (beat)
                        I knew this would take some getting 
                        used to, but I didn’t expect this 
                        level of narrow-mindedness from my 
                        own family.

                             (to STEM)
                        You criticize March to feel better 
                        about your own choices.

                                 MARCH
                        And you know what? I’m not even 
                        upset about it. In fact, I pity 
                        your myopic perspectives. I hope 
                        you take a mental snapshot. This is 
                        what it looks like to be on the 
                        wrong side of history. 

           With that, David John snaps the lid on the Tupperware, and 
           the couple see themselves out. 

           INT. NELSONVILLE BAR & GRILLE - NELSONVILLE, NY - NIGHT 

           March and David John sip Egg Nog at a cheaply-decorated, near-
           empty local tavern -- the kind that serves microwaved kettle 
           corn out of yesterday’s Chinet. 
           By March’s languid speech, we gather this is NOT, in fact, 
           her first drink of the evening.

                                 MARCH 
                        Dell’s always been critical. Holier-
                        than-thou. She’d tell you she’s 
                        concerned about my well-being, but 
                        deep down -- deep down -- I think 
                        she’s threatened by my happiness. 
                        I think that’s what Freud would 
                        say. 

           A beat. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        You’re quiet. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Would you like me to engage more? 

                                 MARCH
                             (shakes her head)
                        Sometimes being quiet together is 
                        nice. 

           They sit in silence for a few moments. 

           An overhead SONG fades out, leading directly into Fatboy 
           Slim’s “Weapon of Choice.” The same video we saw earlier.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        I love this song. 

           Another beat or so... then, David John’s HEAD begins to 
           twitch, ever-so-slightly. 

           March clocks the behavior, perplexed.

           Moments later, he STANDS out of his chair. As if COMPELLED BY 
           SOME UNSEEN FORCE, he moves to the center of the sticky 
           hardwood. Nearby PATRONS eye him curiously. 

           Is he short-circuiting? 

           Finally, at the CRASH of the cymbals, David John LEAPS INTO 
           STEP: He’s reenacting Christopher Walken’s choreography from 
           the music video. 

           ...Moreover, he’s doing it PERFECTLY. 

           His commitment is staggering, even BIZARRE. At first, March 
           isn’t sure what to make of it.
           David John maintains Walken’s STERNNESS as he soft-shoes his 
           way across the floor. Drunk patrons begin to CHEER, bemused. 
           He lands a ROUND-OFF in stellar form -- a lithe machine 
           designed with PERFECT RHYTHM. 

           After a few bars, March finally stands and JOINS HIM in the 
           dance. They face one another, like a MIRROR IMAGE. Her moves 
           are sloppy, if spirited. The two are going BALLS-OUT on the 
           eccentric, pseudo-modern choreography. 

           They take to the tabletops, hands in the air. 

           By the time they’ve finished, March is SWEATING. Punch drunk. 

           Also, regular-drunk.

           She grins. He grins back.

           Bliss.

           INT. BEDROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 

           Back at home, David John and March stand at the foot of her 
           bed. She’s in a NEGLIGEE. He pulls one STRAP, then the other. 
           Watches it fall. Just like he was taught. 

           She takes him into her hand. He pulls her in for a KISS. 

           It’s the exact same routine we saw on their first night... 
           but this time, it reads NATURAL. Sensual. Honest. 

           They’re in perfect sync with one another.

           Without warning:

                                 MARCH
                        I love you. 

           David John stares into her eyes. Ingests the statement, like 
           any other. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        I love you. 

           ...They move together for the BED. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           THE NEXT MORNING

           March wakes to a ringing PHONE. Rolls over, bleary. Off the 
           cue of her physical motion, David John OPENS HIS EYES, too. 
           March reaches for her cell -- a voicemail from her sister: 

                                 DELL (VOICEMAIL)
                             (speaker)
                        March, it’s me. Look, I’m really 
                        sorry about the way things unfolded 
                        last night. I may not understand 
                        everything... but if you’re happy, 
                        then I’m happy for you. Really, I 
                        am. Call me.

           She doesn’t know what to make of it. Looks to David John. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        It’s disingenuous.

                                 MARCH
                        How do you know? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Dell doesn’t care about your well-
                        being. She never has. 

           She stares at the ceiling, chewing this. 

           Finally, she CLICKS OFF her phone. Tables it.

           Carbon looks on beside March and David John, who glide arm-in-
           arm. 

                                 MARCH
                        I thought you said you bought him 
                        last month. Shouldn’t he be more 
                        coordinated by now?

                        Oh, he’s very coordinated. He’s 
                        just never been off of his knees 
                        before. 

           Carbon SNAPS her fingers, calls:

                        interested.

                                 MARCH
                        Well, you shouldn’t feel pressured 
                        to pursue a relationship if you 
                        don’t want to.

                        liberties as men.

                             (OFF Carbon’s glance)
                        He’s very progressive. 

                                 CARBON
                        But that’s just it -- even with 
                        sex, I don’t feel like I’ve 
                        designed the perfect partner yet. 
                        I’ve tried different races, builds, 
                        genders... no matter what, it 
                        always feels like I’m settling. 

           Sergio rejoins the foursome, struggles to stay on his feet.

                        Anyway, how is Hope feeling about 
                        the Orwell project?

                        Good, I guess. She hasn’t asked to 
                        see a pass yet.

                        when she’s excited about projects. 
                        When I was leading Rebecca, she 
                        practically pitched a tent outside

                        I guess she trusts me. 

                                 CARBON
                        Either that, or she’s secretly 
                        replacing you. Right? 

           Carbon smiles -- kidding. 

           March laughs perfunctorily... seems to FLAG that comment.
           Just then, Sergio swerves in a semi-circle, collides with a 
           MOTHER and her SMALL CHILD. 

                                 CARBON (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

           Carbon skates off after him, leaving March in THOUGHT. 

           MEANWHILE - UP ON THE PLAZA

           Red, clad in his usual LINENS, traverses the sidewalk with an 
           armload of BUCKWHEAT. Suddenly, a SIGHT stops him cold --

           RED’S POV: In the center of the rink, David John pulls March 
           up into an effortless LIFT -- his sinewy muscles protruding 
           beneath his diaphanous V-NECK SWEATER. Nearby skaters can’t 
           help but APPLAUD the maneuver. 

           Red clouds at the sight -- crestfallen. Who IS that guy?

           INT. KITCHEN, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 

           At the table, March scans a digital copy of Animal Farm -- 
           seems mentally preoccupied. 

           David John closes the FRIDGE, which we notice is now 
           EXCLUSIVELY stocked with SALMON PRODUCTS -- tartare, sashimi, 
           filets. 

           When a nearby clock reaches EXACTLY 8PM, David John brings 
           March’s dinner over to the table. PERFECTLY-GRILLED FISH.

                                 MARCH
                             (re: PLATE)
                        It’s a little too charred, right? 
                        Around the edges? 

           David John PROCESSES, then: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        It’s a little overdone. 

                                 MARCH
                        Then fix it. 

           David John dutifully takes her plate away. Returns to the 
           fridge. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        That was funny today, when Carbon 
                        made the comment about Hope 
                        pitching a tent outside her office. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        She’s always saying funny little 
                        things like that, isn’t she? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She’s very witty. 

                                 MARCH
                        I think so, too. 

           A beat. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        It was sort of a strange comment, 
                        though. Hard to say exactly what 
                        she was getting at. Was she trying 
                        to tell me that Hope isn’t 
                        enthusiastic about my work? 
                             (beat)
                        It’s just interesting, in that a 
                        third-party observer might think 
                        she was trying to intimidate me. 

           David John PROCESSES. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She was trying to intimidate you. 

                                 MARCH
                        You think so? I didn’t know if 
                        maybe I was being oversensitive. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She was probably just making a 
                        joke. 

                                 MARCH
                        But then again, you do have a 
                        point. After all, I have been 
                        climbing the ranks at work. It’s 
                        only reasonable to assume she’s 
                        noticed. Maybe she feels a little 
                        pressure to step up her game. Maybe 
                        she thinks that as far as Hope is 
                        concerned, it’s her or me. Right? 
                             (beat)
                        Or maybe she was just talking... 

           March returns to her work as David John PROCESSES this 
           speech. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Carbon’s trying to have you fired. 
                                 MARCH
                             (stunned)
                        Oh my god. Do you really think so? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        She’s threatened by your success. 

                                 MARCH
                        She probably is though, isn’t she? 
                        Besides, you know what they say 
                        about jokes. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Your Aunt Marnie makes dirty jokes. 

                                 MARCH
                        In every joke, there’s a kernel of 
                        truth. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        In every joke, there’s a kernel of 
                        truth. 

           David John brings over a NEW piece of fish. 

                                 MARCH
                        I can’t think about food right now. 
                        Take it away. 

           March crosses to her room, slams the door.

           David John idles in the middle of the floor, holding her 
           plate.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY

           March walks briskly on her treadmill desk, gazes 
           surreptitiously at Carbon. We may notice she looks a bit 
           PALER than usual. 

                                 QUID
                             (reading from TABLET)

                        I know his name is Snowball,

           MARCH’S OFFICE - LATER

           March power-walks on her desk.
           ON HER TABLET: A digital mock-up of the Orwell Pamph-Lit -- 
           it indeed resembles a TRAVEL BROCHURE.  

           A KNOCK on the door -- Blush.

                                 BLUSH
                        Hi, March. Sorry to bother you.
                        I was just hoping... I wanted to 
                        get your advice something, if you 
                        have a minute. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yes?

                                 BLUSH
                        Theoretically speaking, if you were 
                        a woman who was married to a 
                        wonderful man, but you were slowly 
                        coming to realize that you never 
                        wanted to have sex with him -- not 
                        even when you’re intoxicated -- and 
                        in fact, you even become a little 
                        bit nauseated at the sight of his 
                        genitals and lower torso... would 
                        you consider getting a Toy?

                                 MARCH
                        Yes.

                                 BLUSH
                             (knew it)
                        Yeah...

           Blush turns to leave -- hesitates:

                                 BLUSH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, March. Are you feeling 
                        alright?

           March looks up -- suddenly on the defense.

                                 MARCH
                        Why -- did Carbon tell you I 
                        wasn’t?

                                 BLUSH
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MARCH
                        What do you mean?

                                 BLUSH
                        You look sort of... pale. 
                                 MARCH
                        I’m fine. Everything’s fine. Better 
                        than fine. Everything’s perfect. 

           Blush nods, bewildered. Exits out into the hallway. 

           Through the glass pane, March witnesses an exchange between 
           Carbon and Hope. It’s innocuous enough, but March clouds at 
           the sight. Skeptical.

           Her mind reels.

           INT. ELEVATOR, THE-POINT-IS HQ - DAY 

           Later, March climbs into the elevator beside two INTERNS 
           (20s), who fall conspicuously silent upon her entrance. 

           March bristles. Were they talking about her...?

           LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           March emerges from the elevator, now visibly AGITATED. 
           Beelines for the street. But just as she exits the 
           building...

           EXT. THE-POINT-IS HQ - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           ...she spots DELL ENTERING through the rotating doors. 

           March persists, pretends not to see her. A confused Dell 
           turns on her heel, emerges back onto the sidewalk. 

                                 DELL
                             (calling)

           March reluctantly turns. 

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                        I’ve been calling you all week. I 
                        was worried about you. 
                             (appraising her)
                        You look terrible. Are you sick? 
                                 MARCH
                        I’ve been busy.

                        I need to talk to you. 

                                 MARCH
                        This isn’t a good time, Dell.

                                 DELL
                        Did something happen at work? 

                                 MARCH
                        You wouldn’t understand. 

                                 DELL
                        Try me. 

                                 MARCH
                        Basically, I’m being victimized. 
                        Everybody’s jealous of me, so 
                        they’re trying to ruin my life. 

           Dell can’t help herself -- LAUGHS at the childish conjecture. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        See? I knew you wouldn’t get it. 

           March pivots, continues toward the train. 

                                 DELL
                        What’s gotten into you lately? 

                                 MARCH
                        He was right. 

                                 DELL
                        Who was right?

                        ‘emotional anvil.’ He says you 
                        purposefully bring me down in order 
                        to boost your own self-image. 

                                 DELL
                        That’s insane.

                                 MARCH
                        He said you’d say that. In fact, he 
                        says that’s the hallmark of an 
                        abusive relationship.

                        Jesus, March -- he’s a machine!

                                 MARCH
                        So, what?

                                 DELL
                        So, he’ll say anything to please 
                        you. That’s the point. That’s 
                        literally what he was made for.

                                 MARCH
                        He knows me better than anybody. He 
                        encourages me to stick up for 
                        myself. To be the person I’m 
                        supposed to be. 

                                 DELL
                        By agreeing with everything you 
                        say? 

                                 MARCH
                        What’s so wrong with that? Maybe 
                        the things I say are right. Maybe 
                        the things I think are right. 

                                 DELL
                        And you really believe that’s the 
                        basis of a healthy relationship? 

                                 MARCH
                        So now you’re qualified to give 
                        relationship advice? Last time I 
                        checked, you couldn’t get your 
                        son’s father to return your phone 
                        calls. 

           Dell’s STUPEFIED by her vitriol. 

           A beat.

                                 DELL
                        I don’t know who you are right now. 

                                 MARCH
                        You wish you had what I have. But 
                        instead, you have nothing.

           And with that, March turns and disappears down the block, 

           Leaving her sister AGHAST.
           INT. BEDROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           The CLOCK on the nightstand reads 3AM. March’s bed is 
           EMPTY... 

           because she’s in the 

           LIVING ROOM,

           Sitting white-knuckled on the couch. On the coffee table, a 
           completed mock-up of Animal Farm: A 500-Word Pamph-Lit. 

                                 MARCH

                        second half. Blush advised on 
                        direct quotations. 

           Beside her, David John looks EQUALLY STRESSED. A mirror image 
           of her mounting anxiety.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        They were my secondaries. I relied 
                        on them for everything.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        They’ve been sabotaging your work 
                        this entire time.

                                 MARCH
                        What do I do? 

                                 DAVID JOHN 
                        You can’t present that to the 
                        board. 

                                 MARCH
                        The luncheon’s on Monday. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        It’ll ruin your career. You’ll be a 
                        laughing stock. You’ll never make 
                        it to the “Featured Read” table. 
                        Pretty soon, you’ll have to move 
                        back to Dayton and sell corn out of 
                        your parents’ Winnebago. 

           Then, a THOUGHT.

                                 MARCH
                             (re: EDIT)
                        I could reassemble it. 
                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You could start from scratch. 

                                 MARCH
                        If I went back to the novel now, 
                        I’d have fifty-seven hours and 
                        forty-eight minutes to do another 
                        abridgment. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You could do another take. 

                                 MARCH
                        A better take. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        A cleaner take. 

                                 MARCH
                        A safer take. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’ll make it perfect.  

                                 MARCH
                        Do you think I look sick? 

           David John’s MOTOR WHIRS. 

           She searches his gaze. Finally: 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        ...You look just like Elizabeth 
                        Taylor. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - VARIOUS (TIME-LAPSE)

           In a RAPID TIME-LAPSE SEQUENCE, we witness TWO DAYS PASSING 
           as March pores over a full-length copy of Animal Farm. 

           While March remains seated at the table, David John moves 
           frenetically around our frame -- completing TWO IDENTICAL 
           CYCLES of his DAILY ROUTINE -- 

           He FLUFFS THE COUCH CUSHIONS, reads a BOOK, waters PLANTS, 
           disappears from frame, does the DISHES, watches TELEVISION, 
           stands at the WINDOW... 

           FLUFFS THE COUCH CUSHIONS, reads a BOOK, waters PLANTS, 
           disappears from frame, does the DISHES, watches TELEVISION, 
           stands at the WINDOW...
           At the table, March is becoming increasingly RESTLESS as she 
           works her way through the novel, slugs back COFFEE, readjusts 
           in her seat. 

           The sun RISES and SETS and RISES and SETS, until finally we

           RESUME NORMAL TIME (NIGHT):

           March is still awake at the table, BLEARY-EYED. She’s 
           fighting sleep as she mumbles a PASSAGE to herself: 

                                 MARCH 
                             (sotto)
                        “...Clover turned over the straw 
                        with her hoof...”
                             (revising)
                        “Clover turned over...the straw...”

           Through a CRACKED DOOR, we can see David John VACUUMING in 
           the bedroom. 

           The TICKING from an overhead WALL CLOCK seems to SWELL. 
           Agitated, March picks up the REMOTE and turns on the TV SET -- 
           as in a source of AMBIENT NOISE. 

           ON THE TV

           Is the same saccharine Infomercial Host we’ve seen before. 
           This time, she’s standing clothed inside of a RUNNING SHOWER. 

                                 INFORMERCIAL HOST (ON TV)
                        -- Who’s got time to shower? You’re 
                        gonna spend thirty-eight hundred 
                        hours of your life in the shower. 
                        You got thirty-eight hundred hours 
                        to waste? 

           MARCH 

           Doubles down into her book...

           But moments later, Host’s chatter GRABS OUR ATTENTION: 

                                 INFORMERCIAL HOST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Five hundred words, folks. It only 
                        takes five hundred words to upend 
                        six years of employment. 

           March LOOKS UP -- 

           -- finds the Host hawking a SELF-DRIVING GOLF CART. 
                                 INFOMERCIAL HOST (ON TV)
                             (reality)
                        -- Five hundred dollars over six 
                        easy monthly installments. 

           March sighs. She was just imagining it.

           She returns to her work. 

           Another beat, then the LANDLINE RINGS. March calls to the 
           bedroom without looking up:

                                 MARCH
                             (to DAVID JOHN)
                        Can you get that? 

           Phone CONTINUES TO RING, unattended. 

           March looks up, realizes the VACUUMING HAS STOPPED in the 
           next room. David John has DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (calling)
                        ...Are you there? 

           A VOICEMAIL comes through from the machine: 

                                 FLICK (O.S.)
                             (speaker)
                        March, it’s your father. Listen, I 
                        know you’re going through a phase 
                        right now, but frankly, you’re 
                        twenty-eight years old. You don’t 
                        have all the time in the world to 
                        waste on this guy... 

                                 HOPE (O.S.)
                        ...You’re wasting time in chapter 
                        three. 

           March looks back to the TV, where HOPE HAS NOW REPLACED THE 
           INFOMERCIAL HOST. She addresses March directly, peruses a 
           copy of Animal Farm from inside the self-driving golf cart. 

                                 HOPE (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        We don’t care about that horse. 
                        Clover? Who’s Clover? 

           March looks down, finds the REMOTE CONTROL IS GONE. 

           Spooked, she stands and crosses to the TV. Shuts it off 
           manually. Rubs her eyes. She’s DIZZY as she turns back for 
           the table. But moments later: 
                                 HOPE (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        -- NOBODY HAS TIME FOR CLOVER!

           March SPINS AROUND, finds the TV IS BACK ON. 

           She PULLS THE PLUG FROM THE WALL, to no avail:  

                                 HOPE (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        Efficiency isn’t just our mantra, 
                        March. It’s our brand.

                        -- A decade. 

           March TURNS to find Red speaking to her from the screen of 
           her TABLET. He appears to have AGED FIFTY YEARS. 

                                 RED (ON TABLET) (CONT’D)
                        ...I wasted an entire decade of my 
                        life with you. I could’ve spent my 
                        twenties with a practical match.
                             (woeful)
                        Now, I’m just an old man. 

                                 MARCH 
                             (calling)
                        David John!

           The TRIO OF OVERLAPPING VOICES begin to SWELL, creating a 
           DIZZYING SOUNDSCAPE as she staggers toward the bedroom.

                                 FLICK (VOICEMAIL) (O/L)
                        ...In seven hundred and sixteen

                        ...If you can’t learn to get to the 
                        point...

                                 RED (ON TABLET)
                        ...should’ve ended it sooner... 

           March THROWS OPEN THE BEDROOM DOOR, but David John’s GONE. 

                                 MARCH
                             (crying out)
                        Where are you?! 
                             (OFF silence)
                        I need you!

                                 CARBON (O.S.)
                        -- For what? 

           March WHEELS AROUND -- 
           Discovers CARBON’S VOICE coming through the INTERCOM. 

                                 CARBON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A modern woman doesn’t waste her 
                        time with romance. If you’d worried 
                        less about your love life, you 
                        might be further along in your 
                        career...

                                 STEM (O.S.) (O/L)
                        -- It’s your career, March. Move, 
                        move, move! --

           The cacophony of VOICES meld into a SHARP RINGING, like 
           MICROPHONE FEEDBACK. 

           March GRIMACES as she crosses to the intercom and YANKS IT 
           OFF THE WALL -- 

           But the feedback only grows LOUDER -- 

           Desperate, she picks up the TV and HURLS IT ACROSS THE ROOM -- 

                                 MARCH
                             (screaming)
                        Stop it!

           -- then the TABLET -- 

           -- then her VOICEMAIL MACHINE -- 

           March TEARS THE ROOM APART in an effort to SILENCE the 
           DEAFENING FEEDBACK, but it’s NO USE --

           Finally, she DOUBLES-OVER in the center of the now-DEMOLISHED 
           space,

           Covers her EARS WITH HER HANDS... 

           Shuts her EYES...

                                 DAVID JOHN 
                        -- March? 

           March looks up to find David John standing over her with a 
           bag of groceries. 

           She GRABS HOLD OF HIM, sobbing. 

                                 MARCH
                             (screaming)
                        Turn it off! 

           David John smiles. 
                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Why didn’t you just ask? 

           He lifts her to her feet and kisses her softly. 

           Then, he reaches beneath her SCALP for a SHINY SILVER 
           TOUCHPAD... 

           And, all at once, 

           Her EYELIDS FLUTTER SHUT. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE (REALITY)

           March WAKES WITH A START at the table -- finds the space 
           restored to normal. The dogeared book in front of her. 

           She exhales. It was just a dream. 

           On the adjacent TV, the music video for Cher’s “If I Could 
           Turn Back Time.” David John turns from his seat on the couch. 
           Smiles placidly. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        How’d you sleep?

           A THOUGHT occurs to her. 

           She eyes her WATCH. 

           -- FUCK.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANQUET ROOM, THE RITZ - NEW YORK CITY - SAME

           A PROJECTION on the back wall reads, “ThePointIs Welcomes the 
           Board of Education.” Various TPI departments -- Math, Lit, 
           Science -- sit at dining tables sharing finger sandwiches 
           with BOARD MEMBERS. 

           AT A ‘MATH DEPARTMENT’ TABLE, 

           Dice (from the Christmas Party) chews a BOARD REP’S ear.

                                 DICE
                        This year, we’re tackling archaic 
                        nomenclature. For starters, the 
                        Pythagorean Theorem. Why not “The 
                        Triangle Rule?” 
           Rep nods his concerted agreement. 

                                 DICE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t even get me started on 
                        ‘Quadratic Reciprocity’...

           AT THE ‘CLASSIC LITERATURE’ TABLE

           Carbon hangs up her CELL, shakes her head at Hope -- no 
           answer. The seat in between them is notably EMPTY.

           Hope eyes her WATCH. Sighs. Finally STANDS. 

           AT THE FRONT OF THE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hope arrives at the podium, taps the MIC to bring the tables 
           to attention. 

                                 HOPE
                        As the director of the Classic 
                        Literature department here at 
                        ThePointIs Publishing, I believe 
                        that children are, indeed, our 
                        future. With the help of the Board, 
                        we’ve made it our mission to 
                        distill the American novel down to 
                        a length that our students can not 
                        only enjoy -- but also, tolerate. 
                        I’m proud to announce that as of 
                        last month, our publications have 
                        appeared on required reading lists 
                        in 923 of our 950 New York school 
                        districts.

           Applause from all. 

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        Of course, it is not enough to rest 
                        on our laurels. As educators, we 
                        must constantly strive to make our 
                        lessons simpler. Plainer. More 
                        palatable. As such, I am proud to 
                        announce our latest initiative: The 
                        ‘Pamph-Lit.’

           A PROJECTION springs to life behind her: in the photo, a ROW 
           OF STUDENTS read captively from a brochure-style Odyssey. 

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        At 500-words-or-less, these hyper-
                        efficient publications will 
                        revolutionize the speed at which 
                        students ingest narrative fiction.

                        One might enjoy Twain, Faulkner and 
                        Fitzgerald in a single afternoon.

           From the crowd, approving murmurs. HEADS NODDING in tandem. 

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        But perhaps the best way to 
                        demonstrate the Pamph-Lit’s 
                        potential is to read you all an 
                        excerpt from our latest project. 

           At the table, Carbon clutches a printed copy of the Orwell 
           draft -- the approved pass. Prepares to stand.

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        Here to read from the soon-to-be-
                        published ‘Pamph-Lit’ edition of 
                        George Orwell’s Animal Farm...

           Suddenly, something O.S. catches Hope’s eye. She hesitates.

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        ...Ladies and gentlemen, our lead 
                        editor, March Berger. 

           Carbon turns to discover a WINDED MARCH entering through the 
           double doors. She’s DISHEVELED, white as a sheet. Looks like 
           she just went through a cycle on PERMANENT PRESS. 

           A few other editors -- including Blush and Quid -- nudge each 
           other to attention. 

           AT THE PODIUM

           Hope shoots March a wary glance -- more CONCERN than anger. 
           She extends a copy of the edit, but March declines it: 

                                 MARCH
                             (to HOPE)
                        I’ve made some revisions. 

           March removes her WEEKEND EDIT from her pocket -- it’s 
           transcribed onto a piece of LINED NOTEBOOK PAPER. 

                                 HOPE
                             (whispering)
                        ...What is that?

           But before she can intervene, March turns to the mic. Clears 
           her throat. 

                                 MARCH
                        Animal Farm. By George Orwell. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCH (CONT'D)
                        “Mr. Jones locked the hen-houses 
                        for the night. The pigs were 
                        animals. The ducks ate rations. 
                        Pigs ate from a troth. By the 
                        autumn, almost every pig was 
                        literate.”

           March speaks earnestly. Thoughtfully. Like she may as well be 
           delivering the STATE OF THE UNION. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        “Pigs and troths. Troths, troths 
                        and pigs. Mollie said ‘Moo.’ 
                        Napoleon sang. All that year, the 
                        animals worked like slaves. A 
                        period of misunderstanding, like 
                        snow on the ground. Malignant 
                        enemies ate from a troth. Pigs ate 
                        from a troth. 
                             (beat)
                        As the animals gazed at the scene, 
                        it seemed to them that some strange 
                        thing was happening. Troths in a 
                        row, from which they ate. The 
                        creatures looked from pig to man, 
                        and from man to pig. It was 
                        impossible to say which was which.” 

           Silence. 

           ...That’s it.

           March looks up from her sheet. Her heart BEATS OUT OF HER 
           CHEST as she awaits the crowd’s applause. 

           REVERSE ANGLE ON 

           A SEA OF BLANK FACES. The Board members are statues. 
           Perplexed. For a long beat, NOBODY MOVES. Nobody speaks. 
           March’s expression clouds. 

           Finally, Carbon stands and crosses quietly to the podium. 

                                 CARBON
                             (to MARCH, whispering)
                        Maybe you should sit down. 

           March looks back to the audience -- genuinely perplexed. 

                                 MARCH
                             (into MIC)
                        That’s the end. That’s the end of 
                        the excerpt. 
           CRICKETS. 

           Carbon keeps a TIGHT SMILE as she turns to her boss.  

                                 CARBON
                             (whispering)
                        Hope. 

           But Hope’s a deer in the headlights. MORTIFIED.

                                 MARCH
                             (to CROWD)
                        Did you hear me? 
                             (to a MAN IN THE FRONT)
                        Could you hear me? 

                                 CARBON
                             (whispering)
                        They heard you, March. 

           Carbon reaches out for her shoulder. March RECOILS. Turns to 
           face her. 

                                 MARCH
                             (to CARBON)
                        You did this. 

                                 CARBON
                             (whispering)
                        You’re embarrassing yourself. 

                                 MARCH
                        Just like you hoped I would.

                                 CARBON
                        ...What?

                                 MARCH
                             (to CARBON)
                        You primed them all. 
                             (to CROWD)
                        She primed you, didn’t she? She 
                        told you all I was incompetent.

                                 CARBON
                             (whispering)
                        Sit down.

           Carbon grabs her arm -- but March brusquely SHOVES HER OFF. 
           Carbon stumbles. A collective GASP from the crowd. 
                                 MARCH
                             (to CROWD)
                        Ladies and gentlemen of the Board, 
                        what we’re dealing with here is a 
                        classic case of professional 
                        sabotage. I know this may be 
                        unpleasant to hear -- even shocking 
                        -- but the fact of the matter is 
                        that some women are incapable of 
                        supporting other women’s successes 
                        in the workplace. 

           Quid jumps to Carbon’s aid as she finds her bearings.

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)

                        And what about you, Quid? Did you 
                        help her out with this?  

                                 CARBON
                        With what?

                        return his sexual advances. 

                                 QUID

                             (to CROWD)
                        Last week, he asked me if I wanted 
                        to go “downtown” with him. 

           ALL EYES shift to Quid. 

                                 QUID
                             (to CROWD)

                             (to MARCH)
                        And I only asked you because you 
                        were standing with Blush.

           Blush looks up from her seat -- huh?

                                 QUID (CONT’D)
                             (to BLUSH, earnest)
                        If I’ve made any sexual advances, 
                        they’ve all been directed at you.

           Blush BLUSHES, in spite of herself. 
                                 MARCH
                             (to CROWD)
                        Blush envies my relationship, so 
                        she’s trying to punish me. She and 
                        Carbon have been working in cahoots 
                        together to ruin this presentation. 
                        She’s mad that my partner is 7.3% 
                        More compatible than hers... and we 
                        actually have sex. 

                                 BLUSH
                             (to CROWD, defensive)
                        I’m suffering from clitoral 
                        atrophy. 
                             (conceding)
                        ...Undiagnosed. 

           At the increasing cacophony, Hope comes to attention, as if 
           waking from a BAD DREAM. She finally steps forward.

                                 HOPE
                             (private)
                        I think you should leave, March. 

                                 MARCH
                        You think I should leave? I’m the 
                        strongest editor you have. Most of 
                        your so-called “literature buffs” 
                        haven’t read the tags on their tee 
                        shirts. I know more about books 
                        than anyone in this room. Including 
                        you. 

           Her audience is agog. FLASHBULBS from nearby cameras. 

                                 HOPE
                        You’re fired, March. Collect your 
                        things and go. 

                                 MARCH
                             (to HOPE)
                        Fine by me. I don’t need this job. 
                             (to CARBON, QUID, BLUSH)
                        I don’t need your friendship. 
                             (to ALL)
                        I don’t need any of you. I’m the 
                        most intelligent, sexy, confident 
                        woman in New York City. 
                             (rallying)
                        In fact, I’m Elizabeth Taylor! 

           With that, March BLOWS DOWN THE CENTER AISLE toward the exit. 
           HEADS TURN in unison as she passes. 
           Moments later, a MOUSY EXEC takes the podium. 

                                 MOUSY EXEC
                        Ah, thank you, ladies. Turning now 
                        to our science department...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           March rides home on the subway, visibly SHAKEN. She avoids 
           the gaze of an O.S. passenger. Finally: 

                                 MARCH
                             (”Got a problem?”)
                        ...What?

           REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS --

           -- A TODDLER gazing at her from his mother’s arms. 

           EXT. MARCH’S BLOCK - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           March barrels down the block, looks like she’s holding back 
           TEARS. In her fervor, she sidesteps the choreographed foot 
           traffic flow, runs head-on into a JUNKIE (17). 

                                 JUNKIE
                        Get your shit together, lady. 

           AT HER FRONT STOOP

           March reaches for her keys. Her HANDS ARE SHAKING. 

           INT. FOYER, MARCH’S BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, March blows down the hallway and into the 

           KITCHEN,

           Where she finds David John waiting at the table with 
           CHAMPAGNE. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Congratulations, beautiful. 

           March takes one look at him and BURSTS INTO TEARS. 

           David John stands, hugs her tightly.  
                                 DAVID JOHN(CONT’D)
                        You’re upset. 

                                 MARCH
                        It was awful... 

           David John PROCESSES. Scans his database. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Fortune favors the bold. 

                                 MARCH
                        No. It doesn’t. Fortune doesn’t 
                        favor the bold. Nobody got it. They 
                        all looked at me like I was crazy. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Nobody understood you. 

                                 MARCH
                        It was worse than that. I was 
                        fired. I’m an idiot.  

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re brilliant. 

                                 MARCH
                        No I’m not. I’m a loser.

           David John PROCESSES, recalibrates.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re a loser.

                                 MARCH
                             (bewildered)
                        What? 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        You’re a worthless human being.

           March pulls away from him, SPOOKED.

                                 MARCH
                        You’re making me upset. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        I’m sorry, March. 

                                 MARCH
                        Act normal. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        I’m sorry. 
                                 MARCH
                        Stop apologizing. 

           David John’s MOTOR WHIRS as she shuttles from one response to 
           the next. He’s OVERHEATING.

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        When God closes a door, he opens a 
                        window. 

                                 MARCH
                        Don’t say things like that. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        -- At the end of a storm comes a 
                        rainbow.

                                 MARCH
                        Stop it. 

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        If at first you don’t succeed -- 

                                 MARCH (O/L)
                        -- Stop reciting adages!

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Teach me how to please you. 

                                 MARCH
                        Shouldn’t you know by now?

                                 DAVID JOHN
                        Error code: Specify command. 

                                 MARCH
                             (snapping)
                        -- Why should I have to specify a 
                        command?! Aren’t you the perfect 
                        companion? I thought I didn’t have 
                        to try. I thought that was the 
                        point of you. Of this. If you can’t 
                        provide what I need at the moment 
                        when I need it, then WHAT DID I PAY 
                        FOR?! 

           David John PROCESSES for a long beat. When his pupils 
           retract, he regards her pensively. Tenderly. Like for once, 
           she may have ignited something REAL.

           Then:
                                 DAVID JOHN
                        ...It’s always darkest before the 
                        dawn. 

           -- WHAP! 

           March WALLOPS DAVID JOHN ACROSS THE FACE with all of her 
           might.

           The shock is ABSORBED by his frame. Does nothing. 

           Conversely, the action looks like it KNOCKS THE WIND out of 
           March. She STUMBLES BACKWARD, and -- 

           -- FHUMP. MARCH COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR like a bag of 
           bricks. Out cold. 

           Is she unconscious? ...Is she DEAD? 

           David John looks down at her quizzically -- a lifeless heap 
           on the floor. He stands at full attention, awaiting 
           instruction. A static tableau. 

           He doesn’t speak, doesn’t move. Just stands there. Waiting.

           Because, you know.

           He isn’t real. 

           THAT NIGHT

           Nothing has changed. David John still looks down at her. 
           March is still out. Like STATUES. 

           THE NEXT MORNING

           Still no motion from either party. March is almost certainly 
           dead... right?

           About TWELVE SECONDS pass in silence.

           Then, mercifully, a SOUND FROM OUTSIDE. That sound is a CAR 
           DOOR SLAMMING. 

           The sound of BOOTS CRUNCHING THROUGH SNOW. Climbing the front 
           steps. 

           Finally, the DOORBELL. 

                                 RED (O.S.)
                             (from OUTSIDE)
                        March. It’s me, Red. 
           We REMAIN IN OUR STATIC TABLEAU over the following: 

                                 RED (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (from OUTSIDE)
                        I just wanted to see if you still 
                        had those old paint swatches 
                        hanging around. If so, I’d love to 
                        borrow ‘em. 
                             (beat)
                        Your lights are on, March. I know 
                        you’re in there.
                             (beat)
                        All right. Fine. I’m not here about 
                        the paint swatches. I wanted to 
                        talk to you. I wanted to sit down 
                        and have a conversation, if you’re 
                        up for it. 

           A FLY circles March’s head, comes to rest on her NOSE. 

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                             (from OUTSIDE)
                        That’s fair. And I would feel the 
                        same way if I were you.
                             (beat)
                        Can’t we just talk for a minute? 
                        All I need is a minute. I’m sorry -- 
                        all right? I’m sorry. Is that what 
                        you want to hear? 
                             (beat)
                        Well, if that’s not what you want 
                        to hear, then I don’t know what you 
                        do want to hear. But it is getting 
                        cold out here. It’s not what I 
                        would call warm. 
                             (beat)
                        I still have a key to the house. 
                        I’m standing here with a key, 
                        trying to be a gentlemen. But, 
                        whatever you think. I guess I’ll 
                        take off now, if that’s how you 
                        really feel. 

           More BOOT CRUNCHING as Red descends the stairs again. 

           A CAR DOOR OPENING. 

           A CAR DOOR SLAMMING AGAIN. 

           ...Is he gone? 

           Another long beat. 

           A CAR DOOR OPENING.
           BOOTS CRUNCHING.

                        to talk to you. 

           A KEY in the front door.

                             (beat)
                        -- Nevermind. That was my car key. 

           Off the FRONT DOOR OPENING, we

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM, BETH ISRAEL HOSPITAL - NYC - NIGHT

           March sits in a hospital bed -- groggy, but indeed, ALIVE. 
           Her arm is connected to an IV. Red sits beside her. 

           A DOCTOR consults a CLIPBOARD as he addresses her. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hypoglycemia and dehydration are a 
                        start. You haven’t slept in seventy-
                        two hours and your blood sugar’s at 
                        sixty milligrams per deciliter. 
                             (re: RED)
                        You’re lucky he found you when he 
                        did. 

                                 RED
                        No, Doctor. I’m lucky I found her 
                        when I did. 

           Doctor -- really, bro?

                                 DOCTOR
                             (back to MARCH)
                        Some bed rest and fluids should do 
                        it. Try to avoid any stressful 
                        situations. 

           As he’s on the way out, Doctor’s gaze snags on a stat: 
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        By the way -- your mercury levels 
                        are off the charts. Are you eating 
                        a lot of fish? 

                                 MARCH
                             (bleak)
                        Salmon’s... a superfood. 

           Doctor regards her quizzically, exits. 

           Red turns to March. Takes her hand. 

                                 RED
                        “Out of our direst ailments, we 
                        shall peel back the veil of past

                        paraphrase -- not the exact

                        The point is that sometimes it 
                        takes a plummet to find out what’s 
                        really important in life. And 
                        that’s you.

                        They were spinning outward from one 
                        another at a rate that would only 
                        increase -- hurdling forth into 
                        their own private pockets of the 
                        galaxy...

           REVEAL: he’s cohabiting with a LiveToy modeled after BLUSH.
           INT. BEDROOM, CARBON’S APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           We TRUCK PAST A LINE OF TOYS sitting propped against the 
           wall. Among them -- a BRAWNY TOY, Sergio, a BLACK TOY, an 
           ASIAN TOY, a HIPSTER TOY... 

                                 CARBON (O.S.)
                        Yes -- yes -- yes -- 

                                 MARCH (V.O.)
                        ...Until finally, she mused, there 
                        would be nothing left to orbit. No 
                        gravity left to pull the planets 
                        toward each other. 

           Finally, we find Carbon in her bed, having sex with a TOY 
           that’s been MODELED AFTER HERSELF. 

                                 CARBON
                             (orgasm)
                        ...YEEEEEEESSSSSSS. 

           She collapses into the arms of her IDENTICAL PARTNER.

           EXT. PASTURE - DAYTON, OHIO - DAY 

           A cow grazes in a pasture. A low sun over middle America. 

           INT. BOOKSTORE - DAYTON, OHIO - DAY 

           March -- now brighter, notably HEALTHIER-LOOKING -- stands at 
           a podium, finishes reading an excerpt from her new FULL-
           LENGTH BOOK. 

           Beside her, a poster reads, “Celestial Bodies: A Novel by 
           March Berger.” 

                                 MARCH 
                        ...And on that day, she would look 
                        out over the quiet Manhattan 
                        skyline, and wonder where all of 
                        them had gone. 

           She closes the book to APPLAUSE.

           REVERSE ANGLE

           A small crowd has gathered for the reading. Among them, 
           March’s parents, Dell, and Regis (still in his headset).
           EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAYTON, OHIO - DAY 

           March is the last to leave, waves goodbye to a YOUNG COUPLE 
           as they head for the parking lot. 

                                 GOZ (O.S.)
                        Any chance I can get an autograph? 

           March turns to discover GOZ PEERMAN holding a copy of her 
           book. He’s literally CHEWING A PIECE OF STRAW.

                                 MARCH
                        ...Goz? 

                                 GOZ
                        I brought my own pen, but I’m gonna 
                        want it back. 

           March grins. 

                                 MARCH
                        What are you doing back in town? 

                                 GOZ
                        I live here. Peerman & Son is now 
                        Peerman & Sons. 

                                 MARCH
                        Since when? 

                                 GOZ
                             (shrugs)
                        Around the same time some girl 
                        called me a pussy. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yeah? 

                                 GOZ
                        In case you’re wondering, the date 
                        was pretty much downhill from 
                        there. 

           March laughs. Grimaces. 

                                 MARCH
                        Yeah. 

                                 GOZ
                        Yeah. 

           A beat. 
                                 GOZ (CONT’D)
                        Still waiting on that signature, 
                        though. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh -- right! Yes. 

           She takes his book, SIGNS IT. 

                                 GOZ
                        How long are you around for? 

                                 MARCH
                        I’m not sure yet. Probably as long 
                        as I can tolerate my parents. 

                                 GOZ
                        Fair enough. Well, maybe I’ll see 
                        you around. 
                             (re: BOOK, joke)
                        Decent stuff. B+.

           He smiles, turns toward the parking lot. 

           March hesitates a moment, then: 

                                 MARCH
                        Hey, Goz. 

           He turns. 

                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                        Would you maybe want to get a cup 
                        of coffee? 

                                 GOZ
                        I’m not much of a coffee drinker. 

                                 MARCH
                        Oh... alright. 

                                 GOZ
                             (pointing)
                        ...But that place does a great 
                        burger. 

           March smiles. Shithead.

                                 MARCH
                        Burgers are good. 

           The pair cross the street. 
                                 MARCH (CONT’D)
                             (re: STRAW)
                        So tell me, did you pluck that just 
                        for the occasion? 

                                 GOZ
                        You don’t like it? Women find it 
                        very sexy. 

                                 MARCH
                        Do they? 

           FROM THE SIDEWALK

           We watch as March and Goz enter the restaurant.

           Soon after, they’re sat at a table by the WINDOW. 

           For a few beats, we watch them laugh, chat. Though we can’t 
           hear their conversation, it’s clear they’re rekindling a 
           SPARK.

           Finally, we -- 

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAYTON, OHIO - DAY 

           -- JUMP OUR LINE into the restaurant, where we’re flooded 
           with the AMBIENT SOUND of other diners. 

           In WIDE, we may recognize SEVERAL FAMILIAR LIVETOY MODELS 
           dining at the restaurant -- several of which resemble 
           iterations of DAVID JOHN. 

           We may also notice that our soundscape is DOMINATED BY THE 
           OVERLAPPING CHATTER OF ARTIFICIAL VOICES. 

           These voices begin to SWELL,

           Until finally, we...

                                                         SNAP TO BLACK.

                                         THE END.
