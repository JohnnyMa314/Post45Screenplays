           A PIECE OF ART

           A fantastical PAINTING of a FURRY BEAST being created before 
           our eyes. 

           Brilliant hues SPLATTER on the canvas.

           Its subject familiar and comforting, but radical all at once. 

           The work of a madman or genius? 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The souls of artists contain 
                        multitudes of contradictions. But art 
                        is truth, and telling it is the job of 
                        an artist.

           Our NARRATOR’s voice is booming and proud -- a trustworthy 
           authority.

           EXT. REYERSBACH HOUSE - DAY (1897)

           An enormous, traditional German HALF-TIMBERED HOUSE with 
           ornate landscaping. May as well be called a palace.

                               SUPER: Hamburg, Germany, 1897

           INT. NURSERY - DAY 

           A TODDLER (2) -- PAINTBRUSH in each hand -- wobbles at a 
           kid’s EASEL. He PAINTS the big, furry DOG at his side. 

           The brushes DRIP and SPLASH with BRIGHTLY COLORED PAINT. The 
           BARKING dog’s fur splotched into a rainbow.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The trouble is that the best artists 
                        have the most complicated souls. Hans 
                        Reyersbach was one of those types.

           This is HANS REYERSBACH, painter of family dogs and other 
           famous animals. His eyes alight with MISCHIEF, seraphic 
           ringlets of dark hair bouncing around his impish face.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Time for breakfast, Hans!

           His mother, SARAH (early 30s) -- a tender soul -- enters. 
           She’s not surprised by the MESS that greets her.

           But Hans isn’t ready to finish painting. As Sarah bends down 
           to pick him up -- 

           Hans DARTS out the room. The paint-covered dog gives CHASE.
           INT. NOOK - CONTINUOUS

           Hans’ father ABRAHAM (40) -- a STERN businessman with the 
           sense of humor Germans are famous for, blessed with a 
           DISTINCTIVE, SHARPLY POINTED NOSE -- uses a HOT IRON to press 
           the sleeve of the suit he’s wearing.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Abraham, come help me with Hans!

           Abraham grunts and marches out to discover today’s trouble. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - REYERSBACH HOUSE - DAY 

           A cavernous, wood-paneled room with a table for twenty. A 
           gilded MENORAH proudly displayed under a framed GERMAN FLAG.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hans was born into a Jewish family 
                        that just wanted to be known as 
                        upstanding German patriots.

           BARK! BARK! The DOG bursts in the far end -- fur DRIPPING and 
           SPLASHING with TECHNICOLOR PAINT.

           Hans bounds APE-LIKE -- now CHASING the dog. In each hand he 
           still carries a WET BRUSH that stains the decor as he runs.

           Sarah lovingly pursues him -- an enjoyable struggle.

                                 SARAH
                        Get over here you little monkey!

           But Hans outpaces her -- still after the barking dog -- paint 
           splattering here and there. DODGING antique furniture, he 
           knocks a STATUE off an ornate wooden server. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He wasn’t much like his parents, 
                        though. Having been -- as they say -- 
                        touched by the gods at birth. 

           SMASH. The statue BREAKS into several parts. CLOSE ON what 
           once was a beautiful bust of DIONYSUS, god of madness. 

           Abraham stomps in from where Hans and the dog are headed. 

           The dog runs past Abraham before he can get his bearings, 
           SMEARING his black pant leg with colorful paint.

           Abraham eyes Hans -- toddling toward him in a SPRINT -- then 
           glances to Sarah. Frustrated with the wild boy. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Abraham and Sarah just wanted the best 
                        for their son.

           Sarah, her shirt alive with Hans’ colorful paint flecks, 
           halts her pursuit and shrugs. This is who Hans is.

           Abraham bends to swoop up Hans. But Hans JUKES and AVOIDS his 
           father’s grasp.

           As Hans is about to escape, his foot TRIPS on a chair’s leg --

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Things never quite worked out that 
                        easily, though.

           SLAM. Hans TOPPLES over. Brushes go flying. PAINT EVERYWHERE. 
           Hans SHRIEKS and CRIES.

           INT. HANS’ NURSERY - NIGHT (1898)

           Hans (3) -- ENERGETIC -- bounces around his crib. Abraham -- 
           wearing silk PAJAMAS and smoking a PIPE -- enters.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Settle now, son.

           Abraham, puffing his pipe, pats the top of Hans’ head to get 
           him to relax. Hans settles. But LOCKS HIS GAZE on Abraham. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        One gift all artists have is observation.

           Hans stares at his dad, FASCINATED by the pipe.

           INT. ABRAHAM’S STUDY - [ANOTHER] NIGHT 

           Hans has managed to put on a pair of his father’s silk 
           pajamas. Swimming in them, he toddles to a large green 
           armchair with a table beside it. 

           Hans climbs up onto the chair. Pajamas everywhere, Hans 
           reaches for the wooden box. He OPENS it, exposing --

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Which Hans had in spades, along with 
                        an endless curiosity. Neither of which 
                        his parents had the foresight to 
                        appreciate. 

           His father’s PIPE and TOBACCO.
           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans proudly PUFFS his father’s pipe. Abraham -- wearing 
           identical pajamas to his son -- BURSTS IN.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Hans! What are you doing?

           Hans puffs the pipe again. But this time, he can’t handle it. 
           He starts COUGHING MADLY and THROWS the pipe on the floor.

           Abraham runs to Hans, picks him up, and pats his back. But --

           The pipe catches the rug on FIRE. Abraham notices and panics. 

           Holding Hans awkwardly away from the fire, Abraham STOMPS it 
           out. Hans SLITHERS DOWN Abraham’s body and ESCAPES the room.

           EXT. CENTRAL VISTA - HAMBURG ZOO - DAY (1901)

           Hans (6) walks hand-in-hand with his mom at the zoo. He’s 
           ENTHRALLED -- in love with the creatures around him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Wild animals were to whom Hans related 
                        best.

           He takes in the GIRAFFES, an enormous ELEPHANT, and makes eye 
           contact with a little MONKEY swinging about in a cage nearby. 

                                 SARAH
                        The animals are neat, right? 

           Hans -- TRANSFIXED on the monkey -- doesn’t acknowledge her. 

           HARUMPHHH! The snort of an ELEPHANT catches Hans’ attention --

           The huge pachyderm lies down for a nap in some hay.

           Sarah tugs at the transfixed Hans’ hand. Time to move on.

           EXT. ICE CREAM CART - HAMBURG ZOO - MOMENTS LATER

           Hans and Sarah -- holding hands -- wait in line. As she lets 
           go of Hans’ hand to grab two cones --

           Hans RUNS AWAY before she notices. She turns to look at him -- 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He hated missing an opportunity to 
                        spend time with them.

                                 SARAH
                        Hans?
           But he’s gone...

           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans bounds around the other side of the zoo. He spots a 
           UNIFORMED ZOOKEEPER pushing a wheelbarrow of dung. A KEY 
           dangles from his belt.

           Hans runs to the dung pusher and RIPS OFF his key. The 
           zookeeper doesn’t notice as Hans scampers off.

           NEARBY - CONTINUOUS

           Sarah stands on a bench CRYING and looking for Hans. The ice 
           cream cones melt tragically down her hands.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sarah sits on the bench WHIMPERING as --

           UNIFORMED ZOOKEEPERS carry out a search and rescue operation. 
           They’re oddly efficient, like a military unit:

           -Checking under benches and in trash cans.
           -Swimming with goggles amongst penguins.
           -Inspecting the inside of a hippo’s mouth.

           EXT. ELEPHANT CAGE - HAMBURG ZOO - SUNSET

           A zookeeper leads Sarah, frazzled, and Abraham, unfazed, into 
           the large elephant enclosure. They look ahead to see --

           Hans CUDDLED under an elephant’s ear like a blanket. Boy and 
           elephant together are UNDENIABLY ADORABLE.

                                 DUNG PUSHER ZOOKEEPER
                        Found him here while I was shoveling.

           His father, unmoved by the cuteness, hoists up Hans.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But Hans’ interest in animals was just 
                        one in a long list of hobbies Abraham 
                        didn’t like very much.

           EXT. REYERSBACH HOUSE - DAY (1902)

           Abraham, crowbar in hand, and Sarah, excited, show off a BIG 
           WOODEN CRATE to Hans (7). Hans -- on tiptoes -- tries to 
           glimpse what’s inside as Abraham jimmies off the top.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Try as they might, though, Abraham and 
                        Sarah couldn’t help themselves from 
                        spoiling the boy.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans’ father holds a shiny new BICYCLE in place. Wants to 
           teach his son to ride. But -- stealing the moment from 
           Abraham -- Hans HOPS ON, WOBBLES a bit, then PEDALS AWAY like 
           he’s in the Tour de France.

           Abraham puts his hands on his hips, ASTONISHED by his son.

           INT. HANS BEDROOM - REYERSBACH HOUSE - SUNSET

           Abraham paces with a TEXTBOOK in hand. Hans’ colorful 
           DRAWINGS cover the wall. Abraham yells out the window --

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Come do your work, son!

           EXT. REYERSBACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Hans does tricks on his bike: Riding with NO HANDS. POPPING 
           WHEELIES. SPINNING CIRCLES ON THE SEAT.

           HANS’ BEDROOM

           Abraham gives up -- SLAMS the textbook on the floor.

           OUTSIDE

           Hans -- RIDING UPSIDE-DOWN -- takes a VICIOUS SPILL. Sarah -- 
           horrified -- runs to his aid.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But the painful lessons he mastered on 
                        that contraption would serve him well 
                        one day.

           CLOSE ON HANS: He rubs his smarting head, but GRINS broadly. 
           ADDICTED to the thrill -- a regular adrenaline junkie.

           INT. WALDSTEIN HOUSE - DAY

           A BABY (6 months) with a full head of STUNNING RED HAIR and 
           SUPERNATURALLY GREEN EYES walks across a room by herself. 
           She’s deliberate with each step but STAGGERINGLY DETERMINED.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Around the same time Hans fell in love 
                        with bicycles -- just a few blocks away 
                        from the Reyersbach’s house -- a baby 
                        girl taught herself to walk six months 
                        before the doctors said it should have 
                        been possible. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sit down, Margret! Little girls aren’t 
                        supposed to wander around on their own!

           This is MARGRET WALDSTEIN. She ignores her mom and KEEPS ON 
           WALKING straight ahead with a REMARKABLE FOCUS.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Margret Waldstein wasn’t touched by 
                        any gods. But she may have been the 
                        most disciplined, determined baby in 
                        Germany’s history. And that’s saying 
                        something. 

           INT. VARIOUS CLASSROOMS (1903-1908) 

           DETENTION. Hans sits alone in a classroom wearing a 
           “DUMMKOPF” (dunce) hat. And, of course, he’s DRAWING.

           FADE THROUGH THE YEARS OF HANS GROWING UP:

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        School never was for Hans. But he made 
                        the most of his time there training 
                        for his future career.

           In every shot, Hans gets a little older. And his drawings -- 
           CARTOONS OF TEACHERS DRAWN AS ANIMALS -- get a little better. 

           INT. ABRAHAM’S WIDGET FACTORY - DAY 

           A spotless marvel of German engineering. BELTS move 
           countless, sparkling WIDGETS in every direction. WORKERS in 
           white jump suits buzz around. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Abraham led his business to wild success.

           Abraham inspects a widget up to his eye like a diamond. A 
           FACTORY WORKER (40s) rushes to him.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Herr Reyersbach, the new shipment of 
                        widgets just arrived from Rio de 
                        Janeiro. What should we do?
           Abraham spins around to answer him. But before he can give 
           direction, he SPOTS --

           HANS

           Has his FEET KICKED UP on Abraham’s meticulously neat desk. 
           ASLEEP in his stately chair. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But grew blind to his son’s genius. 

           ABRAHAM 

           Smoke practically blowing out his ears, marches to his son.

                                 ABRAHAM (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m not mad.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was worse.

           INT. HANS BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Hans sits calmly. His mother, next to him, cries in shame. 
           Abraham, holding a bad REPORT CARD, paces angrily.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’m disappointed!

           EXT. STREET - HANS’ NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (1910)

           Hans (15) rides a BIKE with no hands as he wheels a HELIUM 
           TANK and carries a satchel full of BALLOONS. His parents walk 
           ahead of him. Sarah carries a wrapped present.

           Hans is different now. Older. Shaggy hair. Sharper features 
           becoming handsome. The beginning of flirtiness in his eyes.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Don’t embarrass me, Hans. The 
                        Waldsteins are important contacts.

           Hans rolls his eyes. 

           EXT. FRONT YARD - WALDSTEINS’ HOUSE - DAY

           A girl’s garden birthday party. Kids, parents, and too much 
           pink decoration. MR. AND MRS. WALDSTEIN (40s) host proudly.

           Hans stands away from the crowd, across the yard, making 
           animal balloons with amazing SPEED and DEXTERITY.
           ACROSS THE YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Hans stands next to a MENAGERIE OF LIFE-SIZED BALLOON 
           ANIMALS: an ELEPHANT with tusks, a black and white ZEBRA, a 
           leaping LION.

           PARTY

           The birthday girl, Margret -- now 9 with PIERCINGLY SMART 
           EYES -- stands near her ornate cake, candles already lit. The 
           partygoers sing Happy Birthday.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Margret, little girl as she may have 
                        been, was never blind to Hans’ 
                        prodigious talents.

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN 
                        Make a wish, Margret!

           She turns away from the crowd. Infatuated with something. Her 
           eyes have LOCKED on -- 

           HANS

           Who’s already tied hundreds of inflated balloons to his arm.

           The WIND GUSTS as Hans inflates yet another balloon. It BLOWS 
           the untied balloon out of Hans’ hands, and --

           Hans is LIFTED UP off the ground a few inches by the dozens 
           of balloons attached to him. 

           But instead of fear, THRILL on his face, as he FLOATS.

           MARGRET

           As the blown-away balloon peters out at her feet, she decides 
           she must do something to save Hans. 

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN
                        Blow out the candles. Now, Margret!

           But Margret IGNORES HER and SPRINTS across the yard to Hans, 
           who’s now a few feet off the ground. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I guess she saw something worth saving 
                        in Hans.

           Margret -- all four-foot-nothing of her -- LAUNCHES herself 
           toward Hans feet and hangs on with everything she’s got. 

           EYES LOCKED -- they DESCEND to the ground together.
           MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham, furious, and Margret’s mother, in tears, stand over 
           the two kids. Balloons knock about everywhere.

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN
                        You’ve ruined this birthday party!

           Abraham CLAPS a balloon in front of his face. It POPS.

           Hans laughs off the situation. He hands Margret the string to 
           a balloon. She clutches it like she’ll never let go. 

                                 HANS
                        I get carried away sometimes.

           Hans and Margret interact like they’re in THEIR OWN WORLD. 

                                 MARGRET
                        I can tell. 

           They keep their eyes locked on each other -- a moment of 
           metaphysical magic. 

           OFF a STRAY BALLOON FLOATING heavenwards, we CUT TO:

           INT. ART GALLERY - DAY (1913)

           An art exhibition for students. JUDGES (50s) make the rounds.

           Hans, 18 and a regular HUNK now, stands in front of a WALL-
           SIZED PAINTING covered with a cloth. Abraham and Sarah stand 
           across from him.

           Hans rips away the cloth to REVEAL --

           A giant FRESCO alive with color and energy.

           The faces of the other competitors and judges WHIP to see --

           The scene of Hans getting LOST AT THE ZOO as a small child. 
           Larger than life animals frolicking about. The ice cream 
           cart. And uniformed zookeepers hurrying like soldiers. 

           Everyone’s JAWS HANG SLACK at Hans' creation. More than a few 
           TEENAGED GIRLS’ faces belie their crushes on Hans, too.

                                 TEENAGED GIRL ARTIST
                        Fetching piece of work.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        By the time he graduated high school, 
                        any idiot could recognize Hans’ 
                        artistic gifts.
           A judge puts a wreath on Hans’ head. He beams. Sarah tears 
           up. Abraham, arms crossed, still has his doubts...

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Not terrible, son.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY (1914)

           Hans and Abraham eat at opposite sides of the huge table. 
           Hans flips through NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. Abraham, chomping on 
           dry toast, reads a NEWSPAPER. The top headline reads:

                     FRANZ FERDINAND ASSASSINATED! ALL OF EUROPE AT WAR!

           Hans looks up at Abraham. But makes nothing of the headline. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But before he could continue his art 
                        education, the world went and did 
                        something inexplicably stupid.

                                 HANS
                        Dad, you know how you're always saying 
                        I need to think about my future?

           Abraham lowers the newspaper. This is music to his ears.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I know you think university is best.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Glad you see it my way now.

                                 HANS
                        Well... I don't even really want to go 
                        to art school anymore. I think I 
                        should just move straight to Paris. 
                        Learn from the best and paint 
                        professionally. 

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Paris?!? While we’re at war?

           Abraham holds up the newspaper. Points at the cover story.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        A great world war has broken out. This 
                        will be the war to end all wars!

           The news smacks Hans like a sack of bricks.

                                 HANS
                        I mean, art school still is an option.
                                 ABRAHAM
                        Certainly not! There's no time for 
                        frivolities like art anymore. 

           Hans sulks. A nightmare scenario for him.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Serving this country will be the 
                        opportunity of a lifetime for you, son! 

                                 HANS
                        Don’t hold your breath.

           OFF Hans’ REBELLIOUS glare, we CUT TO:

           EXT. ARMY BASE - DAY

           BASIC TRAINING. Hans -- in UNIFORM with a SPIKY HELMET -- 
           scuttles forward and practices BAYONETING the enemy. The 
           other soldiers thrust their blades passionately. But Hans is 
           just GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

           EXT. TRENCHES - EASTERN FRONT - DAY

           WAR! Packed, filthy trenches. Bullets buzzing overhead. 
           Mortars exploding. Smoke wafting about everywhere.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hans was sent to the Eastern Front. 
                        Mercifully for all, he was allowed to 
                        serve as a medic. 

           Hans -- wearing the RED CROSS symbol of a medic -- cowers in 
           the packed trench. A nearby OFFICER calls out --

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Advance, infantry, advance!

           Hundreds of spiky-helmeted German soldiers hop up, run out of 
           the trench, and attack.

           CLOSE ON HANS

           TIME SLOWS. AGONY on Hans’ face: Fear. Anger. Helplessness.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Gas masks! Put on your gas masks!

           Hans -- TREMBLING -- barely manages to attach his mask before 
           thick smoke consumes him.
           EXT. TRENCHES - EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

           The stars shine brilliantly, which feels like a miracle in 
           this war-torn world. Hans lies on his back, holding a 
           notebook above his face. He draws -- lost in his art. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        On some nights, Hans could make the 
                        war go away. 

           CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK

           A GIRAFFE in a German army helmet, neck outstretched from a 
           trench. It’s scared and helpless like the other soldiers. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        During those fleeting moments between 
                        mortars and gas, Hans kept sane by 
                        reflecting upon the wonder of nature 
                        and crafting his own separate reality.

           Hans TEARS OUT the sketch and tucks it in a pile of his work. 
           But this one is caught by a GUST OF WIND. FLOATING AWAY...

           NEARBY IN THE TRENCH

           The sketch LANDS in the lap of a SOLDIER (19) who can’t 
           sleep. He looks at it and SMILES. A brief moment of joy.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           The madness of a RAGING BATTLE. Hell on earth. Hans, tears in 
           eyes, races to a WOUNDED SOLDIER. Falls to his knees to help 
           his comrade. Hans looks in his TERRIFIED EYES with mercy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Problem was, Hans’ art couldn’t stop 
                        the war.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (1918)

           A grey, dreary day. German soldiers TRUDGE home in DEFEAT. 
           Hans, gaunt and melancholy, doodles on scrap paper.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Eventually World War One came to an end. 
                        The countries who fought hadn’t learned 
                        a damn thing. Not much had changed, 
                        really, except Germany was in ruins.

           He notices an ORPHAN GIRL (5), blond and in pigtails, looking 
           over the soldiers. She’s wearing a tattered old dress and the 
           foulness of war, but maintains her INNOCENCE.
                                 ORPHAN GIRL
                              (YELLING OVER TEARS) 
                        Papa? Have you seen my papa?

           The girl’s eyes find Hans’ and fix on him. 

           Hans pushes past the other soldiers and beelines to the girl, 
           holding sympathetic eye contact as he approaches.

                                 ORPHAN GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know my papa?

                                 HANS
                              (SWEETLY)
                        I do not.

                                 ORPHAN GIRL
                        Will I be all right?

           Hans nods yes. But it doesn’t help. She BURSTS INTO TEARS.

                                 HANS
                        Let me give you something. 

           Hans reaches into a pocket of his uniform. He pulls out a 
           stained piece of SCRAP PAPER and a NUB OF CHARCOAL.

           He sketches a picture of a FLYING BIRD WITH THE GENTLE 
           FEATURES OF THE GIRL. The bird -- tired but determined -- 
           soars toward a big hill.

           The girl is CAPTIVATED as Hans draws. He writes in his 
           instantly recognizable script:

                  THE OBSTACLE IS YOUR PATH. YOU’LL GET TO THE OTHER SIDE.

           Hans closes her hands around the top corners of the drawing. 
           He WHISPERS something inaudible to her as she cries.

           The girl SMILES at him. Her first moment of HEALING.

           INT. REYERSBACH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Hans’ parents -- AGED AND WEARY -- open the door. Hans 
           enters. Sarah -- prayers realized -- hugs him.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, Hans!

           She squeezes him tight, burying her head on his shoulder. 
           Hans doesn’t know what to do. He pats her back uncomfortably. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The trauma of battle had only further 
                        complicated Hans’ soul. 

           Abraham -- the pain of missing his son written on his face -- 
           wants to say something kind but doesn’t have the words. Their 
           eyes meet -- but both look away from the other quickly. 

           INT. HANS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It POURS outside. Hans, in bed, can’t sleep. A strike of 
           LIGHTNING and a clap of THUNDER. Hans CLENCHES his body as if 
           preparing for an incoming mortar.

           INT. HANS’ BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s still raining. Hans sits at his childhood desk. An empty 
           piece of paper and colored pencils in front of him. But 
           nothing’s coming. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hamburg no longer felt like home. And 
                        the gods had lost touch with Hans.

           Abraham ENTERS the room carrying a plate of potato pancakes. 

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Maybe you can start work tomorrow?

           He puts the plate down next to Hans. He points at the food, 
           as if to say, Eat it. They’re good for you. Hans demurs. 

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Time to get on with life. Grow up!

           Hans angrily CRINKLES up his empty page as Abraham exits.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Margret -- now eighteen and self-assured, all woman and no 
           girl -- her parents standing behind her, sits across from her 
           caring, concerned PRINCIPAL (50s).

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hans had lost reason to believe in the 
                        power of art. But one young artist 
                        still had faith.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Margret, you’re the smartest kid in 
                        the class. And the hardest-working! 
                        Why in the world would you want to go 
                        to... art school?
                                 MARGRET
                        I’m an artist. And nothing will hold 
                        me back from telling the truth.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Your grades are perfect. But look...

           He holds up a PAINTING of hers. An almost GROTESQUE PORTRAIT 
           of her parents, who can’t disguise their contempt for it.

                                 MARGRET
                        That’s why I need to go to the best 
                        art school. Where I’ll outwork 
                        everyone else. And learn.

                                 MR. WALDSTEIN
                        Listen to the man. Don’t make the 
                        foolish choice. You could be a doctor!

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Or an engineer!

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN 
                        Or a nice man’s wife!

           Margret GROANS and throws her hands in the air.

           INT. STAGE AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Margret receives her diploma from the principal.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        When Margret was determined, she 
                        always got her way.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                              (DISAPPOINTED)
                        Congratulations to our valedictorian, 
                        Margret Waldstein. Who’s throwing away 
                        so many other great opportunities to...

           INT. BAUHAUS INSTITUTE - DAY

           STUDENTS, including Margret, paint at easels, copying an 
           Impressionist painting. The PROFESSOR (50) lectures.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ... Attend the famous Bauhaus Institute. 
                        Pride of the German art world.

                                 ART PROFESSOR
                        You need a subjective lens that 
                        transforms quotidian nature into a 
                        refracted miracle!
           Margret paints more intensely than any of her classmates.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The professor stands over Margret’s easel. REVEAL her 
           painting. A few lifeless apples. Nothing like the example.

                                 ART PROFESSOR
                        I’m missing the miracle, Miss Waldstein.

                                 MARGRET
                        I can work harder, Professor!

           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           Hans enters and looks around. EMPTY. The machinery MOTIONLESS 
           -- COBWEBS gathering. Messy PILES OF WIDGETS all around. 

           INT. ABRAHAM’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Hans slowly opens the door to see his once-proud father 
           hunched over next to an open VAULT. Abraham piles STACKS OF 
           CASH in a wheelbarrow.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’m so happy you’re here.

           Abraham sees Hans is not happy.

                                 HANS
                        Where is everyone?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        The men were at the front. And, many 
                        of them were... You understand...

           He trails off. Hans nods -- understanding all too well.

                                 HANS
                        What are you doing with all that money?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        It’s worthless now. Inflation. The 
                        whole economy’s shot. 
                              (BEAT)
                        This is all to buy a few boxes of new 
                        widgets at the docks.

           The severity of the situation registers with Hans.
           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Hans sits by a STACK of dusty widgets piled over his head. He 
           pulls out tiny piece by tiny piece. Dropping each one into an 
           appropriate container. Mind-numbing work.

           Hans’ attention strays. He notices some OLD WOODEN CRATES.

           They read: BRAZIL’S FINEST WIDGETS

           We see what Hans DAYDREAMS --

           COLORFUL DRAWINGS -- in Hans’ style -- come to life all over 
           the crates. 

           First verdant JUNGLE. Then a WAVE-FILLED OCEAN. Now WILD 
           CREATURES -- birds, reptiles, and monkeys -- prance around 
           the imaginary landscape. Their CRIES RING OUT as the LITTLE 
           ORPHAN GIRL frolics happily with them.

           ON HANS: DELIGHTED in his make-believe world. 

           INT. LECTURE HALL - BAUHAUS - DAY

           CLOSE ON Margret, taking notes intently. Slowly PULL OUT TO 
           REVEAL she’s the ONLY FEMALE in a sea of male faces.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Margret was never completely 
                        comfortable at the Bauhaus.

           EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - ZOO - DAY

           Hans -- desperate German citizens in the midst of the Great 
           Depression walking past him -- tries to catch a glimpse of 
           his old friends.

           But the zoo is CLOSED. All the cages empty. Hans can’t hide 
           his disenchantment. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Life after the war was a never-ending 
                        series of disappointments. 

           INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

           Hans leans dejectedly against a pile of widgets as he 
           organizes them. Abraham pushes another wheelbarrow of money.

                                 HANS
                        Going to buy more widgets?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Son, this is for groceries.
           Hans can’t hide his alarm. Abraham shrugs.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        How’s the counting and organizing?

           Hans drops the widgets he’s holding. 

                                 HANS
                        Dad, I know you’ve built this company 
                        from nothing just for me. And I know 
                        you’ve always hoped for us to work 
                        together. But this isn’t my dream.

           Abraham sets down the wheelbarrow. Pauses -- REFLECTIVE.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’ve never told me your dream.

                                 HANS
                        It’s hard to... put into words.

           Abraham shrugs and begins to hoist the wheelbarrow again.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t fit in here anymore, if I ever 
                        did in the first place.

           Abraham really thinks over Hans’ comment.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I understand.

                                 HANS
                        You do?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I worked hard so that you could be 
                        happy one day. It pains me when you 
                        find yourself in trouble. I want to 
                        see you grow up so that doesn’t happen 
                        anymore.

                                 HANS
                        Dad, I am grown up.

           Abraham shakes his head no. Hans knows he’s right.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        The things people respect in Germany -- 
                        soldiers, efficiency, business -- 
                        they’ll never be for me. This is your 
                        home. Not mine.

           Abraham nods sympathetically.
                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I had an idea. I know you used to 
                        import widgets from Brazil.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You want to be a widget exporter?

                                 HANS
                        No, dad. I want to move to Brazil. I 
                        need to leave what I’ve been through 
                        behind. So I can become myself again. 
                              (BEAT TO LET IT SINK IN)
                        Will you set me up with your contact 
                        in Rio?

           ON ABRAHAM: The pain of saying yes to losing his son coming 
           through.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Abraham had always wanted what was 
                        best for his son... So he did.

           EXT. SHIP - HARBOR - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY (1920)

           The rickety ship makes its way past the ICONIC ISLANDS in 
           Rio’s bay. A new world ALIVE with verdant greens and marine 
           blues. HOOTS of tropical animals and birds ring out. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That boat was as nasty as anything 
                        that’s ever crossed the Atlantic. But 
                        Hans realized it was carrying him to 
                        freedom. Which, more than anything, is 
                        what artists need.

           Hans -- sun-kissed and healthy -- stands on the deck. ALIVE 
           AGAIN. A moment of rebirth. He peers towards the horizon --

           WHITE SAND BEACHES ahead. FORESTED MOUNTAINS in the distance. 

           EXT. COPACABANA BEACH - DAY

           Hans, all his worldly possessions in a simple RUCKSACK, 
           strolls the famous beach. Its white sand polka-dotted with 
           COLORFUL UMBRELLAS and lithe, tanned bodies.

           Hans has changed. His hair longer. Sex appeal evident. A 
           young Serge Gainsbourg -- artist, bohemian, free-spirit.

           Hans feels a brush against his feet and looks down—

           HATCHLING SEA TURTLES crawling over his feet to the sea.

           Now something else catches Hans’ attention. His eyes widen --
           BIKINI-CLAD BRAZILIAN GIRLS laugh at water’s edge.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Rio de Janeiro sure did suit Hans.

           Hans GRINS in their direction. They call him over.

           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET 

           Hans paints an ELDERLY VACATIONER (60s) at an easel set up on 
           the beach. Some of his finished work propped up around him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And he even started making a little 
                        money from painting.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           A BONFIRE PARTY. Flames bouncing up to the sky. Youths party. 
           A band plays steel drums.

           Hans DANCES wildly. Lost in the ecstasy of a foreign land.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Hans, rucksack on his back, rides a rusty old BIKE down the 
           empty beach alone. He sips at a bottle of BEER.

           A LITTLE LATER

           Hans SLEEPS on the sand. His rucksack, bike, and a few EMPTY 
           BOTTLES OF BEER by his side. Hans tosses and turns as a COLD 
           WIND whips up the sand on the beach.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But all that new liberty was a bit too 
                        much for a young man used to the 
                        discipline of Germany.

           INT. GALLERY - BAUHAUS - DAY

           A stark white room. Margret, twenty-two now, and her 
           classmates show off their FINAL PROJECTS. A group of MALE ART 
           PROFESSORS make their way to Margret's --

           A moody PHOTOGRAPH of a small, elegant house surrounded by 
           towering but ugly edifices. Simple but insightful. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile -- as Hans was learning the 
                        ways of the world -- Margret battled 
                        through the slings and arrows of art 
                        school.
           The professors trade judgmental glances. Finally one HISSES --

                                 NASALLY ART PROFESSOR
                        A photograph? No art will ever be 
                        expressed in this medium!

                                 CHUBBY ART PROFESSOR
                        Miss Waldstein, it’s obvious your life 
                        experiences don’t amount to much. 

           Margret looks away. The words WOUND. 

                                 SKINNY ART PROFESSOR
                        Technically proficient. But too womanly.

           And now the KNIFE GOES DEEPER.

                                 NASALLY ART PROFESSOR
                        It’s clear you don’t have the masculine 
                        strength needed to be an artist.

           The professors SNEER condescendingly. Margret stews.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Hans, in a shabby suit, travels through the jungle. A second-
           hand leather briefcase on his lap. It POURS RAIN outside. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hans was at a dead end. So he visited his 
                        dad’s contact to get a real job. 

           EXT. SHANTY - JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY

           Still POURING. Hans shows off a TOILET SEAT to a VILLAGER 
           LADY(40s). She doesn’t care. Shoves him off her stoop.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He was about as good a traveling 
                        toilet salesman as you might expect.

           INT. CANTINA - JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY

           Hans sits ALONE at the bar. He motions for one more.

           EXT. RIVERBOAT - JUNGLE - DAY

           Hans -- shirt opened, lounging on the deck of a riverboat -- 
           takes in the sun and sights of the jungle. 

           Something in the green CANOPY above Hans’ head catches his 
           eye. He lifts his stylish sunglasses to take a closer look.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But that job introduced him to the 
                        most important business contact he’d 
                        ever have.

           A little brown MONKEY swings bravely through the uppermost 
           branches of the trees. 

           This particular fellow seems MORE ALIVE, MORE GRACEFUL than 
           the other monkeys in the trees. 

           Something ICONIC and RECOGNIZABLE about him. He’s TINY in 
           size. His face CHILDLIKE with glee.

           Hans giggles at the monkey, who now --

           SOMERSAULTS downwards. Barely catching branches here and 
           there. FLINGING HIMSELF ABOUT, unworried about gravity.

           The monkey SPOTS something and makes a BRASH DECISION --

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I suppose I reminded Hans of himself.

           He JUMPS down, CATCHES a vine with one hand, and SWINGS 
           himself over the width of the river.

           Hans holds his breath and tracks the little monkey overhead. 

           THWAP! The monkey GRABS A BRANCH with two hands overhead, 
           like a graceful gymnast. Hans finally exhales.

           The monkey EYES directly below himself at a BIG RED SLOTH 
           barely budging a ripe BANANA toward its mouth. 

           The monkey uses one of his prehensile feet to SNATCH the 
           banana from the sloth’s grasp before the sloth has processed 
           what’s happened.

           Hans CRACKS UP at the monkey’s cheekiness.

           Banana in foot, the monkey dismounts the branch and hurls 
           himself toward the riverboat.

           Hans is still CAPTIVATED. But REALIZES the monkey is headed 
           right toward him!

           The monkey, ROCKETING to Hans, kicks the banana out of his 
           foot into the sky. With his feet now free, the monkey LIGHTLY 
           LANDS on Hans’ shoulder and CATCHES the banana in one motion.

           Hans looks into the eyes of the wild monkey on his shoulder. 
           They share a WEIRD MOMENT. After what feels like forever --
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I can’t tell you why, but it’s like 
                        we’d always known each other. 

           The monkey GIGGLES then rapidly PEELS the banana, bites off 
           half, and shoves the rest in Hans’ mouth. Hans chows down.

                                 HANS
                        Well hello, my little friend!

           The monkey HUGS Hans around his head, mussing his hair. Like 
           two old friends having a joyous reunion.

           INT. CABIN - RIVERBOAT - DAY

           A modest cabin. Hans can’t stop laughing as he draws --

           The MONKEY -- wriggling about -- his neck STUCK in the bars 
           covering the porthole. His eyes imploring Hans to free him.

           Hans sips a GLASS OF WATER, dips his pen in an INKWELL, and 
           finishes a quick sketch. The FIRST HINT of an instantly-
           recognizable character. He stands and moves to the porthole.

                                 HANS
                        Keep doing things like this, and I’m 
                        going to have to keep drawing you.

           Hans tenderly rotates the monkey’s body to the side and 
           slides the creature free. The monkey bounds around, ecstatic, 
           and lands on the desk by the sketch of himself. 

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Not bad, right?

           The monkey hops happily. Hans is a harsher critic, though --

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Eh... Eventually I’ll figure out 
                        something meaningful.

           Hans takes the drawing and puts it in his beat-up brief case. 

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting some dinner. Behave!

           The monkey jumps to the bed and plops his head on the pillow, 
           pretending to sleep. Of course I’ll be a good boy!

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll save the maggots for you.

           The monkey smiles and sticks out his tongue.
           CABIN - A LITTLE LATER

           The monkey climbs onto the desk. He tries to dip the pen in 
           the inkwell, but can’t get it in with his rough grip.

           Frustrated, he drops the pen. With both hands, he LIFTS the 
           inkwell like a mug. Now it’s time to inspect it -- 

           Elevating it toward his face, the monkey LOOKS UP and TIPS IT 
           UPSIDE DOWN to look in the hole --

           But INK POURS all over him. BLINDED and DISCOMBOBULATED --  

           He TOPPLES BACKWARDS off the chair. The INK RUNS ALL OVER his 
           coat and pools darkly in the center of the cabin.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I was too much like Hans. The stubborn 
                        type who had to learn from his own 
                        mistakes.

           The monkey panics, STAINING everything in sight.

           He spots a box full of white powder in the corner of the 
           room. It reads: LAUNDRY DETERGENT

           The monkey bounds to the box and picks it up. Drags it over 
           to the pool of ink and turns the box upside down. Nothing -- 
           just a pile of powdered soap on some ink.

           The monkey looks to the desk -- Ah, the water! He hops up the 
           chair, grabs Hans’ glass, and returns to the pool of ink.

           The monkey pours the water over his own head. As it hits his 
           body and then the floor, the mess turns into an overwhelming 
           SLUDGE of DARK BUBBLES. 

           The DOOR OPENS. The monkey drops the glass, shattering it. 
           Hans -- ignorant of the situation -- carries a tray of fruit.

                                 HANS
                        They had mangoes. I thought you— 

           Hans finally notices the situation and CRACKS UP. The 
           monkey’s eyes plead innocence, but Hans can’t stop laughing. 

           The monkey runs his hands through his fur and flicks soapy 
           ink, disgusted by his condition. Aren’t you going to help me?

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. I have to draw this!

           The monkey slumps his shoulders. Resigned to his fate.
           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Moonlight beams in through the porthole. The noises of the 
           jungle sing outside. Dark ink stains nearly everything. 

           On the desk: HANS’ FINISHED DRAWING. Four little panels as 
           Hans imagined the monkey perpetrated the act. It’s adorable.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In those days, we were a perfect pair.

           The monkey sleeps on Hans’ outstretched arm.

           EXT. HOUSEBOAT - BAY - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY

           Hans and the monkey follow a RENTAL AGENT over a GANGPLANK.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           The main area is SPARSE and DIRTY with UNPAINTED boards as 
           walls. A BAREBONES kitchen and an open door to a small 
           bedroom. BIG WINDOWS on either side exposing the bay.

           Hans looks around -- envisioning how perfect this can be. 
           Shakes with the agent as the monkey bounds from wall to wall.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We moved into an ideal place for two 
                        eligible bachelors. And I brought out 
                        the best in Hans -- unrealized 
                        potential only I could see.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - [ANOTHER] DAY

           The monkey sits calmly. Hans -- FOCUSED, MANIC WITH ENERGY -- 
           paints him.

           Hans’ PAINTINGS, mostly WATER COLORS OF THE MONKEY against 
           colorful backgrounds, line the walls. Tens of pieces. 

           EXT. ART GALLERY - BOHEMIAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Hans, DAPPER, and the monkey approach a crowded storefront. 
           Hans clocks a sign and savors it. The monkey pats his head.

           In Portuguese, it reads: SHOWING THE ART OF HANS REYERSBACH

           INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

           The walls are lined with Hans’ vibrant work. But the art is 
           undeveloped and unoriginal -- blatant Impressionist rip-offs.

           Patrons line up to congratulate Hans and the monkey, who 
           stand in front of a PAINTING OF THE ORPHAN GIRL. 
           LATER

           QUICK CUTS: Hans flirts and drinks with VARIOUS ATTRACTIVE 
           WOMEN. Clanking glasses. Cheap laughs. Hands on shoulders. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But Hans’ worst instincts could still 
                        get the best of him. Which took him 
                        away from our true calling. Art. 

           ON THE MONKEY: He can’t stand Hans’ fraternizing. He rolls 
           his eyes and paces angrily. Disappointed in his friend.

           INT. KITCHEN - WALDSTEIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Margret tinkers with a CAMERA. She overhears a conversation --

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        After graduation, Hamburg was as 
                        unkind to Margret as the Bauhaus’ 
                        blinded professors.

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN (O.S.)
                        I can’t believe you’d let him go to 
                        Brazil.

           DINING ROOM - WALDSTEIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Waldsteins eat dinner with Hans’ parents.

                                 SARAH
                        We miss him terribly, but...

                                 ABRAHAM
                        He needed to do something.

           Mr. Waldsteins raises his hands to make obnoxious air quotes.

                                 MR. WALDSTEIN
                        “Artists.” 

                                 MRS. WALDSTEIN
                        Thinking they’re going to change the 
                        world by running away from reality.

           MARGRET

           Slams down the camera. Sick of the disrespect.

                                 ABRAHAM (O.S.)
                        There’s something to be said for it. 
                        It’s their way to heal the world.

           Abraham’s idea moves her -- she nods in agreement.
           INT. WALDSTEIN HOUSE - DAY

           Margret SELLS her parents on the idea of an adventure.

                                 MARGRET
                        They said, Margret, you have all the 
                        skill in the world. You’re already a 
                        technical master. And your work ethic 
                        is second to none. It’s just—

                                 MARGRET’S MOM
                        Just what?

                                 MARGRET
                        You’re missing one thing, they said.
                              (pausing for effect)
                        An adventure! Seeing the world. 
                        Hardship and danger to imbue your work 
                        with drama.

           Her mother wipes her brow. Sounds scary.

                                 MARGRET’S DAD
                        Adventure? For a single girl like you?

                                 MARGRET
                        They insisted! It’s the practical 
                        thing to do if I want to make money.

           Her mom shakes her head no.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        I need to do something with my life. 
                        It’s getting bad for us here. And we 
                        all have to heal the world in our way.

                                 MARGRET’S DAD
                        Well... There is the Reyersbach boy. 

                                 MARGRET’S MOM
                        Ugh. She doesn’t need his influence.

                                 MARGRET’S DAD
                        He’s on his own adventure. To Brazil, 
                        of all places... 

           Margret feigns surprise. Motions him to tell more.

                                 MARGRET’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        A bit cuckoo, but everyone agrees he’s 
                        the most talented young artist to come 
                        from Hamburg in years. So gifted!

           Margret rolls her eyes. The last thing she wants to hear.
                                 MARGRET’S MOM
                        Maybe you could learn something from 
                        him on a very, very short visit.

                                 MARGRET
                              (NEGOTIATION MODE)
                        I’m going to have my adventure.

           Her parents look to each other -- know they’ve already lost.

           EXT. DOCKS - RIO DE JANEIRO - NIGHT

           Margret -- a large leather SUITCASE in either hand and CAMERA 
           dangling around her neck -- disembarks her ship in POURING 
           RAIN. The port is a disorienting CLAMOR of COMMOTION.

           She’s wearing a bright YELLOW SUIT topped with an oversized 
           YELLOW EXPLORER’S HAT. As some brutish longshoremen bump into 
           her, Margret sets down her suitcases and pulls a small PHOTO 
           of Hans from her pocket:

           ON THE PHOTO: Hans -- hair closely cropped, face clean shaven 
           -- in his army uniform. An ADDRESS is scrawled on the bottom.

           WOOT-WOOT! An obnoxious WHISTLE from a group of LEERING OLD 
           MEN (50s) that CATCALL her. They obnoxiously yell at her.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Margret had every reason to run away 
                        from what awaited her in Rio. But 
                        you’d have to be a damn fool to expect 
                        that from her. 

           She rolls her eyes, picks up her bags, and WALKS AWAY.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - SUNRISE

           Hans and the monkey SLEEP on the floor of the main room. The 
           REMNANTS OF TOO MUCH FUN spread out near them.

           EXT. BOARDWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Margret -- exhausted, thoroughly drenched -- approaches Hans’ 
           houseboat with suitcases in hand and camera around her neck.

           She looks at the tiny houseboat -- confused and disappointed. 
           But she GATHERS HERSELF and MARCHES up the wobbly dock.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. The whole houseboat rattles.

           The monkey, HUNGOVER, wakes up slowly. Rubs his hairy 
           temples, shields his eyes from the sun. Hans still out cold. 
           The monkey hisses and waves toward the door: Go away!

           KNOCK! KNOCK! More insistent now.

           The monkey steps over Hans and lumbers to the door --

           He jumps up, pulls down the handle, and kicks off the jamb to 
           open the door. Swinging backwards, he looks up to see --

           Margret, all bright yellow and shadow on her face, assessing 
           the room. She can’t hide her DISAPPOINTMENT with the mess.

                                 MARGRET
                        Thank you, I suppose.

           The monkey -- OFFENDED -- hops down, turns his back to her, 
           and walks to the bathroom. Closes the door behind him.

           Margret clocks the debris of the previous night and eyes the 
           man passed out on the floor. She takes a BIG SNIFF -- it’s 
           RANK as hell. What have I gotten myself into?

           Margret sets down her suitcases. Looks at the photo again.

           She now stares at Hans sprawled across the floor. Same man, 
           different eras, she observes much to her chagrin.

           Margret walks toward Hans. Standing over him, she bends down 
           to get a better look. Her big yellow hat shadows his face.

           She extends her forefinger and sharply POKES his chest.

           Hans slowly opens his eyes, blinking toward sentience.

           HANS’ POV: An IMAGE SLOWLY COMES INTO FOCUS --

           A GIANT YELLOW HAT. Long RED HAIR. But, most of all, PIERCING 
           GREEN EYES looking into his soul. 

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m Margret Waldstein. From Hamburg. 
                        I’m here to have an adventure.

           Hans slowly props himself up. Trying to make sense of her.

                                 HANS
                        Nice hat. 

                                 MARGRET
                        Thank you?

                                 HANS
                        Who invited you?
                                 MARGRET
                        Um. Well. No one really. But—

           Hans sits up fully now. 

                                 HANS
                        And who the hell let you in?

                                 MARGRET
                        That obnoxious little pet monkey.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Watch yourself now, Margret.

                                 HANS
                        He’s my friend. Not a pet.

           The toilet FLUSHES. The monkey opens the door, strides out 
           with CROSSED ARMS, and STARES DAGGERS at Margret.

                                 MARGRET
                        Sorry...

           The monkey rolls his eyes. Whatever, lady.

                                 HANS
                        He’s quite fun if you learn how to get 
                        along with him.

                                 MARGRET
                        I can imagine.

           Hans stands and GRABS the yellow hat off of Margret’s head. 
           She’s ANNOYED. Tries to straighten her messy hair.

                                 HANS
                        Are you on safari? 

                                 MARGRET
                        No. An adventure. That's what they 
                        told me I need at art school.

                                 HANS
                              (SCOFFING)
                        Art school?

                                 MARGRET
                        I was studying at the Bauhaus!

                                 HANS
                        How pretentious.
                                 MARGRET
                        Fair! But clearly you can see the value 
                        of a young artist exploring the world. 

                                 HANS
                        So you’ve come on holiday to my houseboat?

                                 MARGRET
                        I’m an artist. Like you supposedly 
                        are. I thought I could learn a little—

                                 HANS
                              (SWAGGER)
                        I can teach you some things.

                                 MARGRET
                        I’ve already had quite a thorough 
                        education. Thank you very much.

                                 HANS
                        I get carried away sometimes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Margret remembered hearing that line 
                        one time before.

           She eyes him. That smug face -- exasperating but so alive. 

                                 MARGRET
                        You know I saved you once?
                              (OFF HIS CONFUSED LOOK)
                        You came to my ninth birthday party. 
                        You and your helium balloons...

           Hans takes a few steps toward her. Cutting her off --

                                 HANS
                        You’re the one person who hung onto my 
                        foot when everyone else wanted me to 
                        blow away.

                                 MARGRET
                        I don’t think they wanted that. 
                        Regardless, nice to see you. Again.

           Hans makes a DUBIOUS face. Doesn’t want to get into the past.

                                 HANS
                        So what do you want with me now?

                                 MARGRET
                              (CALLING HIM OUT)
                        What’s your problem? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGRET (CONT'D)
                        Are you embarrassed for me to see you 
                        live like this? Are you even an artist 
                        anymore? Doesn’t seem like it. 

           Hans and the monkey DUMBFOUNDED. Did you really say that?

                                 HANS
                        Uh... Yes... No... Of course I’m an 
                        artist! A damn popular one in Rio. And 
                        much more creative than those self-
                        righteous pricks at the Bauhaus.

                                 MARGRET
                        In that case, show me around. Prove 
                        your genius to me.

                                 HANS
                        You’d be a fool not to notice it.

           The monkey -- defensive -- runs to Hans. Climbs up his body.

                                 MARGRET
                        What’s his name?

                                 HANS
                              (DUMBFOUNDED)
                        A name? Oh... He doesn’t have one.

           Margret eyes the monkey who meets her glance with his.

                                 MARGRET
                        Just look at him! Any genius would 
                        know he’s meant to be a George.

           The newly-minted GEORGE finally smiles at Margret and 
           excitedly plays Hans’ head like a bongo.

                           HANS 
                                                   GEORGE/NARRATOR (V.O.)
           George! Of course he’s a 
           George.
                                               George! Of course I’m a 
                                               George.

           Margret laughs at the intoxicating man and his monkey.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Hans, Margret, and George dine al fresco at a lively place. A 
           waiter brings their drinks. Margret is unhappy with her tea. 

                                 MARGRET
                        Sir, I asked for light milk, no sugar.

           The WAITER (30s) is confused by her seriousness. Hans enjoys 
           her assertiveness which is so out of place in South America.
                                 WAITER
                        A little rum will fix it!

                                 MARGRET
                        No. Certainly not. Please bring it as 
                        I asked for it.

           The waiter takes her cup and rolls his eyes to Hans.

                                 HANS
                        You’re pretty serious about your tea.

                                 MARGRET
                        One should be serious about getting 
                        what they want in life.

                                 HANS
                        What about a nice German fellow living 
                        in Brazil who just wants left alone?

                                 MARGRET
                        Do you want to be left alone or do you 
                        want to be remembered as a great artist?

           Hans is annoyed, but George claps in support of her idea.

                                 HANS
                        I don’t see how the two are related.

                                 MARGRET
                        Well, I worked very hard to come on 
                        this adventure. And I plan to be 
                        remembered as a great artist. So I 
                        won’t let your lack of seriousness get 
                        in my way.

                                 HANS
                        Are you hearing this, George?

           Hans, indignant, looks to George. But George grins to 
           Margret, sympathizing with her position.

           EXT. COPACABANA - LATER

           Hans and Margret leisurely ride beach cruisers next to each 
           other. George sits on Hans’ handlebars. 

                                 MARGRET
                        So it just comes easily for you?

                                 HANS
                        Yeah. Always has. Something I was born 
                        with, I guess.
                                 MARGRET
                              (JEALOUS)
                        Wouldn’t that be nice?

                                 HANS
                        If it’s such a challenge, why do you 
                        do it?

                                 MARGRET
                        Well I know I have something of value 
                        to give back to the world.

                                 HANS
                              (SARCASTIC)
                        How noble.

                                 MARGRET
                        You’ve never wanted to pursue 
                        something bigger than yourself? Push 
                        past your boundaries? Give something 
                        back to the world that’s never existed 
                        before?

                                 HANS
                        Nah. I just like drawing. 

                                 MARGRET
                        You need someone to push you then! To 
                        help accomplish what you don’t think 
                        you’re capable of. It’s not meant to 
                        come easily.

                                 HANS
                        Look... It hasn’t always been easy. I 
                        was blocked after the damn war. It was 
                        horrible! All of it.

                                 MARGRET
                        I didn’t know... I’m sorry.

                                 HANS
                        But I’m here now. And things have never 
                        been better. Until you showed up.

           He pedals ahead of her and smiles back. Is he flirting?

                                 MARGRET
                        What made it better?

                                 HANS
                        Oh, I don’t know. It’s wild here.

           He picks up George and throws him back to her. She YELPS. But 
           George lands safely on her shoulder, and she’s CHARMED.
                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Mostly that little fellow. I love 
                        animals. And he’s the best to draw.

                                 MARGRET
                        Animals. Why do you like them so much?

           Hans laughs at first. Then smiles wistfully. He searches for 
           an honest answer for once...

                                 HANS
                        I don’t know. Wild creatures. Can you 
                        ever really tame them? They’re so 
                        beautiful. Each one is a perfectly 
                        created piece of art. Every moment for 
                        an animal is like that divine feeling 
                        when it’s just you and the canvas and 
                        the art is flowing out of you. They’re 
                        all being -- no thinking -- just like 
                        that.

           She catches up. Looks into his eyes -- moved by his honesty.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        And when an animal -- like George here -
                        - trusts you, it’s the best. You have 
                        to be pure and present for them to 
                        accept you. You can’t judge them. For 
                        them, the only time is right now. To 
                        live with such freeness -- to be like 
                        them -- it’s perfect inspiration.

           He SKIDS to a stop in front of her.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        How about you? What do you like?

           Margret blushes. She wasn’t expecting this.

                                 MARGRET
                        I... don’t... know. I’m sorry.

           Hans smiles to her. George jumps back to his shoulder. He 
           speeds off looking back to her --

                                 HANS
                        You’ll have to figure it out, Margret.

           EXT. VISTA - JUNGLE - DAY

           Hans, Margret, and George hike off of a jungle path onto an 
           OVERLOOK with a clear view of all of Rio and the ocean below.

           Hans carries a beautiful homemade KITE. 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans has the kite FLYING over the tops of the trees. Margret 
           and George stand by his side admiring it. 

           Hans takes Margret’s hands and puts the string in it. 

                                 MARGRET
                        Oh, I don’t know—

                                 HANS
                              (CUTTING HER OFF)
                        Take it. You’ll be great.

           She cautiously takes the string and gives it some more slack. 
           The kite catches a gust of wind. And flies even higher.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Wonderful! You can do it. Forget about 
                        those nasty Bauhaus professors.

           Margret smiles to him as George starts jumping up and down at 
           Margret’s side. He points to himself insistently.

                                 MARGRET
                        It looks like someone else wants a 
                        turn.

                                 HANS
                        All little monkeys deserve a chance.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans and Margret SIT next to each other. Their backs at 
           forest’s edge.

           George is out at the edge of the vista. Running around to-and-
           fro. The kite soaring crazily overhead.

                                 MARGRET
                        That little fellow really is 
                        something.

           Hans smirks back at her -- he already knows that. But Margret 
           bursts up and runs towards --

           GEORGE

           Who’s swept away by the kite. Flying over the side of the 
           vista. Now being blown straight up like an eagle in a draft.

           HANS

           Falls over backwards LAUGHING. 
                                 MARGRET
                        Aren’t you worried?

                                 HANS
                        This is what we do!

           GEORGE

           Jumps off the string and lands safely on a branch high in the 
           trees. He wipes his forehead with his paw -- close call.

           George looks down to Hans, shrieks, and makes an inconsolable 
           face. A young child who needs a parent’s hug.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans CLIMBS the tree George is in. Margret stands below.

                                 HANS
                        I’d never leave you behind, pal.

                                 MARGRET
                        Are you ever going to love anything as 
                        much as you love that monkey?

           Hans, almost to George, pauses and looks back to Margret. 

                                 HANS
                              (CHARMING)
                        Some very secret things are in the works.

           He scurries out on a tiny branch closer to George. Margret 
           can’t help but laugh with joy.

           QUICK CUTS:

           Margret SNAPS PHOTOS around Rio with Hans and George:

           -Underneath the COLORFUL UMBRELLAS at the Copacabana.
           -Colorful COLONIAL BUILDINGS.
           -Overlooking the city from the SCENIC VISTA.
           -GEORGE DOING TRICKS in the jungle’s trees.
           -Hans RIDING A BICYCLE WITH NO HANDS, all smiles.
           -A SELFIE of the three of them HAPPY in the houseboat.

           EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

           Hans and Margret, George on her shoulder now, SNEAK IN.

           INT. ART GALLERY - MOMENTS LATER

           As the lights slowly come up, Margret makes her way around 
           the room, darting amongst the art. Hans and George follow.
                                 MARGRET
                        These are not bad, Hans!

                                 HANS
                        What a compliment.

                                 MARGRET
                        The professors at the Bauhaus would 
                        hate these! But they have a certain 
                        energy and unrefined potential.

           Hans scoffs at her audacity.

                                 HANS
                        I thought you came to learn from me.

                                 MARGRET
                        I already went to art school.

                                 HANS
                        Do you believe me that I’m an artist now?

                                 MARGRET
                              (FLIRTING)
                        Heaven forbid your feelings get hurt.

           Hans and George wave her off at the same time. But the 
           painting of the little girl and the bird catch her eye.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        This one is amazing. There’s a whole 
                        story in it. What inspired you?

           Hans doesn't say anything. But Margret holds her intense gaze 
           until he finally opens up -- 

                                 HANS
                        Everyone thinks kids are too stupid to 
                        know anything. And that we should all 
                        rush to grow up. But that’s nonsense.

                                 MARGRET
                        Maturity isn't all bad.

                                 HANS
                        I’m not saying it is. But it takes more 
                        creativity to appeal to one single child 
                        than all the stuck-up critics in Europe. 
                              (BEAT -- FROM THE HEART)
                        Myths. They tell a whole story. Anyone, 
                        even children, can understand them. 
                        Myths are the highest form of art.

           Margret nods, agreeing with him.
                                 MARGRET
                        Who’s this little girl?

                                 HANS
                              (HESITANT)
                        I met her one day. After the end of 
                        the war. And...

                                 MARGRET
                        And?

           Hans shrugs. Doesn’t want to talk about it. 

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        And you created a myth for her?

                                 HANS
                        It made her smile again, Margret. 

           Margret gives Hans a look. One we’ve seen before. The look 
           she gave him at her ninth birthday party when Hans almost 
           blew away.

                                 MARGRET
                        And you knew you were an artist?

           He nods modestly. Margret takes his hand, and their eyes lock 
           on the other. A return to their metaphysical magic. 

           EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           Margret and Hans walk hand-in-hand across the gangplank into 
           the houseboat. George, ANNOYED, follows behind.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           George, arms crossed across his chest, stomps around outside 
           the bedroom door like an impatient college freshman. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        That night I lost my rightful place in bed. 
                        Which gave Margret some big ideas.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Hans and Margret -- George between them -- rest in bed. 
           Margret, torn up about something, stares out a small window 
           toward the ocean.

                                 MARGRET
                        You’d say I’m a bit too uptight? Too 
                        traditional?
                                 HANS
                        No big secret. 

           Margret stands. Puts on a robe. Still looking away from Hans.

                                 MARGRET
                        And I need to change that to help my 
                        art. Right?

                                 HANS
                        That’s what I’ve been saying.

           She turns around.

                                 MARGRET
                        Hans, let’s get married.

           Hans’ and George’s eyes open wide. They both sit up ramrod 
           straight. 

                                 HANS
                        Married? Like... adults?

                                 MARGRET
                        Yes, I suppose. But also like humans 
                        who value each other and their work.

           Hans and George give her a suspicious glance. Are you nuts?

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                              (SEARCHING)
                        And, and... like the impulsive, 
                        hopeless romantics we are!

           Hans gets out of bed on the opposite side of Margret.

                                 HANS
                        I think you’re mistaken about us.

                                 MARGRET
                        I know this is quick, but... come on!

                                 HANS
                        George and I are not the marrying type.

           Margret -- BEFUDDLED -- throws her hands into the air.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been distracted since you showed 
                        up unannounced. And, let me add, 
                        uninvited. I haven’t been working so 
                        my mind’s a wreck.
                                 MARGRET
                        You still haven’t said yes or no.

                                 HANS
                        I didn’t leave Germany for a yes or no 
                        kind of life!

           Margret looks at him, embarrassed and regretful.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        George and I are going to the jungle 
                        to paint today.

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! An unexpected rapping at the door.

                                 DELIVERY BOY (O.S.) 
                        Telegraph!

           MOMENTS LATER

           Hans, George on his shoulder, is at the open door talking to 
           a DELIVERY BOY (18). Margret -- WIPING TEARS from her eyes -- 
           stays back in the kitchen.

           Hans, annoyed, signs for it and slams the door.

                                 DELIVERY BOY
                        And nice monkey by the-

           As the boy is cut off, Hans eyes Margret. Did you plan this?

                                 MARGRET
                        This was not my doing. I swear!

                                 HANS
                        Ugh. It’s from my dad. I don’t want it.

           Margret approaches Hans, opens the telegraph, reads it ALOUD. 
           But we hear ABRAHAM’S VOICE --

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        Hans, mother and I miss you. But it’s 
                        good you left Germany.

           INTERCUT ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF HITLER’S RISE TO POWER WITH 
           HANS’ HORRIFIED REACTION:

           -A young HITLER shakes hands and nods furiously to a small 
           group of uniformed Nazi goons. The beginning of the party.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        A terrible man named Hitler has been 
                        gaining power. Our country has been 
                        hypnotized by him.
           -Hitler, all TWISTED PASSION, gives an impassioned speech.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        He and his Nazi party have been 
                        burning books and art. Many writers 
                        and artists are being jailed.

           -Nazis throw BOOKS into a massive bonfire. 

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        He has a deep hatred for us Jews. I 
                        don’t understand how, but he’s 
                        convinced many of our countrymen we’re 
                        to blame for Germany’s problems. 

           -KRISTELLNACHT. Nazis looting Jewish businesses. Beating Jews 
           on the street. Terror.

           EXT. ABRAHAM’S FACTORY - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

           NAZI THUGS vandalize Hans’ father’s business. A STORM TROOPER 
           paints a large STAR OF DAVID on the front, broken window.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        We can no longer work. Our business 
                        has been taken away from us. 

           Through a HOLE in the middle of the graffiti star, we see—

           ABRAHAM - CONTINUOUS [FLASHBACK]

           Hanging his head in FEAR and SHAME. The business is 
           RANSACKED. Widgets strewn about everywhere.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        It’s not safe for us. We fear we will 
                        soon have to leave our beloved 
                        country.

           Sarah, slower now, walks to Abraham, who’s cleaning. She puts 
           her arm around him. No reaction from the old man.

           HANS

           RIPS UP the telegraph. FURIOUS and SAD all at once.

                                 HANS
                        This cannot happen again! 

                                 MARGRET
                        I’m sure—

                                 HANS
                        You don’t know what war is like.
                                 MARGRET
                        We’ll figure out how to help them.

           Hans -- almost in tears -- doesn't want to get into it. 

                                 HANS
                        We’ve got to go paint now.

           George darts to Hans’ art supplies and grabs a few brushes 
           from a can. Hans pauses at the door before exiting --

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Pack your bags. I’ll help you find a 
                        new place when I’m back.

           Margret is DEVASTATED. Hans turns and exits with George.

           EXT. VISTA - JUNGLE - DAY

           Hans and George, both visibly upset, arrive at a vista 
           overlooking Rio. They set up an easel. 

           EXT. VISTA - JUNGLE - SUNSET

           The last light of day... And an EMPTY CANVAS. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        It was a lot to consider. We needed to 
                        clear our minds. 

                                 HANS
                        All right now. We've got this.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        But the gods weren’t touching us that day.

           He moves the brush to the canvas. But doesn’t draw a thing.

                                 HANS
                        Oh, come on, Hans!
                              (BEAT)
                        This is not your fault! How dare she. 
                        Propose? Ugh. The word itself is 
                        disgusting.

           George hops off Hans’ shoulder.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        We had it made here. Fun. Beautiful 
                        women. Paint a little here and there. 
                        We would have grown old -- leaving 
                        everyone else be, the world not 
                        bothering us. That’s the life, George.
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Hans wasn’t telling the truth. And -- 
                        somewhere in the depths of his soul -- he 
                        knew it. But he was scared to admit it.

           Hans becomes morose -- 

                                 HANS
                        What’s she see in me? I don’t have 
                        anything for her. We have no real art 
                        to share with anyone, George.

           The monkey looks up to Hans. He cocks his head as if 
           preparing a thought. And George -- in the voice of our 
           narrator -- blurts out --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        So I spoke up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Love can be a great adventure. 

           Hans doesn’t skip a beat in responding.

                                 HANS
                        That is true.

                                 GEORGE
                        This love could be your masterpiece.

           Hans nods along in agreement. 

                                 HANS
                        Oh, I don’t know! Going back to Europe, 
                        it’ll be hard. With what’s going on in 
                        Germany and the threat of war.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do we really stand a chance without 
                        Margret, though?

                                 HANS
                        Oh, George! Of course, you’re right!

           But now the ABSURDITY of George speaking HITS HIM.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        George, did you...

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Sometimes genius is simply knowing 
                        when to shut up.

           George bounces up and down. Proud of himself. 
           Hans -- bewildered -- shakes his head. 

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           Hans and George, supplies in hand, skip in. Margret, in the 
           yellow outfit she arrived in, finishes packing her suitcases.

                                 HANS
                              (EXCITED)
                        Margret! Margret!

                                 MARGRET
                        I’m sorry. I tried to pack, but... Can 
                        I stay here one last night—

                                 HANS
                        Of course! Of course you can!

                                 MARGRET
                        About before. It was a terrible idea.

           Hans hurries to her and puts his hands on both her shoulders.

                                 HANS
                        It was a brilliant idea! 
                             (BEAT -- OFF MARGRET’S CONFUSION)
                        Let’s move to Paris and get married. 
                        It’s the most romantic, artistic thing 
                        we could possibly do.

           George bounces beside them clapping excitedly.

                                 MARGRET
                        Paris! How are we going to... 
                             (REALIZING WHAT’S GOING ON)
                        Married? Are you sure?

                                 HANS
                        Let’s have our adventure.

           He KISSES her long and sweet. 

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry about that little outburst 
                        before. The war did something to me... 
                        And then that telegram from my dad... I 
                        don’t know how to explain it.

                                 MARGRET
                              (FORGIVING)
                        Let’s not make a habit out of it.
                                 HANS
                        Of course not.
                              (BEAT)
                        But we must figure out how to take 
                        George with us!

           INT. COUNTER - GOVERNMENT OFFICE - DAY

           Margret talks to a BUREAUCRAT and signs some documents.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Margret worked her magic. Figured out 
                        the papers and money.

                                 BUREAUCRAT
                        Congratulations. 

           He hands her some papers -- two BRAZILIAN PASSPORTS on top.

           INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

           A GALLERIST (50s) signs a CHECK and hands it to Margret.

           INT. TICKET STALL - DOCKS - DAY

           Margret NEGOTIATES with a GRUMPY TICKET AGENT (40s).

                                 GRUMPY TICKET AGENT
                        ... No way, lady!

                                 MARGRET
                        Coach cabin, but first class meals. 

                                 GRUMPY TICKET AGENT
                        Fine.

           He extends his hand to shake on it. BUT Margret won’t yet --

                                 MARGRET
                        One last thing. My fiancé has a 
                        friend... A Brazilian friend.

           Grumpy Ticket Agent mugs her. So what?

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        Actually he’s a house pet... 
                             (OFF THE TICKET AGENT’S GLARE)
                        All right! He’s a monkey. But he 
                        absolutely must make the trip with us! 

                                 GRUMPY TICKET AGENT
                        No. 
                                 MARGRET
                        My fiancé would never talk to me—

                                 GRUMPY TICKET AGENT
                        Personal problem, miss.

           Margret looks at him trying to find any compassion. Please!

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        But she couldn’t finalize the most 
                        important arrangements.

                                 GRUMPY TICKET AGENT
                        They find that monkey, they’ll drown 
                        him in a heartbeat. Enjoy your first 
                        class meals, though.

           I/E HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           Margret ever-so-calmly explains the situation to Hans. We 
           watch this scene play out SILENTLY from the exterior. 

           Hans is shell-shocked. Pure DENIAL as he PACES FRANTICALLY.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Margret did the best she could to 
                        break the news lightly. But we took it 
                        kind of poorly...

           George goes BERSERK. Bouncing off the walls -- flying here 
           and there. DESTROYING everything in site. Knocking over an 
           easel. FLINGING PAINT. Tearing up canvases. 

           EXT. VISTA - JUNGLE - SUNSET

           Hans and George trudge off of the jungle path.

                                 HANS
                        Come here, George.

           George jumps up to Hans’ chest. Hans hugs him like a baby.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I want to thank you, my friend. I 
                        thought I’d never be myself again 
                        after the war.

           George looks up at Hans.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Without you, I’d still be a bum on the 
                        beach. Or maybe in a madhouse in 
                        Hamburg. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        But you taught me to draw again. And 
                        I’m going to have a wife because of 
                        you, old friend!

           George wipes a tear from Hans’ cheek.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        It’d be selfish of me to keep you.

           Hans peels George off his chest. Gently tosses him toward the 
           forest.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Go, George! You’ll be happy.

           But George won’t go. He rests dumbly staring at Hans.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Hans thought he could get rid of me.

                                 HANS
                              (EMOTIONAL)
                        You don’t understand. If they find you 
                        on the ship, they’ll throw you 
                        overboard and drown you in the 
                        freezing ocean! And it’s not the same 
                        in Europe. You’d hate it.
                              (BEAT, YELLS NOW)
                        Go, George! Leave you stupid monkey!

           Hans -- breaking down -- TURNS AWAY from George. 

           George looks at his friend for a moment. Then he turns around 
           and ambles back toward the jungle. But --

           An IMAGINARY VERSION OF GEORGE peels off from the real monkey 
           that disappears into the greenery of the jungle and looks at 
           Hans. This George is a figment of Hans’ imagination.

           The new IMAGINARY George bounds to Hans, CLIMBS into his 
           shirt, and cleverly HIDES at the SMALL OF HIS BACK. 

           Hans -- surprised by the new George clinging to his skin -- 
           smiles in delight.

           The new George now HIDDEN, Hans turns to walk away from the 
           vista. The FAINTEST OUTLINE of a tiny monkey protrudes under 
           his shirt. 

           But we see what Hans has actually left behind -- 

           The real George -- just a small, regular monkey -- bounces 
           around alone on the vista. As Hans walks away, the old, 
           animal George meanders back into the jungle forever.
           EXT. DOCKS - BRAZIL - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Documents changing hands. A STAMP smashes down.

                                 GATE AGENT (O.S.)
                        Papers! Papers!

           Hans -- grimacing at the gate agent’s call for papers -- 
           follows Margret onto the ship. On the small of Hans’ back, 
           George’s TAIL barely peaks out -- WAGGING happily.

           INT. CABIN - SHIP - NIGHT (1935)

           A modest room. Hans and Margret rest under the covers. 
           Margret reads, Hans draws. The camera moves down, REVEALING --

           UNDER THE BED

           GEORGE, on best behavior, HIDING quietly. 

           EXT. HÔTEL DE VILLE - PARIS - DAY

           Hans and Margret, their SUITCASES in hand, SPRINT to Paris’s 
           magnificent city hall. The city’s GRANDEUR surrounds them.

           INT. HANS’ SUITCASE - CONTINUOUS

           George, hidden amongst dirty clothes, BOUNCES back and forth.

           INT. CEREMONY ROOM - HOTEL DE VILLE - LATER

           A grand Beaux Arts hall. Hans and Margret -- drunk in love, 
           suitcases at their side -- stand in front of a CIVIL SERVANT 
           who declares them man and wife.

           They KISS passionately. 

           GEORGE - IN THE SUITCASE - CONTINUOUS

           Looks glum. Sad to be missing out on all the fun.

           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DE VILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Hans and Margret, in a whirlwind of adrenaline, race out of 
           city hall. Margret stops on a dime. 

                                 MARGRET
                              (TONGUE-IN-CHEEK)
                        We haven’t talked about our honeymoon.

                                 HANS
                        Oh... Right you are... 
                              (GRINNING)
                        How about Paris?
           The two newlyweds FROLIC off. 

           EXT. BAR -  LATIN QUARTER - DAY

           A LIVELY AREA filled with universities, students, and bars. 
           Hans and Margret sit on a busy patio -- luggage on the floor 
           beside them. Hans pours two glasses of CHAMPAGNE. 

                                 HANS
                        À votre santé, Madame Reyersbach!

                                 MARGRET
                        Cheers, my love! 

           They clink their glasses and drink. 

                                 HANS
                        My hat’s off to you. This whole 
                        elopement idea. Not too shabby.

                                 MARGRET
                        I very immodestly agree.

           Something across the street catches Hans’ eye. He can’t stop 
           staring. Margret turns and looks, too, at a --

           MIME SCHOOL

           An older TEACHER MIME silently BERATES two younger STUDENT 
           MIMES. The teacher points his finger in their faces and 
           indicates the students have brains the size of peanuts.

           The older mime slams the door shut in their face. The two 
           students walk away -- silently -- with their heads hung.

           BAR

           Hans -- in hysterics -- bursts up.

                                 HANS
                        I cannot stand for this.

           Margret -- giggly -- tries to grab him, but he’s on his way.

                                 MARGRET
                        Hans, no, please!

           CLOSE ON Margret, enjoying the spectacle Hans makes as he 
           runs to the mimes walking down the --

           STREET

           Hans taps both the depressed, young mimes on their back. 
           They’re SURPRISED to see this stranger --
           Especially because Hans now acts like a trained mime himself -
           - exaggerated posture, expressions, and all.

           As the young mimes look at him, he points back at their 
           school and SIMULATES PUNCHING their teacher.

           Both the young mimes nod in agreement. They point like they 
           need to be going. But Hans indicates for them to stay.

           MARGRET

           Laughs at Hans’ nerve. Quite a show he’s putting on.

                                 MARGRET
                        Let them go! They have important mime 
                        things to be doing.

           STREET

           Hans wags his finger at her. Not yet. By this point a SMALL 
           CROWD has gathered around Hans and the two mimes.

           Hans puts his fingers on both of their lips at the same time. 
           He mimes drawing a SMILE on both their faces and --

           Both mimes break out in laughter. 

           He now finds Margret’s eyes with his. He points at her then 
           makes a HEART SHAPE with his fingers. He moves the heart 
           shape over his own heart.

           Now he beats the heart shape against his chest, indicating 
           Margret is his own heartbeat. 

           The two mimes grin from ear to ear as Hans waves for them to 
           go out in the world and find their own loves.

           The crowd erupts in cheers. Hans bows as he spots -- 

           MARGRET

           Standing, clapping, and making joyful eye contact with Hans.

           white SACRÉ-COEUR CHURCH. 

           Margret and Hans, still with their luggage in hand, mosey 
           around, infatuated by their surroundings.
           An ODD BUILDING catches Hans’ eye. It’s bright blue -- like 
           something he’d draw -- with strange crags and promontories. 
           Built into a hillside beside a cemetery. A sign reads:

                       TERRASS HOTEL. APPARTEMENTS POUR LES ARTISTES.

                                 HANS
                        What about that one?

           Hans points at it, and they GRIN KNOWINGLY at one another.

           INT. HALLWAY - TERRASS HOTEL - LATER

           Margret opens the door to room 505. They enter.

           IN THE ROOM

           Hans flips on the light and brings in the luggage.

                                 HANS AND MARGRET
                        It’s perfect.

           Hans looks at the furniture and art on the wall. A baroque 
           mix of styles, periods, and colors. But somehow it all works.

           Margret gravitates to the window overlooking the city of 
           light. She pulls open a blowing sheer obscuring the view --

           The EIFFEL TOWER in the distance, surrounded by the most 
           beautiful city in the world.

                                 MARGRET
                        We’re home, Hans.

           Hans walks to Margret and takes in the view.

           George UNZIPS -- just a bit -- the bag in which he’s hidden. 
           Peaks his head out. Looks around surreptitiously -- 

           Feeling IGNORED, George hangs his head and hides again as --

                                 HANS
                        You know... Our marriage still isn’t 
                        official.

           Hans and Margret KISS, STUMBLING toward the bed.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           A perfect morning. Breakfast in bed. 

                                 HANS
                        If the coffee is from Brazil, why does 
                        it taste so much better here?
                                 MARGRET
                        Everything tastes better in Paris.

           She plants a kiss right on his lips.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        Even you!

                                 HANS
                        Why do you think that is?

           Margret grabs a croissant and bites into it.

                                 MARGRET
                             (PUTTING ON A FRENCH ACCENT)
                        Who cares! We are françaises now.

                                 HANS
                        In that case, there’s something I’d 
                        like to do. 

                                 MARGRET
                        Tell me. Please.

                                 HANS
                              (OVEREMPHASIZING)
                        Reyersbach. Rey. Ers. Bach.
                              (PAUSE)
                        It’s so...

                                 MARGRET
                        German! And ugly. Reyersbachhhh.

           She coughs up a hairball on the last syllable.

                                 HANS
                        We should change our last name. 

                                 MARGRET
                        I don’t want people associating us 
                        with that madman in Germany. It should 
                        be simple. Memorable. 

           Hans nods in affirmation. Margret thinks a beat.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                              (REALLY SELLING IT)
                        Rey! Hans and Margret Rey. We could be 
                        French. Or Brazilian for that matter. 

           Hans, baguette in hand, hops out of bed.

                                 HANS
                        Genius! The Reys. Citizens of the world. 
           Hans surreptitiously throws a bit of bread under the bed.

           UNDER THE BED

           George, moving silently in the shadows, snatches up the food.

                                 HANS (O.S.)
                        Artists of all lands!

           He GRINS -- loves the sound of that.

           MARGRET

           Loves the idea. 

                                 MARGRET
                        And no one will have to know we’re...

                                 HANS
                        Right. Not necessary at the moment.

                                 MARGRET
                        I’ll get the papers taken care of.

                                 HANS
                        Papers, papers, papers. They’re going 
                        to be the end of me one day!

           Margret rolls her eyes -- she’ll always deal with the papers.

           EXT. JARDIN DE LUXEMBOURG - DAY

           A stunning PARK dotted with STATUES. The grounds abut an 
           elegant CASTLE. Hans PAINTS the scenery at an easel. George 
           hangs on the front of Hans’ shirt.

           Hans SPLATTERS paint to give his work a surreal feel.

                                 GEORGE
                        More! Go bigger, Hans! C’mon!

           Hans excitedly flicks REDS and YELLOWS. Until he hears --

                                 MARGRET (O.S.)
                        Bonjour, Monsieur Rey.

           George BURROWS back inside Hans’ shirt, hiding himself. Hans 
           turns around, CAUGHT OFF-GUARD.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        The name change is all done.

                                 HANS
                        Oh, um, great.
           Margret approaches the easel. Looks at it critically.

                                 MARGRET
                        The mess in the sky detracts from your 
                        detail work of the statues.

                                 HANS
                              (ANNOYED)
                        It’s not done.

                                 MARGRET
                        Don’t go overboard with the unessential.

                                 HANS
                        Well, I should get back to it...

                                 MARGRET
                              (IGNORING HIS HINT)
                        Some good news. My parents got out of 
                        Germany yesterday. 
                              (BEAT -- GETTING SERIOUS)
                        But your parents still need travel 
                        arrangements, papers, and more funds. 
                              (BEAT -- SOLEMN)
                        I was just at the bank wiring them. 
                        Almost all of our savings are gone 
                        already, Hans.

                                 HANS
                        It’ll work itself—

                                 MARGRET
                              (CUTTING HIM OFF)
                        No. Our priority is getting all of our 
                        family out of Germany. 

                                 HANS
                        Of course.

                                 MARGRET
                        So we’re going to need some work here.

           He smiles at her mischievously. 

                                 HANS
                        I’ve always dreamed of working our 
                        entire honeymoon.

           Hans swoops up Margret into his arms. She gasps and giggles -- 
           very unlike herself -- before they kiss.

           START MUSIC MONTAGE - MARGRET AND HANS IN JAZZ AGE PARIS
           INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           Beautiful people DANCE. AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSICIANS play jazz.

           Hans and Margret -- looking very en vogue -- enter -- 
           ENTHRALLED by the atmosphere. Margret pushes to the bar -- 
           calls the BARTENDER. Hans -- George on his back -- follows.

           Bartender presents a magnum of CHAMPAGNE and SPRITZES them.

           LATER

           Hans and Margret dance closely as the band speeds up. On 
           Hans' back, we see George’s tail wagging to the beat.

           EXT. CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES - NIGHT

           The CITY OF LIGHTS illuminated in a golden haze. The Reys, 
           REVELING in the magical environment, walk home hand-in-hand.

           As they KISS, NOTICE George SWINGING between light poles. 

           INT. LOUVRE - DAY

           Hans and Margret look at the legendary works. Hans sets up an 
           easel to replicate them. Margret points, offering direction.

           As Hans sketches, we see his HAND-DRAWN ART fill the frame, 
           obscuring the original masterpieces he renders in his style:

           -The Mona Lisa as the Orphan Girl on a bright background.
           -Margret, smiling at Hans, as the Venus de Milo.
           -George as the Winged Statue of Victory.

           GEORGE

           Observes them from the heights of the cathedral-like ceiling.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Margret poses for Hans -- the beginning of his STUDIO taking 
           shape near the window. NOTICE MORE ART AND FURNITURE 
           ACCUMULATING in the apartment.

           HANS’ PAINTING COMES TO LIFE: 

           Margret and George -- BOTH DRAWN IN HANS’ HAND -- dance 
           wildly in a rainbow jazz club. Hans looks on approvingly.

           INT. SALON - GERTRUDE STEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A bohemian literary salon. Margret in the corner debates two 
           Americans -- a burly HEMINGWAY (30s) and plain-looking 
           GERTRUDE STEIN (60s), who's in charge of this affair.
           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Hans chats with an American woman with a stern face. She 
           wears cropped hair and a man’s suit, and works as an ART 
           BROKER. 

           This is ALICE BABETTE TOKLAS (50s) -- romantic partner of 
           Gertrude Stein and connective tissue of Paris’s art scene. 

                                 ALICE
                        Rey? What is that?

                                 HANS
                        Who knows? Could be from anywhere.

                                 ALICE
                        Smart.

           Alice motions to Margret, who’s forcefully sticking her 
           pointer finger into Hemingway’s chest.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        She’s pretty. But more important, 
                        seems very strong-willed.

           Hans nods. Proud of Margret. Alice takes in Hans --

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I’d love to see your work.

           INT. TERASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans pulls his sketches and canvases out of a large leather 
           portfolio. Alice, standing close to Margret, inspects them.

                                 ALICE
                        Trés bien! Plenty of money in this.
                              (TO MARGRET)
                        And you, lovey? Don’t let your husband 
                        keep all the glory to himself.

           Hans rolls his eyes. Margret shrugs modestly.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Want to live in his shadow? Whadya got?

           Margret hands Alice an ALBUM OF HER PHOTOGRAPHY from Rio.

                                 MARGRET
                        I know what the audience wants to see. 
                        And I know how to help other artists. 
                        I have the vision, I do! 
                             (BEAT. THEN POINTS AT HANS)
                        But my hands don’t work like his.
                                 ALICE
                        If you're willing to tell men who 
                        think they're geniuses what to do, I 
                        got something for you.

           Off of Margret’s EXCITEMENT, we cut back to --

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL

           The art collection is growing quickly. To support the habit --

           Hans, Margret, and Alice SELL a few of Hans' pieces to a 
           FRENCH COUPLE (60s). Francs quickly move between hands. 

           UNDER THE BED

           George smiles. Happy to see Hans doing well.

           INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           The Reys DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY. George GYRATES in the wings.

           EXT. PARK - SUNSET

           A picnic. More than a picnic... A MOVEABLE FEAST -- 

           Great artists sit around a LAVISH SPREAD of food and drink.

           Margret PHOTOGRAPHS the afternoon. Through her viewfinder --

           Picasso. Hemingway. Stein with Alice. Louis Armstrong. All 
           drinking, arguing, or amorous.

           And Hans, OFF TO THE SIDE but loving life, sketching the 
           scene through his childlike lens. 

           Hans glances around. All clear. He grabs a few grapes. 

                                 HANS
                        Take a look, George.

           George PEAKS OUT the shirt. Hans hands him the grapes.

           REVEAL the drawing -- almost like THE LAST SUPPER. George 
           holding court amidst the famous artists at the picnic.

           ON GEORGE: He smiles -- AT PEACE -- in the rosy sunlight.

           END MUSIC MONTAGE

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margret develops film at the table. Hans enters, arms full of 
           painted canvases and a statue. Margret GRIMACES.
                                 MARGRET
                        Hans, were those purchases really crucial?

                                 HANS
                        We’re selling my paintings constantly.

           Hans sets down the statue and goes about hanging a canvas.

                                 MARGRET
                        Not well enough to afford our real 
                        priorities and all this... Alice will 
                        have to find us something else. 

           INT. PUBLISHER’S OFFICE - DAY

           GUY LAFAYETTE (40s) -- a resentful man who feels too smart to 
           work in children’s literature -- sits behind an ornate desk.

           He studies some of Hans’ sketches before looking up at Hans, 
           Margret, and Alice across from him.

                                 GUY
                        Alice is right. You’re a perfect fit.

                                 HANS
                        I’d love to work on a good book, at least.

                                 GUY
                        Children’s books are an assault on 
                        culture! We don’t do this for the art. 
                        Let’s at least be honest with ourselves.

           Hans and Margret are unsettled. Guy hands Hans a manuscript.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the text of the so-called story.

                                 HANS
                        Well... What am I supposed to draw?

                                 GUY
                        That’s your job!

           Margret grabs the manuscript and looks over it.

                                 MARGRET
                        He wants to exceed your expectations.

                                 GUY
                        Then do so. Five hundred francs a week. 

                                 ALICE
                        Six hundred francs a week.
           Before Guy can respond --

                                 MARGRET
                        One thousand francs a week for such a 
                        coveted artist. And Hans is credited 
                        on the cover of the book. Final offer.

                                 GUY
                        One thousand francs. But no 
                        illustrators ever get cover credit. 

           Alice signals to leave well enough alone. They all stand.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Monsieur Rey, it’s a pleasure.
                              (ICILY TO MARGRET)
                        We won’t be needing a wife’s input at 
                        our next meeting. 

           ON MARGRET: Pissed. I’m going to show him. 

           INT. ADVERTISING AGENCY - DAY

           A sleek, modern office. Margret and Alice sit across from 
           DOMINIC LEMIEUX (40s) -- a handsome, self-assured ad exec.

                                 DOMINIC
                        Alice says she’s never met a more 
                        promising young art director.

                                 ALICE
                        Her photos speak for themselves.

           Alice hands him a pile of well-composed B&W PHOTOS from Rio.

                                 DOMINIC
                        There’s a narrative. Well told, too. A 
                        little simplistic, but great for ads.

                                 MARGRET
                        I appreciate that... I suppose.

                                 DOMINIC
                        We’ll give you a chance on our next shoot.
                              (OFF MARGRET’S SMILE)
                        If it goes well, perhaps we can—

                          MARGRET
                                                           ALICE
           I’m married.
                                               She’s married.

           Dominic whips up a slick grin --

                                 DOMINIC
                        It’s France, after all.
           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Hans paints a penguin for the kid’s book he’s working on. 
           Margret sets down a pile of NEWSPAPERS near the bed.

                                 MARGRET
                        Will you come help me with something?

                                 HANS
                        Gladly. It’s no fun working on someone 
                        else’s project.

           He walks to her. She picks up a newspaper.

                                 MARGRET
                        I have an idea for this first shoot. 
                        We’ll have tiny boats floating down 
                        the Seine. The boats are made from 
                        newspapers an onlooking boy was 
                        supposed to deliver. It’s his 
                        daydream. 
                              (BEAT)
                        Any idea how to make a paper boat?

           He takes the newspaper from her.

                                 HANS
                        Luckily I was a boy who spent an awful 
                        lot of time daydreaming.

           In no time at all, Hans folds the paper into an elegant, 
           origami-like miniature boat. Margret’s amazed. 

                                 MARGRET
                        Bravo! It feels like when George used 
                        to be around... Just... fun.

           Hans is caught off guard by the comment. He PLAYS DUMB.

                                 HANS
                        Who?

                                 MARGRET
                        George! Your monkey. Oh don’t pretend 
                        like you don’t miss him, too.

                                 HANS
                        Oh, um, we’re fine without him.

           Margret takes his hand. A sore subject. Hans glances --

           UNDER THE BED

           He sees a twinkle in George’s eyes.
           HANS

           Loosens up -- smiling at Margret. But now he shifts his body 
           language... Starting to act like a monkey.

           Hans bounces up and down like George. Makes monkey noises.

                                 HANS
                              (SILLY VOICE)
                        Monkey wants have fun!

           He ambles to Margret and smacks a sloppy kiss on her cheek.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Monkey play!

                                 MARGRET
                              (OVER HER LAUGHTER)
                        The monkey will get to play when he’s 
                        done folding boats!

           Hans -- still acting like a monkey -- grabs a newspaper. 
           Instantly folds it into a boat and sends it soaring through 
           the air like a paper airplane.

                                 HANS
                        Monkey play now!

           EXT. SEINE - MORNING

           The RIVER winds through a field. Hundreds of MINIATURE BOATS 
           made from folded newspaper float on the river. YELLOW DUCKS 
           bob up and down. And a BOY ON A BIKE with a satchel of 
           newspapers sits waiting for direction. 

           A beautiful scene, but as we pull wider we realize --

           It’s a PHOTO SET. And MARGRET IS THE BOSS. 

           However, everyone else on set is a man that doesn’t 
           appreciate her telling them what to do.

           Margret hurries around giving direction: 

           -Explaining the plan to Dominic and other executives.
           -Instructing the cameraman to make technical changes.
           -Arranging the folded paper boats to perfection.
           -Coaxing the boy model to give a perfect smile. 

           Off the FLASH of a photo bulb, we CUT TO:
           THE FINISHED PHOTO FRAME: 

           The boy riding his bike along the river, satchel blowing in 
           the wind just so. The immaculate paper boats floating 
           peacefully as ducks swim happily along. [This image will 
           become an illustration in Curious George Rides a Bike.]

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans works on something more refined than normal -- 

           He draws three people arm-in-arm. A man on either side of a 
           red-headed Margret lookalike. In his iconic hand, he scrawls: 

                               LIBERTÉ. EQUALITÉ. FRATERNITÉ.

                                                        CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS OF PARIS (VARIOUS) - DAY

           Hans’ poster PLASTERED on buildings everywhere around Paris. 

           INT. HOTEL TERRASS - NIGHT

           Art is EVERYWHERE -- like they live in a museum. Hans works 
           at his studio while Margret sleeps. The window is wide open. 
           We see what Hans looks at --

           The EIFFEL TOWER. Lit up perfectly as ever. GEORGE races up 
           the metal spire, dancing boisterously at the top.

           CLOSE ON Hans’ brush strokes, REVEALING what he’s painted --

           A larger than life George, triumphantly atop the Eiffel Tower 
           like King Kong. A perfect piece of POP ART. 

           INT. GALLERY - NIGHT (1938)

           An elegant Parisian gallery. Hans’ paintings -- many of 
           George -- his STYLE COMPLETELY HIS OWN now -- line the walls.

           Hans and Margret, both beaming proudly in FORMAL WEAR, stand 
           beside Alice. Artist friends mix amongst Paris’s finest.

           LATER

           Hans shows a SOCIETY LADY (50s) the painting of George atop 
           the Eiffel Tower. Answering her question -- 

                                 HANS
                        He’s an old friend I can’t let go of.

                                 SOCIETY LADY
                        Trés majestique. I’ll take it.
           Hans shakes with her but stealthily LOOKS UP to the ceiling --

           Making eye contact with George. Who hangs upside down, 
           swinging happily amongst the rafters. A celebratory moment.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margret balances a CHECKBOOK while Hans reads on a sofa. A 
           RADIO softly broadcasts updates about Hitler in Germany.

                                 MARGRET
                        We have to tighten up these next few months. 

                                 HANS
                        What’s the big deal?

                                 MARGRET
                        You should try doing our books sometime.

                                 HANS
                        We practically print money here.

                                 MARGRET
                        And we've been sending most of it back 
                        to Germany.

                                 HANS
                        Rightly so.

                                 MARGRET
                        That’s the point. Helping them is the 
                        priority. But all your other purchases 
                        are leaving us with less than nothing!

           Hans takes a big sip of red wine then raises his glass. 

                                 HANS
                        I’m the toast of the town. The sky 
                        would have to fall before we’re in 
                        serious trouble.

           UNDER THE BED

           George shakes his head. Embarrassed at Hans’ hubris.

           EXT. PARIS ZOO - DAY

           Hans and Margret observe a SERENGETI exhibit. Gazelles and 
           antelopes sprint past the zoo’s iconic BIG ROCK.
                                 HANS
                        Thanks for bringing me here. Whenever 
                        things weren’t going well at home, I’d 
                        always run off to Hamburg’s zoo.

                                 MARGRET
                        You’re too wild an animal to keep 
                        cooped up inside painting all the 
                        time.

           Two giraffes adorably nuzzle up with each other. Their NECKS 
           INTERTWINED as they rest. Hans and Margret laugh at them.

                                 HANS
                        Look at them. They’re not worried in 
                        the least about Hitler.

           Margret takes Hans’ hand.

                                 MARGRET
                        So let’s be a little more like them.

           Hans smiles. They walk and take in the animals.

           A LITTLE LATER

           A pack of squawking OSTRICHES runs around a herd of ZEBRAS. 
           Hans and Margret take in the absurd sight with a small crowd.

           Everyone amused. Except a SMALL BOY (4) with his business-
           like FATHER (40).

                                 FATHER
                        It’s homework time, son. Let’s go.

           The boy -- in love with the animals -- won’t let go of the 
           fence. He cries as his father tries to pick him up.

           Hans taps Margret’s shoulder and rolls his eyes.

                                 HANS
                        The idiot’s going to ruin the boy’s 
                        whole childhood.

                                 MARGRET
                        Oh, Hans.

           Hans pulls a pen and notebook from his pocket. Starts drawing 
           quickly while looking at the animals. He finishes, tears out 
           the drawing, and heads to the boy and his father. 

           Hans -- Margret catching up -- hands the screaming boy the 
           picture. The father is none too pleased.
                                 HANS
                        Go home and listen to your, papa. But 
                        remember this.

           The boy looks at the drawing --

           It’s one ostrich running around madly. He says I WISH I 
           WEREN’T ALWAYS IN SUCH A HURRY.

           Another ostrich -- this one with his HEAD BURIED IN THE SAND -
           - says YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE.

           The boy lets go of the fence, calms down, and laughs.

                                 SMALL BOY
                        I’m ready, papa.

           The father lets down his guard just a bit. Looks to Hans.

                                 FATHER
                              (PICKING UP HIS SON)
                        Merci.

                          MARGRET
                                                            HANS
           Don’t forget to work hard!
                                               Don’t forget to have fun!

           As the father and his son walk away, Hans looks back to the 
           animals. Happy and present in the moment.

           Margret kisses him on the cheek and he puts his arm around 
           her. Still a perfect match.

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - PARIS - DAY (1939)

           A cold, windswept autumn day. Parisians, their scarves 
           wrapped extra tight, go about their business in silence. 

           NEWSSTAND

           Patrons, SOLEMN LIKE MOURNERS, grab the morning rag. The 
           headline says it all: NAZIS INVADE POLAND!

           EXT. CINEMA - DAY 

           Margret leads Hans -- PALE and BUG-EYED -- under a marquee.

           INT. THEATER - DAY

           Hans and Margret sit in a PACKED BUT SILENT theater. Margret 
           glances at Hans -- he’s not doing well. 
           ON THE SCREEN

           A “News du Monde” logo card spins up over corny music. A few 
           Morse code signals bring a transition to news footage:

           -Hitler gives a speech to Nazi troops. Thousands Sieg Heil.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        Hitler’s war machine has been 
                        mobilized against neighboring Poland 
                        to the east.

           -Nazi tanks advance in formation. German bombers overhead.

                        In a blindingly fast attack the 
                        Germans have dubbed Blitzkrieg, the 
                        Nazis overwhelmed the ill-equipped 
                        Polish forces.

           -Polish forces ride to battle on horseback with archaic guns.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Although the battle is only days old, it 
                        looks like the Poles will soon surrender.

           -Decimated Polish cities. Nazis celebrate triumphantly.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hitler has promised he’s not 
                        interested in wider war. But can the 
                        world be sure?

           ON HANS: WHITE AS A GHOST. Like he just saw the devil.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - SUNSET

           Hans and Margret walk home. Hans is a zombie.

                                 HANS
                        This was not supposed to happen. It 
                        was the War to End All Wars, Margret.

                                 MARGRET
                        The war is just in the east. We’ll get 
                        all our family out. And we’re safe in 
                        Paris for now.

                                 HANS
                        War ruins everything. You were too 
                        young last time to understand.

           She tries to hold his hand. But he keeps them in his coat.
                                 MARGRET
                        I know you experienced horrible events 
                        I didn’t. But I will not let this one 
                        destroy us. 

           EXT. TERASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           A BLACKOUT. All the lights turned off in Paris.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           The room is eerily dark. Margret sleeps. Hans, George perched 
           on his shoulder, paces by the open window. He looks unwell.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’s no reason to sulk.

           Hans and George whisper to each other.

                                 HANS
                        I don’t like all this one bit, old friend.

                                 GEORGE
                        You don’t seem like yourself. 

                                 HANS
                        I’m not made for all this. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I wish we could all go back to Brazil. It 
                        was so easy for you to draw there.

           Hans looks to Margret, sound asleep. A certain MELANCHOLY in 
           his eyes.

                                 HANS
                        It’s not so simple anymore.

           Hans and George look out the window:

           HANS’ POV: Paris is DARK and BLEAK. Only the faintest outline 
           of the Eiffel Tower visible in the distance.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever seen anything so sad?

           George shakes his head slowly and sympathetically.

           Margret stirs a bit. Half-asleep, she mumbles --

                                 MARGRET
                        Hans?
           George scurries down from Hans’ shoulder. Tucks himself in a 
           ball along Hans’ chest, away from Margret.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        Come back to bed.

                                 HANS
                              (APOLOGETICALLY)
                        I’ll just disturb you.

           Margret settles and falls asleep again. 

           George grabs a paintbrush from Hans’ easel. He tries to hand 
           it to Hans. But Hans shakes his head no -- the paintbrush 
           falls to the ground.

           Hans looks back over the dark city, squeezing George tight.

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - PARIS

           SNOW FLAKES whip around the hazy city. The BUSINESSES EMPTY. 

           But the BOULEVARDS ARE PACKED with cars and bicycles -- all 
           headed OUT of Paris to escape a feared invasion.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                              (SCREAMING TO REFUGEES)
                        You must have papers to leave the 
                        city! You must have papers!

           One of Hans’ POSTERS blows off a building into the crowds.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans -- gaunt, with bags under his eyes -- sits on a chair 
           gazing out the closed window. Margret packs her purse and 
           puts on a winter jacket.

                                 MARGRET
                        Will you please paint today? 

           Hans doesn’t respond. In his own world. Margret annoyed.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        I need to get more wires done. 

           No response. Hans watches refugees on BIKES pour downhill.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        There are horrible rumors, Hans! That 
                        they’re shipping Jews out of Germany. 
                        Never to be seen again.

           Hans turns to her but hasn’t really processed what she said.
                                 HANS
                        All the people leaving the city have 
                        bicycles. I’d love if we had them, too.

                                 MARGRET
                        Bicycles? You want us to buy bikes now?

                                 HANS
                        I’ve always loved them... It wouldn’t be 
                        so bad, is all I’m saying.

                                 MARGRET
                        It’s no time for childish things, Hans!

                                 HANS
                        You sound like my father.

                                 MARGRET
                        It’s a matter of life and death in Germany. 
                        The fascists and Nazi sympathizers are 
                        demonstrating here in Paris. And you fancy 
                        a bike! 

           Hans shrugs -- doesn’t have the right answer.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m going. Please get some work done.

           She turns and leaves, closing the door behind her.

           George -- emaciated and weak -- trudges to Hans. Hans bends 
           to pick up his friend.

                                 GEORGE
                        A bike ride sure does sound nice. She 
                        just doesn’t understand real artists.

                                 HANS
                        Are we going to make it?

                                 GEORGE
                        Long as I’m here, we’ll make due.

           George extends his spindly arm, grasping Hans’ hand. Hold on.

           EXT. PLACE DE LA CONCORDE - DAY

           Margret -- on her way to the bank -- walks by Paris’s 
           beautiful central square where NAZI SYMPATHIZERS PROTEST -- 

           It’s a VIOLENT RUCKUS. The Fascists carry clubs, chant 
           hateful things, and wave ANTI-SEMITIC and PRO-HITLER banners. 
           They’re confronted by civilians and FRENCH SOLDIERS.
           Margret tightens her scarf, holds her purse close to her 
           body, and strides past the savage rally.  

           INT. ALICE AND GERTRUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hans enters the stately apartment. But he CAN’T BELIEVE WHAT 
           HE SEES --

           Alice -- letting him in -- is BEAT UP with horrible BRUISES 
           on her face. She walks with a LIMP. Gertrude -- in the 
           background -- lies on a couch with an ICE BAG on her head. 

           The apartment’s furnishing is BOXED UP, ready to move. 

                                 HANS
                        Alice! What in the world happened to 
                        you two? Are you all right?

                                 ALICE
                              (PAINED)
                        We’ll be fine. 

           Hans tenderly puts his arm around her shoulder. 

                                 HANS
                        Was it a robber? How can I help?

                                 ALICE
                        If it were only a robber.
                              (BEAT)
                        We went to protest the Nazi lovers. 

                                 HANS
                        This is France, not Germany! We can 
                        protest freely here. What problem did 
                        they have with you?

                                 ALICE
                        One of the fascists must have 
                        recognized us. We’re blacklisted by 
                        the Nazis. They have an agenda against 
                        artists who speak out... And 
                        homosexuals. 
                              (POINTS TO GERTRUDE)
                        We fit the bill on both accounts.

           They sit on love seats across from Gertrude. 

                                 HANS
                        I am so sorry. I’m worried about you now.
                                 ALICE
                        We’ll be fine. Your path is much 
                        harder, much more dangerous, Hans. 
                        You’ll need all the help you can get.

                                 HANS
                              (SHEEPISHLY)
                        I suppose that’s why I’m here.
                              (BEAT)
                        We’re out of money. Flat broke. It’s 
                        all going to save our family. And 
                        there’s no work. Nothing. 

           Alice nods along -- she gets it.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Can you help scrounge up some work for 
                        Margret or me?

                                 ALICE
                        Hans...

           Hans just looks at her -- scared of what’s coming next.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        We’re moving back to the U.S. It’s not 
                        safe for people like us here anymore. 
                              (BEAT)
                        I don’t know how, but you and Margret 
                        must escape before it’s too late.

           Hans’ face sinks into his palms. Can’t handle the news.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Please send Margret our love. 

           EXT. WINDOW - TERRASS HOTEL - DAY/NIGHT [TIMELAPSE]

           Hans stands at his easel -- UNABLE TO PAINT -- as days, 
           night, snow, rain, Margret, George all pass by behind him.

                                 FRENCH RADIO BROADCASTER (O.S.)
                        In this frigid winter, nineteen forty 
                        begins like nineteen thirty nine 
                        ended. Hitler wages war throughout 
                        Europe. And the French are left to 
                        ponder their fate.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margret, at the kitchen table, marks up black and white 
           photos with chalk. Finishing the pile, she looks up at --
           Hans -- frustrated, dry brush in hand -- standing at his 
           easel. A few stray pencil lines. Otherwise a blank canvas.

                                 MARGRET
                        Can I help you, Hans?

                                 HANS
                        You can’t help me do what I do.

           Margret stands, grabs an ENVELOPE, and walks to him. Wants to 
           reassure him. But he moves away and sets down the brush.

                                 MARGRET
                        I don’t want to stress you.

                                 HANS
                        I’m losing it. The magic touch. The 
                        part of me where the art comes from.

           She puts her hands on his shoulders and draws him close.

           UNDER THE BED

           George lies, SHIVERING AND WEAK. Struggles to wipe his nose.

                                 MARGRET (O.S.)
                        I won’t allow that.

           As George trembles with fever, he barely manages to crack a 
           smile at Margret’s hopefulness. 

           MARGRET

           Holds up the envelope. Smiling optimistically.

                                 MARGRET
                        We got a letter from your parents. 
                        They’re in Rio finally! Can I read it?

           Hans nods. Margret reads, but we hear ABRAHAM’S VOICE --

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO (VARIOUS) - DAY

           -Abraham and Sarah arrive on a BANANA BOAT to the sunny bay.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        We’ve made it safely to Brazil at last.

           -Their GERMAN PASSPORTS are STAMPED with BRAZILIAN VISAS.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        Margret, we’re so grateful for your 
                        diligence in securing our papers.
           -Hans’ parents, WEAK now, drag their bags to a new apartment 
           in the colorful, lively city. A BRIGHT PARROT flies by.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        We see why you were so charmed here.

           -In candlelight, Abraham, wiping away TEARS, writes a letter.

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        But we must warn you. The situation in 
                        Germany is truly dire. Do not believe 
                        what you hear about Hitler’s mercy. 

           BACK TO MARGRET

           She reads solemnly. Her voice mixing with Abraham’s.

                                 MARGRET AND ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        He is bloodthirsty. A murderer of 
                        innocents. And he will turn west for 
                        France, destroying all you hold dear. 
                        Hans, you must act with the utmost 
                        maturity in these days. Love, your 
                        mother and father.

           ON: Hans, DEFEATED. And still resentful of his father.

                                 HANS
                        It’s hopeless, Margret.

                                 MARGRET
                        No. Not yet. We need to get out of 
                        here. Escape. Before it’s too late.

                                 HANS
                        How? We’re out of money. I’m blocked. 
                        There’s no work.

                                 MARGRET
                        I’ll do my best. But I’m depending on 
                        you. We’re partners. You understand, 
                        Hans? 

           CLOSE ON HANS: IMPOTENT. Feeling like a letdown in advance.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margret sleeps in bed. She rolls over to hug Hans. But finds 
           no one there.

           Margret wakes and sits up in bed. Sad. Frustrated. Alone.
           EXT. MONTMARTRE - CONTINUOUS

           The lights are out. The streets are empty and coated with 
           dirty snow. The windmill of the Moulin Rouge stands still.

           Hans, shivering, sits on a sidewalk bench. GEORGE peaks out 
           the top of his parka, trembling as snow collects on his fur.

           Hans feels George’s forehead like he’s taking a baby’s 
           temperature. He’s feverish -- Hans can’t hide his concern.

                                 HANS
                        George, you’re not doing well.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t worry about me. You need to get 
                        better. To make art again.

                                 HANS
                        But I can’t when you’re like this.

           Hans hangs his head. But he and George hear something --

           A DOOR CLOSING. FOOTSTEPS. They turn to look to a nearby --

           ALLEY

           A GERMAN FAMILY of four -- mother and father (30s), son (14), 
           and daughter (7) -- are all bundled up and dragging 
           suitcases. They try to silently sneak away.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Hold it right there, Krauts!

           A small group of FRENCH SOLDIERS with guns run to the family.

                                 GERMAN FATHER
                        I’m a professor. I’ve lived here for 
                        years. We’re going to the U.S.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        Show us your papers! How do we know 
                        you’re not spies?

           The soldiers TACKLE the father to the ground. The wife and 
           son -- HORRIFIED -- GUNS in their faces -- raise their hands. 

           The little girl wanders a few steps away from the melee. Her 
           HEARTBROKEN EYES notice Hans. She STARES at him --

           HANS

           Can barely look back. Old trauma flooding back. He fights 
           away tears as George, startled, hides away in the parka.
           But he decides to speak up --

                                 HANS
                        Leave them alone! They’re innocent!

           MOMENTS LATER

           A French soldier sits on Hans chest, pressing his BILLY CLUB 
           down across Hans’ neck. Hans squirms, trying to kick free.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        A Brazilian with a Kraut accent? 

           Hans reaches in his pocket and pulls out a passport.

                                 HANS
                        Look. Here’s my passport and visa and 
                        work permit!

           The soldier eyes the papers as he knees hard into Hans’ gut.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        How do I know you’re not working for 
                        the Nazis?

           Hans, in pain, thinks for a moment then blurts out --

                                 HANS
                        I’m a Jewish artist. What would I want 
                        with the Nazis?

           The soldier looks at him with contempt but lifts up the billy 
           club from his neck. Hans GASPS in air.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        Get your filthy ass inside. No one 
                        wants you here either.

           The French Soldier SPITS A FAT HAWKER in Hans face and walks 
           away.

           Hans -- covered in spit -- lies in SHAME on the snow.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Hans -- DISTRAUGHT -- enters and takes off his snowy parka. 
           George climbs down Hans’ body at a snail’s pace and labors 
           his way under the bed, where Margret sleeps.

           As Hans crosses to the bed, Margret STIRS AWAKE.

                                 MARGRET
                        Where were you? What happened?
                                 HANS
                        I needed some fresh air.

                                 MARGRET
                        In a snowstorm? In a blackout?!?

                                 HANS
                        I just saw French soldiers round up an 
                        innocent German family -- kids and all. 
                        For no good reason other than the fact 
                        that they’re German. And then they... 
                        ugh... This war, all this pointless 
                        hatred... It’s madness!

                                 MARGRET
                        Exactly why you shouldn’t be outside by 
                        yourself in the middle of the night!

           Hans lets out a guttural GROAN of frustration. 

           UNDER THE BED

           George -- skinnier and unhealthier than ever -- PACES 
           NERVOUSLY as he watches Hans and Margret fight.

           ROOM

                                 HANS
                        I’m not perfect. I’m not like you. 

                                 MARGRET
                        I’m not asking you to be perfect.

                                 HANS
                        Yes, you are. Constantly. Always 
                        telling me what a disappointment I am.

           BEAT. Margret opens up, fighting back her tears. 

                                 MARGRET
                        I spent every moment of my life until 
                        I met you wishing that I had what you 
                        do. Your talent. Your access to some 
                        amazing wild and free artistic 
                        spirit. You have what I pray for. So 
                        instead of running away or living in 
                        jealousy, I decided I’d partner with 
                        you. In every way, Hans. With 
                        everything I can give. And I support 
                        you, because you have a gift I never 
                        will. But -- I want you to know this 
                        and think about it -- I’ve given up a 
                        lot so that you can pursue your 
                        talents.
                                 HANS
                        No one asked you to give anything up.

           Margret blows up!

                                 MARGRET
                        Oh, grow up, Hans! Give up your 
                        childish fantasies that someone is 
                        always going to be there to save you 
                        when you fall on your ass.

                                 HANS
                        If I changed to be what you want, I’d 
                        be about as good an artist as you are.

           Margret CRACKS -- emotions finally running free.

                                 MARGRET
                        What would you do alone? Without me?

           Hans’ eyes twitch nervously. He doesn’t say anything.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                              (OVER TEARS)
                        What would you do? Tell me!

           Hans breaks down. Stutters. Shakes. Not fully in control. 

                                 HANS
                        Please not, Margret.
                              (BEAT)
                        It’s just... You don’t know...

           Hans -- PANIC-STRICKEN -- glances around. Looking for George.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        There are some things...
                              (BEAT -- SOFTLY)
                        George?

           He walks past Margret to look under the bed.

           Margret stares at him. Putting the pieces together.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        George? Where... What’s going on?

                                 MARGRET
                              (GENTLY)
                        Look at me Hans.

           Hans turns around sheepishly. But he won’t look up at her.
                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right. It really is.

                                 HANS
                        I don’t know what I’d do. Without you.
                              (PAUSING IN EMBARRASSMENT)
                        Or without...

                                 MARGRET
                        Hans, I understand. I see -- I finally 
                        see -- what you’re going through.  

           Hans looks up at her. 

                                 HANS
                        You do?

                                 MARGRET
                        I do. I see him. And I understand.

           GEORGE appears out of thin air right next to Hans. His head 
           hung in shame, just like Hans’. 

                                 HANS
                        You were never supposed to see us like 
                        this. 

           We LINGER ON MARGRET. She’s not exactly mad. Her face is 
           filled with all kinds of emotions -- understanding, empathy, 
           but also pain. 

           And now we see the image of the puzzle Margret has finally 
           put together:

           Her beloved husband in pain. And, by his side, George, the 
           IMAGINARY LIKENESS of his pet monkey from Brazil. Both little 
           boys caught red-handed. And both -- with the same posture and 
           expression -- desperate not to get in trouble.

                        HANS (CONT'D)
           Please forgive us.
                                                           GEORGE
                                               Please forgive us.

                                 MARGRET
                        I finally see what you’ve been going 
                        through. You don’t need to apologize 
                        for it.

           Hans fights back tears.

                                 HANS
                        I’ve been hiding George since we got 
                        to Paris. It’s embarrassing really.
                                 MARGRET
                        You’ve been touched in some way most 
                        of us haven’t been. And that’s part of 
                        the reason I fell in love with you in 
                        the first place. It’s messy and 
                        complicated, but it’s also beautiful 
                        and inspirational. 

           George smiles to Margret -- glad she gets him. He now glances 
           to Hans. They’re both RELIEVED.

                                 HANS
                        Can George stay with us?

           Margret speaks calmly but firmly --

                                 MARGRET
                        No. Not that George.

           The imaginary George DISAPPEARS from Hans’ side. But Hans 
           remains calms, hanging on Margret’s next word --  

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea, Hans. And it’s the 
                        best I’ve ever had. 

                                 HANS
                        What is it? 

                                 MARGRET
                        Come here. Look at your easel.

           Hans shuffles to Margret. They hold hands.

           Margret points to the BLANK CANVAS on Hans’ easel.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        Can you see him?

           CLOSE ON HANS: In childlike AWE. As he watches --

           AN ILLUSTRATED CURIOUS GEORGE APPEARS ON THE CANVAS AS IF 
           HANS’ IS DRAWING HIM.

                                 HANS
                        Of course I see him. I can’t believe 
                        you do, too.

           Margret smiles at him.

           THE ROOM AROUND THEM SLOWLY TRANSFORMS INTO HANS’ 
           ILLUSTRATIONS.
                                 MARGRET
                        I see him. I see George. And I see his 
                        whole world. And his adventures.

           The STARS, pulsing in a hand-drawn yellow, shine extra 
           bright. An illustrated EIFFEL TOWER a little too close.

           Hans turns around, taking in this world of his own 
           imagination.

           Their possessions TRANSFORM, FLOATING around them. It’s as if 
           they’re being transported into Hans’ mind.

                                 HANS
                        Oh... Wow...

           Margret circles Hans. Her attention shifting between him and 
           the new world around them. A beautiful waltz of artistic 
           creation. 

                                 MARGRET
                        And I see the kids that will love 
                        George just as much as you do. 
                              (BEAT)
                        We have to tell George’s story. 
                        Together.

           Now the work-in-progress George JUMPS OFF THE CANVAS and 
           stands before Hans and Margret. He smiles to them.

                                 HANS
                        You’ve never looked better, old 
                        friend.

           Margret squares up to Hans and takes his hands in hers. 
           Inches from his face, she speaks gently but passionately --

                                 MARGRET
                        Your gift is your curse, Hans. The 
                        gods have touched you, but they throw 
                        obstacles in your way, too. 
                              (BEAT -- EARNEST)
                        We have one chance to survive. And 
                        that’s by you and me working through 
                        this obstacle... Together. We’re going 
                        to turn George into something good, 
                        something that’ll last forever, 
                        something that will help other people. 

           The version of George from the canvas bounces to Margret and 
           hops up into her arms.
                                 HANS
                        You’re more brilliant and stronger 
                        than I could ever be. No one gives you 
                        the credit you deserve, Margret. But I 
                        see it. And I want everyone else to.

           There are no more important words she could hear right now.

           George, in Margret’s arms, nods in approval.

                                 MARGRET
                        Our lives depend on this, Hans. We’ll 
                        have to get to work quickly.

           INT. PUBLISHER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margret, alone, sits across from Guy, the resentful 
           children’s publisher. He’s just listened to her pitch.

                                 GUY
                        You want me to pay you for that? 

                                 MARGRET
                        Yes! This book will sell thousands of 
                        copies. Maybe more. Kids need it now.

                                 GUY
                        It’s kindergarten Freud wrapped in 
                        what I’m sure will be overly 
                        sentimental illustrations.

                                 MARGRET
                        Not at all...

           Margret leans over and pulls an early illustration of George 
           from her bag. She PROUDLY DISPLAYS IT for Guy.

                                 GUY
                              (SARCASTIC)
                        I can hear the cash registers now.

                                 MARGRET
                        How about just a small advance?

           He snickers.

                                 GUY
                        Europe’s at war! There’s no money for 
                        frivolous ideas. The Nazis are coming for 
                        us next. Or can your woman’s mind not 
                        understand that?
                                 MARGRET
                        Good stories are important for kids 
                        during times of war, Monsieur Lafayette. 

                                 GUY

                        himself the next time he has a half-
                        baked idea for a book. 

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margaret -- DEJECTED but attempting to hide it -- enters. But 
           what she sees couldn’t thrill her more --

           Hans working at his easel. Really FOCUSED in. She’s shocked --

                                 MARGRET
                        You’re painting!

           Hans steps aside to reveal a self-portrait of his younger 
           self. In the painting, young Hans smokes his dad’s pipe while 
           wearing his pajamas. Abraham, in a black suit, looks on with 
           astonishment. It’s almost the iconic image from the book.

           Margret approaches the easel. Taking in the canvas.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        That’s some of your best work.

                                 HANS
                        He said yes, right? They bought the book?

           Margret takes Hans’ hands in hers. Expecting an outburst.

                                 MARGRET
                        No.

           A LONG BEAT as Margret waits for Hans’ reaction. 

                                 HANS
                        Can we still work on it together?

           START MUSIC/FANTASY MONTAGE - THE WRITING OF CURIOUS GEORGE

           (This sequence is a WHIRLWIND OF CREATIVITY AND ART. Hans and 
           Margret create the CURIOUS GEORGE BOOKS as we know them. 
           CURIOUS GEORGE ILLUSTRATIONS flip across half the screen as 
           if a book is being read. On the other side of frame, reality 
           and imagination mix.)

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans and Margret brainstorm at the table.
                                 HANS
                        There was nothing special that 
                        happened to me before the war! 

           Margret bursts up -- trying to spark Hans.

                                 MARGRET
                        What about all the crazy stories about 
                        your childhood you told me in Rio? The 
                        time you threw the spaghetti all over 
                        the kitchen! When you ran away under 
                        the elephant’s ear at the zoo and half 
                        of Hamburg went searching for you! 

           Margret has excited Hans. He moves to his easel to sketch --

           BLACK AND WHITE SCENES FROM THE BOOK APPEAR AROUND HANS AND 
           MARGRET. But Hans -- drawn as a child -- appears instead of 
           George in the sketches.

           EXT. CAFE - [ANOTHER] DAY

           They sip coffee while Margret critiques some early sketches. 
           They’re all of YOUNG HANS getting in trouble -- no George.

                                 MARGRET
                        There’s something missing here!

           Margret reaches down beside her into her purse and pulls out 
           the illustration she showed Guy. 

           GEORGE springs to life from the page. 

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        But he’s missing in the book. He 
                        always has to be there...
                              (OFF HANS’ NODDING)
                        Hans... George is you.

           The EPIPHANY of a lifetime registers on Hans’ face as George 
           climbs onto Margret’s shoulder.

                                 HANS
                        You’re saying... George needs to take 
                        my place in the book? 

           Margret and George both enthusiastically nod yes. 

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        Did I ever tell you you’re a genius?

           Margret beams -- appreciates the gratification for once.
           EXT. SEINE - [ANOTHER] DAY

           Hans and Margret walk by the river where Margret had her 
           photo shoot. But now the river, boats, and ducks are drawn in 
           Hans’ hand. George bounds behind them.

                                 MARGRET
                        George’s mishaps... They’re kind of 
                        sad and pathetic unless someone is 
                        there to appreciate his effort and set 
                        him back on the right path.

                                 HANS
                        Are you trying to say something about me?

                                 MARGRET
                        Hans, George needs a friend. No... a 
                        mentor. No... A partner, Hans!

                                 HANS
                        Someone to save him when he gets a bit 
                        too curious.

                                 MARGRET
                        Right. To bring out the best him. 
                        Point him in the right direction.

                                 HANS
                        That’s you, Margret.

           Hans stops. We see what he’s picturing --

           MARGRET -- dressed in the YELLOW OUTFIT and HAT FROM her 
           first day in Brazil -- is drawn in frame. 

           Margret looks at the illustrated version of herself. She’s 
           genuinely touched.

                                 MARGRET
                        It doesn’t feel right with the rest of 
                        the book. 
                              (BEAT -- THOUGHTFULLY)
                        It should be your father. He was the 
                        first one there for you. He deserves 
                        it. It’s what’s best for the story. 
                        Trust me.

                                 HANS
                        You sure?

           Margret nods yes.

           ABRAHAM - his SHARPLY POINTED NOSE recognizable instantly -- 
           appears drawn in frame. He wears one of his formal suits. 
           The illustration of his father smiles at Hans. The ultimate 
           seal of approval Hans needs from his dad.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        He should be wearing a yellow outfit. 
                        Like when you came into my life and 
                        saved me. 

           The illustrated characters glance at each other. Margret and 
           Abraham meld into THE MAN WITH THE YELLOW HAT.

                                 MARGRET
                        I don’t know if I saved you.

                                 HANS
                        You did. And you’re doing it again.

           Margret BEAMS at the MAN WITH THE YELLOW HAT, who now holds 
           George. 

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           The whole room is illustrated in the style of Curious George. 
           Hans and Margret -- George resting between them -- snuggle 
           under the covers. 

                                 MARGRET
                        You know what scene we need?

                                 HANS
                        When I wrecked my new bike?

           George pops a wheelie in front of them. Margret watches in 
           astonishment but shakes her head no.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        When I painted the walls like a jungle?

           Laborers walk out the door, leaving cans of paint behind. 
           George quickly paints the wall like a forest with palm trees, 
           a giraffe, two leopards, and a zebra. Margret shakes her head 
           no again.

                                 MARGRET
                        The first time we met!

                                 HANS
                        And certainly not the last time you 
                        saw me get carried away.

           As Hans kisses Margret --
           The whole frame dissolves into George hanging onto 
           balloons... Sailing out their window... Through the window.. 
           Over Paris... And now it’s the illustration from the book.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans finishes a frame from the book at his easel. It’s George 
           smoking The Man’s pipe. Margret inspects and critiques --

                                 MARGRET
                        Almost. But make George a little more 
                        innocent. A kid who can’t help himself.

           Hans nods along in agreement.

                                 HANS
                        They always said I was touched. But 
                        I’ve never seen anyone so in control 
                        of their art as you are right now.

                                 MARGRET
                              (MODESTLY)
                        Let’s focus on the book.

           Hans takes her note. Adjusts George’s mouth with his brush.

                                 HANS
                        How’s the story coming?

                                 MARGRET
                        “He was a monkey. Very curious. Too 
                        much so, in fact.”
                              (BEAT -- NOT HAPPY)
                        Not quite there yet.

                                 HANS
                        You’ll get it! What’s next for me?

                                 MARGRET
                        The Man With The Yellow Hat coming in. 
                        He’s not mad, but can’t hide his 
                        disappointment. Still charmed all the 
                        while.

           Hans nods, understanding all too well, and gets back to work.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Hans sleeps in bed. Margret -- pacing -- talks out the text 
           of the book. Scratching and rewriting. Finished illustrations 
           beside her.
           Margret smiles -- she’s cracked a great line --

                                 MARGRET
                        “George promised to be good. But it’s 
                        easy for little monkeys to forget.”

           AN AIR RAID SIREN SOUNDS, practically shaking the elegant 
           buildings of Paris. A LOW DRONING NOISE hums in the sky.

           Hans BURSTS AWAKE. Jolts up. His face a fear-stricken boy’s.

                                 HANS
                        The war is here! It’s here, Margret!

           Margret gets up and hurries to him, but Hans rushes past her 
           toward the window. THE DRONING GROWS LOUDER.

           Hans tears open the curtains -- a formation of NAZI FIGHTER 
           PLANES flies past the Eiffel Tower.

           Hans can’t take his eyes off them. Years of repressed trauma 
           bubbling to the surface.

           Margret walks to the kitchen and turns on the radio. Between 
           the air raid sirens, we HEAR --

                                 NEWSCASTER (RADIO)
                        The Nazis have launched a surprise 
                        invasion from Belgium. The Germans 
                        have bypassed the Maginot Line and are 
                        rapidly advancing toward Paris...

           As the radio broadcast continues, Hans sits on the bed. Tears 
           stream down his face as he looks up at Margret.

                                 HANS
                        I can’t do it again.

           Margret remains STOIC. She looks at Hans right in the eyes.

                                 MARGRET
                        We must Hans. Selling the book is the 
                        only way we can escape the Nazis. We 
                        need the money for tickets and papers 
                        and... all the bribes we’ll have to 
                        pay.

           He shakes his head No. Ready to give up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah right. Us against the greatest 
                        war machine ever assembled?
                                 MARGRET
                        There are children that need George 
                        right now. Our art can help kids get 
                        through this. We must.

           Hans stands. Nodding. Inspired by his wife’s conviction.

           INT. TERASS HOTEL - DAY

           Hans stares out his window. His CANVAS BLANK. Margret stands 
           at the wall where she’s PINNED up Hans’ drawings next to 
           corresponding NOTE CARDS. She inspects the story closely. 

                                 HANS
                        Now they’re all coming back to Paris. 
                        As if they’ll be safe here. Fools.

           HANS’ POV: The streets of Montmartre packed full of desperate 
           REFUGEES. Many of them on BICYCLES.

                                 MARGRET
                        We can’t worry about anything else 
                        right now.

                                 HANS
                        Easy for you to say. I’m missing the 
                        one thing, the one person that—

                                 MARGRET
                              (CUTTING HIM OFF GENTLY)
                        What are you missing?

           Hans stands and looks at Margret. Really takes her in, 
           appreciating her love. He CLOSES THE DRAPES -- understanding 
           he’s not missing a damn thing.

                                 HANS
                        I need you, Margret. Help me finish 
                        the book.

           Margret walks towards his canvas. Takes his hand.

                                 MARGRET
                        George is going to finish the story at 
                        the zoo. Please paint George patiently 
                        waiting for his next adventure.

           Hans grabs a brush. Margret smiles with quiet satisfaction.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Margret holds Hans’ finished illustrations together as a 
           book. She flips through them, studying them intently. 
           Hans at her side waiting for her judgment. Margret inspects 
           the drawing closely -- sees that something is missing.

                                 MARGRET
                        We can’t just print the story next to 
                        the illustrations. You’ll have to write 
                        out the words as a part of the 
                        pictures. It’s all one piece of art!

           ON HANS: WORRIED that it’ll destroy his illustrations.

                                 HANS
                        But the text. It’s inelegant...

                                 MARGRET
                        No, Hans. The lettering will be gentle 
                        but firm. Like a parent creating a 
                        story with their child. And because 
                        you’re doing it, it’ll fit in 
                        perfectly. It’s not just a story. And 
                        not just a picture book. It’s a—

           Hans -- so satisfied by her pitch -- finishes her sentence.

                                 HANS
                        Myth!

                                 MARGRET
                        The highest form of art.

           LATER

           -Hans uses a brush to write Margret’s words on his paintings. 
           Margret stands next to him reading the opening of the book.

                                 MARGRET (V.O.)
                        “What a nice little monkey,” he thought. 

           -She smiles at Hans’ attention to detail.

                                 MARGRET (V.O.)
                        “I would like to take him home with me.”

           -The sun sets outside. Hans finishes the last words.

                                 MARGRET (V.O.)
                        “What a nice place for George to live!”

           -Hans and Margret admire the finished book. Notice BOTH Hans’ 
           and Margret’s names on the FRONT COVER.
           INT. PUBLISHER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margret stands tall in front of Guy’s desk -- flipping 
           through the book. Air raid sirens wail in the background. Guy 
           is less cocksure right now -- HUMBLED by the fear of war.

                                 GUY
                        Well, it is a lovely kid’s book. 

                                 MARGRET
                        It’s not just a kid’s book! Or some 
                        silly drawings. It’s a timeless myth.

                                 GUY 
                        Let me see it.

           He stands and reaches for the manuscript. Eyes it closely. 
           Runs his fingers over BOTH THEIR NAMES on the cover.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Brilliant how he incorporated the 
                        words into his illustrations.

                                 MARGRET
                        That was my idea.

                                 GUY
                              (CONDESCENDING)
                        Right, dear. 

           He looks up at her. A long, tense beat. Finally --

                                 MARGRET
                        Are you going to buy it?

                                 GUY
                        I guess the war is here now. 
                              (PAUSE -- DEFEATED)
                        And children are going to need a good 
                        story.

                                 MARGRET
                        Glad to hear you’ve come around to see 
                        it that way. Dear.

                                 GUY
                        Four-thousand francs is all we can do.

                                 MARGRET
                        Six thousand. And we’ll retain the 
                        international rights in case we move.

                                 GUY
                        Ha! Good luck getting out of Paris!
                                 MARGRET
                        We keep the international rights.

                                 GUY
                        Four thousand. You keep international 
                        rights. And we take your name off the 
                        cover to keep things... simple. Hans 
                        drew the pictures and wrote the words. 
                        Why confuse anyone simply to flatter 
                        your pride?

           ON MARGRET: This blow hurts. But she needs to cut a deal.

                                 MARGRET
                        Five thousand. We keep international 
                        rights. And... only Hans gets 
                        credit... To keep it simple.

           They shake. Margret unsure how to feel.

                                 GUY
                        You’re a hell of a wife. Send Hans my 
                        felicitations.

           INT. HALLWAY - PUBLISHING OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Margret STRIDES down the hall -- she knows she’s won the war. 
           She HUGS the manuscript to her chest with crossed arms. But 
           it hurts like hell to have lost the battle for her credit.

           CLOSE ON MARGRET: An avalanche of emotions. 

           She laughs at herself -- can’t believe what she pulled off. 
           Then she glowers -- PISSED OFF at Guy’s disrespect. Finally 
           she’s OVERCOME BY IT ALL -- TEARS RUN DOWN HER CHEEKS.

           Drying her cheeks with her forearms, SHE KEEPS ON GOING. 

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - DAY

           Margret enters, holding the manuscript under one arm and a 
           fat MANILA ENVELOPE extended with the other.

                                 MARGRET
                        He bought the book. We have five 
                        thousand francs to escape.

           Hans, sitting by the window, bursts up. He rushes to her. But 
           she stops his embrace. She’s not as excited as he expected.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        It’s not time to celebrate yet.
                                 HANS
                        What’s wrong? 

           Margret shrugs.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        What happened with him?

                                 MARGRET
                        It’s not a big deal... He demanded 
                        that we take my name off the cover. 
                        It’s just you getting the credit... 
                        But... What can we do? 

           Hans eyes widen -- ready to commit a grave crime.

                                 HANS
                        Are you kidding me? It was your idea! 
                        I should go choke that little weasel.

           Margret grabs his arms to calm him.

                                 MARGRET
                        I made him give us the international 
                        rights. The best thing we can do right 
                        now is survive. And then sell our 
                        beautiful book all over the world. If 
                        people like it as much as we think, 
                        history will work itself out.

           Hans is awed by his wife.

                                 HANS
                        You’re an amazing woman. You better 
                        get the credit you deserve one day.

                                 MARGRET
                        We’ll worry about that one day. Right 
                        now, I’ll get our papers in order.

                                 HANS
                        Papers are man’s stupidest creation!

                                 MARGRET
                        But necessary if we’re going to get to 
                        America where the book will be safe.

                                 HANS
                        Well... Can I do something?

           She hands him the pages of Curious George.

                                 MARGRET
                        You can guard the manuscript. 
           ON HANS: Frustrated. Doesn’t want to be useless.

                                 HANS
                        I want to get us bicycles.

                                 MARGRET
                        We have five thousand francs to our 
                        name. Do you really—

                                 HANS
                              (CUTTING HER OFF)
                        Most of the refugees have them. I know 
                        we’ll need them. Please trust me. 

           She measures him up and agrees to it. Hands him some CASH. 

           I/E. VARIOUS - PARIS - DAY

           -CLOSE ON: A VISA gets STAMPED on Brazilian passport pages.

           -Margret pushes her way through a JAM-PACKED train station.

           -CLOSE ON: Margret hands over a STACK OF CASH in return for 
           TWO TRAIN TICKETS. The most beautiful thing she’s ever seen.

           -Margret leaves the busy train station. IMMENSELY SATISFIED.

           START BIKE MONTAGE - VARIOUS BICYCLE SHOPS - DAY

           -Hans tries to enter a bike shop. The door won’t open. A 
           shopkeeper inside points to a sign. It reads: SOLD OUT.

           -Hans stands in another bike shop. The racks are completely 
           empty. He’s STUNNED. A GIRL (12) -- probably the shopkeeper’s 
           daughter -- looks up at him.

                                 BIKE SHOP GIRL
                        What do you expect, Monsieur?

           -Hans pokes around a small, dusty, slightly sad bike shop. 
           SPARE PARTS messily stacked in heaps. The SHOPKEEPER (80) is 
           a hunched-over elderly gentleman with an asthmatic wheeze.

                                 HANS
                        Can I buy your spare parts?

                                 ASTHMATIC BIKE SHOPKEEPER
                        They won’t make a full bicycle.

                                 HANS
                        You got nothing? No bikes?

           The shopkeeper shrugs. Nope, sorry. He turns away from Hans.
           Hans is ready to give up. A certain sad desperation overtakes 
           his face. Until... He NOTICES behind the front counter --

           A rusty, old TWO-SEATER CIRCUS BIKE with a COMICALLY-LARGE 
           BASKET and big RIBBON BOW on the front.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        I need that.

           -Shopkeeper gives him a quizzical glance. But Hans 
           commandeers the old man’s shop. 

           -Hans SAWS the bike apart. LOWERS the seats. SANDS off rust. 

           -Hans takes the ribbon off. TRIMS the basket to normal size.

           -Shopkeeper coughs up a lung as he hands Hans a mismatching 
           seat and handlebars.

           -The two-seater is now TWO SEPARATE REASONABLY-SIZED BIKES, 
           but they’re embarrassingly mismatched. 

           -Hans paints both bikes a uniform, pleasant blue. 

           -Sun setting, Hans wheels both bikes on either side of him to 
           the exit. The old man holds the door open. They GRIN AT EACH 
           OTHER, and Hans, bicycles in hand, WALKS OUT TRIUMPHANTLY.

           Margret -- packed bags at her feet -- secures the Curious 
           George MANUSCRIPT in a large LEATHER PORTFOLIO. The door 
           opens. Ring. Ring. Margret looks up.

           Hans enters, wheeling in both bikes, ringing one’s bell.

                                 MARGRET
                        How in the world did you get those?

                                 HANS
                        You doubted me?

           She gives him a look. Of course, I did! He smiles proudly.

                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                        And your mission?

                                 MARGRET
                        Everything’s in order.
                              (HOLDING UP THE PORTFOLIO)
                        And this is the manuscript.
           Hans points to the basket on the smaller bike.

                                 HANS
                        That... shall go here!

           Margret puts the leather-sheathed manuscript in the basket 
           with triumphant flair. She’s all business now --

                                 MARGRET
                        We’ll leave at sunrise.

           Hans takes in the news. Nodding and scared as hell.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Hans and Margret in bed, their packed bags near the door. 
           Margret sleeps peacefully. Hans TOSSES AND TURNS.

           Hans turns to the window. Wishing ruefully an old friend 
           would show up...

           But nothing.

           Hans gets up and looks out at the dark, frightened city.

           ON HANS: Horrified. Doubting he can handle the journey ahead.

           INT. TERRASS HOTEL - SUNRISE

           Hans and Margret each wear a backpack as they wheel their 
           bikes to the door. The bikes’ crossbars have smaller bags 
           tied to them. The apartment is sad -- not quite empty, but 
           all their personal touches have been removed. 

           Margret leads the way and opens the door. She turns back 
           toward their lovely Parisian home.

                                 MARGRET
                        Au revoir, Terrass. Merci.

           Margret wheels her bike out the door. But Hans stays inside 
           the apartment. He looks under their old bed looking for 
           someone.

           HANS’ POV: Imaginary George’s eyes look back up to him from 
           the dark.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go, Hans.

           Imaginary George walks up to Hans in the middle of the room. 
           They hold hands. But Margret can’t see George.
                                 HANS
                        Can I take George with me?

           Margret’s taken aback.

                                 MARGRET
                        He was supposed to stay in the book!

                                 HANS
                              (DESPERATE)
                        Margret, please...

                                 MARGRET
                        Now’s not the time!

           Margret looks away -- toward the future ahead -- and wheels 
           her bike into the hallway, leaving the room forever.

           Hans pulls up his jacket. George joyfully climbs up Hans’ 
           body and hides under his shirt. Now Hans is ready to go.

           EXT. TERASS HOTEL - MONTMARTRE - MORNING

           The Reys -- led by Margret and the MANUSCRIPT in her basket -- 
           ride downhill, away from the Terrass. TENSION between them.

           They weave between hordes of refugees heading the other way.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        It was finally time to leave Paris. We 
                        rode all day. The only people heading 
                        straight toward the incoming Nazis.

           Scout planes with ominous SWASTIKAS circle overhead.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A busy street. Margret leads the way. 

           SMASH! Another BICYCLIST T-BONES Margret at an intersection. 
           She falls sideways as --

           The manuscript FLIES OUT of her basket. Lands in the street.

           Hans jumps off his bike to help Margret, but she --

           CRAWLS towards the manuscript. It’s being trampled by bikes 
           and pedestrians. PICKS IT UP as she’s about to be run over.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Margret turns into a small, empty alley. Hans follows. 
           A French ARMY JEEP turns into the alley from the other side. 
           SPEEDING right at them. Blares its HORN.

           They stop and look around. NOWHERE TO GO. Jeep keeps coming!

           Hans BREAKS IN A WOODEN DOOR along the alley wall. He pulls 
           in Margret and their bikes as the jeep passes. CLOSE CALL.

           EXT. CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉE - PARIS - DAY

           Monuments LINED WITH SANDBAGS to prevent their destruction. 
           BOMBS EXPLODING on the outskirts of the city.

           Hans -- George’s tail wagging from under his shirt -- 
           struggles to keep up with Margret. Heading toward the Arc de 
           Triomphe, they pedal against the stream of refugees pouring 
           into Paris. 

           Nazi fighter jets ZOOM overhead, sending a chill to Hans.

           EXT. CHECKPOINT - OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS - DAY

           Finally out of Paris. Huge lines, but the Reys at the front.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        Papers! Papers!

           Margret hands them their papers. Hans can’t hide his nerves.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Only soldiers can leave Paris.

                                 MARGRET
                        Why? We’re Brazilian citizens!

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER
                        So? Are you going to fight with us?

                                 MARGRET
                        We’re on a diplomatic mission. Ask 
                        your officer about the Reys. Cultural 
                        ambassadors. Wink, wink.

           The soldier is CONFUSED. 

                                 HANS
                        We’re important spies. Go!

           He LOOKS THEM OVER. Then TURNS to find his officer. The Reys 
           SPEED OFF past the checkpoint towards the countryside.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           They ride quickly on an empty road. The SOUNDS OF WAR nearby. 
           But coast is clear. Until -- 

           BOOM! A stray shell explodes feet from them. 

           Their bikes literally BOUNCE OFF THE GROUND. They both 
           screech to a halt, and Margret secures the manuscript.

           Hans steps off the pedals. IN A DAZE. But --

           Margret GRABS his arm. PULLS him ahead as she pedals.

           EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET

           Hans and Margret are exhausted and covered in grime. They 
           ride past a small, medieval village where a battle rages 
           between Nazis and the French. WHIZ! Bullets zipping nearby.

           ON HANS: Scared shitless. Battling his demons.

                                 MARGRET
                        We’ve got to keep going, Hans!

           HANS’ POV: In a ditch off the side of the road, German 
           soldiers line up a bunch of French prisoners -- RIFLES 
           pointed at their backs.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Ready! Aim!

           Hans trembles as Margret pushes forward.

                                 MARGRET
                        Don’t look back, Hans! Don’t look—

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Fire!

           BANG! Gunshots ring out as -- 

           George PEAKS OUT to Hans. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Keep going! Don’t stop now!

           Hans, staring straight ahead, follows Margret.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           The Reys pedal on a small, wooded road. Margret points to a 
           village with chimneys billowing smoke in the distance.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - ÉTAMPS - NIGHT

           Margret talks to a FARMER and WIFE outside their cottage. She 
           shows them her papers. Takes some bills from her envelope.

           INT. BARN - ÉTAMPS - NIGHT

           Hans and Margret -- their bags, bikes, and coats beside them -
           - sleep on hay next to cows. George rests atop a bull’s head.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - ÉTAMPS - SUNRISE

           Hans and Margret -- refreshed -- pedal away from the barn.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        We thought the next day was going to be a 
                        lovely ride toward freedom.

           A GERMAN BOMBER dives down out of a giant formation. Feels 
           like it’s almost overhead. BAY DOORS OPEN. A BOMB DROPS!

           SWOOOOOOSH... BOOM! The little barn they slept in explodes. 

           They grimace at each other... But keep pedaling. 

           EXT. VARIOUS - PARIS - DAY

           Nazi TANKS drive past the Arc de Triomphe. GOOSE-STEPPING 
           Nazi soldiers follow down the Champs d’Elysées.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        But June 14, 1940, was one of the 
                        worst days in French history. And the 
                        scariest of our lives.

           The French flag FALLS from the Eiffel Tower. The red and 
           black Nazi SWASTIKA FLAG is draped in its place.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Margret and Hans PEDAL SLOWLY. Their faces are hollowed out -- 
           EXHAUSTED and DEHYDRATED. George’s tail droops limply.

                                 GERMAN VOICE (O.S.)
                        Stop! Get off the bikes! Show us your 
                        papers!

           Hans and Margret -- TERROR on their faces -- screech to a 
           halt. George retracts his tail up Hans’ shirt. 

           Two NAZI SOLDIERS (20s) pointing RIFLES run into the road. 
                                 MARGRET
                              (WHISPERING)
                        Let me handle this.

                                 HANS
                        They can’t take George from us.

           Margret makes eyes at Hans. Not right now.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1
                        Papers, now! Where are you going? 

           Margret raises her hands slowly as the soldiers approach.

                                 MARGRET
                        We’re Brazilian citizens. Artists 
                        trying to get back home. We have papers 
                        and train tickets to Spain.

           Margret hands a soldier their Brazilian passports and papers.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2
                        You don’t sound Brazilian. 

           Margret doesn’t react. The soldier closely inspects their 
           papers. The other soldier eyes Hans --

           ON HANS: Losing his cool. 

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                              (TO HANS)
                        Do you have any contraband? 

           Hans STAMMERS -- can’t get a word out.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        Weapons? Ammunition? Animals?

           Hans can hardly breathe. Margret pipes up --

                                 MARGRET
                        Our tickets are for tomorrow. We have 
                        to get back on the road now to make it.

           Soldier #2 doesn’t care. Pokes his BAYONET into Hans’ chest.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2
                        Do you have contraband? We’ll kill you 
                        if you lie.

                                 MARGRET
                        He was shell-shocked in the Great War. 
                        Please be gentle.
           SWEAT BEADS on Hans’ face. Margret tries to comfort him by 
           touching his hand, but it doesn’t register with Hans.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        What are you carrying? Tell me!

                                 HANS
                        I have a monkey. You can’t have him. 
                        He’s too important.

           The soldiers look to each other. Confused but also upset.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1
                        A monkey? You’re going to die for a 
                        monkey?

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2
                        Give it to us! Or we’ll shoot you 
                        right now!

           Margret -- keeping her composure -- reaches for the leather 
           portfolio holding the manuscript.

                                 MARGRET
                        Please! He’s not well!
                             (BEAT AS SHE UNWRAPS THE MANUSCRIPT)
                        This is what he’s talking about.

           She hands the soldiers the beautiful manuscript.

                                 MARGRET (CONT’D)
                        It’s a book he’s written. For scared 
                        children.

           The soldiers -- scornful -- leaf through the pages. They’re 
           taken in by it. And -- finally -- the book cracks their 
           exteriors -- THE HINT OF SMILES on their faces. The soldiers 
           glance to each other.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1
                        We’ll take you to our officer.

           EXT. NAZI CAMP - DAY

           A BARBED WIRE ENCLOSURE for PRISONERS.

           ON HANS: In a frightened stupor, slumped against the fence.

                                 GERMAN VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ready! Aim! Fire!

           He HEARS: Cries of terror. Machine gun rounds. Bodies hitting 
           the ground. But he’s so scared he can’t even react.
           Margret, manuscript on her lap, sits between Hans and a 
           PRIEST (30s), who prays on ROSARY BEADS. The gentle man 
           maintains his calm somehow. 

                                 MARGRET
                        I’m sorry to bother you, Father.

           The priest looks up at her.

                                 PRIEST
                        Please don’t worry. 

                                 MARGRET
                        German?

           He nods yes.

                                 PRIEST
                        Would you like me to perform your last 
                        rites?

           This gets Hans’ attention. He looks to the priest. Tears wet 
           his cheeks.

                                 MARGRET
                        But we’ve done nothing wrong.

                                 PRIEST
                        That’s never stopped them.

                                 MARGRET
                        Why aren’t you in Germany? What do 
                        they want with you?

                                 PRIEST
                        I protested their killing of innocents -
                        - Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, artists. 
                        So they put me in a death camp. I 
                        escaped. But they found me here.

           Hans -- not all there -- slowly stands and looks to Margret.

                                 HANS
                        I need to do one thing.

           Margret nods for him to go for it. The priest takes her hand.

           MOMENTS LATER

           MARGRET’S POV: Hans stands at the opposite side of the 
           enclosure. Mumbling to himself. Pulling his hands in and out 
           of his shirt.

           ON MARGRET: Pity for her husband.
           HANS

           Manages to pull George -- now scared himself -- out of his 
           shirt. George tries to cling to him, but Hans lifts him to 
           eye level.

                                 HANS
                        George, you need to listen to me. These 
                        people won’t understand you. They won’t 
                        like you. And they’ll kill you. You 
                        need to go. Do you understand?

                                 GEORGE
                        We’ve been through so much. Why now?

                                 HANS
                        Margret was right. If I save you, it’s 
                        all worth it. You’ll be able to help 
                        other people.

           The sound of a GATE in the barbed wire enclosure opening.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                        Brazilians. Come with us. Now!

           George tries to clutch back onto Hans, but --

           Hans THROWS GEORGE over the barbed wire. To freedom.

                                 HANS
                        Go George! Run!

           HANS’ POV: George flees into the distance. Running free.

           Margret stands, manuscript in hand. Hans moves to her and 
           holds her hand. The priest glances kindly to them as the two 
           soldiers that captured them push them off to face their final 
           judgment.

           OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE - MOMENTS LATER

           The soldiers march Hans and Margret toward a tent.

                                 HANS
                        I love you, Margret. Thank you for 
                        everything. 

           She squeezes his hand. The words mean the world to her.

           INT. OFFICER’S TENT - NAZI TENT - DAY

           Hans and Margret stand in front of a well-organized desk. The 
           two soldiers behind them. The MANUSCRIPT in Margret’s hands. 
           A SENIOR OFFICER (45) enters. He’s TALL, BLOND, and ALL-
           BUSINESS. The three Nazis exchange Sieg Heils.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER AND SOLDIERS
                        Heil Hitler.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        Who are the prisoners?

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1
                        Supposedly Brazilians with train 
                        tickets to Spain. 

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        Spies?

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2
                        Can’t tell. 

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        Let me see.

           The soldier hands the officer their papers. He inspects 
           closely.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
                              (SCOFFING)
                        The Reys. Of Rio de Janeiro. Riding 
                        through the French countryside.

           Margret stands stoically. Hans -- weak in the knee -- starts 
           SWEATING and SHAKING. He reaches for Margret’s hand. 

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        If you’re guilty but honest, we’ll send 
                        you to work in the east. If you’re 
                        guilty but lie to me, my men will do 
                        what they must in the field behind us.
                              (BEAT)
                        Are you spies? Do you have weapons? Do 
                        you have contraband to sell on the 
                        black market?

                                 MARGRET
                        The answer to all your questions is no.

           The officer moves to Margret -- invading her personal space.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        You don’t sound Brazilian.

                                 MARGRET
                        You’ve seen my passport.
                                 NAZI SOLDIER #2
                        The man was babbling on about carrying 
                        a monkey. 

           The Nazis all eye Hans now.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        Ha. A monkey... Contraband like 
                        anything else. Punishable by death.

           ON HANS: On the verge of breaking down.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER #1
                        She said he was shell-shocked in the 
                        Great War.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        Oh... A Brazilian who fought in the 
                        Great War. How interesting. 
                              (BEAT)
                        They’re not worth my time. Take them 
                        to the normal spot.

           Margret sticks out the Curious George manuscript in the 
           officer’s direction --

                                 MARGRET
                        Hold on! This is what he’s talking 
                        about! It’s an innocent book about a 
                        monkey. Please look...

           The officer takes the book and holds it up to his working 
           eye. He’s CAPTIVATED BY IT -- taking him to another place.

           Hans notices the officer likes the book. He PULLS HIMSELF 
           TOGETHER and makes a case. 

                                 HANS
                              (STARTING SLOWLY)
                        It’s a book for children. Who are 
                        scared -- just like many soldiers are 
                        right now -- during this horrible war. 
                              (BEAT)
                        When I was young, I once realized that 
                        what I do can help people during times 
                        like this. So I know that right now 
                        it’s my to duty to give them this. I 
                        want to help kids -- Jew, Gentile, 
                        Nazi, Ally, black, white.

           The officer looks up from the book to Hans. 
                                 HANS (CONT’D)
                              (GAINING CONFIDENCE)
                        What’s going on in the world right now 
                        is evil. And I despise what you stand 
                        for. But it will pass. It’s just the 
                        bitterness of old men who fear progress.
                              (BEAT)
                        However there are children who will 
                        create a better world. Their hearts 
                        are still pure. Right now -- even 
                        though dictators wish otherwise -- 
                        their souls need filled with love and 
                        freedom and curiosity.

           The soldiers look to their officer who peers at Hans.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                              (GENTLE)
                        I have six children. My oldest boy 
                        died fighting in Poland. My youngest 
                        girl is four years old, back in 
                        Hamburg, waiting for the zoo to open 
                        again. 
                              (BEAT -- DEADLY SERIOUS)
                        But the war must be fought and won for 
                        there to be peace again.

           A LONG MOMENT between the officer and Hans. 

                                 HANS
                        Shoot us if you must. But make sure 
                        the book gets to children. Everywhere! 
                        In Germany. Your own kids! And the 
                        countries you’re invading.

           The officer hands Margret back their papers and the 
           manuscript. 

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER
                        In times of war, children need good 
                        stories. 

           The officer turns away from them and walks out of the tent. 
           He sniffles a bit and raises his hands to dry his eyes.

                                 SENIOR NAZI OFFICER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let them go.

           Hans and Margret look to each other -- SAVORING the miracle.

           The soldiers -- STUNNED -- exit the tent.

                                 MARGRET
                        George saved us again.
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        I don’t know if I can take credit for 
                        all that.

                                 HANS
                        Because you taught me how to let him go.

           EXT. NAZI CAMP - SUNSET

           Hans and Margret hastily RIDE AWAY from the Nazi tent city, 
           the manuscript safely in Margret’s basket. 

           EXT. WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

           Hans leads the way now. Margret starting to tire out.

                                 HANS
                        We’ve got this, Margret.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Even though Hans let go of me, I 
                        wasn’t about to leave his side.

           WOODS BESIDE THE ROAD

           George runs through the brush, keeping pace with the bikes.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - ORLÉANS - DAY

           Margret and Hans ride their bikes into a smaller station. 

           Margret spots a BROTHER and SISTER (about 16) -- lost and 
           confused. They give the surprised teens, both GRATEFUL, their 
           bikes and run toward their train.

           George, HIDDEN HIGH ABOVE on a sign, smiles at the good deed.

           PLATFORM - A LITTLE LATER

           Hans and Margret show a PORTER their tickets and get on a 
           train under a sign that reads: MADRID.

           As they board, George SWINGS DOWN from the rafters and lands 
           on the roof of the train chugging ahead.

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Nazi planes fly overhead. The HORRIFYING WHIR of bombs 
           rushing toward the earth. Margret squeezes the manuscript 
           tight. Hans contorts his face.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        All things considered, the rest of the 
                        trip went pretty smoothly. 
           Bombs EXPLODE not so far away. The train shakily RUMBLES ON.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - LISBON - DAY

           Hans and Margret -- their bags in tow -- look around the 
           SUNNY, COLORFUL city. They beam and take in the fresh air.

           George stealthily swings between the bright tiled buildings.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        We finally made it to Lisbon. The one 
                        city in Europe you could still sail 
                        away from. Without a penny to spare.

           INT. TICKET OFFICE - LISBON - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Margret pulls the remaining francs out of the 
           envelope. She exchanges them for two tickets.

           EXT. SHIP - DOCKS - LISBON - DAY

           Hans and Margret -- standing on the deck -- kiss. Squeezed 
           between them, the MANUSCRIPT that saved their lives. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        And, for the last time, Hans would 
                        board a ship taking him to a new life.

                                 HANS
                        I’m going to get your name back on the 
                        cover of the book if need to sail 
                        around the world.

           Margret squeezes Hans tight. George -- high above in the 
           rigging -- SMILES down on them.

           EXT. SHIP - NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY 

           The Reys’ ship approaches ELLIS ISLAND and the STATUE OF 
           LIBERTY. Hans and Margret on the deck CHEERING with the rest 
           of the passengers. Hans stares out to the horizon -- 

           HANS’ POV: The GREEN TORCH of freedom looks so MAGNIFICENT. 

           Hans inhales deeply -- savoring the air of their new home -- 
           and beams. Margret puts her arm around him. They’ve made it.

           INT. APARTMENT - GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY (1942)

           Hans and Margret host a small party. All types of interesting 
           folks in attendance -- this is their kind of neighborhood. 
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Hans and Margret quickly settled into New 
                        York City. Surrounded by other artists. 

           Margret passes a VICTORY BONDS COLLECTION CAN around. The 
           guests -- many refugees from their diverse looks -- chip in.

           Hans takes in the scene: Laughter. Joy. And ART -- everywhere 
           -- hung up all over the walls. 

           He’s at peace.

                                                        REVEAL:

           GEORGE

           Sitting outside the window. Smiling -- happy for his friend. 
           It’s from George’s vantage we’ve been observing this party.

           INT. PUBLISHER - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           A kindly AMERICAN PUBLISHER (50s) sits across his desk from 
           Hans and Margret. A big window behind him shows off New 
           York’s skyline.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        And it took Margret no time at all to 
                        get our book published in the U.S.

           He hands them the ENGLISH TRANSLATION of Curious George. Hans 
           immediately points to --

           MARGRET’S NAME listed first on the front cover. Where it 
           belongs.

           Hans takes her hand, squeezing it tight. Margret subtly nods 
           to the publisher thanking him. Grateful smiles all around.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY (1945)

           Hans and Margret walk hand-in-hand through the famous parade 
           from the LIFE MAGAZINE PHOTOS celebrating V-DAY. The SAILOR 
           and NURSE kiss as the Reys walk by. Confetti showers down.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        By the time the war was over, children 
                        across the country were reading my story.

           Hans points up toward the CHRYSLER TOWER --

           GEORGE frolics high above them. 

           Hans and Margret are thrilled to see him.
           CLOSE ON HANS: He’s a changed man. Content. Relaxed in his 
           own skin.... MATURE.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Hans’ soul had straightened itself out 
                        on our journey to freedom. He was happy 
                        now. His art told the truth. I guess he 
                        had grown up in all the right ways.

           George FLASHES A SMILE TO HANS and DESCENDS THE SKYSCRAPER, 
           joining the joyous crowd. 

           Hans holds Margret’s hand, then takes in the scene --

           Times Square becomes illustrated in Hans’ hand -- another of 
           his iconic images.

                                          THE END

           The EPILOGUE rolls over BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS of the Reys: 

           -Hans and Margret growing up with their families in Hamburg.
           -Hans as a struggling bohemian in Rio.
           -Margret unhappy at the Bauhaus.
           -Hans and Margret in love in Rio then Paris.
           -A book signing in the U.S. surrounded by George memorabilia.
           -The Reys old and happy together. 

           HANS AND MARGRET SOLD THE U.S. RIGHTS TO CURIOUS GEORGE TO 
           HOUGHTON MIFFLIN IN NOVEMBER 1940.

           SINCE THEN, CURIOUS GEORGE BOOKS HAVE SOLD OVER SEVENTY-FIVE 
           MILLION COPIES AND HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO FOURTEEN 
           LANGUAGES.

           ALTHOUGH THE CURIOUS GEORGE BOOKS WERE INITIALLY PUBLISHED 
           WITH HANS AS THE SOLE AUTHOR, LATER EDITIONS PROPERLY 
           CREDITED MARGRET AS A COAUTHOR.

           HANS AND MARGRET BECAME CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ON 
           APRIL 8, 1946. 

           THEY NEVER HAD KIDS OF THEIR OWN, BUT BROUGHT JOY TO MILLIONS 
           OF CHILDREN THROUGH THEIR WORK.

           HANS PASSED AWAY IN 1977 AT AGE SEVENTY-EIGHT. MARGRET SPENT 
           THE REST OF HER LIFE AS A GUARDIAN OF CURIOUS GEORGE, AN 
           ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN, AND PROTESTOR AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY. 
           SHE PASSED AWAY AT AGE NINETY IN 1996.
