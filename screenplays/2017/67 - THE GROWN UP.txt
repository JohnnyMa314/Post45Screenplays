          Hell is empty and all the devils are here. 

                                        -- William Shakespeare, The Tempest
           OVER BLACK 

           The wet, beating sounds of a hand job. The squelch of 
           lubricant and skin-to-skin contact. The strokes begin slow 
           and deliberate, but like the violin in Flight of the 
           Bumblebee, hastily pick up speed. 

           Movements fast, furious, bordering on frantic. A climax-- 

           The defeated groan of release. A soft sigh. Silence. 

                                 THE GROWN UP (V.O.)
                        I didn’t stop giving hand jobs 
                        because I wasn’t good at it. I 
                        stopped giving hand jobs because I 
                        was the best at it.

                                                                REVEAL:

           EXT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - STAMFORD, CT - DAY 

           We could be ANYPLACE, USA. But for our purposes, let’s call 
           it STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT. 

           A small clapboard HOUSE, wholesome, inviting, converted into 
           SPIRITUAL PALMS; edifice of fortune and fluid. A NEON SIGN 
           perched in the window. 

           Tarot cards and crystal balls up front. Balls of a different 
           persuasion in the back. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - HAND JOB ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Close on THE GROWN UP, 28 our heroine. She currently goes by 
           EMILY KENT, (probably) not her given name. She is headed 
           somewhere, though her path often leaves blood in the water. 

           A face that gives nothing away.  

           Behind the cool facade, an unquenched thirst to belong. 

           The room is set up like a doctor’s office; paper towels, 
           disinfectant, exam table. 

           Emily smiles absently at her CLIENT, 50s, slight paunch, a 
           kind, if not pathetic face. His penis rests on his thigh like 
           a gutted fish. His frayed black socks pulled to mid-calf. 

                                 CLIENT
                        I think we’re going to need more 
                        Kleenex. 
           Emily is zoned out, dreaming of a different, better life. 

                                 CLIENT (CONT’D)
                        Emily, I said, I think we’re going 
                        to need more Kleenex. 

           Emily snaps back in.  

                                 EMILY 
                        Baby, I’ve got a whole box. 

           This is their “bit.”

           Emily pulls several TISSUES, letting some fall to the ground, 
           placing one atop his penis, using another for herself, wiping 
           her hands methodically.  

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        They fix the old Radcliffe Bridge?  

                                 CLIENT
                        Nope. It’s a real logjam out there. 

                                 EMILY 
                        Clever way of keeping the riff raff 
                        out of the Heights if you ask me. 

           He zips up.  

                                 CLIENT
                        Loads of thanks, Em.  

                                 EMILY
                        Go Jets. 

           He raises his fist in solidarity and exits. 

           Once he’s gone, Emily’s shakes her throbbing wrist, closes 
           her eyes, takes a deep, meditative breath. And then- 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        The key with a hand job is not to 
                        over-think it.

           QUICK CUTS; FINGERS on a woman’s HAND bending and stretching; 
           FEET slipping out of cheap, square-toed LOAFERS; a BELT 
           unbuckling; smiley face BOXERS dropping to the floor; a row 
           of LOTIONS -- Midnight Pomegranate, Pink Chiffon, Autumn 
           Heat; a squirt of milky LUBE into a PALM; an ELBOW bowing; a 
           WRIST rotating; a man’s FIST clenched tightly, and releasing; 
           a FLY zipping; a TEN stuffed in a TIP JAR.     
                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        If you start worrying about 
                        technique, if you begin analyzing 
                        rhythm and pressure, you lose the 
                        essential nature of the act. You 
                        have to shut off your brain and 
                        trust your body to take over. 
                        Basically, it’s like a golf swing.

           EXT. TROPICANA GARDENS - NIGHT   

           A boxy beige apartment building. TROPICANA GARDENS written in 
           script above the door. Two dead potted plants flank the 
           entrance. 

           Emily’s 2002 FORD MUSTANG GT sputters into the deserted 
           PARKING LOT.   

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I jacked men off six days a week, 
                        eight hours a day, with a break for 
                        lunch. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           The apartment is small, one room. A MATTRESS on the floor, 
           thirteen BOOKS stacked neatly next to it - DuMaurier, 
           Dickens, Bronte, Christie, Highsmith, Waters.   

           Plastic LAWN FURNITURE moonlights as a dining set. A fridge 
           and a few cabinets approximate a kitchen in the corner. 

           Emily enters, drops her purse and keys on the “dining table,” 
           sorts through the mail (addressed alternately to EMILY KENT, 
           MARY SEYTON, ELIZABETH BRADDON, REBECCA DANVERS...); junk, 
           junk, junk. 

           She comes upon an envelope from AMERICAN EXPRESS. It reads 
           “CONGRATULATIONS EMILY! YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY SELECTED FOR 
           A UNIQUE OFFER!” 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I took two weeks of vacation every 
                        year.

           She drops the rest of the mail in the TRASH and opens a 
           DRAWER in the “kitchen.” It is filled with similar offers in 
           pristine condition - you’ve been selected, you’ve been 
           chosen, we want you!    
           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Wearing OVEN MITTS, Emily pulls a TURKEY out of the oven, 
           large enough for an entire family, places it on a table set 
           for one. A single, beautiful porcelain plate, silverware, an 
           elaborate crystal goblet. 

           Emily pours herself a glass of wine. 

           Hitchcock’s Shadow of a Doubt plays on a brand new Mac - this 
           is Emily’s prized possession. 

           Emily watches the dinner table scene where Uncle Charlie 
           derides “horrible, fat, fading women.”  

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I never worked holidays, because 
                        holiday hand jobs are sad for 
                        everyone. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Emily paces her “bedroom” wearing a headset. Her LAPTOP sits 
           on her bed. She wears PROTECTIVE GLOVES.  

           One NICE BLACK DRESS hangs in the closet. 

           On the CARDBOARD BOX that serves as the night stand, a 
           GOLDFISH swims in endless circles in its BOWL. 

                                 EMILY
                        ‘What are you doing?’ cried Ilaria 
                        wrathfully, her eyes flooding with 
                        fear. ‘Where is my son?’   

           C/U on her computer. Emily’s WORDS appear on SCREEN as she 
           speaks. 

           Emily is writing a novel.  

           She rereads her words, satisfied. Closes the WORD PROCESSOR. 
           Behind it; an open BROWSER WINDOW - “SELF PUBLISH YOUR NOVEL 
           FOR $3000! EDITING, COVER ART, PROOFREADING INCLUDED! CLICK 
           HERE TO EMBARK ON YOUR LITERARY ODYSSEY!” 

           Emily’s MOUSE hovers over “CLICK HERE.” Click she does not. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        So over three years, I’m estimating 
                        that comes to about 23,546 hand 
                        jobs. So don’t listen to that bitch 
                        Shardelle when she says I quit 
                        because I didn’t have the talent.
           Emily closes her laptop, switches off the light, gets in bed.   

           She stares at a WATER STAIN on the ceiling above her bed. 
           Initially abstract, it morphs into a WOMAN pointing to a DARK 
           CLOUD hovering above a CITYSCAPE. 

           Emily blinks. 

           It’s just a stain. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY 

           A DOCTOR, 40s administers NERVE TESTS / X RAYS on Emily’s 
           LEFT WRIST. He fits her with an unsexy ATHLETIC BRACE. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I quit because when you give 23,546 
                        hand jobs over a three-year period, 
                        carpal tunnel syndrome is a very 
                        real thing.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Emily checks out with the monotonous RECEPTIONIST, 50s.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Your insurance card, Ms. Kent?  

           Emily puts on a dazzling smile, assumes a SOUTHERN DRAWL. 

                                 EMILY
                             (Correcting.)
                        Missus, actually. Just got hitched. 
                        Gorgeous ceremony down at the 
                        Rockrimmon Club.   

           She holds her wrist up. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Caught one too many rounds of mixed 
                        doubles on the honeymoon. Anyway, 
                        can’t find that darn card. Maybe I 
                        could e-mail over a copy-- 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You’ll be paying cash then? 

           A moment slides by. 

           Emily blinks. 
           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - SUPPLY CLOSET - LATER 

           Emily pleasures the Doctor using her RIGHT HAND, with all the 
           enthusiasm of a court stenographer.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STAMFORD - DAY 

           The sidewalk bustles with the morning shift; men in suits, 
           women in nude stockings and tennis shoes, sullen smoking 
           teens, homeless schizophrenics. 

           Emily weaves through the tableau, watching passersby, always 
           searching for opportunity. 

           A FRAZZLED MOM holding a SCREAMING TODDLER, drops FIVE 
           DOLLARS. Emily picks it up, like she’s going to return it, 
           pockets it instead. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I came to my occupation honestly. 
                        Maybe ‘naturally’ is the better 
                        word. I’ve never done much honestly 
                        in my life.

           Emily arrives outside of-- 

           EXT. HIP COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           She surreptitiously UNTIES a YIPPY DOG waiting outside. 

           The dog takes off. Emily messes her HAIR, scoops the dog in 
           her arms, entering the coffee shop, breathless, frantic, 
           clutching the “runaway” pet. 

           She approaches the OWNER, 20s, gesturing wildly, retelling 
           the story of how the poor mutt narrowly escaped death. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I was raised in the city by a one 
                        eyed mother (the opening line of my 
                        memoir). My mother didn’t have a 
                        drug problem or a drinking problem, 
                        but she did have a working problem. 
                             (Beat.)
                        She was the laziest bitch I ever 
                        met. 

           The gushing Owner nuzzles her dog, insists on buying Emily 
           COFFEE. Emily accepts, points to some GLUTEN FREE THINGS in 
           the case - she’ll take those too. 
           EXT. NORDSTROM’S - DAY 

           Emily greases a NORDSTROM SECURITY GUARD, 30s, with a BOX OF 
           PASTRIES. He checks that the coast is clear, lets her in.

           INT. NORDSTROM’S - DAY

           Emily trolls the beauty department; Eloise gone naughty. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Twice a week we’d hit the streets 
                        downtown and beg. Get as much money 
                        in as little time possible, and 
                        then go home and eat Zebra Cakes 
                        and watch arbitration-based reality 
                        court TV on our broken mattress 
                        amongst the stains. 

           CLOSE on her LIPS as she applies a slash of scarlet LIPSTICK.   

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        That’s what I remember most about 
                        my childhood: stains. 

           She gives herself a satisfied once over. Emily grabs a 
           BRONZER (soupy brown) and GOLD SHADOW (piss yellowish). She 
           shoves them both in her JACKET POCKET.  

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t tell you the color of my 
                        mom’s eye, but I could tell you the 
                        stain on the shag carpet was a 
                        deep, soupy brown, and the stains 
                        on the wall were a vibrant hungover-
                        piss yellow. 

           She wanders into the adjacent ACCESSORIES DEPARTMENT, picks 
           out a BLACK PORTFOLIO and expertly removes the SECURITY TAG 
           with some PLIERS she keeps in her PURSE. 

           EXT. ANYWHERE CITY, USA - DOWNTOWN - STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Emily weaves her way down a CROWDED section of MAIN STREET. 
           The types of PEOPLE she describes pass; a LONE WOMAN in a 
           hurry, a WELL-HEELED MAN on his phone, a GRUNGY GUY wearing a 
           thick, silver THUMB RING.  

                                 EMILY  (V.O.)
                        We’d sit on a bench and target the 
                        right people to beg off. Look for 
                        women in sets of two. Solo women 
                        can dart away too quickly; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMILY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        a pack of women is too hard to 
                        wrangle. Don’t stop men in suits: 
                        that cliché is true, they’re all 
                        assholes. Also skip the thumb 
                        rings. I don’t know what it is, but 
                        men with thumb rings never help. 

           Emily’s eyes land on a SWEET, CHUBBY WOMAN, who picks her 
           wedgie, flustered. She really hopes no one saw. 

           She notices Emily watching, blushes scarlett. Emily smiles at 
           her, radiating empathy. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Final choice is a single woman who 
                        has that open look. You know it: 
                        The same woman you stop to ask for 
                        directions. 
                             (Beat.)
                        Also youngish men with beards or 
                        guitars.

           Emily follows the woman into a DINER. She passes a YOUNGISH 
           MAN with a BEARD, busking, tosses him the FIVER from earlier. 

           INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           The WOMAN joins her equally SWEET CHUBBY FRIEND in a booth.

           Emily looks defeated - but then her eyes land on the TAKE OUT 
           COUNTER near the KITCHEN. Emily approaches--  

                                 EMILY
                        Postmates? 

           The RESTAURANT MANAGER whose name tag reads TONY, hands her 
           an order. He’s got cheesy hip hop vibez. 

           She swipes his BUSINESS CARD flirtatiously.  

                                 TONY
                        My cellie’s on there. Hit me up. 
                        I’m open like 7/11.  

                                 EMILY
                        I’ll make that hotline bling.  

           He winks at her. Emily exits.  

                                 EMILY  (V.O.)
                        The ones we picked? We didn’t call 
                        them marks, or prey or victims.

                        We called them Tonys, after my dad 
                        because he could never say no to 
                        anyone

           She unwraps a poor soul’s breakfast, takes a satisfied bite.

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Although he must have said no to my 
                        mom at least once, when she asked 
                        him to stay.

           INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

           Emily picks up dry-cleaning. 

           She searches through her wallet (MULTIPLE IDs inside). 
           Frowns. “Can’t find her ticket.” She points to a group of 
           LADIES’ BUSINESS SUITS. 

                                 EMILY  (V.O.)
                        Once you stop a Tony, you can 
                        figure out in two seconds which way 
                        to beg. Some want it over with 
                        fast, like a mugging. Some want to 
                        luxuriate in your misfortune. 

           The CLERK hands her the bill. Emily slides the RESTAURANT 
           BUSINESS CARD across the counter, assumes a brusque tone. 

                                 EMILY
                        Incompetent waitress spilled a 
                        bloody straight down my Ann Taylor. 
                        Shows me for not sticking to my 
                        usual chard. Manager promised he’d 
                        cover the bill - that’s his card. 
                        Give him a call.   

           The Clerk hesitates. Emily taps her foot impatiently.   

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t got all day. 

           The Clerk steps away to make the call. Emily exits quickly, 
           dry cleaning slung over her shoulder.   

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I’m not blaming them. You go to the 
                        theater, you want to be 
                        entertained. 
           INT. EMILY’S 2002 FORD MUSTANG GT - DAY  

           Emily drives, her sharp gaze fixed on the NEW YORK CITY 
           SKYLINE in the distance. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I was barely thirty and I had the 
                        wrist of an octogenarian. I took it 
                        as a sign; maybe it was time for a 
                        fresh start. 

           It gets CLOSER and CLOSER. Its nearly within her grasp.

           EXT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY 

           Emily sits in her CAR, parked outside of the WALPOLE 
           PUBLISHING BUILDING. A towering steel and glass structure, 48 
           floors high, infinite with possibility.  

           Emily watches as well-heeled PEDESTRIANS hurry past. They are 
           all in on a joke no one bothered to tell her. 

           INT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - NEW YORK CITY - DAY  

           ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN; reveal Emily. She wears a BUSINESS SUIT, 
           hair pulled back in a CONSERVATIVE CHIGNON, the BLACK 
           PORTFOLIO tucked under her arm.

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I read constantly but I lack formal 
                        education. I’ve always wanted to be 
                        around the really smart people - 
                        the kind that went to universities 
                        and drank wine and spoke Latin.

           She checks in with the YOUNG RECEPTIONIST, 20s.    

           Emily takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM. A POSTER announces 
           the RELEASE of MAGDALENA VANSTONE’S newest novel in the 
           SLAUGHTERHOUSE CHRONICLES SERIES published by WALPOLE. 

           Emily grabs a copy of PUBLISHER’S WEEKLY. She pretends to 
           read, but instead watches the Young Receptionist flirt with a 
           HANDSOME EDITOR, 20s. They discuss their weekend plans - 
           dinners, concerts, readings, gallery openings.   

           In another life, she could be them. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        The question is: How do you find 
                        smart people?  
                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        Elizabeth? 

           Emily comes face to face with a CROTCH draped in pleated GREY 
           WOOL. Does she recognize the bulge? Not offhand. 

           She looks up to find editor, AMBROSE ROWE, 40s, a nice man 
           with a fat ass. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Elizabeth Braddon? 

           Emily smiles brightly. 

                                 EMILY
                        Guilty as charged. 

           She stands, they shake hands. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Ambrose Rowe. Pleasure to finally 
                        make your acquaintance. Everyone 
                        here has spoken very highly of you. 
                        Come on back. 

           He begins walking towards the BULLPEN. Emily follows. 

           INT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - AMBROSE’S OFFICE - LATER 

           Mid-job-interview. Behind Ambrose BOOKSHELVES lined with 
           HORROR / THRILLER GENRE NOVELS. An impressive view of 
           MANHATTAN. 

           Ambrose fiddles with his WEDDING BAND, absently.  

                                 AMBROSE
                        My colleagues have told me that 
                        you’re remarkably well-studied. 

                                 EMILY
                        I did re-read all 17 novels in the 
                        Slaughterhouse Chronicle series. 

           He leans back in his chair, folds his HANDS behind his HEAD. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Magdalena has a small but ardent 
                        cult following. Do you think she’ll 
                        ever reveal her identity? She’s 
                        never been seen in public. 
                                 EMILY
                        I think a woman’s greatest asset 
                        are the things we don’t know about 
                        her. A woman without secrets has no 
                        texture. 

           Ambrose chuckles, pitches forward, intrigued.  

                                 AMBROSE
                        That leads me quite nicely to my 
                        next question. I like to know the 
                        essence of the person I’m hiring. 
                        Elizabeth, who are you? And where 
                        do you see yourself in ten years? 

           A look of absolute conviction passes over Emily’s face. She 
           leans in towards Ambrose, looks him dead in the eye.    

                                 EMILY
                        There is something about words, 
                        Ambrose. In expert hands, 
                        manipulated deftly, words are 
                        hypnotic. They consume you. Take 
                        you prisoner. I have spent my 
                        entire life folded between the 
                        pages of books. In the absence of 
                        human relationships, I bonded with 
                        paper characters. I have traveled 
                        the world, lived, loved and lost 
                        through stories. In ten years, I 
                        will be sitting in your chair, the 
                        editor of a major publishing house, 
                        interviewing a candidate just like 
                        me - giving her a chance, a foot in 
                        the door. And once I have learned 
                        everything I can about telling 
                        stories, I will take a year long 
                        sabbatical, wherein I will pen a 
                        novel that will be published to 
                        much fanfare, and manages, in it’s 
                        own way, to change the world. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Wow. Your focus and determination 
                        are... singular. That question 
                        tends to mystify most people.

                                 EMILY
                        Anything else? 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Don’t think so. Let’s give it a 
                        shot. 
           Emily looks perplexed. 

                                 EMILY
                        Give what a shot?  

                                 AMBROSE
                        It’s yours. 

                                 EMILY
                        I got the job? 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Welcome to Walpole Publishing.  

           For the first time, Emily looks genuinely happy. This is the 
           moment she’s been waited an eternity for. 

           A shot at a better life.

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you. This is a dream come 
                        true.  

           Emily gathers her things, stands to shake Ambrose’s hand. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Before you leave we’ve got some 
                        pesky bureaucracy to take care of. 

           INT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - AMBROSE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Close on JOB PAPERWORK; 

           “HAVE YOU BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR BEEN INCARCERATED IN 
           CONNECTION WITH A FELONY IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS?” 

           There are two boxes a “YES” and a “NO.” Emily’s pen hovers 
           between the two; back and forth. Back and forth. 

           Finally, she checks the NO BOX. She hands her paperwork back 
           to Ambrose, who exits.  And then-- 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS; A FLASH of a CAMERA; Emily’s MUGSHOT 
           taken, Emily’s THUMB pressing down on a BLACK INK PAD, 
           fingerprinted; Emily’s FEET chained, shuffling under an 
           ORANGE JUMPSUIT.  

           INT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - AMBROSE’S OFFICE - LATER

           CLOSE on a WALL CLOCK. Emily watches as the minutes tick by. 

           Ambrose finally re-enters, he looks at Emily with PITY. 
                                 AMBROSE
                        Your name isn’t actually Elizabeth 
                        Braddon, is it? 

           EXT. WALPOLE PUBLISHING - LATER 

           Emily runs out of Walpole Publishing, pushes through a 
           pedestrians, glancing over her shoulder. 

           She gets into her Mustang, slams the door. Puts the KEY in 
           the ignition - the engine sputters and sticks, but doesn’t 
           start. She slams her fist on the steering wheel, frustrated. 

                                 EMILY
                        FUCK!

           DALE PISANO, 28, well-intentioned, mechanic, in love with 
           Emily since HIGH SCHOOL, has his head under the hood of her 
           car. Think TIM RIGGINS - he makes you wet in the no-no, but 
           is he smart? No, no. 

           Emily chain-smokes sullenly nearby. 

                                 DALE
                        I thought you quit the cancer

                        poster one liners. I just pissed 
                        away my big shot.

                        And I remember you said you’re 
                        gonna get your first break writing 
                        short stories that get printed in 
                        the New Yorker, which is read by 
                        all the most important 
                        intellectuals of our time. And once 
                        you get big enough off that, you’ll 
                        write a book. And then one day 
                        you’re going to be one of like ten 
                        chicks to win the Noble Prize for 
                        literature.  

           Dale seems very pleased with himself. 

                                 EMILY
                        Nobel. Nobel Prize. And I can’t 
                        even afford a subscription to the 
                        New Yorker much less publish 
                        anything in it.    

           Emily stubs her cigarette out in a full ASHTRAY. Sits in a 
           PLASTIC CHAIR.

                                 DALE
                        Point is, you can still make it to 
                        the top. But, your engine is shot. 

                                 EMILY
                        This really isn’t the time to 
                        question my motivation. 

                                 DALE
                        What? Naw. Your car. This stang is 
                        on it’s last legs. 

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t have the cash for a new 
                        whip. You know I’m saving up to 
                        self publish my novel. 

           Dale sits down next to Emily, puts a big hand on her leg, 
           rubs her thigh.  

                                 DALE
                        I could loan you the money. 

                                 EMILY
                        And where are you going to come up 
                        with three grand? 

           Dale moves closer, begins kissing her neck. Despite herself, 
           Emily succumbs.  
                                 DALE
                        You know I got a good chunk of 
                        change saved up for my Crossfit.  
                        Just a couple grand away from my 
                        very own box. 

                                 EMILY
                        A small, wet tunnel to squat in. 
                        But I wouldn’t feel right taking 
                        your money. 

                                 DALE
                        Why don’t you pick up some extra 
                        shifts at the Genius Bar? Or talk 
                        to the bosslady about a promotion?

           Emily turns this over in her mind. 

                                 EMILY
                        Yeah. A promotion could do the 
                        trick. Smart Dale.  

           This compliment makes Dale hot. He grabs Emily, pulling her 
           onto his lap, pushing little BLACK DRESS up her thigh--   

                                 DALE
                        You’re so fuckin’ hot when you 
                        dress professional. Like you work 
                        at the bank.  

           INT. OLIO RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           An upscale, white table cloth restaurant. Well-to-do couples 
           order Pinot Noir and “shared plates” in the soft glow of 
           candlelight.   

           A HANDSOME MAN, 40s sits at a TWO-TOP, waiting for someone. A 
           WAITER deposits a SCOTCH in front of him. The man says 
           something to the Waiter. The Waiter laughs, charmed.   

           PULL BACK: Emily stands outside of the restaurant, watching, 
           transfixed.  

           She is jolted from her reverie by A MANGY DOG on a leash, 
           sniffing the TAKE OUT BAG in her hand. She recoils, 
           disgusted. Looks up to see his owner, an aging, scrawny METAL-
           HEAD TWEAKER covered in fading prison tattoos.   

           They lock eyes. Emily turns away. 
           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Emily lies in bed, awake. The GOLDFISH swims, banging into 
           the side of his BOWL, over and over again. 

           She stares up at the WATER STAIN on the ceiling. 

           It MORPHS into STONES raining down on an OLD HOUSE. 

           Emily blinks. It’s just a stain. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - OFFICE - DAY 

           The office is small, cramped and messy. 

           VIVECA (nee Jennifer), might be 40, 50 or 60, proprietor of 
           Spiritual Palms, does some accounting behind the DESK. Viveca 
           is heavy like an octopus, with beads and ruffles and scarves 
           floating around her, hair dyed the color of fruit punch, 
           insists she’s a natural redhead. 

           (But does the rug match the drapes? Methinks not.) 

           Emily, enters, her athletic brace wrapped around her wrist. 
           She watches Viveca for a moment, who ignores her and keeps 
           punching her CALCULATOR feverishly. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        This is my boss Viveca, bona fide 
                        palm reader. Although Viveca isn’t 
                        her bona fide name, her bona fide 
                        name is Jennifer, but people don’t 
                        believe that Jennifers can tell the 
                        future; Jennifers can tell you 
                        which cute shoes to buy or what 
                        farmer’s market to visit.

                                 VIVECA
                        Whatcha want nerdy? 

           Emily sits across from Viveca, adopts a plummy, clear voice. 

                                 EMILY
                        Have I ever told you about my 
                        visions? 

                                 VIVECA
                        What now? 

                                 EMILY
                        Whenever I meet someone, I have 
                        this immediate vision of who they 
                        are and what they need.

                        I can see it like a color or a halo 
                        around them. Basically, I’m a 
                        clairvoyant. 

                                 VIVECA
                        Oh yeah nerdy? It so happens I’m a 
                        fucking clairvoyant too, and I’m 
                        picking up on the distinct vibe 
                        that you’re askin’ me to move up 
                        front. Read palms instead of 
                        growin’ hair on yours. Am I right? 

                                 EMILY
                        I’ve got to hand it to you Viveca, 
                        your intuition is impenetrable. 

                                 VIVECA
                        A week ago you told me you were 
                        outta here cause you scored some 
                        hoity toity desk job. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’ve reconsidered. I decided I 
                        really like it here.  

                                 VIVECA
                        Good.  

           Viveca goes back to work. Emily isn’t giving up.  

                                 EMILY
                        But I feel as if I’ve hit a ceiling 
                        in the field of manual 
                        manipulation. 

                                 VIVECA
                        You know we don’t do blowies here. 
                        I’ve run a clean shop since ‘99. 

                                 EMILY
                        And I admire your principles. Look 
                        Viveca, our tarot business might be 
                        lower volume, but with the right 
                        approach, I can get these ladies to 
                        part with their greenbacks. I’ll 
                        cultivate a loyal clientele just 
                        like I have with our consortium of 
                        gentlemen.    

           Viveca leans back, considering.  
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        At least give me a shot, if it 
                        doesn’t work out, I can always keep 
                        rubbing and tugging, no harm, no 
                        foul. 

                                 VIVECA
                        Fine nerdy. You’re movin’ up front. 
                        Remember, tell ‘em what they want 
                        to hear. Work ‘em like a rib. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - FORTUNE DEN - CONTINUOUS

           A MANTLE cluttered with OLD PHOTOGRAPHS, CANDLES, TAROT CARDS 
           and CRYSTALS. Emily sits behind a round table, draped in a 
           burgundy and gold embroidered TABLE CLOTH. 

           Across from her, a BRIDE, 20s, clumpy mascara, tiara, cheap 
           veil and a SASH that reads BACHELORETTE. She is flanked on 
           either side by chatty, cheesy GIRLFRIENDS. Emily flips her 
           cards; THE TOWER, UPSIDE DOWN KING OF SWORDS, SEVEN OF CUPS.   

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        According to Wikepedia, this hand 
                        is a garbage fire. Her groom is a 
                        drug addled sex-addict with a 
                        mountain of debt. 

                                 BRIDE
                        Shit. It looks bad. Is it bad? 

                                 EMILY
                        On the contrary, this card, the 
                        upside down king of swords 
                        indicates your fiance is a 
                        successful warrior who will slay 
                        any beast to protect you.  

                                 BRIDE
                        Brad’s a CPA. 

           Emily points to the next card. 

                                 EMILY
                        The Tower is a castle, it 
                        represents the place you will 
                        eventually make your home.   

                                 BRIDE
                        Is it nice? Four beds, three baths?  

                                 EMILY
                        I see a happy home--
           DARK GIRLFRIEND, 20s, interrupts. 

                                 DARK GIRLFRIEND
                        A.K.A a shithole. Look at it this 
                        way, if it doesn’t work out, you 
                        can kill the fucker and snag the 
                        insurance money. 

           An awkward beat. 

                                 DARK GIRLFRIEND (CONT’D)
                        Kidding. 

           Suddenly an ORGASM YELP from the BACK ROOM.   

                                 BRIDE
                        What was that? 

                                 EMILY
                        New puppy. 

           EXT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - BACK ALLEY - DAY 

           Lunch Break. Emily eats a yogurt with Viveca, who smokes, 
           putting too much of the filter in her mouth. 

                                 VIVECA
                        I gotta hand it to ya nerdy, your 
                        ESPN has turned out to be legit. 
                        I’m gonna give Shardelle your HJ 
                        client list.  

                                 EMILY
                        Shardelle is a rube coated in body 
                        glitter. My guys are sophisticates. 
                        They come to me for a curated 
                        experience.  

                                 VIVECA
                        Shardelle’s new and she deserves a 
                        helping hand. This is the perfect 
                        way for her to build her rolodex, 
                        take the reigns on some D. 

                                 EMILY
                        That ungrateful bitch has been 
                        talking shit on me all over town.

           Off Viveca’s look--

                        Fine. She can have ‘em. Except one. 
           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - HAND JOB ROOM - DAY 

           CLASSICAL MUSIC plays. 

           CLOSE ON: MICHAEL AUDLEY, 43, handsome, brainy, compulsive 
           jogger. His face contorts with pleasure as Emily administers 
           an enthused jerk-off.  

           We recognize him as the MAN from the FANCY RESTAURANT. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        The darkness in The Haunting of 
                        Hill House stems from the mundane -- 
                        the house, the person, the action. 
                        None of them is quite what they 
                        seem to be.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        True. But Eleanor is drawn to Hill 
                        House because it’s an expression of 
                        her own inner darkness, the 
                        ugliness that lives inside of her, 
                        her incipient madness.  

           Emily’s strokes quicken. Michael groans with pleasure.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        So the dissolving boundary is the 
                        one between the mind and the 
                        exterior world. Is Eleanor the 
                        target of the haunting? Or is the 
                        haunting coming from within her? 

                                 EMILY
                        The point is that mania lurks 
                        inside all of us. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Mmm. Madness is the modern version 
                        of damnation. To be trapped in 
                        one’s own mind is the equivalent of 
                        being condemned to an eternal hell.    

                                 EMILY
                        But aren’t we all a little bit 
                        crazy? An army of demented lonely 
                        girls imprisoned in a big sinister 
                        house.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes! Emily. Yes!   

           Michael comes with a groan. A moment of silence. 
           Emily leans into him, her lips graze his ear. CLOSE ON HER 
           MOUTH, as she whispers;  

                                 EMILY
                        “...silence lay steadily against 
                        the wood and stone of Hill House, 
                        and whatever walked there, walked 
                        alone.” 

                                 MICHAEL
                        God, that opening line-- 

                                 EMILY
                        Makes me wet. 

           Emily puts a copy of The Haunting of Hillhouse on his chest. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I’m ready for my next assignment 
                        Professor Audley.

           Michael zips up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve got just the thing. 

           He removes a copy of The Woman in White from his briefcase 
           and presses into Emily’s hands. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        The Woman in White is one of the 
                        all time best. Published in 1859, 
                        but still holds up today. It’s 
                        widely thought to be the 
                        foundational text of sensation 
                        fiction. Essential to your 
                        education. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’ll start reading immediately. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t doubt it. And how’s your 
                        opus coming along? 

                                 EMILY
                        I wouldn’t exactly call it an opus. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I beg to differ.  

                                 EMILY
                        You haven’t even read it. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Not for lack of trying. 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s not ready. If you ever see it, 
                        I want it to be... perfect. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        “Don’t tell me the moon is shining, 
                        show me the glint of light on 
                        broken glass.” 

           Emily smiles (blankly). 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Recognize the quote? 

                                 EMILY
                        You underestimate me.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        I would never. 

           He pushes a strand of hair out of Emily’s face. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll wait with baited breath for 
                        your draft, as I do for our weekly 
                        rendez-vous. 

                                 EMILY
                        I didn’t know you spoke French. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Un peu. I spent the summer after 
                        college working in a small 
                        restaurant outside of Bordeaux. I 
                        learned the language and how to 
                        cook Coq au Vin. 

           He leans in, as if telling her a secret.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Trick is to marinate the bird 
                        overnight. Perhaps I’ll make it for 
                        you sometime.   

                                 EMILY
                        That would be nice.  

           They both know this is never happening. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        See you next Tuesday, Emily. 
                                 EMILY
                        Goodbye, Michael. 

           He exits. She cuts the music, jolted back to reality. 

           Emily turns to the mirror (she is now dressing a little more 
           “psychic chic”), tousles her hair, smooths her peasant 
           blouse, tucks The Woman in White under her arm and makes her 
           way to the front of Spiritual Palms into-- 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - FORTUNE DEN - CONTINUOUS  

           Emily sits at the card table reading The Woman in White, 
           waiting for her next client. And then--   

           The CLACK, CLACK, CLACK of HIGH HEELS across a WOOD FLOOR. 
           Emily looks up to see-- 

           SUSAN BURKE, 41, nervous, monied, blonde, red-rimmed eyes and 
           pale lashes. Everything about her is tasteful; ecru cashmere 
           COAT, ivory FERRAGAMO HEELS. Even her skin is a pale, creamy 
           alabaster. She is translucent, like paper. 

           Susan smiles tightly. Emily stands to greet her, the book 
           still in her hand.  

                                 EMILY
                        Welcome to Spiritual Palms. I’m 
                        Emily. 

                                 SUSAN 
                        Susan. Burke. 

           She extends a hand, Emily goes to shake it and drops her 
           BOOK. They simultaneously retrieve it, bump heads, clumsily.   

                           EMILY
                                                     SUSAN (CONT'D)
           I’m so sorry. 
                                              No it’s my fault. 

           Each giggles nervously. Susan’s eyes linger on the BOOK. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Susan Burke was different. She 
                        seemed smarter from the second I 
                        saw her. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why don’t you have a seat?  

           Susan nods, obliges. Emily sits as well.   
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        So, Susan, what brings you in 
                        today? 

                                 SUSAN
                        My life is falling apart. 

           Then Susan begins to CRY. At first just a few tears, but then 
           a deluge. Emily watches the CLOCK, lets Susan weep, assumes 
           her best sympathetic face. 

           Finally, Susan composes herself, wipes her eyes. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why I’m here.  

                                 EMILY
                        Well, what exactly is going on in 
                        your life? 

           Susan looks up sharply, a flicker of sparkle in her eyes. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Don’t you know? 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Sense of humor. Unexpected. 

                                 SUSAN
                        So how does this whole thing work? 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m a psychological intuitive. All 
                        my senses play a part in my work. I 
                        can feel vibrations coming off 
                        people. I can see auras. I can 
                        smell misery, or dishonesty, or 
                        depression. It’s a gift I’ve had 
                        since I was a small child. My 
                        mother was a deeply unbalanced 
                        woman. She smelled of despair, 
                        which presents itself to me as the 
                        scent of bread.

                                 SUSAN
                        Bread? 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I needed to pick a new eau de sad 
                        girl. Not dying leaves, too 
                        obvious, but something earthy. 
                        Mushrooms? No, inelegant. 

           Susan shifts uncomfortably. 
                                 SUSAN
                        I don’t mean to be rude, but I 
                        don’t think this is for me.  

           Emily says nothing. Waiting. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        OK. So what do you read off me? 

                                 EMILY
                        There’s something going on in your 
                        house. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I already told you that. 

                                 EMILY
                        No. You told me your life was 
                        falling apart. I’m saying it’s 
                        something to do with your house. 
                        You have a husband, I sense a lot 
                        of discord: I see you surrounded by 
                        a sick green, like an egg yolk gone 
                        bad. Swirls of a healthy vibrant 
                        turquoise on the outer edges. That 
                        tells me you had something good and 
                        it went very bad. Yes?

           Susan glares at Emily. She’s touched a nerve. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You’re desperate, you’re in 
                        exquisite pain. You’re not 
                        sleeping.

                                 SUSAN
                        I sleep eight hours a night. 

           Emily seamlessly course corrects. 

                                 EMILY
                        But it’s not a genuine sleep. You 
                        have unsettling dreams. Maybe not 
                        nightmares, but you wake up feeling 
                        worn, achy.

           Susan nods. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        This woman was in her forties; 
                        people in their forties usually 
                        wake up feeling achy. I know that 
                        from commercials.
                                 EMILY
                        Also you smell of peonies. Do you 
                        have a child? 

           Susan considers Emily’s words carefully, making a decision. 
           Finally, she lowers her voice, leans in.

                                 SUSAN
                        I wasn’t going to say anything 
                        because... it’s early and we’ve 
                        been trying for a while... I’m 
                        eleven weeks pregnant. Only my 
                        husband knows. 

           Susan pauses, puts her hand over her mouth, like the secret 
           escaped on its own. Then she darkens. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        And my step son. He knows too.  

           A glimmer of hope shoots through Emily. 

                                 EMILY
                        Something is wrong in your house. 
                        Your stepson? 

           Susan stands abruptly, protective hand on her belly.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay? 

                                 SUSAN
                        How much do I owe you? 

           Before Emily can answer, Susan throws some a crisp HUNDRED 
           DOLLAR BILL on the table and exits hastily. Emily stares at 
           the money, the CLACK CLACK CLACK of Susan’s heels 
           disappearing into the parking lot.   

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - HAND JOB ROOM - DAY 

           Emily cleans up Michael’s cum. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I needed that. Work has been trying 
                        lately. I’m burning the candle at 
                        both ends.  

                                 EMILY
                        So what’s the next tome for our 
                        sticky book club? 

           Michael laughs. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Is that what you call it? 

           Emily reacts, embarrassed. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sorry. Is that silly? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You amuse me. 
                             (Beat.)
                        Unfortunately we’ll have to put our 
                        “SBC” on hold. I’m going out of 
                        town next week on a speaking tour 
                        to promote my latest oeuvre; Stroke 
                        of Genius; the Art of the Novel. 

                                 EMILY
                        Shaping young, supple minds with 
                        your abundant literary knowledge. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        At least I’ll give the illusion of 
                        expertise. An elaborate exercise in 
                        manipulation for profit. 

                                 EMILY
                        Like Count Fosco in The Woman in 
                        White. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ha. The student becomes the master. 

                                 EMILY
                        Or maybe I’ve known more than you 
                        all along. 

           Michael laughs, enjoying the flirtation, reaches for his fly. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Allow me. 

           She zips him up. An intimacy passes between them. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        The truth is, Emily, I’m in awe of 
                        you. I’ve always admired the writer 
                        as artist. 

                                 EMILY
                        You’re a professor. You write books 
                        all the time. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s different. I critique, 
                        analyze, hover at a safe distance. 
                        I never get my hands dirty. 

                                 EMILY
                        So what’s stopping you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fear. And fiction doesn’t exactly 
                        pay the bills--

           He stops, aware of his audience.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean--

                                 EMILY
                        It’s okay. I do what I have to do. 
                        Words are my passion.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Passion left my life long ago. 

           Emily waits for him to elaborate. He doesn’t. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I brought something for you. 

           Michael reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a beautiful, 
           leather bound copy of The Turn of the Screw, hands it to her. 

                                 EMILY
                        We’ve read this one already..?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I remember. It’s your favorite. But 
                        this isn’t a loaner. It’s for you 
                        to keep. A first edition copy, I 
                        found it at The Strand in 
                        Manhattan. I saw it and thought, 
                        Emily has to have this. 

           Emily repeats; 

                                 EMILY
                        The Strand. 

           Emily opens the book, astounded, caressing its pages. Michael 
           watches her, pleased.  
                                 MICHAEL
                        Emily, would you consider having a 
                        drink with me when I get back from 
                        my trip? 

           Emily looks at him, eyes shining. 

                                 EMILY
                        I would love nothing more. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Emily gently places her new copy of The Turn of the Screw on 
           top of her pile of books - new tally, 14. She steps back, 
           admiring it.   

           Emily FEEDS the FISH who eats hungrily. 

           She looks up at the WATER STAIN. It has shrunk. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - DAY 

           CLOSE on EMILY’S PHONE. She GOOGLES Michael’s quote from 
           earlier; “Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the 
           glint of light on broken glass.”  

           CHEKHOV. Huh. 

           She CLICKS on a LINK and begins reading, jotting down notes 
           in a SMALL NOTEBOOK, completely engrossed.  

           CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Emily looks up, closes her notebook.  

           Susan Burke is back. She shifts uncomfortably.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Mind if we try again? 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - FORTUNE DEN - DAY 

           Susan sits across from Emily. Her hands folded primly. 

                                 EMILY
                        You’re still withholding. Even when 
                        I asked about your job you said you 
                        “define and eliminate problems.” 

                                 SUSAN
                             (Defensive.)
                        But that’s what I do. 
                                 EMILY
                        That’s vague. If you want our 
                        sessions to be effective, we need 
                        to delve deeper. 

           Susan chews a well-manicured nailed, nervously. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’ll try. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why don’t we go back to your 
                        husband? How are things with him? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Ever since we moved back to the 
                        city and into the new house Miles 
                        has been... I don’t know. Acting 
                        out. 

                                 EMILY
                        In what way? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Miles was never a sweet boy. I’m 
                        the only mom he’s known - I’ve been 
                        with his dad since he was four. But 
                        he’s always been cold. Introverted. 
                        He’s just empty. I hate myself for 
                        saying that. I mean, introverted is 
                        fine. But in the past year, since 
                        the move... he’s changed. Become 
                        more aggressive. He’s angry. Dark. 
                        Threatening. 

                                 EMILY
                        I can sense that some of that... 
                        blackness has rubbed off on you. 
                        The scents and colors around have 
                        soured into something... acidic. 
                        Like rotting teeth.  

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s revolting. 

           Emily nods slowly, in agreement. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        It scares me, especially with a 
                        baby on the way. 

           Emily pauses, deep in thought. 
                                 EMILY
                        Susan, have you considered that the 
                        house is affecting your son’s 
                        behavior?

           Susan leans in, her eyes wide. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes! Yes I do. Is that crazy? 
                        That’s why I came back. Because... 
                        there was blood on my wall.

                                 EMILY 
                        Blood? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Last week. I didn’t want to say 
                        anything... But it was there. One 
                        long trickle from the floor to the 
                        ceiling. Am I... am I insane?

                                 EMILY
                        You’re not insane. It’s just as I 
                        suspected - your house needs a 
                        cleansing. I specialize in domestic 
                        auras. 

                                 SUSAN
                        What do you mean “domestic auras?” 

                                 EMILY
                        Well, I recently had a client who’s 
                        dog, was acting strangely, barking 
                        at all hours of the night, refusing 
                        to come indoors, even in the dead 
                        of winter. And you know how cold 
                        it’s been lately. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Frigid. I pulled my furs out of 
                        storage a month early. 

                                 EMILY
                        I realized there could only be one 
                        reason for the bitch’s behavior. A 
                        spirit was occupying her home. You 
                        see they had just moved back to the 
                        city from the suburbs into an old 
                        house. Beautiful but... 

                                 SUSAN
                        But? 
                                 EMILY
                        An a hundred year old house has a 
                        lot of... leftover vibes. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I think that might be what’s 
                        happening with us. 

           Emily nods knowingly. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s exactly what I feared. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Emily, what are you doing next 
                        Tuesday?

                                 EMILY
                        It just so happens my regular 
                        appointment cancelled. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Viveca and Emily pack up, getting ready to leave for the 
           evening. Viveca is annoyed with Emily. 

                                 VIVECA
                        What do you think you’re doing, 
                        Nerdy? We don’t make fucking house 
                        calls around here.

                                 EMILY
                        Look, my Mom didn’t teach me shit 
                        about life, but she showed me how 
                        to spot a mark. I’ve got a whale on 
                        the line with Susan Burke. When is 
                        the last time a Rolex waltzed in to 
                        Spiritual Palms? 

           Viveca doesn’t say anything. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Never, is the answer. I’m thinking 
                        repeat cleansings, once a month for 
                        a year. Twelve visits for $3500. 
                        That’s a pretty penny. I’ll even 
                        toss you a few hundred as a 
                        finder’s fee. 
                                 VIVECA
                        I’ll definitely take my cut. But 
                        that doesn’t change the fact that 
                        you’re holding your mitts awfully 
                        close to the flame. 

           Emily’s not listening. She’s off in her own world. 

                                 EMILY
                        A year gives the stepson time to 
                        adjust to the new school, new kids. 
                        Soon enough he’s cured and I’m the 
                        hero. Susan begins referring all 
                        her rich, nervous friends to me. 
                        Maybe Susan and I become friends. 
                        She invites me to her book club. 
                        We’ll sit by the first and nibble 
                        brie. I finish my novel, publish it 
                        in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair- 

           Viveca interrupts, jolting Emily from her reverie. 

                                 VIVECA
                        And what if the house really is 
                        haunted? 

                                 EMILY
                        We live in the real world, 
                        Jennifer. That house is not 
                        haunted. 

           EXT. RADCLIFFE BRIDGE - DAY 

           Emily drives over the (now repaired) bridge, to the nice part 
           of town. On the passenger seat next to her a copy of a book; 
           Secrets of Gothic Architecture. 

           INT. EMILY’S MUSTANG - DAY 

           Emily drives down SOMERSET ROAD, lined with boxy new 
           construction and bright green, well manicured lawns. This is 
           how the other half lives. 

           Emily stops in front of Susan’s house.Ext. Carterhook manor 
           (susan’s house) - day 

           Susan’s house is the only remaining Victorian on the block. 
           The mansion’s front is elaborate, carved stonework, dizzying 
           in its detail: flowers and filigrees, dainty rods and 
           swooping ribbons. Two life-sized angels framed the doorway, 
           arms reaching upward.
           TRASH and RECYCLING BINS set out on the curb for trash day. 

           A CHILD-SIZED PIANO, WARPED and BURNED sits on the curb. 

           EXT. WEST SOMERSET ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Emily gets out of the car, takes an optimistic breath of 
           spring air. But then--

           She looks up and the house - stops, stares, gives a slight 
           shiver. 

           The house is vile. It lurks. 

           Standing at one window Emily spots a CHILD - gray trousers, 
           black sweater, a maroon tie perfectly knotted at the neck. A 
           thicket of dark hair covering his eyes. Then, a sudden blur, 
           and he disappears behind heavy brocade drapes. 

           Emily shakes off the dread. She starts towards the house-- 

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Emily knocks on the door. At her feet, carved in stone, an 
           inscription; CARTERHOOK MANOR, ESTABLISHED 1893, PATRICK 
           CARTERHOOK. 

           The door swings open. REVEAL; Susan, eyes red-rimmed, hair 
           matted. She puts on an air of fake grandeur. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Welcome to Carterhook Manor. I’ve 
                        finally stopped sleeping. 

           Emily steps inside, the door closing heavily behind her. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - CONTINUOUS  

           The inside of the house stands in stark contrast to the 
           outside. It had been gutted and looks like every other rich 
           person’s house - recessed lighting, wide plank wood floors, 
           granite counters. 

           All the newness can’t hide the feeling that something evil 
           lives here. 

           A large foyer, with a grand staircase on the left. The foyer 
           leads to a hallway that opens to an eat in kitchen ahead. The 
           formal living and dining room to the right. 

           Emily looks around appreciatively. And then, with authority; 
                                 EMILY
                        Let’s start with the blood trickle. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Susan and Emily stand at the base of the stairs, next to the 
           hallway closet. The stairwell is open, with two more floors 
           above them. 

           Emily looks up through the banister to see a FACE peering 
           down at her. Black hair and dark eyes set against the 
           porcelain skin of an antique doll. This is MILES, 15. He 
           stares at Emily, then disappears abruptly. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Here. It was right here. 

           Susan removes a large print from the wall and points--

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        The entire length of the wall. I 
                        scrubbed it with bleach. I need my 
                        walls to be white. I take comfort 
                        in the cold pale shade. Makes me 
                        feel in control. I guess because 
                        most of the time... I feel so out 
                        of control.   

           Emily nods understanding. Leans in, examining the wall.

                                 EMILY
                        There is a tremendous feeling of 
                        pain, right here. Throughout the 
                        whole house, but definitely here. 

                                 SUSAN
                        The house creaks all night long. It 
                        shouldn’t. Everything inside is 
                        new. Miles’s door slams at strange 
                        times. And he... he’s getting 
                        worse. It’s like he carries a 
                        darkness on his back. I’d move, but 
                        we spent so much money buying this 
                        house, and then almost that much 
                        renovating, and... my husband won’t 
                        let me anyway. He says Miles is 
                        just going through growing pains. 
                        And that I’m a nervous, silly 
                        woman.

           Susan lets out a joyless laugh. 
                                 EMILY
                        That is something powerful men say 
                        to women to make us second guess 
                        ourselves. He shouldn’t treat you 
                        as if you’re self-indulgent when 
                        really you’re endangered. 

           This lands on Susan. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I sense something awful too. Do you 
                        mind if I take a closer look?  

                                 SUSAN
                        Please. Go ahead. 

           Emily removes a SHAWL from her purse, and places it gently 
           over her head. She puts her hands on the wall, bowing her 
           head, muttering a few words to herself. 

           She RECOILS abruptly. Shaking, Emily turns to Susan. 

                                 EMILY
                        What’s behind this wall? 

           Susan shakes her head. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Nothing. Just a closet. 

                                 EMILY
                        I need to get inside that closet. 

           Susan walks a few paces around the corner and opens the door, 
           uncertainly. Emily slips inside. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           EMILY’S POV: Expensive COATS hung neatly in a row. Some HAT 
           BOXES on a shelf. Expensive SKI EQUIPMENT leans against one 
           wall.  Along the floor, Emily notices a SMALL DOOR that looks 
           like it might contain an ELECTRICAL PANEL, but has been 
           PAINTED SHUT. Interesting. Emily examines it closely. She 
           turns back to Susan. 

                                 EMILY
                        Where does this door lead? 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m not sure. 
                                 EMILY
                        You said you did renovations. This 
                        door wasn’t in the plans? 

           Susan shakes her head. 

                                 SUSAN
                        My husband handled construction. I 
                        mostly busied myself with design 
                        elements. 

           Susan lets out a hollow laugh. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Silly “lady” things.    

           Emily doesn’t answer. She turns back to the panel. Give is a 
           push. Nothing. Shoves harder. Still nothing. 

           One last time. It breaks open. Emily peers inside - a 
           cramped, DARK PASSAGE behind it, like an animal’s burrow. 
           Susan looks over her shoulder, fearful. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. What is that?  

                                 EMILY
                        Secret corridors are common in 
                        Victorian homes. They are where 
                        spirits and energies get trapped. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you think that’s happening here? 

                                 EMILY
                        Susan your instinct was right. 
                        Something wicked lives here. Remove 
                        everything from this closet. 
                        Immediately. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I should be writing this down. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why don’t you show me the rest of 
                        the house? 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY 

           A long narrow hallway, naturally dark. The CLACK CLACK CLACK 
           of Susan’s heels echo on the wood floors. She flick lights on 
           as they walk. 
                                 SUSAN
                        Miles turns them off. Then I turn 
                        them back on. When I ask him to 
                        keep them on, he pretends he has no 
                        idea what I’m talking about.

           At the end of the hallway Susan opens a door to reveal-- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           A cavernous room with wall to wall bookshelves. 

                                 SUSAN
                        This is our den. 

           Emily takes a sharp breath in. 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s a library. 

           Her eyes take in the thousands of volumes, their covers made 
           of soft leather. Emily runs her hand over an ARM CHAIR. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Do you feel this? Do you feel 
                        the... heaviness here? 

                                 SUSAN
                        I hate this room. 

                                 EMILY 
                        I’ll need to pay extra attention to 
                        this room. 

           Susan nods and walks out of the room. Emily stays for a 
           moment taking it all in. 

           She’s spent her life dreaming of a place like this. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They walk back into the hallway, where the lights are again, 
           off. Susan sighs and begins turning them on. 

           The lights flicker. 

           From behind a CLOSED DOOR up ahead, a scratching sound, 
           compulsive, repetitive. Emily looks at the DOOR, uneasy. 

           Susan notices and motions to it. 
                                 SUSAN
                        I’d show you Miles’ room, but I 
                        don’t have a key. 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s locked? 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m scared of him. 

           Emily frowns. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I know that seems extreme, but you 
                        should see what Miles did to the 
                        babysitter he didn’t like. I want 
                        my husband to discipline him the 
                        old fashioned way, but he doesn’t 
                        believe in corporal punishment. He 
                        had your typical, WASPy upbringing, 
                        a cold drunk mother that slapped 
                        him silly, withheld affection. Said 
                        he would divorce me if raised a 
                        hand to Miles. So instead I live in 
                        constant fear... 

           She turns to Emily sharply. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t have said that. The 
                        babysitter thing wasn’t... major. 
                        Possibly an accident. I don’t know 
                        anymore. Maybe I am just goddamn 
                        crazy.

           She laughs, roughly, unhinged. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why don’t you show me the third 
                        floor? 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           They walk passing a series of rooms, wallpapered and painted, 
           with fine VICTORIAN FURNITURE arranged haphazardly.

           One room holds only a LITTER BOX. 

                                 SUSAN
                        For our cat, Wilkie. Luckiest cat 
                        in the world: his own room for his 
                        own crap. 
                                 EMILY
                        I’m sure you’ll find use for the 
                        space. 

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s actually a sweet cat. Almost 
                        twenty years old. 

           Emily smiles, like she cares. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        We obviously have more room than we 
                        need. It’s like we’re living in an 
                        expensive storage facility. My 
                        husband likes antiques. He says 
                        they give the place authenticity. 
                        He didn’t like the renovation, but 
                        I insisted.  

           Susan wrinkles her nose. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t stand old, dusty things. 

           She turns into--   

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

           A pretty room, the walls striped pink and white. An ANTIQUE 
           BASSINET in the corner, made of WICKER sits on ROCKERS. It 
           sways back and forth gently. 

           The rest of the room feels NEW, out of POTTERY BARN KIDS.   

                                 SUSAN
                        This is the nursery. My husband 
                        insisted on that hideous crib. It’s 
                        been in his family for generations. 
                        It was Miles’ when he was a baby.

                                 EMILY
                        That’s nice. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Is it? Given the way Miles turned 
                        out..? But you know how old money 
                        is about tradition. 
                             (Beat.)
                        This room is the furthest from his. 
                        That’s why I chose it for Poppy. 

                                 EMILY
                        Is that the baby’s name? 
                                 SUSAN
                        That’s what I’m calling her. For 
                        now. When I was first pregnant, the 
                        doctor told me the baby was the 
                        size of a poppy seed. I don’t know, 
                        I thought it was adorable. 

           She shrugs. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Name kind of stuck. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s sweet. 

           Susan looks a little embarrassed. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I never thought I’d be this kind of 
                        woman -- this cliche of mommyhood. 
                        But here I am, stocking up on 
                        American Girl Dolls and buying 
                        frilly pink dresses by the dozen.     

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sure it’s exciting, having a 
                        little girl. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you close with your mother? 

                                 EMILY
                        We were alike. In many ways. 

           Emily looks away, “sad.”  

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m sorry for your loss. Do you 
                        have kids? 
                             (laughs roughly)
                        What am I talking about? You’re 
                        practically a child yourself. You 
                        have plenty of time.    

                                 EMILY
                        That’s what people say. But I’m not 
                        sure I’ll ever have children. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’ve often wondered why people are 
                        so desperate to have children. I’ve 
                        concluded that it’s our way of 
                        repairing what we’ve broken.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        These little beings are our chance 
                        at undoing our mistakes and 
                        disappointments. We duplicate 
                        ourselves and hope that they will 
                        succeed where we have failed. These 
                        little vessels of optimism with 
                        limbs.  

           Susan smiles warmly, and then lightly;  

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you haven’t failed at 
                        anything. You’re psychic after all, 
                        so you can see what’s coming.    

                                 EMILY
                        Yes. It’s a blessing. 

           Susan puts her hands on her flat belly, looks at Emily 
           brightly, like maybe they’re girlfriends.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Anyway, shall I show you Poppy’s 
                        closet? We should probably check 
                        for one of those secret 
                        passageways.

           Susan crosses the room and opens the closet door, she 
           continues chatting with Emily.  

           INSIDE THE CLOSET: PINK DRESSES hang in a neat row. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m due next summer. I’m dreading 
                        being as big as a house in the dead 
                        heat but--    

           Directly below the DRESSES, a ROW OF DOLLS. 

           EACH missing LIMBS; ARMS, LEGS, HANDS, HEADS, in various 
           eugenics-like configurations. The effect is jarring.  

           Emily gasps. Susan turns to see what she’s looking at. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Susan’s eyes well with tears. Suddenly a ROTTING STENCH fills 
           the air, choking them. Susan gags, Emily stifles her reflex. 

                                 EMILY
                        I think I smell something burning.  

           Susan runs out of the room, Emily on her heels. 
           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - KITCHEN - DAY 

           Emily and Susan rush in. Miles sits at the ISLAND, waiting. 

           Susan starts when she sees him, pulls back. 

           Miles stands, his sullen face transformed into a bright, 
           goofy grin. 

                                 MILES
                        Hi Momma.  

           SMOKE billows from the oven, a STENCH overwhelms the room. 
           Susan throws open the oven door to a DOZENS of DOLL LIMBS 
           warped and melted. Susan sucks her breath in. 

           Miles approaches, menacing. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Do you like my surprise Momma? 

                                 SUSAN
                        What did you do? 

           He wraps his arms around Susan, nuzzling her. But the action 
           is loaded and mean. Susan stares at Emily pleading. 

                                 MILES
                        I love you. Why won’t you hug me?  

           Susan pats him, Miles releases her suddenly, as if scalded. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I heard what you just told her. 
                        About me. About the babysitter. 
                        About everything. You’re such a 
                        bitch.  

           Susan flinches, hands on her belly, protective. Miles turns 
           to Emily. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I really hope you leave and don’t 
                        come back. For your own good. This 
                        is a family matter. 

           Emily takes a small step back.  Miles regards her cold, 
           amused. He turns on his heel and exits, his heavy shoes 
           clattering on the marble tile. Susan looks at the floor, 
           defeated, takes a breath, looks up, her voice barely above a 
           whisper.   

                                 SUSAN
                        I need your help.

           The WHISTLING of a TEA KETTLE. 

           Susan sets two mugs on the island. 

                                 EMILY
                        It comes out to about $3500 for 
                        twelve cleansings -- one a month, 
                        for a year. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Miles will kill me if we wait that 
                        long.  

                                 EMILY
                        I do have a more intense program. 
                        Something I reserve for my most 
                        pressing cases. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I think it’s clear we’re in dire 
                        straits.   

                                 EMILY
                        Two cleansings a week, for the next 
                        six weeks. It’s aggressive, but--

                                 SUSAN
                        You’ll start tomorrow. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - DAY 

           The Grown Up arrives at Carterhook Manor for her first day of 
           work. She unpacks her supplies - her sage and lavender and 
           rosemary. Her salts. Her rags. 

           CLEANSING MONTAGE; Emily lights SAGE; she sprinkles SEA SALT 
           in front of CLOSET DOORS; puts HANDFULS of ROSEMARY and 
           LAVENDER into POT of BOILING WATER; wipes the WALLS and 
           FLOORS, doing away with COBWEBS and DUST.  

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Mostly I came during the day, when 
                        Miles was at school and Susan was 
                        at work. I lit my sage and 
                        sprinkled my sea salt. I boiled my 
                        lavender and rosemary, and I wiped 
                        down the house, walls and floors.
           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LATER

           Finished with her rituals, Emily looks around. She’s never 
           been in a house this fancy before. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Also I nosed around. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           In the kitchen she opens the fridge, the DRINKS arranged in 
           perfect rows, the gourmet OLIVES, CORNICHONS, HEIRLOOM 
           TOMATOES, crisp WHITE WINE. 

           It’s a designer fridge. 

           Everything in the pantry is labeled, organized, alphabetized. 
           Bread. Cereal. Crackers. Flour. Sugar. Salt.  

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER CLOSET - LATER 

           She walks through Susan’s closet, the items color-coordinated 
           and arranged according to category.   

           The colors muted; black, white, navy, grey. 

           Insanely organized. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Heated floors. Lush towels. Expensive lotions and potions in 
           crystal bottles. 

           A CLOTH SHOWER CURTAIN. Emily fingers it, appreciatively.  

           The his and her vanity mirrors surrounded by little round 
           bulbs that give off a soft, glowing light. 

           A single tube of TOM FORD LIPSTICK sits on a MOTHER OF PEARL 
           TRAY. Emily fingers it’s beautiful shiny black surface. The 
           shade is named PRIVILEGE. 

           Emily applies the SOFT PINK SHADE to her lips in the mirror.

           A different, better life stares back at her. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bed is perfectly made, HOSPITAL CORNERS. An abundance of 
           THROW PILLOWS. 
           On one night stand a neat STACK of BOOKS; WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN 
           YOU’RE EXPECTING, EXPECTING BETTER. 

           Emily pulls back the sheets. They have been ironed. She runs 
           her hand over the cool fabric.  

           Next to her, on the other NIGHT STAND a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of 
           Susan, wearing a white button down, posed, somber. 

           Susan watches Emily from inside the frame, accusingly.  

           Emily remakes the bed. Hurries out. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LIBRARY - LATER  

           Emily scans the BOOKS - the titles are familiar. She 
           congratulates herself for having read so many of them. 

           On the far side of the room a BEAUTIFUL OLD TRUNK. Emily 
           approaches it. IT’S LOCKED. She considers picking the lock, 
           but decides against it

           She pulls down a copy of No Name, and curls into the leather 
           chair with a satisfied sigh. 

           This is better than anything she could have hoped for. 

           Emily Kent has arrived. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Emily paces excitedly, drinking WINE from IDENTICAL STEM-WARE 
           we saw at Susan’s. 

           Dale sits on a LAWN CHAIR eating CORNICHONS out of a JAR. He 
           regards them suspiciously.  

                                 EMILY
                        Their house has a name. Like 
                        Manderlay or Otranto or Thornfield 
                        Hall. A true sign of wealth and 
                        sophistication. And the shower 
                        curtain, it’s cloth, no cheap holey 
                        plastic in sight.  

                                 DALE
                        Why are these pickles so small? 

                                 EMILY
                        Those are cornichons. 
                                 DALE
                        They’re gross. 

                                 EMILY
                        They’re French, Dale. 

                                 DALE
                        So lemme get this straight. You’re 
                        tricking this broad into believing 
                        you have some magical powers so her 
                        son stops spooking her?  

                                 EMILY
                        I’m earning money to publish my 
                        novel. 

                                 DALE
                        I dunno. Seems kinda shady if you 
                        ask me. 

                                 EMILY
                        I didn’t ask you. But since we’re 
                        on the topic, this is what writers 
                        do. We have to hunt for stories, 
                        break out of our comfort zone, find 
                        characters in unexpected places.  
                        This what I call inspiration. 
                             (Beat.)
                        You know, Susan would make a great 
                        fictional character. 

           Emily takes a thoughtful sip of wine. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I thought it would be fun to become 
                        Susan’s friend. But I wonder what 
                        it’s like to actually be Susan. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - BAR - NIGHT

           Emily, wearing a CRISP WHITE BUTTON DOWN, her hair in a tight 
           BUN, is perched nervously at the bar. A small HANDBAG next to 
           her.  

           Emily’s POV: Two ELEGANT WOMEN greet each other with double 
           cheek kisses. The glint of DIAMONDS in low light. A WAD of 
           CASH held with a GOLD MONEY CLIP pulled from a TROUSER 
           POCKET. AMBER LIQUID poured into BACARAT TUMBLERS. A PRESSED 
           WHITE NAPKIN draped over the BARTENDER’S forearm. 

           Emily is woefully out of her league. 
           The BARTENDER places a SILVER TRAY with small bowls filled 
           with OLIVES, NUTS, CRUDITE and CHIPS in front of Emily. 

                                 EMILY
                        Oh. I didn’t order this. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s complimentary.

           A long, uncomfortable silence. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Can I offer you a cocktail? 

           Emily looks around uncertainly. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’ll wait for my date.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Very well. 

           Emily checks her PHONE. No texts. She pulls a COMPACT from 
           her purse and a LIPSTICK; “PRIVILEGE” by TOM FORD. 

           She opens the compact and applies several layers onto her 
           already made-up pout. 

           IN THE COMPACT: she sees Michael hurrying towards her. 
           Emily’s eyes light up. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m so sorry I’m late. 

           Michael kisses both of Emily’s cheeks. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You look beautiful. More buttoned 
                        up than usual, might I add.  

                                 EMILY
                        Do you like the white? It makes me 
                        feel in control.

           Michael takes in her comment. Surprised? We can’t quite tell.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        They make a sublime Manhattan here. 
                        Shall I order us a round?  

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - BAR - LATER

           Michael and Emily sip their Manhattans. 
                                 EMILY
                        I recently started Collins’ No 
                        Name. The thing I love about his 
                        work is that his characters are 
                        constantly wondering what sort of 
                        story they are living, and their 
                        ability to alter the story. To 
                        change their lives.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t want to talk about books. 

                                 EMILY
                        Oh. I see. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want to talk about you. Your 
                        story. Tell me something about 
                        Emily Kent that no one else knows. 

                                 EMILY
                        Tell me something about Michael 
                        Audley that no one else knows. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I got some exciting news 
                        today. My book is being given a 
                        Peabody Award. 

                                 EMILY
                        A Peabody? Next to the Pulitzer and 
                        the Nobel, it’s among academia’s 
                        highest honors.  

           Michael shrugs, bashful. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations. You’re a big deal.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wouldn’t go that far. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s why you told me. So that I 
                        think you’re smart, powerful. 
                        Virile.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want you to think the best of me. 
                        Despite our circumstances. 

                                 EMILY
                        I know you’re a good man. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        And you? What kind of woman are 
                        you?  

                                 EMILY
                        Isn’t it better if I am your No 
                        Name? A blank canvas for your 
                        fantasies? An empty vessel to fill 
                        up with your desires? 

           Emily unbuttons one of her pearly white buttons. 

           Michael swallows hard. Aroused. His phone buzzes with a text. 
           He ignores it. He leans in, puts his hand on her thigh. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want to take you upstairs. I want 
                        to picture my life with you. I want 
                        to be inside you. I want--

           Michael’s phone buzzes another text and another in quick 
           succession a few more. 

           He looks at his phone. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I have to go. I... 

           He throws a CRISP 100 DOLLAR BILL on the bar. He rushes out. 

           Emily stares at the bill. After a moment, she pockets it. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Emily rides Dale. Closes her eyes, seeing Michael. She hears 
           snippets of Dale’s gym-centric dirty talk. 

                                 DALE
                        Yes... Engage your core... Sink 
                        down into those glutes... 

           Emily puts her HAND over Dale’s MOUTH. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Mmmhmm. Keep it pinched... beast 
                        mode babe...    

           Emily shoves a SHEET in Dale’s MOUTH. She focuses on the 
           Michael. Grinds her hips into Dale. Comes with a scream. 
           INT. DALE’S SOUPED UP 1988 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX - LATER

           Dale and Emily pull up in front of a WHITE CLAPBOARD house in 
           a MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD. 

           In the distance, the Radcliffe Bridge, separating the haves 
           from the have-nots. 

                                 DALE
                        This is it babe. 

                                 EMILY
                        What’s it? 

                                 DALE
                        I put an offer on this house. 

                                 EMILY
                        Congratulations. 

                                 DALE
                        For us. Three bedrooms. Two baths. 
                        Enough room in the back for an 
                        above ground pool. Whaddaya think?  

                                 EMILY
                        I finished my novel. I’m going to 
                        send it to all the major New York 
                        publishers. I think it’s good 
                        enough to be a best-seller. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - DINING ROOM - DUSK 

           Emily wipes the floorboards with her rags vigorously. 

           Suddenly a searing pain in her hand. 

           She pulls her hand back, she is bleeding, a deep cut in her 
           middle finger. She wraps it tightly in one of her spare rags, 
           watching the blood seep through. 

           Emily senses a presence behind her. She turns around. 

           Her eyes scan the growing darkness. Nothing. 

           The CHANDELIER swings above, back and forth, back and forth. 

           Illuminating her, darkening her, illuminating her, darkening 
           her. 
           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY 

           Emily stands outside of Miles’ room, debating. Makes a 
           decision, picks the lock, pushes the door open- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MILES’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Heavy drapes keep the light out. A single wood-framed bed 
           pushed against the far wall. Hospital corners. Inside the 
           closet, three identical sets of Miles’ SCHOOL UNIFORM hang 
           limply. 

           It’s all very Edward Gorey.  

           On the bedside table several editions of THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE 
           CHRONICLES by MAGDALENA VANSTONE. 

           Next to the books, an elaborately carved WOODEN BOX. Emily 
           picks it up curiously, sits down on the bed. 

           The bed CREAKS. Emily jumps, startled. 

           She opens the box. Inside a set of SMALL TEETH. A fistful of 
           BLONDE HAIR. 

           A few POLAROIDS face down. Emily turns them over - 
           VOYEURISTIC PHOTOS of SUSAN - taken from outside her bedroom 
           window. 

           Emily hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. 

           She shoves the items back in the box. She puts the box back 
           on the bedside table, her breath quickening.  

           The FOOTSTEPS grow closer. 

           Emily slips out of the room. 

           The hallway is empty, save for a BLANK POLAROID lying in the 
           middle of the hallway. A silent threat.    

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Emily uneasily counts the MONEY Susan has paid her. She 
           stashes it under her mattress. 

           She begins composing a text to MICHAEL. Hesitates. Puts her 
           phone down. 

           Lies in bed, eyes wide open, staring at the WATER STAIN. 
           The stain MORPHS into a WOMAN who looks like SUSAN. MICE 
           crawl over her body. First just one, then a few more, then 
           dozens and dozens. She laughs, hysterical.  Emily blinks. 
           It’s just a stain. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - FORTUNE DEN - DAY  

           Emily’s FINGER is BANDAGED. She clumsily shuffles a deck of 
           TAROT CARDS. Viveca enters, notices her injury. 

                                 VIVECA
                        What the hell happened to your 
                        finger? If you were still beating 
                        off dudes, an injury like that 
                        could put you of commission for a 
                        week. 

                                 EMILY
                        I cut my finger cleansing Susan’s 
                        house. It was weird. When it 
                        happened, it felt like the house 
                        was pleased or something. 

                                 VIVECA
                        Pleased? A house can’t be pleased. 
                        That’s crazy talk, nerdy. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’ve started to dread my trips to 
                        Carterhook Manor. I know it sounds 
                        crazy, but I really think it could 
                        be haunted. And that stepson Miles, 
                        he might very well be a psycho 
                        killer. 

                                 VIVECA
                        I wish I could say I hate to say I 
                        told ya so. But I told ya so. I 
                        ain’t gettin’ involved in this 
                        racket. You’re on your own nerdy. 
                        This is exactly what happens when 
                        you think your shit don’t stink. 

                                 EMILY
                        Like Icarus, I flew too close to 
                        the sun. 

                                 VIVECA
                        Who? 

           Emily shakes her head. The idiocy of some people. 
                                 EMILY
                        Nevermind. I only have a couple of 
                        cleansings left. I’ll grin and bare 
                        it. It’ll be worth it in the long 
                        run.  

                                 VIVECA
                        Guess all that dick doesn’t seem so 
                        bad anymore, huh? 

           Emily shakes her head annoyed, reaches for some NEOSPORIN. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - KITCHEN - DAY 

           Emily boils lavender over the hot stove, her cheeks are 
           flushed from the heat. She feels a presence behind her. She 
           turns to find Miles, wearing his school uniform, a smirk on 
           his face, holding her prized copy of The Turn of the Screw. 

           A slow smiles spreads across his face.  

                                 MILES
                        You like ghost stories? 

                                 EMILY
                        Why are you home Miles? You’re 
                        supposed to be at school.

                                 MILES
                        I’ve been studying you. You’re 
                        interesting. You know something bad 
                        is going to happen, right? 

           He takes a step towards her. Emily instinctively takes a step 
           back. He moves closer still. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m trying to help. 

                                 MILES
                        But you agree? You feel it? Evil?  

                                 EMILY
                        I feel it. 

           Miles turns his attention to the pot, traces his finger along 
           the edge, then snatches it away, pink from the heat. 

                                 MILES
                        You don’t look how I thought you’d 
                        look. Up close. I thought you’d 
                        be... sexy. You look like a 
                        babysitter. 
           Emily takes a step back. 

                                 EMILY
                        Are you trying to scare me Miles? 

           Her eyes dart towards the burner, the pot of boiling water 
           sitting precariously between them. 

                                 MILES
                        Silly, stupid Emily. I’m trying to 
                        help you. I don’t want you around 
                        Susan. If you come back, you will 
                        die. I don’t want to say more than 
                        that. But I’ve warned you.

           Miles turns on his heel and leaves the room. As soon as Emily 
           hears his footsteps disappear up the stairs, she grabs the 
           pot of boiling water, pouring it hastily down the drain, and 
           rushes into--

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           She grabs her purse and keys off the console. A foul ODOR. 

           Emily looks inside of her bag - it is filled with VOMIT. 
           Miles’ sick covers everything inside - WALLET, PHONE, KEYS, 
           business CARDS. 

           Susans bangs in the door, frantic, breathless.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Is he here? Are you okay? School 
                        called, said Miles never showed. He 
                        must have walked in the front door 
                        and straight out the back. He 
                        doesn’t like it that you’re here. 
                        Did he say anything to you?

           Before Emily can answer, a loud SMASH upstairs, and then a 
           blood-curdling SCREAM. 

           Emily and Susan exchange a look, run up the stairs. 

           Hanging from the expensive CHANDELIER, a PRIMITIVE FIGURE 
           made of cloth, it’s face drawn in magic marker. A noose 
           fashioned from red thread. 

           From Miles room, a continuous haunted WAILING. 

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Nooooo! You bitch. You bitch! 
           Susan shakily plucks the figure from the light fixture, her 
           eyes welling with tears. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I thought this was me at first. But 
                        I don’t have brown hair. 

                                 EMILY
                        I think it’s me. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m so tired of being afraid. 

                                 EMILY
                        I know. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You don’t. But you will. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LATER

           Emily works maniacally, washing every square inch of the 
           house with rosemary and lavender. 

           Miles’ SCREAMS pierce the dead air, punctured by Susan’s 
           violent SOBS. 

           Emily continues to work; smudging sage, repeating her magical 
           gibberish words like prayer. 

           The screams intensify. 

           The wails sharpen.   

           Emily’s heart pounds in her chest.  

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - NIGHT

           Dusk. 

           Emily unlocks her CAR, exhausted, hands trembling. She gets 
           inside, she turns the key to start the engine, but it stalls. 
           She turns it again. It stalls. 

           Suddenly, an OLDER WOMAN, 60S, well-powdered and plump-
           cheeked knocks on Emily’s window, STARTLING HER, motions to 
           Emily to roll down her window. Emily obliges. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN 
                        I just want to thank you for what 
                        you are doing for this family. For 
                        helping little Miles. 
                                 EMILY
                        I haven’t done anything. 

           The Older Woman pantomimes locking her lips, scurries away. 

           Emily watches her go.  

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Emily tries to read. She wears multiple sweaters. She 
           shivers, despondent, jittery. Her eyes flit around the room, 
           searching for danger.  

           A KNOCK at the door, startling her. Emily peers through the 
           peep-hole. A WARPED Dale stands, fidgeting in the hallway, 
           carrying a BOUQUET OF CARNATIONS. 

           Emily unlatches the chain. Opens the door. Dale enters, 
           handing her the flowers. 

                                 EMILY
                        Thanks for coming over. I don’t 
                        know. I couldn’t be alone tonight. 

                                 DALE
                        Em that kid seems like a dangerous 
                        creep. And you hurt yourself. Why 
                        are you still working there? 

                                 EMILY
                        Susan and her husband poured 
                        millions of dollars into a house 
                        that made them resentful of one 
                        another instead of happy. A house 
                        that reeks of misery and depravity. 
                        Money is wasted on the rich, Dale. 
                        But why should it be? I want a cut 
                        too. I deserve it. If I can get 
                        through this, maybe I have a chance 
                        at something better. At a life like 
                        Susan’s. Maybe I’m risking 
                        everything, but without this? My 
                        life is hopeless. 

                                 DALE
                        It’s not hopeless. I wanna marry 
                        you Em. I want us to have our very 
                        own chain of Crossfits, a buncha 
                        kids and an RV for camping in the 
                        summertime.    

                                 EMILY
                        Imagine we were sitting in that RV-- 
           She looks Dale in the eye. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What on earth would we say to each 
                        other?

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Emily lies in bed. She rolls over - coming face to face with 
           the WATER STAIN - it has grown. It now covers the CEILING and 
           the WALL next to her bed. It has turned a sickening RED, like 
           a RUSTY TIDAL POOL. Emily touches it tentatively. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        This stain reminded me of my 
                        mother. Of my old life. All the 
                        transactions — this for that, that 
                        for this — and none of it had made 
                        any difference until now. Once the 
                        transaction was complete, my mind 
                        was a blank. But Susan Burke and 
                        her family, they stuck with me. 
                        Susan Burke and her family and that 
                        house.

           Emily crosses the room, opens her lap top. She types PATRICK 
           CARTERHOOK into the search engine. a LINK from a UNIVERSITY 
           ENGLISH DEPARTMENT: Victorian True Crime: The Grisly Tale of 
           the Patrick Carterhook Family. 

           Emily clicks on the link. 

           WE FLASHBACK (in the hands of a skilled director) and watch 
           the ominous history of CARTERHOOK MANOR unfurl, it is MILES 
           who narrates the story. 

           Miles, who has invaded Emily’s psyche, the demonic presence 
           that occupies her thoughts. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        The year is 1893, and department-
                        store magnate Patrick Carterhook 
                        moves into his splendid Gilded Age 
                        mansion in the heart of the city 
                        with his lovely wife, Margaret, 
                        their son, Robert and their 
                        daughter Penelope. Robert was a 
                        troubled, violent boy, and by age 
                        fourteen, he proved unable to 
                        control himself. The Carterhooks 
                        chose to keep him away from 
                        society: In 1895 they locked him 
                        inside the mansion.

                        Robert steadily grew more vicious 
                        in his gloomy, gilded prison. He 
                        smeared his family’s belongings 
                        with his own excrement and vomit. A 
                        nursemaid was sent to the hospital 
                        with unexplained bruises; she never 
                        returned. No one knows exactly what 
                        went on in that house the night of 
                        January 7, 1897, but the bloody 
                        results are indisputable. Patrick 
                        Carterhook was discovered stabbed 
                        to death in his bed; his body was 
                        pocked with 117 knife wounds. 
                        Patrick’s wife, Margaret, was found 
                        struck down by an ax — still in her 
                        back - as she was fleeing up the 
                        stairs to the attic, and young 
                        Penelope, age two, was found 
                        drowned in a bathtub. Robert hanged 
                        himself from a beam in his room. He 
                        had apparently dressed up for the 
                        occasion: he wore a blue Sunday 
                        suit, covered in his parents’ 
                        blood. It was still wet from 
                        drowning his little sister. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN: A PHOTO of the CARTERHOOKS. A 
           slender MAN in his forties, his white-blonde WIFE, their 
           youngest DAUGHTER an imprint of the mother, and the older 
           SON... a shock of dark hair, piercing black eyes... 

           Emily stares at it, takes a sharp breath in. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Miles. Not a perfect match, but the 
                        essence was exact: the smugness, 
                        the superiority, the threat. Miles. 

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - HAND JOB NOOK - DAY  

           A gaunt, tired Emily jerks Michael off. He’s sporting a five 
           o’clock shadow. She’s lost weight. The blades of her 
           shoulders sharp, her skin mushroom pale, violet pouches under 
           her eyes. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hope you don’t mind the beard. 
                        Didn’t get a chance to shave.  
                                 EMILY
                        Looks nice. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I apologize about the way we left 
                        things last time. 

                                 EMILY
                        I thought there was something 
                        between us. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        There is. But my life is 
                        complicated. You know that. 

                                 EMILY
                        Doesn’t mean I have to like it. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m glad I get to see you before I 
                        hit the road again for the Peabodys 
                        in Charleston.  

                                 EMILY
                        Yeah. 

           Emily speeds up her stroke. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Emily, stop. 

           Michael stops her hand. Sits up, zips up his pants.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You can talk to me. 

           Emily sighs heavily. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Come on. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why do you love the horror novels 
                        we read, so much?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Gothic villains represent the 
                        darkest parts of ourselves. They’re 
                        a mirror. A warbled, dusty mirror, 
                        but a mirror nonetheless. The 
                        reason the monsters seem 
                        unstoppable? Why they’re always one 
                        step ahead? Why they tap right into 
                        our nightmares? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        It’s because they’re basically just 
                        an extension of ourselves. We are 
                        all haunted by our own demons. 

                                 EMILY
                        You don’t seem to have any demons. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I hide them well. 

                                 EMILY
                        Mine aren’t so well hidden. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s what I like about you. Your 
                        darkness lurks just below the 
                        surface. Sometimes I feel like I 
                        can touch it. 

                                 EMILY
                        And what about houses? Can they be 
                        born bad, like people? Can a house 
                        be disturbed? Deranged? Like 
                        Eleanor? Mad in its very guts? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I guess the answer lies once again 
                        with the person. The inhabitant of 
                        the house. The supernatural attacks 
                        when minds are the weakest. 

                                 EMILY
                        Meaning? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you recognize the demon, if you 
                        let it in, it has the ability to 
                        bring you fear, to inflict pain. To 
                        interfere with your life. The demon 
                        is your mind.  

                                 EMILY
                        And if you reject it? If you never 
                        acknowledge it to begin with? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Then you’re always in control. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Emily sleeps fitfully. She dreams vividly. 
           INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           A heavy FIGURE, it’s back to us, sits at Susan’s kitchen 
           table. A baby wails in the background. Emily approaches, 
           tentatively. The figure turns-- 

           REVEAL; EMILY’S MOTHER. One eye a grotesque socket, empty, 
           dry, rotting like meat, filled with maggots. The other eye, 
           stares at Emily, hungrily. She is ugly and chinless. She 
           reaches her gnarled hands towards Emily, begging.   

                                 EMILY’S MOTHER
                        Come to Momma. Please, baby. Come.  

           Emily shakes her head, frightened. 

           A wild laugh escapes Emily’s mother. 

                                 EMILY’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You’re too good for me, Emily? Too 
                        good for me you fool? You’re not 
                        too good. You’re just like me. 

           Her voice rises crazily, taunting.  

                                 EMILY’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You’re just like me. You’re just 
                        like me, you stupid bitch. Just 
                        like me. Stupid bitch. Just like 
                        me.    

           Emily tries to speak but words get caught in her throat. The 
           BABY’s WAILING intensifies to a HOWL.  

           Emily’s Mother stands, pushing her chair back, LUNGING at 
           Emily her rough hands wrapping around her throat. Squeezing-- 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Emily thrashes violently. Wakes from her nightmare with a 
           start. 

           Outside, a thunderstorm swirls, violent. 

           She gets out of bed, dresses hurriedly.  

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - NIGHT

           Emily knocks on the door. The rain beats down heavily. Susan 
           opens the door, her depthless grey eyes glassy, her skin 
           sallow and pale. 
           She wears her HIGH HEELS, as always. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You are psychic. It’s gotten worse. 
                        It’s not stopping.  

           She leads Emily inside, collapsing on a couch in the living 
           room. 

                                 EMILY
                        Is Miles here? 

           Susan nods, trembling. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Miles told me last night, quite 
                        calmly that he was going to kill me 
                        and the baby. 

           She wraps her arms around herself, begins to cry. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        And I actually worry because... 
                        Wilkie... oh god.  

           A CAT pads into the room, slow and worn. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Look what he did to poor Wilkie! 

           The cat’s back haunches with only a frayed tuft of hair. 

                                 EMILY
                        He cut off his tail? 

           Susan nods, her eyes wide with fear and exhaustion. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Susan do you have a laptop? I need 
                        to show you something. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LIBRARY

           Susan and Emily sit in front of a laptop, their faces glow, 
           the story of the Carterhooks displayed on the blue screen. 

                                 EMILY
                        Does Robert Carterhook remind you 
                        of anyone? 

           Susan nods, as if in a trance. 
                                 SUSAN
                        What does it mean? 

                                 EMILY
                        Susan, I like you. I don’t like 
                        many people. I want the best for 
                        your family. And I don’t think it’s 
                        me.

                                 SUSAN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 EMILY
                        There is something wrong with this 
                        house. It’s bigger than me, I can’t 
                        help you. I think you should leave. 
                        I don’t care what your husband 
                        says.

                                 SUSAN
                        But if we leave... Miles is still 
                        with us. 

                                 EMILY
                        Yes. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Then he’ll be cured? If he leaves 
                        this house? 

                                 EMILY
                        Susan, I don’t know. But I’m not 
                        qualified to fix this. I think you 
                        need to leave tonight. Go to a 
                        hotel. Get two rooms. Lock the 
                        adjoining door. And then... we’ll 
                        figure it out. But all I can really 
                        do for you is be your friend.  

           Susan stands dizzily, overwhelmed, holding her throat. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Excuse me. 

           She rushes out the door. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        No parties here for me. No 
                        referrals to rich, nervous friends. 
                        I was ruining my big chance; I gave 
                        her an answer she didn’t want. But 
                        I felt, for the first time in my 
                        life, decent. Not telling-myself-I-
                        am decent, but actually decent.

                                 EMILY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Like maybe badness wasn’t baked 
                        into my DNA. Like I wasn’t rotting 
                        from the inside.  

           Susan flickers past the door again, and a moment later, Miles 
           behind her. Emily yells out; 

                                 EMILY
                        Susan! 

           Emily stands, rushes towards the DOOR, peers down the dark 
           hallway. She hears URGENT, ANGRY MURMERS and then... nothing. 
           She fears the worst.  

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Susan! Watch out!  

           She yells into the BLACK HALLWAY. Miles appears at the door, 
           blocking the exit. 

                                 MILES
                        I told you not to ever come back 
                        here, and you came back — you came 
                        back again and again. You know 
                        you’re going to die right? 

           Emily backs away from him, trying to keep her voice steady. 

                                 EMILY
                        Where’s your step-mom Miles? What 
                        did you do with Susan?  

                                 MILES
                        You still don’t understand, do you? 
                        Tonight is when we die. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sorry Miles, I didn’t mean to 
                        upset you. 

           He laughs, his eyes crinkling. Complete mirth. 

                                 MILES
                        No, you misunderstand me. She’s 
                        going to kill you. Susan is going 
                        to kill you and me. Look around 
                        this room. Do you think you’re here 
                        by accident? Look closely. Look at 
                        the books.

           Emily approaches a shelf, her hands tracing the hundreds of 
           volumes; Rebecca, The Woman in White, The Turn of the Screw, 
           The Haunting of Hill House.  
                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t a well-read bookworm; I 
                        was just a dumb whore in the right 
                        library.

           Emily turns to face Miles. 

           He pulls a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH from THE ETERNALLY LOCKED TRUNK, 
           handing it to Emily. Inside the TRUNK are DOZENS of FRAMED 
           PHOTOS - this is where Susan has been hiding the evidence. 

           Miles hands the PHOTO to Emily. She looks at it; the summer 
           sunset behind a bride and groom on their wedding day. 

           The BRIDE is a radiant, stunning Susan. 

           The GROOM? MICHAEL AUDLEY. 

                                 MILES
                        Susan is going to kill you. And I’m 
                        pretty sure she’s going to kill me 
                        too. 

                                 EMILY
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MILES
                        She’s calling 911 right now. She 
                        told me to stall you. When she 
                        comes upstairs, she’s going to 
                        shoot you, and she’s going to tell 
                        the cops one of two things. One: 
                        You are a con artist who claims she 
                        has psychic powers in order to prey 
                        on the emotionally vulnerable. You 
                        told Susan you could help her 
                        mentally unstable son - and she 
                        trusted you - but instead, all 
                        you’ve been doing is coming into 
                        the house and stealing from her. 
                        When she confronted you, you became 
                        violent, you shot me, she shot you 
                        in self-defense.

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t like that at all. What’s 
                        the other option? 

                                 MILES
                        You are legit. You really did 
                        believe that the house was haunting 
                        me. But it turned out I’m just a 
                        run-of-the-mill teen sociopath. You 
                        pushed me too hard, I killed you.

                        She and I struggled with the gun, 
                        she shot me in self-defense.

                                 EMILY
                        Why would she want to kill you? 

                                 MILES
                        She doesn’t like me, she never has. 
                        I’m not her son. She tried to pack 
                        me off to my mom, but my mom has 
                        zero interest. Then she tried to 
                        ship me to boarding school but my 
                        dad said no. She definitely would 
                        like me dead. It’s just how she is, 
                        how she makes her living: She 
                        defines and eliminates problems. 

           Bewildered, Emily turns this story over in her mind. 

                                 EMILY
                        But she seems so-

                                 MILES
                        Mousy? She’s not. She wanted you to 
                        think that. She’s a beautiful, 
                        successful executive. She’s a 
                        goddamn overdog. But you needed to 
                        feel like you were preying on 
                        someone weaker than you. That you 
                        had the upper hand. I mean, am I 
                        wrong? Isn’t that your whole 
                        business? Manipulating the 
                        manipulatable?

                                 EMILY
                        Susan wants to kill me because of 
                        your dad? 

                                 MILES
                        Susan and my Dad were a Norman 
                        Rockwell painting, the perfect 
                        couple living in the perfect house, 
                        and you ripped the fantasy to 
                        shreds. 

           Emily’s voice rises. Panic. 

                                 EMILY
                        Does your Dad know I’m here? 

                                 MILES
                        No. But once my dad learns we’re 
                        dead, hears Susan’s story? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        Once she tells him about being so 
                        scared, and coming across the 
                        business card for the psychic in 
                        his copy of Rebecca, and 
                        desperately asking her to help... 
                        imagine that guilt. His kid is dead 
                        because he wanted a hand job. His 
                        wife was forced to kill because he 
                        got a hand job. He’ll never be able 
                        to make it up to her. Which is the 
                        point

                                 EMILY
                        That’s how she found me? My 
                        business card? 

           As Miles speaks, we watch the EVENTS HE DESCRIBES UNFOLD. 
           They have a DREAM-LIKE QUALITY, appearing in GRAINY FLASHES, 
           as if Emily is watching a FILM. 

           Susan DUSTS the LIBRARY, A CARD falls out of Rebecca; Susan 
           stares at the CARD, perplexed; 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Yes. She thought it was odd. My dad 
                        loves ghost stories, but he’s the 
                        world’s biggest skeptic — he’d 
                        never see a palm reader. Unless... 
                        she wasn’t really a palm reader. 
                        She followed him. 

           -- A RAINY Tuesday afternoon, Michael’s LEXUS pulls out of 
           WOLFENBACH CONSULTING OFFICES, splashes through a puddle, 
           drives towards DOWNTOWN, a few seconds later, SUSAN pulls out 
           behind him, following him

           -- Susan watches Michael enter SPIRITUAL PALMS, a woman 
           pushing a baby stroller walks by, a dog barks somewhere in 
           the distance. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        She made an appointment. And then 
                        you were reading his copy of The 
                        Woman in White, and she knew. 

           -- VIVECA answers the phone at SPIRITUAL PALMS, makes an 
           appointment for SUSAN BURKE.  

           -- THE GROWN UP sits at the round table at Spiritual Palms, 
           reading THE WOMAN IN WHITE, hears the clacking of heels, 
           looks up, smiling warmly.  
           INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Miles PACES in front of Emily, urgently. 

                                 MILES
                        My Dad and Susan were trying to get 
                        pregnant. She would ovulate, they 
                        would fuck missionary like a couple 
                        of metronomes, and then... nothing. 
                        He was leaving all his good sperm 
                        crumpled on a wetnap at Spiritual 
                        Palms.  

                                 EMILY
                        But Susan is pregnant. She got what 
                        she wanted. My relationship with 
                        Michael is purely... transactional. 
                        I swear. 

                                 MILES
                        Even if that’s true, Susan needs to 
                        make sure that my dad would be the 
                        best father ever. Michael, Susan 
                        and Poppy would be the picture 
                        perfect family. But you and I? 
                        We’re black marks, stains on her 
                        pristine, perfect life. 

           Emily looks around. The library, the walls of books which 
           were once so inviting now feel... claustrophobic. Her breath 
           quickens. A cold sweat on her brow. She moves to the door-   

                                 EMILY
                        I have to get out of here. 

                                 MILES
                        Yes. We leave tonight. 

                                 EMILY
                        We? I want nothing to do with any 
                        of you. I work alone.    

           Miles holds up a SMALL METAL OBJECT. 

                                 MILES
                        Well good luck getting out of here 
                        without the spark plug to your car.

           Susan’s heels CLATTER up the stairs, moving fast.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Emily! Don’t move! I’m coming. 

           Emily looks around, scared, searching for an alternate exit. 
           Miles grabs her HAND. 

                                 MILES
                        I’m your only option. Come on. We 
                        have to get out. Now.  

           The duo run out into-- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Susan is rushing down the hallway towards them. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Where are you going? Emily! Don’t 
                        listen to anything he says, he’s a 
                        psycopath. A dangerous demon child.     

           Miles pulls on her hand. Gripping it tightly. 

                                 MILES
                        Come on Emily! Let’s go! 

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s a liar! He’ll kill you!  

           Emily hesitates. She looks between Susan and Miles. Susan all 
           in white, her hand extended towards Emily. She looks almost 
           ANGELIC.  

           Emily looks towards Miles - dark, angry, his expression 
           BLANK. BEHIND HIM, hanging from the stairs the EMILY VOODOO 
           DOLL he made.  

           Miles GRABS Emily’s BAD WRIST roughly. 

                                 MILES
                        Let’s go! 

           Emily SCREAMS OUT in pain. She pulls her arm away sending 
           MILES flying back, tumbling down the STAIRS.  

           He lands in a crumpled heap. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Come on! Now’s our chance. Let’s 
                        go! 

           Emily SCRAMBLES after Susan into-- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Susan slams the door shut, and LOCKS IT.  
           The sound of water running comes from the BATHROOM. WATER 
           leaks into the MASTER BEDROOM. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Shit! I was running a bath. My 
                        floors are ruined! 

                                 EMILY
                        That doesn’t matter now.  

           Susan nods. 

                                 SUSAN
                        There’s a door in the closet that 
                        leads to the back stairs. I’ll meet 
                        you in there. 

           Emily turns, and moves towards the closet. Susan stops her.  

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you Emily. This nightmare is 
                        almost over. We’ll be safe soon.   

           Susan squeezes Emily’s hand. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Emily rifles through Susan’s clothes looking for the door.  

           She pushes aside a pile of PRESSED WHITE SHIRTS - and there 
           it is - shorter than a normal size door, but large enough for 
           her to fit through. Success. She kneels in front of it. 
           Reaches for the knob. 

           AND THEN-- 

           The BARREL OF A GUN enters the frame. Mother of pearl. 
           Ladylike. White.  

           She presses it to EMILY’S TEMPLE. Emily takes a sharp breath 
           inward. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Stand up. 

           Emily doesn’t move. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I said get the fuck up. 

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t kill me. Please. 
                                 SUSAN
                        Put your grubby little cum-mitts 
                        where I can see them. 

           Emily puts her hands up, trembling. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Did your psychic powers see this 
                        coming? Did you smell the malice? 
                        How did it present to you? Putrid 
                        and wet? Like semen, perhaps? What 
                        good is seeing the future if you 
                        don’t have the power to change it?  

                                 EMILY
                        Susan. Please don’t do this. I came 
                        here tonight because I wanted to 
                        help you. I wanted do the right 
                        thing.  

                                 SUSAN
                        The right thing? You’ve been 
                        knuckle shuffling my husband’s cock 
                        while I lean in at the office 
                        vaulting the corporate ladder. In 
                        my free time, I wake up at 5am to 
                        keep my abs tight and my skin taut. 
                        Eight hours at the hair salon to 
                        achieve ice blonde. I shoot myself 
                        up with hormones so my last lazy 
                        ovary - the only lethargic part of 
                        me - can get a move on. And still 
                        my husband steps out on me. But I 
                        am not a woman who breaks under the 
                        weight of his absence. No. I have a 
                        bloodthirsty sense of justice. 

                                 EMILY
                        If you kill me your picture perfect 
                        life will be shattered. 

           Susan cocks the pistol in her hand, cocks her head to the 
           side.

                                 SUSAN
                        Really? When was the last time 
                        someone came looking for a dead 
                        hooker? 

           CLOSE on Susan’s finger, pressing slowly on the trigger. 

           CLOSE on Emily, eyes twitching, breath quickening. The barrel 
           of the gun against her temple.  
           And suddenly in a BLUR Miles appears at the door with the 
           VICTORIAN ERA PROSTHETIC ARM raised high above his head. 

           He slams it down on SUSAN’S HEAD. 

           CRACK. 

           Her FACE CONTORTS WITH PAIN. She hits the ground, the GUN 
           dislodges from her grasp and SLIDES away. 

           Miles STRIKES her in the face again, leaving a SCRATCH along 
           her cheek. 

           Emily scrambles towards the gun, but Susan KICKS HER in the 
           stomach. Susan SLAMS Emily’s head into the ground and then 
           GRABS the GUN, gets on her feet.  

           Emily pulls herself up and RUSHES towards the adjoining 
           MASTER BATHROOM, it’s WHITE TILES blinding, TUB overflowing, 
           the ground WET and SLIPPERY. 

           A STRUGGLE ENSUES between MILES AND EMILY AND SUSAN. Emily 
           manages to PUSH Susan into the tub. 

           Emily holds her HEAD firmly under the water. 

           Susan thrashes, scratching at Emily. 

           Emily SLAMS Susan’s head against the tub. Holds it in place. 
           Determined. 

           Miles watches. 

           Susan struggles. 

           Emily pushes harder, further. Susan’s beautiful blonde mane 
           floats like a halo around her head. 

           Susan’s body jerks, shakes. 

           Emily holds firm. 

           SUSAN SHUDDERS ONCE, TWICE, THEN LIES STILL.  

           Silence. 

           Emily lets go of Susan, who’s body slumps LIFELESS into the 
           TUB. 

           SUSAN IS DEAD. 

           A suspended moment. 

           Miles and Emily stare at each other, gauging, assessing. 
           In the distance SIRENS WAIL. 

                                 MILES
                        You killed her. 

           Emily stares at Miles. The NATURAL WORLD DROWNED OUT, 
           replaced by a DULL RINGING. 

           THE RINGING CONTINUES OVER--  

           -- Emily and Miles roll Susan’s body in a THICK, WHITE BATH 
           MAT.

           -- Emily and Miles STRUGGLE under the weight of SUSAN’S BODY 
           as they carry her down the stairs. 

           -- Wilkie watches as they load Susan’s body into the TRUNK of 
           EMILY’s MUSTANG. 

           -- Emily and Miles get in the car. 

           -- A shot of CARTERHOOK MANOR framed against the BLACK NIGHT.  

           INT. EMILY’S MUSTANG - NIGHT

           The dull ringing CONTINUES. Emily drives, CATATONIC. Miles is 
           YELLING AT HER, trying to get her attention. 

           The LIGHTS of an ONCOMING CAR pass, BLINDING HER. She 
           squints, THE OTHER DRIVER STARES BACK AT HER. Emily sees--  

           EMILY’S MOTHER. One eye a grotesque socket, empty, dry, 
           rotting like meat. She drives, her hair WILD around her head. 
           RAIN beating into her car from an open window. LITTLE DROPS 
           dot her face.   

                                 EMIL’S MOTHER
                        I’m proud of you baby. This is who 
                        you really are. 

           Emily can’t take her eyes off of her.  

           Suddenly a CAR speeding towards them. 

                                 MILES
                        Emily! 

           Emily SNAPS OUT OF IT, SLAMS on the breaks. The car SKIDS on 
           the WET PAVEMENT, steers the wheel trying to regain control. 
           EXT. EMILY’S MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

           The car spins 180 degrees and comes to a stop on the SHOULDER 
           of the HIGHWAY. 

           INT. EMILY’S MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

           Emily and Miles look at each other, breath heavy, eyes wide. 

                                 MILES
                        What the fuck are you trying to do? 
                        Get us killed? 

                                 EMILY
                        I need a cup of coffee. 
                             (beat.)
                        And I need to think.  

           EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT

           A single gas pump. A fluorescent sign reads “DINER.” A 
           payphone, receiver off the hook, dangles by its cord. 

           A couple of 18-wheelers parked outside. 

           INT. REST STOP - DINER - NIGHT

           Emily sit at the COUNTER. The air is thick and hot. A film of 
           sweat and dirt covers every surface. 

           Emily drinks COFFEE. Miles eats PIE. 

                                 EMILY
                        We have to go see your Dad in 
                        Charleston. Get ahead of the story. 
                        It’s only a matter of time before 
                        someone realizes Susan is missing. 

                                 MILES
                        Do you think she called the cops? 

                                 EMILY
                        We chatted about her plans for 
                        murder one and then braided each 
                        others hair.  

                                 MILES
                        There’s a dead body in the trunk of 
                        that car. Would be good to know if 
                        we were fugitives.  
                                 EMILY
                        We have time but not a lot. If we 
                        can convince your father that she 
                        disappeared somehow, left you--  

                                 MILES
                        We moved the corpse. Like fucking 
                        amateurs. 

                                 EMILY
                        Look, if her body was still there, 
                        and she did call the cops, we’d be 
                        screwed. We left no evidence and we 
                        have some lead time. A day to get 
                        our heads on straight and our 
                        stories to align. Your Dad is our 
                        ticket out of this mess--  

                                 MILES
                        Fine. So we dupe the nutty 
                        professor. What do you propose we 
                        do with Susan? 

                                 EMILY
                        We dump her. As soon as we get our 
                        story straight. We dump her. 
                        Somewhere random. Somewhere far 
                        away. Somewhere that can’t be 
                        traced to us.  

           Just then TWO COPS enter the DINER. Emily and Miles fall 
           silent. They HEELS of their BOOTS and the CLANKING of their 
           GUNS marking their slow steps.  

           They stop behind Miles and Emily. OFFICER 1 nods at Emily. 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Evening Ma’am. 

                                 EMILY
                        Evening. 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        That your car outside? 

                                 EMILY
                        Which one? 

           The OFFICER looks out the DINER WINDOW. Emily’s MUSTANG is 
           the ONLY CAR.  

                                 OFFICER 1
                        The only one parked in the lot. 
           Emily takes her sweater off, underneath, a revealing tank 
           top. No bra. Miles watches her. So does the Officer.  

                                 EMILY
                        You’re makin’ me sweat.  

           He looks Emily up and down slowly. Elevator eyes. Glances 
           over at Miles. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I never breast fed. Keeps things... 
                        erect. Plus my ex would get 
                        jealous.  

           She winks. The officer shifts uncomfortably. 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        You’re parked illegally. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sorry Officer. We were just 
                        settling up. I’ll move it right 
                        away. You have yourself a great 
                        evening.   

           The Officer nods. Walks off with his PARTNER. Emily signals 
           at the WAITRESS for the check. 

           Miles FIDDLES with a PLASTIC CONTAINER that has some 
           TOOTHPICKS and CHEAP DINER BUSINESS CARDS in it. 

           CLOSE on his twitching hand as he does. Emily watches him. 

           Something in her shifts.  

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

           Emily drives. Rain clatters against the Mustang’s tinny 
           rooftop.

           Miles’ pale face reflects passing headlights like a sickly 
           moon. Raindrops glide from his forehead down his cheeks and 
           off his chin. 

                                 EMILY
                        How did my business card end up in 
                        Rebecca? 

                                 MILES
                        I put it there. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why? 
                                 MILES
                        Part of what Susan said is true: 
                        She does think I’m weird. When we 
                        moved here - after I told her I 
                        didn’t want to; I was very clear 
                        that I didn’t want to — I started 
                        making things happen, in the house. 
                        Just to screw with her. I made up 
                        that website. Me. I made up the 
                        story of the Carterhooks. 

           Emily turns Miles’ story around in her mind, inspecting it.

                                 EMILY
                        So Susan was telling the truth 
                        about all the scary things in the 
                        house? You really did throw your 
                        sitter down the stairs? 

                                 MILES
                        Please. She fell. I’m not violent, 
                        I’m just smart. 

                                 EMILY
                        That day, with the vomit in my 
                        purse and the fit you had upstairs 
                        and the doll hanging from the 
                        light?

                                 MILES
                        The vomit was me because you 
                        weren’t listening to me. You 
                        weren’t leaving. The doll too. Also 
                        the razor-blade tip in the 
                        floorboard that sliced your finger. 
                        That’s actually an idea inspired by 
                        ancient Roman warfare. Have you 
                        ever read—

                                 EMILY
                        No. The screaming you did? You 
                        sounded so furious. 

                                 MILES
                        Oh, that was real. Susan had cut up 
                        my credit card and left it on my 
                        desk. She was trying to wall me in. 
                        But then I realized you were my way 
                        out of that stupid house. Away from 
                        Susan. I set the dominoes up. She 
                        just knocked ‘em down. Though I 
                        didn’t foresee this murder one 
                        scenario. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        I just thought she’d bang you up a 
                        little, try to scare you away. 

           Emily thinks for a while. Miles stares out the window. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        The kid was sharper at fifteen than 
                        I was at twice his age. I was 
                        starting to think this whole going 
                        legit, thinking-of-others, 
                        benevolent thing was fer the berds. 
                        Plus, nothing a con girl could use 
                        more than a great con kid. 

                                 MILES
                        You know America’s first female 
                        serial killer lived in Charleston. 
                        Lavinia Fisher.  

                                 EMILY
                        How do you know shit like that? 

                                 MILES
                        I’m smart. And I’m obsessed with 
                        criminals. That’s why I like you. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m not a criminal. 

                                 MILES
                        Semantics. I go to school with a 
                        bunch of automatons. Everyone wants 
                        to get straight As and join model 
                        UN and get into Harvard. They 
                        worship the system. 

                                 EMILY
                        And you? 

                                 MILES
                        I wanna game the system. I want to 
                        be Frank Abingdale. Bernie Madoff? 
                        That guy was a genius. Lived like a 
                        king for forty years and no one 
                        gives him a lick of credit for it.

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t you want a regular life? 

                                 MILES
                        Do you? 

                                 EMILY
                        I want a privileged life. 
                                 MILES
                        You think you do. Once prettily 
                        installed in the lap of luxury. 
                        You’ll get the itch again. The same 
                        itch I have. You’ll want to fuck 
                        with people. Not cause you’re evil. 
                        You aren’t totally evil. But you’re 
                        smart. You’re smarter than them. 
                        That’s the big secret all these 
                        rich fucks are hiding behind their 
                        black cards and their Benzes. 
                        They’re all basic shit for brains. 

                                 EMILY
                        You can reject it because you’ve 
                        had it. You’re a part of it. You’ve 
                        been on the inside.   

                                 MILES
                        What’s your point? 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m not gonna know what I think 
                        till I’ve walked a mile in those 
                        white high heeled shoes. Till that 
                        library is mine. Till I’m amongst 
                        the smart people. Till I’m on the 
                        inside too.  

           Miles leans back. Takes her in. 

                                 MILES
                        I guess the only bit of unfinished 
                        business is what are we going to 
                        tell my Dad? 

           EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

           Emily and Miles stand outside, near the Mustang, watching. 

           Inside-- 

           A SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS TEEN, drinks coffee sullenly. 

           A TRUCKER, 40s, with a GAUDY BELT BUCKLE scratches at a LOTTO 
           ticket. He’s got a rough look. 

           A MOUSY WOMAN, 50s wearing a WOODEN CROSS. 

           Emily’s gaze settles on this last woman. Bingo.
                                 EMILY
                        When people lie, some tic gives 
                        them away. They blink, or break 
                        their gaze, or touch their nose 
                        with their fingers. Polygraph 
                        machines operate on the principle 
                        that the physical signs of lying 
                        exist inside the body - breaths 
                        quicken, heart rates jump.  

                                 MILES
                        So how do you game the system? 

                                 EMILY
                        Passionate conviction. You have to 
                        believe what you’re saying without 
                        reservation. A good lie always 
                        starts with a germ of a truth and 
                        builds from there.  

           INT. BUS DEPOT - LATER

           Emily chats amicably with the MOUSY WOMAN. A PALE MILES lies 
           on some hard plastic chairs next to her. 

           Every minutes he SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY. 

                                 EMILY
                        Spent my last dollars traveling 
                        down here from Maine. That’s where 
                        we’re from. Came to see about a 
                        fancy doctor who claimed he could 
                        help my baby.   

                                 MOUSY WOMAN 
                        What’s wrong with the poor dear? 

           Emily reaches for Miles’ her hand. 

                                 EMILY
                        Few years back he was diagnosed 
                        with S. Burke disease. It’s a real 
                        rare blood disorder. He gets plasma 
                        replacement ever three weeks. It’s 
                        so tough on the poor kid. There’s 
                        no cure. But we don’t have 
                        insurance so the fancy doctor 
                        couldn’t find it in his heart to 
                        help. He turned us away. People 
                        like that don’t care about 
                        hillbillies like us. 

           Emily looks at Miles hopefully. 
                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I just have to trust that the Lord 
                        has a plan for us.  

                                 MOUSY WOMAN
                        He does, my dear. 

                                 EMILY
                        People say that. But it’s hard not 
                        to give up hope when you’re 
                        invisible. 

           Miles’ head lolls back. He STARES out the WINDOW at the 
           MUSTANG. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        D’you mind watching my baby for a 
                        minute while I run to the rest 
                        room? Sometimes there’s loose 
                        change in the tampon dispenser. 
                             (beat)
                        Every bit counts. 

           Miles smiles weakly at the Mousy Woman. 

           INT. BUS DEPOT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A dingy, dirty bathroom. One stall. No toilet paper. An OLD 
           TAMPON DISPENSER in the corner. The mirror, dusty, warbled 
           and cracked. 

           Emily catches sight of herself, pushes a few rogue strands of 
           HAIR out of her face.   

           She inspects the TAMPON DISPENSER, slams her hand against it, 
           with force. Two TAMPONS fall out.  

           She slips them in the BACK POCKET of her jeans. Enters the 
           stall, closes the door. 

           INT. BUS DEPOT - MINUTES LATER

           Emily exits the bathroom and Miles is CONVULSING on the 
           ground. His EYES rolling back in his head. 

           The MOUSY WOMAN is panicking, screaming.  

           Emily rushes to Miles, gets on her knees next to him. She 
           quickly pushes her FINGER into his mouth, CLEARING it of 
           SALIVA, she then rolls him onto his SIDE.   
           She reaches into her BACK POCKET, finding an EPI PEN, 
           slamming it into his THIGH. 

           A tense moment. 

           The convulsing stops. Miles breath normalizes. His eyes are 
           still closed.

           INT. BUS DEPOT - LATER

           The MOUSY WOMAN sticks a WAD of CASH in Emily’s hand, makes 
           the sign of the cross over her chest.  

           INT. EMILY’S MUSTANG - LATER

           Emily drives. Miles, pale and weak, finally opens his eyes. 

           He gives Emily a sidelong glance and then grins. 

                                 MILES
                        S. Burke disease. What’d you use 
                        for the “medicine.” 

                                 EMILY
                        Tampon. Slides into itself. Looks 
                        like an epi pen, if you hold it 
                        right.  

           INT. ROADSIDE - GENERAL STORE - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a little bell over the door, ringing cheerfully as 
           it opens... 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I had convinced so many people of 
                        so many things over the course of 
                        my life, but this would be my 
                        greatest feat. 

           Emily and Miles troll the aisles. A team. Grabbing-- 

           A SHOVEL 

           A BASEBALL CAP 

           A TENNIS BALL 

           PLASTIC SHEETS 

           DUCT TAPE 
           INT. ROADSIDE - GENERAL STORE - LATER

           Emily sidles up to the counter. A HOT TEENAGER chews gum 
           absently. He checks Emily out. Miles scowls at him.  

           He rings them up. Emily pulls out a twenty. Points to a PACK 
           OF CIGARETTES over the counter. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Not hiding Susan’s death, far 
                        stupider people have gotten away 
                        with murder, but rather convincing 
                        myself what I was doing was 
                        reasonable. Not decent, but 
                        reasonable.

           The HOT TEENAGER grabs the CIGARETTES. AS he does, she 
           replaces the TWENTY with a TEN. 

           He gives her CHANGE for a TWENTY. 

           Emily and Miles out the door before he realizes his mistake. 

           INT. EMPTY FIELD - NIGHT

           CLOSE on Miles’ face. His dark beady eyes shift back and 
           forth nervously. 

                                 MILES
                        Do it. 

                                 EMILY
                        You sure? 

           She BOUNCES a TENNIS BALL on the ground. HARD. 

           Miles nods. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        She ever actually raise a hand to 
                        you? 

                                 MILES
                        Every great lie begins with a germ 
                        of truth. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING 

           The sun rises. A hopeful new day. 
           Sort of. 

           Emily’s Mustang speeds down a DESERTED stretch of HIGHWAY. A 
           sign reads CHARLESTON, 50 MILES. 

           EXT. WENTWORTH MANSION - CHARLESTON - DAY

           Establishing. A stately, historic Charleston mansion, 
           converted into a Five Star hotel.  

           Emily and Miles pull up outside, park the car. Gets out. 

           Miles wears a BASEBALL CAP. 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - RESTAURANT - DAY

           Michael sits across from Emily and Miles. Miles looks down at 
           his hands, his face hidden by a BASEBALL CAP.  

           Michael’s face etched with concern. 

                                 EMILY
                        After our drink at the Four 
                        Seasons, I couldn’t get you out of 
                        my head. I looked through the 
                        University’s faculty directory to 
                        find out where you lived. 

           Emily looks down. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m so ashamed.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s alright. 

                                 EMILY
                        I was only planning on texting you 
                        if I saw your car outside the 
                        house. Telling you to meet me. I 
                        didn’t want to cause a scene. But 
                        there Miles was. Sitting on the 
                        curb. Sad. Alone. Abandoned. I know 
                        what that feels like.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I still don’t understand how you 
                        ended up here. Together. 

           Emily touches Miles’ arm. 
                                 EMILY
                        Show him. 

           Miles shakes his head. Emily LEANS IN, whispers something in 
           his ear. 

           Miles takes off his BASEBALL CAP, looks up, REVEALING a BLACK 
           EYE. 

           Michael GASPS at the sight of his son. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What the hell happened to you? 

                                 MILES
                        Susan and I got in a fight and she 
                        hit me. She took off in her car and 
                        locked me out of the house. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What did you fight about? 

                                 MILES
                        She told me she wouldn’t bring me 
                        here. I couldn’t come to see you 
                        accept your award. I told her you 
                        were my hero. She said she didn’t 
                        care. She said once Poppy came 
                        along your new family would be 
                        cemented and I would be on my own. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You must have pushed her. Triggered 
                        her somehow. You’re not innocent in 
                        all of this. You’ve been torturing 
                        her for months. Tell me what you 
                        did. 

                                 MILES
                        What I did? What about what you 
                        did? You left me in that house with 
                        that woman! Every day she reminds 
                        me that I’m a worthless little 
                        shit. The fly in her lemonade. So 
                        maybe I fuck with her a little. 
                        Scare her into thinking our house 
                        is haunted. But she’s the parent. 
                        I’m the child. She’s supposed to 
                        stick around and so are you. When 
                        are you going to remember that? 

           Miles’ lower lip quivers, eyes flashing, genuinely hurt. 
           Michael looks around the restaurant embarrassed.     
           Emily puts her hand over his. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why don’t we all calm down? Take a 
                        deep breath.  

           Michael rises abruptly. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need to get in touch with Susan. 

           Emily and Miles exchange a look. 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

           Michael DIALS Susan repeatedly. No answer. 

           EXT. WENTWORTH MANSION - PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Emily’s Mustang parked outside. Susan’s body in the trunk. 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Michael returns to where Emily and Miles sit. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s not picking up. She was 
                        supposed to be here hours ago. 

                                 MILES
                        She’s not coming. She told me if I 
                        was here she wouldn’t be. She’s 
                        gone, Dad. But I’m still here.    

           Miles’ voice cracks he begins to cry. Michael looks around 
           helpless. 

           Emily envelops Miles in an embrace. Caring. Mothering.  

                                 EMILY
                        It’s been a long day. We drove all 
                        night so Miles could come see you. 
                        I’m going to take him upstairs so 
                        he can lie down and then you and I 
                        can have a Manhattan at the bar. 
                        Talk about this like grown adults. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know--

           Emily gives him a look. 
                                 EMILY
                        Miles needs us right now. Let’s try  
                        and support him. 

           Miles looks up at Michael with watery eyes. 

           Michael nods. Emily escorts Miles out. 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Emily walk through the lobby. 

                                 MILES
                        Manhattans? Do you think we’re in a 
                        Woody Allen movie? I thought we had 
                        a deal. We get to Charleston, we 
                        convince Michael that Susan is a 
                        child beater on the lam, and then 
                        we bury the body. It’s only a 
                        matter of time before the old bag 
                        starts to reek like your mother’s 
                        eye socket. 

                                 EMILY
                        I told you about that in 
                        confidence. 

                                 MILES
                        There’s a dead woman in your trunk. 
                        It’s all fair game hooker. 

                                 EMILY
                        Look, you got what you wanted. Your 
                        stepmonster is in the early stages 
                        of rigor mortis. You went on the 
                        lam and lived out your little con-
                        man fantasy. Now it’s my turn. I’ve 
                        been waiting for an opportunity 
                        like this my entire life. We’ll 
                        bury her tonight, after the 
                        ceremony.    

                                 MILES
                        But-- 

                                 EMILY
                        Lavinia’s childhood home is two 
                        blocks away. I booked you a private 
                        tour. 

           Emily holds up a ticket. Miles eyes it.
                                 MILES
                        When the hell did you manage that? 

           Emily holds the tickets out to him. Miles take them 
           reluctantly. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Tonight. 

                                 EMILY
                        Tonight. 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - BAR - LATER

           Emily and Michael drink Manhattans.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve never seen Miles this... 
                        fragile. 

                                 EMILY
                        We all have our breaking points. 
                        Even you, Michael. Are you happy? 
                        Is Susan right for you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not a bad guy. Sometimes I do 
                        bad things, but Susan... is 
                        pregnant with my child... We’re 
                        family. I could never abandon her.  

                                 EMILY
                        Seems to me that she’s abandoned 
                        you. On the most important day of 
                        your career, no less.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’ll be back. Susan is a master 
                        manipulator. A cancer, an incurable 
                        disease. You can’t get rid of her, 
                        you can only manage the symptoms. 

           Michael laughs, uneasy. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        The only way she’ll give me any 
                        peace is when she’s dead. 

           Emily smiles to herself. Dead you say? 
           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Emily’s MUSTANG still parked outside. 

           Dead you say? 

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Emily stands in front of room 217. Knocks. 

                                 EMILY
                        Hello, you. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: Michael. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Emily. I wasn’t expecting you. 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s Tuesday. Four P.M. Are you 
                        alone?  

           He nods. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Journeys end in lovers meeting. 

           Michael opens the door wider, letting her in. 

           INT. MICHAEL’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Emily looks around the room, her back to Michael. He stands a 
           few feet behind her. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you think of the room? 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s nice. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I get you anything? 

           Emily faces him. 

                                 EMILY
                        Undress. I want you naked.  

           Michael hesitates. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Do it. 
           Michael obliges. He takes off his t-shirt. Unbuckles his 
           pants. Drops his boxers to the ground. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Lie on the bed. 

           Michael does. 

           Emily crosses the room, stands next to the bed. She looks 
           down at him. She has all the power. She takes his dick in her 
           hands, begins playing with him. He moans. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve always been intrigued by the 
                        narrator in Rebecca. She has no 
                        name. She’s cast adrift in the 
                        world. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s in order to convey the 
                        overpowering essence of Rebecca, 
                        Maxim’s dead wife.   

           His eyes are closed. He’s enjoying himself. 

                                 EMILY
                        I disagree. I think it’s so she can 
                        be whomever she likes. Whomever she 
                        chooses. She is mistress of her 
                        destiny.   

           Emily leans in. Kisses Michael deeply. Her mouth on his 
           mouth. The softness of her lips. The warmth of her breath. 

           And then Emily bites his lip - HARD - drawing blood. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ow! Fuck! 

           Michael puts his hand to his mouth. Emily pulls away. She has 
           his blood on her lips. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You fucking bit me. 

                                 EMILY
                        Did I hurt you? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes. 

                                 EMILY
                        Good. 
           She kneels by the bed, puts Michael’s dick in her mouth. 

           CLOSE on Emily’s BACK. Hair loose and swaying around her 
           shoulders.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER 

           Michael and Emily lie in bed. Michael is nervous. Emily is 
           blissed out.  

                                 EMILY
                        What time is the ceremony tonight? 

           Michael sits up. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Emily you can’t come with me this 
                        evening. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why not? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        It wouldn’t be appropriate. These 
                        are my work colleagues.  

                                 EMILY
                        Are you ashamed of me? Were you 
                        just using me because I’m 
                        ambidextrous? Because you don’t 
                        want people to know you pay for 
                        this?   

                                 MICHAEL
                        No. Not at all--

                                 EMILY
                        I took care of your son! You said 
                        you wanted to know me. You wanted 
                        to spend your life with me. Didn’t 
                        you mean it? 

           Her voice rises to a high pitch. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Of course not. Of course I meant 
                        it. 

                                 EMILY
                        Then what’s the problem? 
                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll see you in the ballroom at 
                        eight. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           QUICK CUTS: A woman’s HAND running a BATH, skimming through 
           the water; LACE PANTIES dropping to the ground; HAIR 
           unclipped from a bun; a row of LOTIONS; a squirt of LOTION 
           into a PALM; a THIGH being LOTIONED, a STOCKING slipped over 
           an ANKLE; a BRACELET clasped on a WRIST; a DRESS zipping up; 
           a TEN stuffed into a CLUTCH

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The DOORS open. REVEAL Emily - a vision dressed all in BLACK. 
           She embodies the women she first ogled at the FOUR SEASONS 
           with Michael. 

           A woman you want to inhale.     

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Emily walks through the expansive lobby. 

           She is ripe for the picking. 

           Heads turn as she passes.   

           INT. WENTWORTH MANSION - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Emily enters the BALLROOM. Tastefully decorated. Candlelit. 
           White and green flower arrangements dot every table. The din 
           of a well-heeled crowd. 

           Emily swipes a GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE from a TRAY. 

           Emily GLIDES through the crowd, looking for Michael. She 
           finally spots him and Miles, makes her way towards them.  

           And then--

           As the CROWD parts, her eyes focus more intently on Michael, 
           sharp in his suit, glass of wine in hand, commanding the 
           room. 

           Emily is mere feet away, and then she sees-- 

           SUSAN. 
           Flawless. Not a hair out of place. Dressed head to toe in 
           white, the color of control. 

           Make up covers the SCRATCH along her face from the 
           prosthetic. Susan smiles, raises a well-manicured hand, and 
           gives a small, elegant wave. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Emily. So lovely to see you. 

           Emily is frozen in place. Unable to move. Michael blanches. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        This is Emily, the babysitter I was 
                        telling you about. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello. 

           Emily swallows hard. Finds her voice. 

                                 EMILY
                        Hi. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you for bringing Miles all 
                        the way here. I was panicked when I 
                        got stuck at work and then to hear 
                        that Miles was beat up at school. 

           She shakes her head. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Rest assured I will be having a 
                        stern talk with the headmistress as 
                        soon as we’re back in Connecticut.  

           Susan puts her hand on Miles shoulder. The simple act, in 
           itself, menacing. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Right Milesy? 

           Miles nods, meekly. 

                                 MILES
                        I have to use the bathroom. 

           He slinks away from Susan’s grasp. 

           Susan turns to Michael, even and fresh. Like an ice cold beer 
           on a hot day. 
                                 SUSAN
                        Emily has been invaluable these 
                        last few weeks. I’ve been so ill 
                        from the pregnancy and she’s 
                        been... a godsend really. Helping 
                        around the house, looking after 
                        Miles. She’s really quite 
                        intuitive. It’s like she knows what 
                        I want her to do before I even ask. 
                        She’s saving up to move to the big 
                        city. Emily wants to be a writer. 
                        Isn’t that right?  

           Emily nods slowly. She doesn’t remember telling Susan she 
           wanted to be a writer. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s right. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Break a leg. Would you consider 
                        yourself more of a Sylvia Plath? Or 
                        Virginia Woolf?  

                                 EMILY
                        They were both manic depressives 
                        who killed themselves. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Indeed. 

           A NERVOUS ASSISTANT wearing a HEADSET approaches. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Professor Audley? We’re ready for 
                        you now. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Excuse me. 

           Susan grabs his arm tightly. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Rub Poppy for luck. 

           Susan grabs his hand, places it on her belly. 

           Michael hurries off, leaving the two women alone. Susan 
           watches Miles go. She turns to Emily.  

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I was captain of the Yale swim team 
                        four years running. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I can hold my breath for up to 
                        eight minutes. I was never dead. 

           Susan holds Emily’s gaze for a moment and then smiles a tiny, 
           infuriating smile. 

           She turns and walks away. Her white heels CLACK CLACK CLACK 
           on the polished wood floor. 

           EXT. WENTWORTH MANSION - NIGHT

           Emily shivers in the cold air. 

           Standing in the spot where her Mustang used to be. 

           Alone. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY 

           Emily stands alone along a DUSTY STRETCH OF HIGHWAY. She 
           wears LARGE DARK SUNGLASSES, head wrapped in a SCARF, arms 
           folded across her chest, face devoid of expression. DALE 
           pulls up in his souped up 1988 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX. Emily gets 
           in the car. 

                                 DALE
                        What happened to the ‘stang? 

                                 EMILY
                        It died, just as you predicted. 

                                 DALE
                        Should we tow the old beast? I can 
                        call up my pal Eugene, he’s got a 
                        shop up the road. 

                                 EMILY
                        Let’s just consider it collateral 
                        damage. 

                                 DALE
                        How’d you end up all the way down 
                        in the Carolinas anyway? 

                                 EMILY
                        Long story, Dale.  

                                 DALE
                        You know I love your stories. 

           They peel away, the tail end of Emily’s scarf fluttering out 
           the window, in the breeze. 
           EXT. STAMFORD, CT - A FEW DAYS LATER 

           Establishing. It’s a sad, grey day in Stamford. 

           EXT. TROPICANA GARDENS - CONTINUOUS

           Same old boxy beige shithole. The potted plants are still 
           very much dead. 

           Emily UNLOCKS an OLD BIKE from the chain-link fence. She 
           halfheartedly gets on it, starts pedaling. 

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - DAY

           Emily rides her bike past the house. 

           The PLUMP OLD WOMAN with ROSY CHEEKS watches her. 

           INT. EMILY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Emily lies in bed. Her GOLDFISH floats in its BOWL, DEAD. 

           She stares at the WATER STAIN on the ceiling. It grows larger 
           and larger until it seems to morph into a GIANT MIDDLE 
           FINGER. She blinks. It’s still a MIDDLE FINGER.  

           INT. SPIRITUAL PALMS - FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Emily enters, putting LOTION on her hands, ready for a day of 
           work. Viveca looks up, blanches at the sight of her. 

                                 VIVECA
                        What the fuck are you doing here? 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s Monday. I’m on the schedule. 

           Viveca shakes her head vigorously. Her beads clink against 
           one another angrily. 

                                 VIVECA
                        No no no no no no. You don’t work 
                        here anymore. 

                                 EMILY
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about? 

           Viveca rushes to the WINDOW and looks outside visibly shaken. 
           She pulls the DRAPES closed, her hands trembling.    
                                 VIVECA
                        That ‘whale on the line,’ you were 
                        so damn proud of came to see me. 
                        She works at the health department. 
                        Told me you confessed everything 
                        about the racket I’ve been running 
                        in the back. She came in here with 
                        a blacklight and it was like Room 
                        Raiders. They’re shuttin’ me down, 
                        nerdy. I knew you were uppity but I 
                        never pegged you for a rat. 

                                 EMILY
                        Viveca, Susan is lying to you. 
                        She’s not a health inspector. She’s 
                        a con.  

                                 VIVECA
                        Out. Out damn spot. Get out.  

           Emily exits. No more yob.  

           INT. TROPICANA GARDENS - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Exhausted, Emily trudges down the hallway. She arrives at her 
           door. An EVICTION notice hangs on it. 

           The door is BOLTED SHUT. 

           INT. TROPICANA GARDENS - HALLWAY - LATER

           Emily BANGS on a door labeled SUPER. No answer. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STAMFORD - DAY 

           The sidewalk bustles; men in suits, women in nude stockings 
           and tennis shoes, sullen smoking teens, homeless 
           schizophrenics. 

           Emily weaves through the tableau, watching passersby, always 
           searching for opportunity. 

           She stops in front of her usual coffee shop-- 

           EXT. HIP COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           She approaches the TELEPHONE POLE where YIPPY DOGS are tied 
           up. 
           Notices a POSTER. On it her FACE STARES BACK AT HER. EMILY’S 
           MUG SHOT. Underneath the text: WARNING: WATCH OUT FOR THIS 
           CUNT BITCH. 

           Emily TEARS DOWN THE POSTER. A few feet ahead another one. 
           And then another and then another. 

           They are all over Downtown Stamford. 

           EXT. HALCOMBE MOTEL - NIGHT  

           Establishing. A basic one story L-shape with a pool. The kind 
           where guests park three feet away from their room. A neon 
           “Vacancy” sign buzzes on and off by the curb. It’s completely 
           quiet at this hour. No lights in the windows save for the 
           manager’s office. 

           A single streetlight flickers overhead. 

           INT. HALCOMBE MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Emily enters. A queen bed, polyblend coverlet, dingy PLASTIC 
           SHOWER CURTAIN. 

           She eyes the shower curtain wearily. Lies on top of the 
           covers. She stares at the ceiling. 

           Her cell phone buzzes with a CALL. She sees the 212 AREA 
           CODE. Her eyes light up. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Is this Mary Seyton? 

                                 EMILY
                        It is. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        This is Ambrose Rowe from Walpole 
                        Publishing. 

                                 EMILY
                        Ambrose, what a pleasure to hear 
                        from you. I assume you’re calling 
                        about my manuscript, Hand of 
                        Darkness? Walpole is my ideal 
                        publisher-- 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Do you take me for a fool? 

                                 EMILY
                        What? 
                                 AMBROSE
                        Your manuscript is a lightly 
                        doctored version of Rebecca.  

                                 EMILY
                        Excuse me? 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Your novel is plagiarized. 

                                 EMILY
                        No it isn’t. That’s an original 
                        manuscript. I’ve been working on it 
                        for years! How dare you accuse me-- 

           We hear RUSTLING on AMBROSE’S SIDE of the CALL. 

                                 AMBROSE
                        “Men are simpler than you imagine. 
                        But what goes on in the twisted, 
                        tortuous minds of women would 
                        baffle anyone.”

                                 EMILY
                        I didn’t write that! 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Correct. Daphne DuMaurier wrote it, 
                        quite famously may I add. 

                                 EMILY
                        No. Susan Burke switched the 
                        manuscript. She intercepted my 
                        draft and put Rebecca in its stead. 
                        She must know someone at Walpole. 
                        Someone very senior. I can get you 
                        my real manuscript. The one I 
                        submitted. Tonight. I’ll get in my 
                        car. Well I don’t have a car but I 
                        will get to New York-- 

                                 AMBROSE
                        Don’t bother.   

           The line goes DEAD. 

           A KNOCK at the DOOR. 

           Emily crosses the room. Unlocks the door. 
           EXT. HALCOMBE MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           No one is outside. Instead, a small WHITE BOX on the 
           DOORSTEP. 

           Emily picks it up tentatively. Opens it. Inside a USB KEY. 

           INT. HALCOMBE MOTEL - EMILY’S ROOM - LATER

           Emily sits on the bed, inserts the USB into the DRIVE of her 
           computer. 

           CLOSE on EMILY’S COMPUTER SCREEN. 

           SECURITY FOOTAGE of EMILY and MILES in CARTERHOOK MANOR-- 

           DROWNING SUSAN IN THE BATHTUB 

           ROLLING HER UP IN A RUG 

           HAULING SUSAN DOWN THE STAIRS 

           COMMITTING A MURDER 

           Emily slams her computer shut. 

           Her eyes land on a COCKROACH crawling out of the CORNER of 
           the room, from under the RUG. 

           Emily walks over to the ROACH, pulls BACK the rug. 

           AN INFESTATION. Rotting from the inside out. 

           Emily gags. Begins STAMPING the ROACHES, desperate. 
           Frustrated. Alone.  

           INT. HALCOMBE MOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Emily gets out of the shower. The bathroom filled with STEAM. 
           She grabs a cheap, thin towel, off the HOOK. Wraps it around 
           her body.  

           She clears the mirror with her hand. 

           Her eyes dark and tired, sunken. Her cheekbones sharp. Her 
           skin sallow. 

           Emily shivers, despite the warmth of the bathroom.    

           Her eyes land on the TOM FORD LIPSTICK sitting on the edge of 
           the sink. 
           She picks it up. Considers it. Turns it around. Reads the 
           label. PRIVILEGE. 

           PRIVILEGE. 

           PRIVILEGE. 

           Emily puts the lipstick on. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        No one fucks with Emily Kent. 
                             (beat.)
                        Or Elizabeth Braddon. 
                             (beat.)
                        Or Mary Seyton. 

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MORNING

           A single dark cloud, the color of a bruise hovers above 
           Carterhook Manor.  

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - CONTINUOUS

           From outside the WINDOW, we watch as Miles, Michael and Susan 
           go through the motions of their morning routine. 

           A picture perfect family. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BATHROOM - LATER

           Michael stands under the hot shower. Eyes closed. 

           Thinks of Emily. 

           Masturbates. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MILES’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miles wearing his school uniform, stands in his closet. Eyes 
           wide open.  

           Thinks of Emily. 

           Masturbates. 
           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - FOYER - LATER

           Miles grabs his backpack. Michael grabs his briefcase. Susan 
           stands at the base of the stairs in her WHITE ROBE, a small 
           BABY BUMP protruding underneath. 

                                 MILES
                        I’ll wait in the car. 

           Michael turns to Susan. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Remember I have that speaking 
                        engagement at the Rockrimm Club 
                        tonight. I’ll pick Miles up on my 
                        way home. 

           He kisses her, turns towards the door. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh sweetheart? 

           Michael turns back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes dear? 

                                 SUSAN
                        You know how we divide up the 
                        chores? You do the dishes. I take 
                        out the trash. You handle the dry 
                        cleaning. I tend to the rose 
                        bushes? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Of course. It’s all right there on 
                        the chore wheel. 

                                 SUSAN
                        We both know she wasn't the 
                        babysitter. I took out the trash. 
                        If you ever humiliate me like that 
                        again, I’ll kill you and make it 
                        look like an accident. 
                             (beat)
                        Have a wonderful day. 

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - DAY

           Michael’s car pulls out of the driveway. 
           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Susan enters the bedroom. Hears the WATER running in the 
           bathroom. 

           She enters-- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Water overflows from the tub. It drips over the edge. 

           Disturbed, Susan crosses the room to turn off the faucet. 

           FLOATING INSIDE THE TUB, WILKIE, DEAD. 

           Susan stares at the cat. 

           INT. SUSAN’S WHITE MERCEDES - LATER 

           Classical music plays. Susan drives. 

           She stops at a RED LIGHT. Fishes through her PURSE for her 
           LIPSTICK.  

           She finds it, looks up, pulls down her mirror. 

           Next to her, in the WINDOW, A ONE EYED BEGGAR WOMAN dressed 
           in rags. Her other eye, a grotesque socket, empty, dry, 
           rotting like meat. 

           Susan SCREAMS. PRESSES on the gas. 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a SPIDER. It’s black round body, beady eyes, spindly 
           hairy legs. It cleans itself.  

           A long SHADOW passes OVER THE SPIDER. 

           Clack. Clack. Clack. The sound of SUSAN’S WHITE HEELS 
           striding down the hallway. 

           Her FOOTSTEPS approach. The spider scuttles along the wooden 
           floorboards, moving as quickly as it can to evade--  

           The WHITE SHOE. Too late. The spider is crushed underfoot. 

           Dead spider.

           REVEAL; SUSAN, BABY BUMP protruding, striding down the 
           HALLWAY. 
           She makes her way towards her bedroom. 

           Stops short. Up ahead the hallway is covered with VOYEURISTIC  
           SECURITY STILLS of her. 

           Susan making dinner. 

           Susan on the toilet. 

           Susan polishing her gun.

           Sitting on the bed is Emily. Dressed all in white. Her hair 
           newly shorn into a BLONDE BOB. 

           She is the spitting image of Susan. 

           Privilege.  

                                 EMILY
                        Hello Susan. 

                                 SUSAN 
                        What the fuck are you doing here? 

                                 EMILY
                        You invited me. I’m here to 
                        exercise your demons.  

           Emily smiles. Stands. Walks towards Susan.  

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Powerful people like you, rich, 
                        educated, erudite... ish you were 
                        born lucky. Your circumstances gave 
                        you certain advantages. You’re in 
                        on all the jokes. You know where 
                        the forks go. Brecht references 
                        roll of your tongue. You know that 
                        Gstaad is pronounced “shtaad.” No 
                        hard G. But me? I had to teach 
                        myself all of those things. There 
                        is a single piece of paper that 
                        differentiates us. Yours is a Yale 
                        diploma. Mine is a rap sheet. Two 
                        pieces of paper, two fates.  
                                 SUSAN
                        Get out of my house before I call 
                        the cops. 

                                 EMILY
                        The cops aren’t coming. I cut your 
                        phone line. I also disabled the 
                        security cameras. Fool me once 
                        shame on you. Fool me twice, shame 
                        on me.  

           Susan laughs. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re pathetic. Look at you. A sad 
                        clone. A cheap imitation. I pity 
                        you. You can pretend to be someone 
                        with breeding and potential, but 
                        your stench will always stick to 
                        you. No matter how many books you 
                        read. You’re still nobody. No 
                        matter how high your thread count. 
                        Nobody. No matter what side of the 
                        bridge you reside. Nobody. 

                                 EMILY
                        That might be true, Susan. But 
                        there’s a difference between you 
                        and I. You’ve lived a life of 
                        luxury. Unimaginable comfort. Your 
                        limousine liberal problems are a 
                        bad dye job and lapsed country club 
                        membership. Eventually, that makes 
                        you soft. Weak. You overlook 
                        details. You get sloppy. But, me? I 
                        know plenty about “just in case.” 
                        Contingency plans. What to do when 
                        things don’t work out. Cause guess 
                        what? Things never work out for 
                        people like me. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m a cockroach. I will survive 
                        nuclear holocaust. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Yet, I still have all the power. I 
                        took away your job. Your apartment. 
                        Your prospects. And still, you want 
                        to go to war with me? Haven’t you 
                        read any Machiavelli?   

           Emily smiles. 
                                 EMILY
                        I have. And you committed the 
                        cardinal sin of warfare. You let 
                        the enemy in your house. 

           FLASHBACK TO EMILY IN CARTERHOOK MANOR -- 

           As she “cleanses” she also snoops.

           -- An airplane-sized bottle of vodka tucked between the 
           cushions of the couch.  

           -- Soft gourmet cheeses in the fridge. Wrapped in pretty 
           cellophane, newly purchased from the market.  

           -- A container of take out sushi in the trash. 

           -- A SPOT of BLOOD next to the toilet. Emily wipes it away. 

           -- Prescriptions stuffed in the night stand - Xanax, Lortab 
           etc. Emily looks at the PRESCRIPTION DATES. Hoards a few 
           pills.

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back to present. Emily and Susan face each other. 

                                 EMILY
                        Booze on your breath. Raw fish in 
                        your belly. Blood on your tampons 
                        and a one way ticket to Xanitown. A 
                        woman like you would never take 
                        those kinds of risks with a 
                        geriatric pregnancy. Unless-- 

           Emily PUNCHES Susan in the stomach. HER BELLY INDENTS. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not pregnant, cunt. 

           Susan LUNGES for Emily’s throat, wraps her hands around it 
           tightly. 

           Emily gasps for air. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Michael is on his way to your 
                        fertility doctor’s office right 
                        now. To hear the news - that this 
                        was all a ruse. A desperate attempt 
                        at keeping your marriage together. 
                        Of holding on to your perfect life. 
           Emily escapes Susan’s grasp and rushes into the hallway.  

           The woman WRESTLE - matching one another BLOW FOR BLOW near 
           the stairs, above the IMPRESSIVE ROTUNDA. 

           The chandelier swings above them. 

           The fight is FIERCE, VIOLENT. Each WOMAN DESPERATE TO KILL 
           THE OTHER. 

           Emily finally takes the UPPER HAND. 

           Emily PUSHES Susan against the RAILING on the stairs. The 
           WOOD cracks. Susan CLAWS at Emily’s face.  

           Emily pushes SUSAN HARD, over the railing. Susan begins to 
           FALL. She GRABS onto the LEDGE, her feet dangling below. 

           Susan tries to pull herself up, struggles mightily. Emily 
           watches her. 

                                 SUSAN
                        What do you want? Money? Power? 
                        Your book published? Name your 
                        price. 

                                 EMILY
                        Too late Susan. 

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s never too late. There’s always 
                        a way. I told you, I define and 
                        eliminate problems. Let me help 
                        you.   

           EMILY STEPS ON SUSAN’S FINGERS with her HEEL. Susan CRIES OUT 
           in PAIN. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I can undo what I’ve done.

                                 EMILY
                        If I’m not mistaken Yale’s motto is 
                        lux et veritas. Light and truth. 
                        Isn’t it? 

           Susan nods, weakly, losing her grip. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes. 

                                 EMILY
                        Light and truth. I’ve always known 
                        the truth - that I’m smart.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        But I always thought if I ever got 
                        around really smart people — people 
                        who went to universities and drank 
                        wine and spoke Latin — that they’d 
                        be bored as hell by me. It’s a 
                        lonely way to go through life. 

           Emily shakes her head, thinking of her existence up until 
           now. Up until Carterhook manor. Up until Susan. Miles. 
           Michael. Those books. That house. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        But Susan, what you’ve done, is 
                        enlighten me. Turns out I was 
                        wrong. There is no difference 
                        between you and I. If I rip up that 
                        rap sheet, well, we’re exactly the 
                        same. Aren’t we?  

           Emily steps on SUSAN’S FINGERS one last time. HARD. Like she 
           means it.  

           CLOSE on Susan’s grip, loosening, one perfectly manicured 
           finger at a time. Her diamonds sparkle in the light of the 
           chandelier. 

           And then-- 

           Susan falls. THREE STORIES DOWN to the ROTUNDA below. 

           Emily watches her. 

           Susan’s body slams against the ground. 

           Bounces. Once. Twice. 

           Finally rests. Immobile. 

           Emily looks down at her for one long moment. 

           And then like LIGHTENING she grabs a LOOSE WOODEN RAILING in 
           her hand. RUSHES down the three flights of stairs. 

           Emily stands over Susan’s body. The one with the power.  

           She raises the railing over her head. Brings it down HARD 
           over Susan’s skull. 

           This time that bitch better be dead. 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
           An infinite expanse of BLUE SKY high above a sheet of rumpled 
           CLOUDS. The blazing sphere of the AFTERNOON SUN gives the 
           world a bright and shiny hue.

           WE BURST THROUGH CLOUDS-- 

           EXT. WOODLAND CEMETERY - DAY 

           A WHITE CASKET poised above an OPEN GRAVE. 

           Hills, trees, blue sky, green grass. A nice place to be 
           buried.  

           A respectable turnout. Michael, somber, accompanied by Emily 
           and Miles, sits in the front row. 

           Emily wears LARGE BLACK SUNGLASSES, An EXPENSIVE SILK DRESS 
           compliments her figure, a lily among the reeds.     

           A REVEREND, 70s, intones the traditional platitudes. The 
           sound of his voice rises and falls.

                        ...Susan Burke was above all else,

                        that woman loved her Lortab.  

                                 LADY 1
                        And her vodka.

           Towards the back of the crowd, the chatter continues.

           The crowd has dispersed. Michael stands alone above the open 
           void, holding a PERFECT WHITE ROSE in his hand. He drops the 
           flower on top of the coffin.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re in a better place now.

           sits next to her, facing forward as well. (As they talk, 
           neither looks at the other). 

                                 EMILY
                        That was a nice funeral. 

                                 MILES
                        Very tasteful.  

                                 EMILY
                        Mmmhmmm. Miles, have I ever told 
                        you about my oldest friend, Dale? 

                                 MILES
                        Doesn’t ring a bell.  

                                 EMILY
                        Dale is a mechanic. Helpless in 
                        everything else in life, but when 
                        it comes to engines, and machines, 
                        motors and turbines - there’s no 
                        one better than Dale. 

           Emily removes her sunglasses. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        In high school, Dale was my only 
                        friend. All the other kids shunned 
                        the poor, mangy beggar girl with 
                        the one-eyed mother. But not Dale. 
                        He saved me from the stifling 
                        loneliness of adolescence, the 
                        unyielding cruelty of high school. 
                        You understand that, don’t you 
                        Miles? What it’s like to be 
                        completely isolated? To be 
                        surrounded by people who will never 
                        accept you, who make certain you 
                        know you don’t belong? 

           Miles doesn’t respond. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Dale has been in love with me for 
                        years. He’s asked me to marry him 
                        dozens of times. Which is sweet. So 
                        sweet. But it goes without saying 
                        that I could never be with Dale. He 
                        wants a regular life.

                        And what’s a relationship without a 
                        worthy sparring partner? An equal 
                        foe? A bore, really. A pitiful 
                        waste of time. I believe it was 
                        Chekhov who wrote, “Only entropy 
                        comes easy.”  

           Emily pauses, looks out the window, watches as a DUCK swims 
           in endless CIRCLES in a nearby pond.   

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        But occasionally I can call on him 
                        for a favor. To answer questions, 
                        for example. Like where I was the 
                        night of November 17th. Who I was 
                        with. What I was doing. 
                             (beat)
                        He’s a very useful tool.   

           Miles turns to face Emily, their faces INCHES apart. So close 
           they could kiss. 

                                 MILES
                        When do we hit the road again, 
                        Momma? I’ve got an itch I need to 
                        scratch. 

                                 EMILY
                        Name your day. I’ll be ready.  

                                 MILES
                        Are we friends? 

                                 EMILY
                        We don’t need to be friends. 
                             (Beat.)
                        We’re family. 

           Michael gets in the car. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ready to go? 

                                 EMILY
                        Absolutely. 

           EXT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - DAY 

           Miles, Michael and Emily walk up the FRONT STEPS. Miles 
           enters the house first. 

           Michael holds Emily back-- 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Welcome home. 

                                 EMILY
                        No name no longer. 

           Michael smiles, takes his face in her hands, kisses her 
           gently, looks deeply in her eyes. And then in a whisper--

                                 MICHAEL
                        My money was always on you. 

           Michael steps inside. Emily watches him for a moment, and 
           then she steps inside as well.  

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a pair of FERRAGAMO HEELS. They CLACK CLACK CLACK. 

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I didn’t stop giving hand jobs 
                        because I wasn’t good at it. I 
                        stopped giving hand jobs because I 
                        was the best at it. 

           REVEAL; Emily, her belly swollen from PREGNANCY, elegantly 
           draped in IVORY CASHMERE. She holds a TRAY carrying three 
           steaming MUGS of hot chocolate.  She enters-- 

           INT. CARTERHOOK MANOR - LIBRARY - NIGHT 

           She joins Michael and Miles by the FIRE. They are the picture 
           of quaint, privileged domesticity. 

           Emily removes REBECCA from the bookshelf, settles into the 
           big leather chair. She places the book on her lap, Michael by 
           her side, Miles at her feet and opens to the first page. She 
           rests her hand serenely on her belly.  

           She reads aloud, her VOICE sing-songy and richly theatrical. 
           A double edge of MENACE and IRONY; 

                                 EMILY 
                        Last night I dreamt I went to 
                        Manderley again. It seemed to me I 
                        stood by the iron gate leading to 
                        the drive, and for a while I could 
                        not enter, for the way was barred 
                        to me. There was a padlock and a 
                        chain upon the gate.

                        I called in my dream to the lodge-
                        keeper, and had no answer, and 
                        peering closer through the rusted 
                        spokes of the gate I saw that the 
                        lodge was uninhabited...

           CAMERA PULLS OUT of this quaint tableau. We notice a small 
           trickle of blood dripping from a crack in the ceiling. 

           It rolls slowly down the wall. 

           Outside a crack of thunder. It starts to pour. And we-- 

                                                       SMASH TO BLACK.
