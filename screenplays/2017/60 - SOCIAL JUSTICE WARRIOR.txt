           PURE BLACK fills the screen. The sounds of shuffling paper, 
           shifting chairs, and a quiet cough.

           SHAUN BARNES (male, 18, black, cisgender) steps into frame. 
           His focus masks the awkwardness of a valedictorian who spent 
           high school buried in books. He’s on the verge of coming into 
           his own. He looks down for a moment, then up.

                                 SHAUN
                        America is racist. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s what my parents told me when 
                        I was ten, after we had “the talk.” 
                        In black families, the talk isn’t 
                        about sex, it’s about how to be 
                        black around police. 

           REVEAL: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           We’re WIDER now and we see the edges of the darkness behind 
           Shaun. It’s a chalkboard. He looks at the essay in his hands.

                                 SHAUN
                        My dad says, “No matter what the 
                        police tell you, just do it. Even 
                        if it feels unfair. Even if you 
                        didn’t do anything wrong.” The 
                        first time he said that was the day 
                        police officers pushed him to the 
                        ground on our walk home. They said 
                        that he “matched the description.” 
                        Black men always match the 
                        description. That night, he told 
                        me, “We can do whatever it takes to 
                        make it right afterwards, as long 
                        as you’re still alive.”

           ANGLE ON: THE CLASS. A small group of about a dozen first-
           year, all white, STUDENTS sit facing Shaun. They’re 
           uncomfortable, but trying to hide it. They search for 
           something to look at: their hands, the clock, the wall.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        People like to say things are 
                        better now, but I still get 
                        followed around convenience stores 
                        and I still hear car doors lock 
                        when I walk down the street. And 
                        white people still talk to me just 
                        a little bit too politely. I know 
                        what they’re compensating for.
           The students’ faces each hold uneasy expressions: Does he 
           hate white people? I’m not one of those white people. Am I?

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        So I taught myself to blend in. 
                        Last week when I got to Wolcott, I 
                        told my hallmates that my name’s 
                        Shaun, just like I told you. But 
                        that’s not what they call me back 
                        home. Back home my family calls me 
                        DeShaun. I realized after getting 
                        here that changing my name won’t 
                        change the fact that some people 
                        don’t see me. They only see the 
                        stereotype. And I’m tired of it. 
                        I’m tired when it’s subtle. When 
                        I’m “lazy” or I’m “angry.” And I’m 
                        tired when it’s not so subtle. I’m 
                        a “thug.” A “nigger.” 

           On hearing the n-word, the students all simultaneously sit 
           up, as if hit by a slight electric shock. The LIT PROFESSOR 
           (female, 30’s, white, cisgender) searches for a response but 
           comes up empty.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be tired anymore.

           Silence. The class isn’t sure how to react when: HARPER 
           PENZIG (female, 18, white, cisgender) BURSTS INTO TEARS.

           The whole class turns to look at Harper. She’s naive, 
           brilliant, earnest, and currently in the middle of a world-
           broadening revelation. 

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        Um... are you okay?

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe -- it’s so 
                        terrible!

                                 SHAUN
                        Uhh... Hey. Hey. It’s -- I didn’t 
                        mean to upset you. 

                                 HARPER
                        But I am upset -- how could I not 
                        be upset!

           Harper sobs harder. Now Shaun’s the one who feels 
           uncomfortable.
                                 SHAUN
                        Really, I didn’t mean to make you 
                        cry. Please stop crying. I’m sorry. 

           Harper wipes her eyes.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks. I appreciate that. I 
                        just... I want you to know you have 
                        my support. I think all of us do, 
                        DeShaun.

           The students nod in agreement.

                                 SHAUN
                        You don’t have to do that. You 
                        don’t have to stop calling me 
                        Shaun. I was just making a point.

                                 HARPER
                        What can we do for you then? What 
                        can we do to end this? 

                                 SHAUN
                        End... what? Racism?

                                 HARPER
                        Y’know, just everything. What do 
                        you need us to do?

           Everybody, including the Lit Professor, looks to Shaun.

                                 SHAUN
                        Maybe... we can... start listening 
                        to each other?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes. Listening. We’re listening, 
                        Shaun. The world is listening.

           As Shaun searches for a response, Harper starts to APPLAUD. 
           The rest of the class joins in. Harper looks at her 
           classmates. She stands. The class follows. She beams.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. WOLCOTT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING

           The brick buildings, green quads, and bronze statues of a 
           private university during early fall in Connecticut.

           It’s an upscale, elite school. Not quite in the Ivy League, 
           but wishes it was.
           The buildings change to black and white, then washed out, 
           then high-contrast -- they are on a PHONE, getting ready to 
           be uploaded to Instagram.

           MONTAGE:

           Harper’s hand cycles through various apps on the phone, 
           navigating between Instagram, Snapchat, Text Messages, and 
           Facebook. This is her emoji-laden selfie journey from 
           freshman to sophomore year:

           -Harper in a class with “Race, Ethnicity, and Nation in 
           Global Perspective” written on the board.

           -A selfie of Harper studying in the library with the caption:  
           “Studying like <fire emoji> <fire emoji> <fire emoji>”

           -A Boomerang of Harper in her dorm room with her roommate 
           FRANCES CHUN (female, 18, Korean-American, cisgender) pulling 
           pizza bagels out of the microwave.

           -Harper at an Asian-American Association meeting with 
           Frances.

           -Harper sorting cans at a food pantry.

           -Harper with a clip board outside the Campus Center.

           -Harper chanting at a protest with Shaun behind her.

           -Harper friend requesting Shaun on Facebook.

           -Another Boomerang of students dancing at a Gay Pride Party.

           -Harper showing Shaun how to wrap duct tape around the wooden 
           handle of a protest sign.

           -A Snapchat of Harper, eyes closed: “asleep in this class”

           -A Snapchat of Harper, eyes wide open: “but woke AF” 

           -A Black Student Union Facebook photo of all their members, 
           including Shaun and Harper (who is the only white person).

           -A series of texts between Shaun and Harper, comparing their 
           housing numbers and learning they are both applying to the 
           Intercultural House next year.

           -Harper in a Habitat for Humanity t-shirt building a house in 
           Mexico during the summer.

           -Harper, Shaun, and Frances moving boxes into the 
           Intercultural House at the start of sophomore year.
           -Shaky iPhone footage from the center of a protest that’s 
           interrupting an English 101 class. 

           END MONTAGE -- but the scene continues as iPhone footage.

           30 BLACK STUDENTS in #NoRepresentation t-shirts are chanting 
           and marching towards the front of a lecture hall.

                                 BLACK STUDENTS
                        No representation in our education! 
                        No representation in our education!

           The screen suddenly fills with Harper’s face. She’s holding 
           the camera with her outstretched arm.

                                 HARPER 
                        Do you think a diverse faculty 
                        matters?

           She WHIPS to WHITE MALE 1, he averts his gaze, closes his 
           laptop, and quickly leaves.

           The phone WHIPS past an ASIAN FEMALE STUDENT (not what she’s 
           looking for), then stops on another flustered WHITE MALE 2.

                                 HARPER  (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Do you think a diverse faculty 
                        matters?

                                 WHITE MALE 2
                        Don’t film me. Stop! Stop filming! 
                        This is violating my rights!

           He covers the phone camera with his hand. The iPhone goes 
           dark and we’re in...

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Black Students swarm the lectern, taking over the class 
           from the OLD WHITE MALE PROFESSOR. At the center is OLENNA 
           (female, 21, black, queer) who pulls out a small bullhorn.

                                 OLENNA
                             (into bullhorn)
                        The Black Student Union demands a 
                        more diverse English department! We 
                        are fed up with being taught only 
                        by white faces! 

                                 HARPER
                             (to herself)
                        A bullhorn. Fuck me. That’s good 
                        thinking.
           Harper joins the protest at the front of the room. She 
           shimmies through the students to get closer to the bullhorn.

                                 OLENNA
                        We are staging a walkout until you 
                        meet our demands for a more 
                        inclusive and diverse faculty!

           Just as Harper pushes in next to Olenna, she hands the 
           bullhorn off to BLACK STUDENT 1 on her opposite side.

                                 BLACK STUDENT 1
                        There is value in our perspective!

           Harper watches the bullhorn travel further away from her as 
           Black Student 1 hands it off to Shaun.

                                 SHAUN
                        Value not just for students of 
                        color but for students of all 
                        races!

           As Shaun passes the bullhorn to BLACK STUDENT 2, Harper 
           suddenly cuts into the line and intercepts it.

                                 HARPER
                             (into bullhorn)
                        I want to hear from people of 
                        color, I want to learn from people 
                        of color!

           Black Student 2 reaches for the bullhorn but Harper isn’t 
           finished. In fact, she steps forward. Olenna turns to Shaun.

                                 OLENNA
                             (under her breath)
                        Get her in check.

                           SHAUN
                                                         HARPER
                 (off Olenna’s look)
           Okay... umm... Harper? 
           Harper!
                                              Which is why allies of all 
                                              colors are here to say that 
                                              students of color will not be 
                                              silenced!

           Harper doesn’t hear Shaun over the bullhorn so he shouts.

                           SHAUN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
                                              We will fight--
           NO REPRESENTATION IN OUR 
           EDUCATION!

           Shaun encourages the other protesters to join his chant.
                                 SHAUN AND BLACK STUDENTS
                        NO REPRESENTATION IN OUR EDUCATION!
                        NO REPRESENTATION IN OUR EDUCATION!

           Olenna starts to lead the protesters out of the lecture hall. 

                                 OLENNA
                        Our absence will reflect the 
                        absence of people of color on our 
                        faculty!

           Harper fist bumps the students as they march out past her. 

                                 HARPER
                        ...Yes it will! Their absence and 
                        my absence will reflect the absence 
                        of absent diverse voices here at 
                        Wolcott!

           As they march out, Shaun leads the Black Students in the 
           chant, but that doesn’t stop Harper from talking over them.

                      BLACK STUDENTS
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           No representation in our 
           education! 
           No representation in our 
           education!
                                              Justice will be served for 
                                              people of color! It’s our 
                                              duty to stand with our 
                                              brothers and sisters!

           Everyone has marched out except Harper, who lingers just 
           inside. Shaun holds the door, motioning for her to join them 
           in the hallway. He looks back at a pissed Olenna.

                                 SHAUN
                        Harper! Come on! It’s a walkout!

                                 HARPER
                        Wolcott’s policies re-create 
                        colonial violence daily--

           Shaun grabs Harper’s hand to coax her out. She holds his hand 
           up, mistaking it for solidarity. Everyone stares at Harper.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        --and we demand reparations!

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY

           Frances leads a meeting at the Intercultural House, which 
           Wolcott’s website describes as “the multicultural on-campus 
           housing option for diverse students.”
                                 FRANCES
                        Let’s have some recognition for the 
                        BSU’s very successful walk out.

           A circle of MOSTLY STUDENTS OF COLOR snap in approval, along 
           with Harper, Shaun, and LIZ MARUSINA (female, 19, white, 
           transgender), an engineer both at school and at heart.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        The next item is the Diversity and 
                        Inclusion Town Hall. One of the 
                        Jewish Acapella groups e-mailed me 
                        and asked if they could perform. We 
                        have a slot for them at the 
                        beginning. All in favor say 
                        “inclusion.”

                                 GROUP
                        Inclusion!

                                 FRANCES
                        Great. So let’s end this meeting 
                        with a sharing. I want to open it 
                        up to anyone who had an 
                        uncomfortable moment, a difficult 
                        feeling, or an experienced micro-
                        aggression. It doesn’t matter how 
                        trivial it is. It just helps to get 
                        it off your chest. No judgement. 
                        Remember, this is a safe space so 
                        whatever we say here doesn’t leave 
                        this room. I’ll start.

           Frances picks up a STUFFED ELEPHANT before she begins.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        I was playing Taboo with a friend, 
                        and I gave him the hint “where I’m 
                        from.” He guessed “China.” My card 
                        said “New Jersey.” Also, my parents 
                        are Korean.

           The students snap their approval. Frances passes the elephant 
           to a LATINO STUDENT next to her.

                                 LATINO STUDENT
                        A guy behind me in line at 
                        McDonald’s told me I spoke English 
                        really good. His words: “English 
                        really good.” 

           Loud snaps of approval. He passes the elephant to Harper.
                                 HARPER
                        I mean, I don't really have a good 
                        one. The woman at the sandwich 
                        counter keeps calling me “Sweetie.” 
                        Sorry, that's lame. Hopefully I’ll 
                        have a better one next time.

           Only a few snaps. Harper quickly passes the elephant to Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        This frat boy called me an “ugly 
                        bitch.” 

           A gasp. Then silence.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        But I was like, “awww, you insulted 
                        me like I’m a woman!” 

           Snaps and laughter break the tension. Harper isn’t laughing.

                                 HARPER
                        You don’t have to make a joke about 
                        it. Listen to me: You are not ugly. 
                        That frat guy, he’s the ugly one. 
                        But you. You, Liz--

           Harper takes Liz’s hand, looks deep into her eyes.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You are not ugly. You are perfect 
                        exactly as you are.

                                 LIZ
                        Well, not exactly as I am, but I’m 
                        on hormone therapy so I’m getting 
                        there.

           More laughter and snaps. Liz passes the elephant to a JEWISH 
           GIRL.

                                 JEWISH GIRL
                        I heard a girl on my floor call 
                        another girl’s sweater “worse than 
                        the Holocaust.”

           INT. EUROPEAN INTELLECTUALS 201 CLASSROOM - DAY

           DR. SUSAN BRODBECK (female, 40’s, white, cisgender) reads 
           from Nietzsche’s “Beyond Good and Evil” to a class of 30 
           STUDENTS. Most are on laptops and pay varying degrees of 
           attention. 
                                 SUSAN
                        “From the beginning, nothing has 
                        been more alien, repugnant, and 
                        hostile to woman than truth -- her 
                        great art is the lie, her highest 
                        concern is mere appearance and 
                        beauty.”

           Susan peers over her glasses at the class. She’s the sort of 
           professor who reads a physical newspaper every day, lives 
           without a television, and can eviscerate someone at a dinner 
           party with a single cutting remark.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        So Nietzsche is obviously being 
                        sexist, right?

           Towards the back of the class, Harper nods in agreement. Next 
           to her, Liz takes notes on her laptop.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Or rather, is he proving a point?

           Harper stops nodding.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        In your reading, Oppel claims that 
                        Nietzche is actually employing 
                        irony here to comment on societal 
                        attitudes that he finds ugly.

           On the word “ugly,” Harper’s face sours. She looks at Liz, 
           who has no visible reaction. Harper’s hand shoots up.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Harper?

                                 HARPER
                        I have a huge problem with this.

                                 SUSAN
                        Irony?

                                 HARPER
                        No. “Ugly.”

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m sorry?

                                 HARPER
                        That word alienates important 
                        segments of our community.

           Liz looks to the ground. She doesn’t want any attention.
                                 SUSAN
                        Ugly? Who does “ugly” alienate?

                                 HARPER
                        Women. Transgender students. Anyone 
                        who’s been called the u-word. You 
                        should apologize for saying it.

                                 SUSAN
                        Why? Ugly is a fairly common word.

                                 HARPER
                        The reality is, “ugly” is a 
                        gendered term to make women feel 
                        less than and it is reinforced 
                        daily by the sexist expectations of 
                        movies, magazines, and online 
                        media. And I know for a fact there 
                        is a person in this room -- who I 
                        will not name -- who has had this 
                        word cruelly flung in her face and 
                        it is a trigger for her.

           Liz sinks deeper in her seat, hiding behind her laptop.

                                 SUSAN
                        One of my goals as a professor is 
                        to always make my class inclusive, 
                        that’s why I put trigger warnings 
                        on the syllabus. I’m sorry if you 
                        were offended.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s not an apology. You’re 
                        apologizing for my feelings, not 
                        for your actions. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I hear what you are saying, but 
                        keep in mind that in addressing an 
                        individual’s needs, we cannot lose 
                        sight of the larger group’s needs. 
                        So when teaching a class I try to 
                        find a balance. I’d like to open 
                        this discussion up. Does anyone 
                        else have a perspective on this? 

           CHURCH (male, 21, white, cisgender, jock) raises his hand.

                                 CHURCH
                        Actually, ugly is just a word to 
                        describe something that doesn’t 
                        look good. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHURCH (CONT'D)
                        So people should be able to say it, 
                        and... actually, it’s part of the 
                        first amendment.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not saying it should be 
                        illegal, I’m saying that using this 
                        word should have consequences, just 
                        like any other sexist speech. Have 
                        you ever called a man ugly? 

                                 CHURCH
                        I mean, I don’t know, I don’t 
                        really look at dudes like that.

                                 HARPER
                        Exactly. “Ugly” is like “bitch,” 
                        except it describes appearance 
                        rather than assertiveness. You 
                        wouldn’t describe someone as 
                        “bitchy” in an academic discussion, 
                        would you?

                                 CHURCH
                        Uh... no, I guess not.

                                 HARPER
                        Then likewise we shouldn’t say 
                        “ugly.” We must remember that 
                        demeaning language reinforces 
                        stereotypes and stereotypes lead to 
                        unconscious bias and unconscious 
                        bias leads to prejudice and 
                        prejudice leads to bias motivated 
                        violence and bias motivated 
                        violence leads to genocide. It’s a 
                        pyramid of hate. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Harper, you’ve made some very 
                        interesting observations. But we’re 
                        getting off topic. We should really 
                        move on, however, I’m happy to talk 
                        more about this at my office hours.

           Susan turns back to the board. Harper sits back, fuming. She 
           motions to Liz like “Can you believe this?” Liz shrugs.

           INT. LEWIS HALL LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           A row of old coin-operated washing machines sit under 
           fluorescent lights in a concrete basement. Several machines 
           WHIR with laundry. Harper’s on her phone.
           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper uploads her video from the beginning 
           of the BSU walk out to Facebook. She posts a status update.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Injustice is institutional. Led a 
                        protest yesterday. I will continue 
                        to fight! #victory #racism 
                        #wewillovercome - with Shaun Barnes 
                        and 4 others.

           She clicks Facebook’s search bar and types in “gary penzig.” 
           A few options come up. She picks the humorless-looking GARY 
           PENZIG from Seattle, Washington (male, late 40’s, white, 
           cisgender).

           She scrolls through his photos. There’s mostly pictures of 
           him with a WOMAN (mid-30’s, Asian) and their TWO CHILDREN (4 
           and 6). She keeps scrolling, further and further, until she 
           finds an older photo. It’s Gary and a middle school-aged 
           Harper, who is smiling and holding up a science fair ribbon.

                                 SHAUN (O.S.)
                        S’up?

           PHONE OFF SCREEN. Harper turns to find Shaun with an 
           overflowing laundry bag. He starts loading a machine.

                                 HARPER
                        Hi.

                                 SHAUN
                        So... what did you decide to do 
                        about the Dr. Brodbeck thing? You 
                        gonna talk to her?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s a waste of time to talk with 
                        close-minded people. Would you talk 
                        to a KKK member?

                                 SHAUN
                        Uh, no. Probably not.

           DING! PHONE ON SCREEN: Shaun glances at his text messages. 

                                 OLENNA (V.O.)
                        Did you tell her yet?

                                 SHAUN (V.O.)
                        Don’t worry i got it
                                 OLENNA (V.O.)
                        She better not show up to the next 
                        BSU mtg. She’s OUT <black clapping 
                        hands emoji>

           Shaun puts away his phone and returns to his laundry.

                                 SHAUN
                        Hey, so there’s something I need to--

                                 HARPER
                        Let me guess. You want to start 
                        planning the next BSU protest. 
                        Don’t worry, I have some ideas.

                                 SHAUN
                        Y’know, I was thinking maybe the 
                        BSU isn’t the best way to protest 
                        at Wolcott.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you kidding? The BSU is the 
                        only group with a real agenda: 
                        faculty diversity. I was thinking 
                        we should stage a die-in at 
                        President Tilton’s house because 
                        he’s killing our education.

                                 SHAUN
                        Maybe.

           Unsure of how to continue, Shaun focuses on his laundry.

                                 HARPER
                        I have another idea for the BSU. 

                                 SHAUN
                        C’mon, Harps. You must have 
                        something else to think about.

                                 HARPER
                        I think you should run for 
                        president.

                                 SHAUN
                        Seriously?

                                 HARPER
                        Seriously. 

                                 SHAUN
                        I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
                                 HARPER
                        You’re a rising star! The BSU’s 
                        focus on faculty diversity was all 
                        your idea. You have to run.

                                 SHAUN
                        I don’t know...

                                 HARPER
                        Please? I obviously can’t be 
                        president so I need to live 
                        vicariously through you. Do it for 
                        me?

                                 SHAUN
                        Okay. Okay, fine, I’ll run.

           Harper steps forward and touches Shaun’s arm.

                                 HARPER
                        Good. Maybe I’ll vote for you.

           Harper smiles. He smiles back. Beat. Suddenly self-conscious, 
           Shaun fiddles with the laundry machine. Harper gives him a 
           look.

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        What?

                                 SHAUN
                        What’s that look?

                                 HARPER
                        Nothing.

           Harper suddenly kisses Shaun. It’s sweet... for a second. 
           Then it turns into a sloppy 19-year-old make out session.

           INT. SHAUN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Harper and Shaun are squeezed into his twin bed in his messy 
           room. Harper stares at the ceiling as Shaun slowly wakes up.

                                 HARPER
                        Hey...

                                 SHAUN
                        Hey...
                                 HARPER
                        So... 

                                 SHAUN
                        Yeah...

                                 HARPER
                        That was fun.

                                 SHAUN
                             (smiling)
                        It was.

           Beat.

                                 HARPER
                        Hey, do you think the BSU would 
                        help me protest Dr. Brodbeck? 

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        I know it wasn’t racially motivated 
                        but there’s a certain amount of 
                        white privilege involved.

                                 SHAUN
                        Harper, I have to tell you 
                        something...

                                 HARPER
                        What?

                                 SHAUN
                        Fuck... um, I totally disagree with 
                        them, but the BSU eboard... wants 
                        you out of the group.

                                 HARPER
                        But I’ve been part of the BSU since 
                        first semester freshman year. 
                        Before you even joined!

                                 SHAUN
                        It’s not a competition.

                                 HARPER
                        I know. I’m just saying I was.

           Awkward silence.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        They don’t like me?
                                 SHAUN
                        No, it’s... I think they just want 
                        a group where black folks can talk 
                        openly.

                                 HARPER
                        They can talk openly when I’m 
                        there. I won’t judge anyone. I’m an 
                        ally.

                                 SHAUN
                        I’m sorry, Harps. I’ll quit too.

                                 HARPER
                        What? No! You can’t quit. You have 
                        to run for president, remember?

                                 SHAUN
                        You still want me to do that?

                                 HARPER
                        Of course. Wolcott needs you. 
                        Promise me you’ll run.

                                 SHAUN
                        Okay. I promise.

           Harper snuggles up next to Shaun. They spoon for a moment. 
           It’s peaceful, but something’s on Harper’s mind.

                                 HARPER
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 SHAUN
                        Hm?

                                 HARPER
                        Nevermind.

                                 SHAUN
                        Okay.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s just... I’ll never really know 
                        what it’s like to be like you. 

                                 SHAUN
                        Like me?

                                 HARPER
                        Y’know. A person of color.
                                 SHAUN
                             (smiling)
                        Too bad for you.

           A quiet beat as Harper nuzzles into Shaun.

                                 HARPER
                        Has anyone ever... said it to you?

                                 SHAUN
                        Said what?

                                 HARPER
                        You know.

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        The... n-word.

                                 SHAUN
                        “The n-word.” If you want to say 
                        it, then say it.

                                 HARPER
                        What? No! I can’t.

                                 SHAUN
                        You have permission.

                                 HARPER
                        Permission from who?

                                 SHAUN
                        Me. As a representative of the 
                        entire black race.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s tokenism.

                                 SHAUN
                             (playful)
                        Come on... say it!

                                 HARPER
                        No! You’re testing me.

                                 SHAUN
                        It’s not a test.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re trying to trick me.
                                 SHAUN
                        How about we say it together.

                                 HARPER
                        No.

                                 SHAUN
                        On the count of three. One... 
                        two... three: nigga. 

           Harper’s silent. Shaun exaggerates shock.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t say it! You lied to me!

                                 HARPER
                        Shut up. I’m not gonna do it.

                                 SHAUN
                        If you don’t say this with me, 
                        right now, I’ll never be able to 
                        trust you ever again.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you sure?

                                 SHAUN
                        Yes. Come on: One...

           Harper grudgingly follows along.

                      SHAUN (CONT'D)
                                                         HARPER
           Two... three...
                                              Two... three...

           As they reach the word, Shaun drops out after the “n” sound.

                           SHAUN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           N--
                                              Nigger.

                                 SHAUN
                             (mock serious)
                        The fuck did you just say to me?

                                 HARPER
                        Hey, you didn’t say it!
                        That’s not fair! That is not 
                        fucking fair!

           Harper playfully punches Shaun and he responds by rolling on 
           top of her.
                                 SHAUN
                        Come on, I was just playin. Though 
                        it was weird to hear that hard “r.” 
                        “Nigg-Errrr.”

                                 HARPER
                        Shut up. Shut up.

           She rolls him so she’s on top. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Stop. Oh my god. Am I a racist?

                                 SHAUN
                        You’re not a racist.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have said 
                        it.

           Shaun thinks for a second.

                                 SHAUN
                        Yeah. You probably shouldn’t have.

                                 HARPER
                        You know what? This has taught me 
                        something very important.

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        I hurt you with my words. Just like 
                        Liz was hurt. Just like I was hurt.

                                 SHAUN
                        “Ugly” isn’t the same as nigger.

                                 HARPER
                        Of course not! Definitely not. I 
                        was gonna say though, that if we 
                        let the little injustices go, we 
                        make room for bigger ones.

           Shaun’s not sure if he follows that logic. Harper picks up 
           her phone.

                                 SHAUN
                        What are you doing?

                                 HARPER
                        Correcting a little injustice.
           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper types an e-mail.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Dear Dean Gordon, I am writing to 
                        share an experience I had with a 
                        faculty member that I believe was 
                        an inflammatory micro-aggression. 
                        Dr. Susan Brodbeck visited--

           INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           A spacious office with large framed old maps on the walls. 

           DEAN SAUL GORDON (male, 50’s, white, cisgender, culturally 
           Jewish) sits at a mahogany desk reading Harper’s e-mail, 
           concerned and confused.

                                 DEAN GORDON (V.O.)
                        --violence upon me by using an 
                        inappropriate and purposefully 
                        alienating term--

           INT. SHAUN'S ROOM - MORNING

           Harper types, self righteous.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        --that hindered my ability to learn 
                        in a safe space. 

           INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           A small and functional bedroom with a tasteful modern black-
           and-white aesthetic and lots of bookshelves. Susan reads the 
           e-mail on her laptop. 

                                 SUSAN (V.O.)
                        The insulting--

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                        --patriarchal sexism?--

                        --disrespects not only my gender!--

                                 HARPER (V.O.)

                        University will take appropriate 
                        action!

           INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING - BACK TO SCENE

           Susan closes her laptop.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re fucking kidding me.

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Honey?

           MARK PEREZ (male, 40’s, hispanic, cisgender), Susan’s salt-of-
           the-earth, long-term boyfriend, sits on the edge of the bed. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Sorry, it’s nothing. Keep going.

                                 MARK
                        Were you listening to any of it?

           She wasn’t. Susan smiles, doing her best to look innocent.

                                 SUSAN
                        Would you mind starting again?

           Mark reads from a piece of paper.

                                 MARK
                        Dr. Susan Brodbeck has fifteen 
                        years of experience as a scholar-
                        activist specializing in social 
                        movements. As an associate 
                        professor at Emory, she received 
                        the Cromwell prize for excellence 
                        in teaching and since joining 
                        Wolcott has been published in the 
                        American Historical Review, 
                        Comparative Studies...

           Mark notices Susan is looking at her laptop.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not starting over again.
                                 SUSAN
                        I was listening. Do I sound 
                        impressive enough?

                                 MARK
                        Yes. You sound very impressive and 
                        that’s because you are very 
                        impressive. Don’t worry. You’re 
                        going to get tenure this year.

                                 SUSAN
                        I didn’t worry enough at Emory and 
                        I got completely fucked. Six years 
                        down the drain.

                                 MARK
                        Maybe things are supposed to happen 
                        a certain way. If you had stayed at 
                        Emory, we never would’ve met and 
                        I’d probably still be with Kathy.

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you bringing up your ex-wife to 
                        make me feel... better?

                                 MARK
                        You know what I mean. You are 
                        brilliant and your book is amazing.

           Susan softens and kisses Mark on the cheek.

           INT. NOVEL IDEA BOOKS - EVENING

           A cramped local bookstore, political stickers adorn the 
           register and quippy greeting cards sit next to it.

           A small sign with Susan’s picture announces the release of 
           her book, “19th Century Societal Norms And Their Emerging 
           Effect On The Greater Social Consciousness.” Susan’s reading 
           from her book in front of a small audience of PROFESSORS.

                                 SUSAN
                             (reading)
                        ...the resulting societal shifts 
                        used to be far smaller, and far 
                        slower, occurring only after a 
                        significant clash of ideologies 
                        such as a war or a rebellion. Now 
                        we see rapid and monumental 
                        ideological shifts resulting from 
                        far less significant clashes. 
                        Sometimes in just 140 characters.
           There is a smattering of laughter. Susan smiles and looks to 
           Mark who smiles back at her.

           INT. NOVEL IDEA BOOKS - LATER

           The Professors mill about drinking wine and eating cheese. 
           Susan chats with Dean Gordon as Mark looks on.

                                 SUSAN
                        Honestly, Saul, it really means a 
                        lot when the administration shows 
                        up to support faculty scholarship.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Of course. We think you’re a great 
                        talent.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh, thank you.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        But... I did come here to bring up 
                        one item. As you may have seen, a 
                        bias incident report has been 
                        filed--

                                 SUSAN
                        The one by Harper Penzig?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        They’re anonymous actually.

                                 SUSAN
                        You left her e-mail address on when 
                        you forwarded it.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Oh, um... Please don’t tell anyone. 
                        They’re supposed to be 
                        confidential.

                                 MARK
                        What’s a “bias incident report?”

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        It’s a way for students to file a 
                        complaint after they’ve encountered 
                        an act of discrimination. Wolcott 
                        has to track reported bias 
                        incidents because they are now a 
                        metric used for US News and World 
                        Report’s school rankings.
                                 SUSAN
                        Will this affect my tenure process?

           Dean Gordon takes a breath.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Saul. Come on. Do you know why 
                        Harper filed it? Because I used the 
                        word “ugly.”

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Ugly?

                                 MARK
                        Ugly!

                                 SUSAN
                        Ugly. 

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        That’s... I was not aware of that.
                        Unfortunately, the complaint will 
                        still have to be reviewed by your 
                        department chair. And President 
                        Tilton. It’s policy, I’m afraid.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me.

                                 MARK
                        Can’t you just... make it go away 
                        or something?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        I can’t. The administration has to 
                        remain neutral in student-teacher 
                        disputes. But you can, Susan.

           Dean Gordon hands her a folded paper from his jacket pocket. 

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        This is a retraction of the bias 
                        incident. If you can get Ms. Penzig 
                        to sign it by tomorrow, the 
                        complaint can be dismissed before 
                        the board sees it.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m sure that won’t be a problem. 
                        It’s just a misunderstanding. I’ll 
                        grab her after class.
           INT. EUROPEAN INTELLECTUALS 201 CLASSROOM -  DAY

           As STUDENTS take their seats, Susan scans the room.

                                 SUSAN
                        Has anyone seen Harper Penzig?

                                 LIZ
                             (reluctantly)
                        She told me to tell you she’s 
                        boycotting your class.

                                 SUSAN
                        Wonderful.

           INT. LIBRARY STUDY AREA - DAY

           Harper sits at a cubicle, headphones on, listening to hip-hop 
           and typing on her laptop. She feels a tap on her shoulder and 
           turns to find Susan smiling at her. She takes off her 
           headphones. 

           They both WHISPER to each other throughout the scene.

                                 HARPER
                        Dr. Brodbeck? What do you want?

                                 SUSAN
                        You skipped my class today and I 
                        was worried. I don’t want our 
                        disagreement to get in the way of 
                        your education.

                                 HARPER
                        It won’t.

                                 SUSAN
                        Honestly, Harper, I admire you.

           Harper regards her skeptically.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        You have so much passion. It 
                        reminds me of when I was an 
                        undergrad protesting apartheid and 
                        trying to get my school to divest 
                        from South Africa. I want Wolcott 
                        to be a more inclusive school just 
                        like you do.
                                 HARPER
                        No, you don’t. You couldn’t even 
                        apologize for what you said in 
                        class.

           Susan takes a deep breath.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re right. I didn’t mean to use 
                        language that alienated you. And 
                        for that, I do apologize.

           Harper wasn’t expecting this.

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you. I... I appreciate that.

                                 SUSAN
                        Of course. Now do you think we can 
                        put this whole thing behind us?

                                 HARPER
                        I guess. Sure.

                                 SUSAN
                        Great. Just to make it official, 
                        would you mind signing this little 
                        thing?

           Susan produces the retraction form and hands it to Harper.

                                 HARPER
                        What’s this?
                             (reading)
                        “Retraction of bias incident.”

                                 SUSAN
                        Once you sign it, we can get back 
                        to having a productive conversation 
                        about the issues that are important 
                        to you.

           Harper looks at the document, thinking. She hands it back.

                                 HARPER
                        I’ll sign it... when your classroom 
                        is a safe space for students.

                                 SUSAN
                        My classroom is a safe space for 
                        students. It’s a place where 
                        students can learn and feel safe to 
                        express their views in a generous 
                        environment. A safe space.
                                 HARPER
                        That’s not what a safe space is. 
                        It’s a place where people are safe 
                        because they don’t feel threatened.

                                 SUSAN
                        Right. To express their views.

                                 HARPER
                        No. To not be attacked. Which is 
                        what you are doing to me right now.

           Harper closes her laptop and shoves it in her bag before 
           walking off. Susan follows. They’re getting a little louder. 
           Some LIBRARY STUDENTS look up.

                                 SUSAN
                        Harper. Harper! I tried. I asked 
                        you come to my office hours, but 
                        instead you immediately filed a 
                        bias incident over a regular word!

                                 HARPER
                        There’s no such thing as “regular.” 
                        “Ugly” is a tool of the patriarchy  
                        purposely used to belittle women.

                                 SUSAN
                        Men can be ugly. Steve Buscemi is 
                        ugly.

                                 HARPER
                        First, I don’t really know who that 
                        is, and second, calling a man ugly 
                        is like calling some random person 
                        cheap but calling a woman ugly is 
                        like calling a Jewish person cheap! 

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re comparing what I said to 
                        anti-Semitism?

                                 HARPER
                        I’m proving context is important. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Context is important. I wasn’t 
                        describing a person in class, I was 
                        describing an idea. You’re ignoring 
                        both the context and my intent. 

                                 HARPER
                        Intent is subjective.
                                 SUSAN
                        My subjective intent was never to 
                        upset you.

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t believe you!

                                 SUSAN
                        I don’t believe you.

           More Library Students stare. Susan follows Harper behind a 
           bookshelf. They are now approaching normal speaking volume, 
           and beyond.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re being so immature right now--

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not being immature! You’re 
                        being stupid!

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re trying to fulfill some 
                        infantile need for attention. I’m 
                        sorry your generation can only feel 
                        self worth through the gaze of 
                        others.

                                 HARPER
                        And I’m sorry your pathetic ego is 
                        so fragile you can’t even admit 
                        when you’re wrong! Instead, you 
                        defend outdated, normative, 
                        offensive language!

                                 SUSAN
                        If it’s relevant to academic 
                        discussion, it’s not offensive!

                                 HARPER
                        So what? Anybody can say anything 
                        in your class? Would you call me 
                        a... a... dirty cum cunt?

                                 SUSAN
                        I would never call you that!

                                 HARPER
                        So now there are things that you 
                        won’t say! Why? Because it’s 
                        offensive! If you really believed 
                        in your argument, you’d call me a 
                        dirty cum cunt!
                           SUSAN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           No--
                                              Say it!

                           SUSAN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           Stop it--
                                              Dirty--

                           SUSAN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           Don’t--
                                              Cum--

                           SUSAN
                                                     HARPER (CONT'D)
           Harper!
                                              CUNT!

           Some Library Students and a LIBRARIAN stare, mouths open.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ha! You can’t say it! Because you 
                        are a hypocrite.

                                 SUSAN
                        I am not a hypocrite! I’m right. 
                        You know what, Harper? 

                                 HARPER
                        What, Dr. Brodbeck?

           Susan lowers her voice back to a threatening whisper.

                                 SUSAN
                        I know you live in the 
                        Intercultural House, and I know 
                        Wolcott only pays for it as long as 
                        you keep a 3.6 GPA.

                                 HARPER
                        So?

                                 SUSAN
                        So what happens if you fail my 
                        class?

           Finally, Harper’s at a loss for words. Susan thrusts the 
           paper at her.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Sign it.

           Harper takes it.

                                 HARPER
                        But I-- this-- what you’re doing is 
                        blackmail.
                                 SUSAN
                        And what you did was slander. So 
                        now we’re equal. Here’s a pen.

           Slowly, Harper signs the paper and hands it back to her.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

                                 HARPER
                        “Injustice anywhere is a threat to 
                        justice everywhere.”

                                 SUSAN
                        Don’t do that. Don’t you quote 
                        Martin Luther King at me. You don’t 
                        have the right.

           Susan walks away as Harper shouts after her.

                                 HARPER
                        Why are you continually trying to 
                        delegitimize my experiences!

           EXT. CAMPUS CENTER - DAY

           Frances and Harper stand near the entrance of the campus 
           center, holding armfuls of signs that read: “Dr. Brodbeck 
           Teaches Hate Speech 101.” Harper looks around.

                                 HARPER
                        What time is it? Why is no one here 
                        yet?

           Frances looks at the time on her phone.

                                 FRANCES
                        Maybe they’re late? We had 12 
                        people “interested” in our “Dr. 
                        Brodbeck Hate Speech Rally” event 
                        on Facebook.

                                 HARPER
                        “Interested” means “I want to look 
                        like I care but I’m definitely not 
                        coming.” I should have known. I 
                        barely get 10 likes when I post 
                        about being an ally or white 
                        privilege or even 
                        intersectionalism. And they’re all 
                        from members of the Intercultural 
                        Alliance.
                                 FRANCES
                        The students on this campus are 
                        completely apathetic. It’s so 
                        depressing. What should we do?

           EXT. HISTORY DEPARTMENT - DAY

           A VERTICAL IMAGE OF AN IPHONE VIDEO FILLS THE FRAME:

           Poor sound, wind. In the middle of the busy academic quad, 
           Susan walks briskly with her head down. Harper follows, 
           yelling directly at her and holding a “Hate Speech 101” sign.

                                 HARPER
                        Dr. Brodbeck teaches hate speech!

           Susan says nothing and picks up her pace.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ignoring a student is nothing new 
                        for Dr. Brodbeck.

                                 FRANCES (O.S.)
                             (from behind the camera)
                        Too proud to address the lowly 
                        peasants.

                                 HARPER
                        Whose university?

                                 FRANCES (O.S.)
                        Our university!

                                 HARPER
                        Whose university?

                                 FRANCES (O.S.)
                        Our university!

           Some nearby STUDENTS turn to watch this bizarre scene.

           The image stays vertical but the video TILTS 90 DEGREES.

                                 HARPER
                        Frances! You can’t start it 
                        vertical then turn the phone 
                        horizontal! It doesn’t work like 
                        that!

                                 FRANCES (O.S.)
                        Oops, sorry! I was trying to keep 
                        her in frame--
                                 HARPER
                        Hurry up!

           Harper starts running after Susan, Frances follows, the 
           camera shaking badly. They get in Susan’s face. The image 
           turns back to VERTICAL.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Brodbeck! Dr. Brodbeck!

           Susan turns. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 HARPER
                        We’re bringing attention to our 
                        cause!

                                 SUSAN
                        What cause?

                                 HARPER
                        Violent hate speech in the 
                        classroom.

                                 SUSAN
                        You signed the retraction.

                                 HARPER
                        Because you blackmailed me! 
                             (yelling out)
                        Dr. Brodbeck extorted me! 
                        Blackmail! Shame! Shame!

                                 SUSAN
                        I’d be happy to talk to you if you 
                        turn off the camera.

                                 HARPER
                        What’s the point if there’s no 
                        record of our dialogue? What are 
                        you so afraid of?

                                 SUSAN
                        Being taken out of context for one.

                                 HARPER
                        You should be able to stand behind 
                        everything you’ve ever said.

           Susan starts to respond, but thinks better of it and instead, 
           hurries away with her head down. Harper and Frances follow.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Whose university?

                                 FRANCES (O.S.)
                        Our university!

           INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A defiant Harper sits across from Dean Gordon.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        You cannot publicly accuse a 
                        professor of blackmail without any 
                        corroborating documentation.

                                 HARPER
                        But I’m telling the truth! 

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Dr. Brodbeck has unequivocally 
                        denied your claim.

                                 HARPER
                        So what? Just because she’s a 
                        professor she has more authority 
                        than me?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        If you pursue this, you could face 
                        disciplinary sanctions for 
                        defamation.

                                 HARPER
                        Then I want to unsign my retraction 
                        of the bias incident.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        You want to retract your 
                        retraction?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes, exactly.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Ms. Penzig, I’m afraid once the 
                        retraction paperwork has been 
                        submitted and approved by the 
                        relevant department heads, the bias 
                        conduct guidelines don’t allow us 
                        to reopen a closed bias incident. I 
                        mean, that would be unnecessarily 
                        bureaucratic.
           Harper looks frustrated.

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE ON A TUBE TV: A digitally fuzzy clip of a right wing 
           cable news host, PETER O’MALLEY (male, 50’s, white, bloated, 
           3rd Generation Irish-American), lecturing his audience:

                                 O’MALLEY
                        The three most persecuted groups in 
                        America are Christians, the Wealthy 
                        and White Men.

           An abrupt cut to an old movie clip of a MAN looking at a 
           SLEEPING WOMAN. Romantic music plays as he kisses her. She 
           wakes up and smiles. Then a cut to O’Malley again:

                                 O’MALLEY (CONT’D)
                        Women buy makeup because they want 
                        us to look at them. So I say, look!

           The TV plays more old movie clips of men kissing sleeping 
           women juxtaposed with right wing cable news.

           WIDEN OUT: 

           Frances looks at a wood-paneled tube TV, arms folded. Harper 
           stands next to her, considering.

                                 FRANCES
                        You really think it’s good?

                                 HARPER
                        This is the most powerful 
                        installation you’ve made yet.

                                 FRANCES
                        Do you think I should write “this 
                        is rape” in red lipstick or black?

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, red for sure. It’s a commentary 
                        on western beauty standards.

           Harper goes to her laptop on the dining room table.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        For this post, do you think I 
                        should say they “denied my 
                        intelligence” or “denied my 
                        rationality?”
                                 FRANCES
                        Why not both?

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah. Smart.

           LAPTOP ON SCREEN: Harper’s editing a Facebook post with her 
           protest video attached. We only see the end of it.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Dr. Susan Brodbeck, Dean Saul 
                        Gordon, and the entire Wolcott 
                        Administration denied my 
                        intelligence. They denied my 
                        rationality. But they cannot deny 
                        my emotions. 

           Harper hits post and waits. A notification pops up. Harper 
           smiles and clicks the globe. One like. From Frances.

                                 HARPER
                        Just a like? No comment?

                                 FRANCES
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 HARPER
                        Actually, can you share it? I need 
                        more than just my friends to see it.

                                 FRANCES
                        I could send it to this girl in my 
                        art class who’s an editor at The 
                        Whisperer. Maybe they’d write about 
                        it?

           Harper’s face lights up.

                                 HARPER
                        Yes! Amazing.

           Frances goes to her phone and starts typing.

           INT. THE WOLCOTT DAILY WHISPERER - NIGHT

           A STUDENT JOURNALIST posts an article titled, “Student 
           Accuses Wolcott of Promoting Hate Speech” to The Wolcott 
           Whisperer’s website. Comments begin to appear.

                        applaud her for taking a stand. We 
                        need white voices to support us.

                        This article comes from a place of 
                        privilege and is sexist and racist.

           A BLACK MALE in his dorm room.

                                 BLACK MALE (V.O.)
                        Black bodies are dying in the 
                        streets and that’s what we need to 
                        be focusing on.

                        white, blue, or purple, you racist.

                        I’m a black woman on campus, and I 
                        think we need to be more tolerant 
                        of each other and less tolerant of 
                        drivel like this.
           More commenters appear, the overlapping voices and arguments 
           rise until it reaches a CACOPHONY.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. AUDITORIUM - EVENING

           A sign reads: “Wolcott University presents ‘A Conversation on 
           Diversity and Inclusion Town Hall’ presented by The 
           Intercultural Alliance”

           An ACAPELLA version of a very, very explicit hip-hop song can 
           be heard from inside the auditorium.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           A nerdy coed acapella group, all glasses, frizzy hair and too-
           long ties, perform the song on stage. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper peaks out from the curtains. As the song continues, 
           Harper pulls out her phone and takes a Snapchat selfie with 
           the audience behind her.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: A blurry picture that’s mostly Harper and a 
           bit of the audience in the background. Harper writes:

                        This is what diversity looks like.

           She posts it to her Snapchat stories. PHONE OFF SCREEN.

                        The turn out is way better than 
                        last year’s. Do you think the crowd 
                        just looks bigger from the stage?

                                 SHAUN
                        I think the Whisperer writing about 
                        your Facebook post made a 
                        difference.

                                 HARPER
                        Really?

                                 SHAUN
                        People love a controversy.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s not controversial.

           The acapella group finishes up.

                                 ACAPELLA MEMBER
                        Thank you! We are the 
                        Passovertones. Our fall show is 
                        November 5th, check us out on 
                        Facebook and goodnight!

           They all run off the stage to APPLAUSE as Dean Gordon walks 
           out. He looks out over the audience.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Thanks to all the student groups 
                        for coming tonight and providing a 
                        wonderful introduction for what I’m 
                        sure will be an enlightening 
                        conversation. 

           The Dean unfolds a piece of paper and reads off it.

                        I’d also like to thank the 
                        Intercultural Alliance and the 
                        Intercultural House who organized 
                        this event, along with President 
                        Tilton, the Center for the Study of 
                        Race and Ethnicity, the Office of

                        the Institutional Diversity 
                        Committee, and Darius Jackson, who 
                        is the Co-Vice chair of the 
                        Diversity Student Leader Society of 
                        the College of Information and 
                        Communication.

                        There’s a new addition this year, a 
                        “hashtag” for this event, pound 
                        sign W-D-I-Town-Hall.

           A tweet appears on the screen from the official Wolcott 
           account: “Excited for a great #WDITownHall.”

                        Anything with that hashtag will 
                        appear on this screen to truly give 
                        our student body real-time 
                        feedback.

                        We’re also streaming on Wolcott’s 
                        YouTube page so we are not only 
                        having this conversation here, but 
                        around the world. I do hope those 
                        in “I.R.L.” -- in real life -- will 
                        participate and ask questions of 
                        our panelists. And now I will turn 
                        this discussion over to our student 
                        leaders who will each introduce 
                        themselves.

           Lukewarm applause as a diverse group of STUDENT LEADERS, 
           including Shaun and Harper, take their seats at a table with 
           identifying paper placards and a single microphone. Shaun 
           picks up the mic.

                                 SHAUN
                        Hi. I’m Shaun Barnes, and I’m 
                        representing the Black Student 
                        Union.

           He passes the mic to ASHLEY (female, 19, white, cis, person 
           of size).

                        Ashley Hale, Coalition for Women’s 
                        Issues.

           She passes the mic to NIDA (female, 21, American-Pakistani, 
           cis).

           She passes the mic to Harper.

                        Harper Penzig, Intercultural 
                        Alliance.

           She seems like she’s going to pass it down again, but just 
           repositions it.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m a cis woman, a second-year 
                        student at Wolcott, a bisexual, a 
                        child of divorce, and an agent of 
                        change against our shared 
                        institutionalized problems. My 
                        preferred gender pronouns are 
                        she/her/hers or they/them/theirs.

           Harper stands, mic in hand.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Starting my freshman year, I’ve 
                        fought diligently to give a voice 
                        to those less privileged. I’ve 
                        participated in rallies, sit-ins, 
                        and protests and this summer I 
                        built a schoolhouse in a very poor 
                        part of Mexico. But I’m not here to 
                        talk about that. We’re here to talk 
                        about our shared cultural 
                        experiences. Because we can make 
                        this campus a better place. Follow 
                        me at HarpsPen on Twitter and on 
                        Instagram at Harpspen1 for more 
                        thoughts on social change. And 
                        remember - diversity means 
                        differences both visible and 
                        invisible but Wolcott must be 
                        indivisible. Thank you.

           Harper drops the mic on the table. A silent beat. TIM (male, 
           19, Asian-American, cis) hesitates, then retrieves the mic.

                        What a wonderful night of 
                        experiences we’ve been having. I 
                        know that I now better understand 
                        the battles my fellow marginalized 
                        students and friends fight every 
                        day. Don’t you?

           REVEAL: Susan’s watching Harper online in her cramped, dark 
           office, surrounded by messy piles of paperwork. She eats a 
           handful of Skittles and scowls.

                        Let’s give ourselves a round of 
                        applause.

           Harper claps and the audience follows suit. Susan shuts her 
           laptop. She can’t take it anymore.
           INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Harper has the mic.

                                 HARPER
                        Let’s start a conversation. I want 
                        to hear from you. Please, any 
                        questions for me or our panel.

           Behind Harper, #WDITownhall tweets appear: “We’re changing 
           lives and minds #WDItownhall” “This is what progress looks 
           like #WDITownhall” “Say goodbye to racism #WDITownhall.”

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        As a reminder, if you are a cishet 
                        white male, please give someone 
                        else the opportunity to speak first 
                        because you dominate the rest of 
                        our cultural discourse. 

           Harper squints but can’t see into the audience because of the 
           bright lights. Olenna takes the mic.

                                 OLENNA
                        Hi. I have a friend in that class 
                        you wrote the post about... Wasn’t 
                        the word that the teacher used 
                        “ugly?” Is that a bad word now?

           Murmurs from the student body. 

                                 HARPER
                        Yes. I know. I know. Some of you 
                        may think I’m overreacting. But let 
                        me ask you this: if we don’t say 
                        the n-word or the c-word or the f-
                        word -- the one for the queer-
                        identified, “fuck” is okay -- then 
                        why do we say “ugly?” It’s because 
                        we don’t yet recognize its 
                        invisible connotations. Of 
                        demeaning women. Of insulting 
                        people with disabilities. Until 
                        just a few years ago, it used to be 
                        okay to say “tranny” or “retarded” 
                        but we realized that those words 
                        hurt certain groups of people, so 
                        we stopped. That’s progress. And I 
                        think we’re seeing that same 
                        progress here on campus today with 
                        this word.

           The murmurs die down.  All eyes on Harper.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        When you say ugly, the marginalized 
                        relive that pain and internalize 
                        that misogyny. I can prove it. 

           Harper turns to Ashley, the person of size.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ashley, you are ugly.

           Stunned, Ashley isn’t sure how to respond.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Now how did that feel? How did that 
                        feel to be called “ugly?” How did 
                        it feel to you in the audience when 
                        I called her that?

           Harper doesn’t give anyone a chance to answer.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ugly happens and we can’t ignore 
                        it. Ashley can’t ignore it. We 
                        cannot be visually impaired to the 
                        fact that ignorant people call 
                        wonderful people like Ashley 
                        “ugly.” Because to Ashley, “ugly” 
                        means “fat.” Doesn’t it, Ashley? 
                        People are out there calling you 
                        fat and ugly. And that is not how 
                        we should be speaking to each 
                        other.

           Harper puts her hand on Ashley’s shoulder, in support.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        From now on, when we hear the word 
                        ugly, we should think of Ashley. 
                        And her feelings.

           Harper turns back to the audience.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Just as white people must spend 
                        time and effort to identify white 
                        privilege, we must to do the same 
                        with beauty privilege. To ignore it 
                        is offensive. That is why I will 
                        continue to write and speak and 
                        fight until Wolcott is a free place 
                        for all cultures and identities!  
           A few members in the audience applaud. A question from deep 
           in the back of the auditorium. Harper shields her eyes but 
           can’t see the AUDIENCE MEMBER.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        If I said there is no god, would 
                        that be considered offensive?

                                 HARPER
                        Of course not. We are respectful of 
                        all faith traditions.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        In 1804, a student was expelled 
                        from Wolcott for publicly stating 
                        he was an atheist.

                                 HARPER
                        Can we turn the house lights up?

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        He was expelled for being 
                        offensive. So my question is: how 
                        do we decide what’s considered 
                        offensive?

           The house lights come up REVEALING SUSAN with the microphone.

                                 HARPER
                        Dr. Brodbeck. This is the professor 
                        who viciously attacked us with the 
                        u-word.

                                 SUSAN
                        The progress that allows atheists 
                        to express their views freely on 
                        campus comes from a society that 
                        pushed against what the status quo 
                        considered offensive: interracial 
                        relationships, women voting, even 
                        liberalism itself. That all came 
                        from free speech and an open 
                        dialogue.

           In the audience, PHONES start to come out and record. Tweets 
           start showing up on the screen behind them. “#WDITownhall 
           professor showed up!!!!” “Shits abt 2 go down #WDITownhall” 
           “catfight #WDITownhall” 

                                 HARPER
                        Let me ask you this: do you believe 
                        racism and sexism exist?
                                 SUSAN
                        Of course.

                                 HARPER
                        So there are groups that are 
                        oppressed.

                                 SUSAN
                        Obviously.

                                 HARPER
                        And is language one way to oppress 
                        a group? Like for instance, a 
                        racial slur?

                                 SUSAN
                        I see what--

                                 HARPER
                        So hypothetically, if we used less 
                        racially negative language, there 
                        would be less oppression in the 
                        world?

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes, but--

                                 HARPER
                        Then what you are asking for is a 
                        more oppressive society! Do you 
                        know who else allowed hate speech 
                        to fuel oppression? The--

                                              --Nazis!!

                        I think the voices of women, the 
                        LGBTQIA community, and minorities 
                        are more valuable than a 
                        misogynist’s, homophobe’s, or 
                        racist’s right to spout hatred!

           The audience applauds.

                                 SUSAN
                        I agree! We agree with each other, 
                        Harper! I’m just trying to get you 
                        to see the other side. That 
                        diversity includes a diversity of 
                        opinions too.
                                 HARPER
                        That’s something Republicans say! 
                        Are you a Republican?

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh god, no! Of course not. 

                                 HARPER
                        Because you sound like one!

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not letting me finish--

                                 HARPER
                        I will not be silenced! I will not 
                        be a victim!

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not the victim, you’re the 
                        bully! 

                                 HARPER
                        You blackmailed me!

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s a lie! You’re -- you’re 
                        lying! Just shut up! Shut up for 10 
                        seconds so I can explain how 
                        language--

           The audiences starts to boo Susan.

                                 HARPER
                        Don’t lecture me!

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m your teacher! Lecturing you is 
                        literally my job.

                                 HARPER
                        Then how come I’m the one teaching 
                        you tonight?

           The audience roars. Tweets on the screen behind the stage: 
           “Shut up, bitch! #WDITownhall” “prof border beck is a hater 
           #WDITownhall #bigot” “racist shit going down @ #WDITownhall”

                                 SUSAN
                        Censorship isn’t progressive, it's 
                        paternalistic!

                                 HARPER
                        You’re paternalistic! You’re the 
                        patriarchy!
                                 SUSAN
                        No, I’m not!

                                 HARPER
                        Yes, you are!

           No! Not-- no!
                                              Yes! Uh-huh! Yes!

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re asking to create a culture 
                        of fear and hostility--

                                 HARPER
                        You mean a culture that’s no longer  
                        racist, homophobic, or sexist!

           Major applause. “she’s teachin da teach #WDITownhall”

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s the problem! Who gets to 
                        decide what’s racist, homophobic, 
                        or sexist?!

                                 HARPER
                        I do! I decide what’s racist, 
                        homophobic, or sexist!

                                 SUSAN
                        So what? What does that even mean? 
                        Are you actually going tell people 
                        what they can and can’t say?

                                 HARPER
                        That’s a great idea! Yes! Somebody 
                        needs to! I will! We will! We’re 
                        going to come together as a 
                        community and define what’s hate 
                        speech! And we’re going to create a 
                        group to enforce those rules!

                                 SUSAN
                        Then how are you any better than 
                        the politicians who decided gay 
                        marriage was offensive?! 

           The crowd BOOS Susan, drowning her out.
                                 HARPER
                        Don’t listen to her! She’s just an 
                        old who doesn’t understand that the 
                        future of Wolcott is free from hate 
                        and so is the future of humankind.

           The crowd stands, CHEERING. Susan, realizing the battle is 
           lost, hands the microphone back to Olenna and storms out.

           EXT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - NIGHT

           On the porch, STUDENTS drink and lounge on worn-out wingback 
           chairs and a lumpy, faded pleather couch. Muted THUMPING BASS 
           comes from the party inside. Frances takes a drag of a vape 
           pen, hands it back to some NEO-HIPPIES and heads inside.

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Frances walks through a CROWD of drunk college kids as loud, 
           classic-to-them early 00’s hip-hop plays. 

           She stops in the kitchen to refill her drink with high proof, 
           low-quality alcohol. Harper barges through the crowd.

                                 HARPER
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DRINKING?!

                                 FRANCES
                        MALE TEARS YOU FUCKING BITCH!

           They hold their drinks high and scream.

                                 HARPER
                        We’re reclaiming bitch, you bitch!

                                 FRANCES
                        Third wave, biatch!

           They hug. Harper looks at the kitchen table cluttered with 
           liquor bottles. She grabs a bottle of Goldschläger.

                                 HARPER
                        Mmmmm, smells like cinnamon and 
                        it’s got fuckin’ gold flakes, you 
                        bitch!
                                 FRANCES
                        You bitch!

           Harper pours way too much Goldschläger into her solo cup.

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - LATER

           Harper and Frances, smashed, yell over the music at Liz.

                                 HARPER
                        ...but yeah, point is, I’m open to 
                        it. Totally. So I qualify, right? 

                                 FRANCES
                        But you’ve never actually been with 
                        a girl, so how do you know?

                                 HARPER
                        That doesn’t matter because I could 
                        be. I could be.

                                 LIZ
                        You bring up another great point. 
                        You’re right, I officially deem you 
                        bi.

           Harper’s too buzzed to register the sarcasm. She puts her 
           hand on Liz’s shoulder.

                                 HARPER
                        You are the most oppressed person I 
                        know. The most. But you have the 
                        best attitude.

                                 LIZ
                        Thanks?

           Harper gives Liz a sloppy hug. Frances joins in. 

           EXT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE BACK YARD - NIGHT

           A grass lawn worn down to mostly dirt from a generation of 
           college kids partying outside. A GUY fills his cup from a too-
           warm keg, resulting in mostly foam. Clumps of STUDENTS smoke.

           Shaun stands in the center of a cluster of his BLACK FRIENDS. 
           They’re in the middle of roasting ANDRE (male, 19, black, 
           bald head and mustache).

                                 SHAUN
                        This dumbass failed Orgo. And your 
                        stupid ass still wanna be a doctor.
                                 ANDRE
                        You sayin’ I’m dumb? Boy, you so 
                        dense yo’ head got a fucking moon 
                        orbiting it.

           The group screams and laughs.

                                 SHAUN
                        Yeah, but when I talk to you I hear 
                        a fucking echo comin’ out your ears 
                        you ol’ Steve Harvey head ass 
                        looking boy!

           The group reacts, running away laughing then running back. 
           Harper suddenly breaks into the circle.

                                 HARPER
                             (slurring)
                        What’s so funny? What’s so funny, 
                        tell me. What was it?

                                 SHAUN
                        We were just making fun of Andre.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s mean. Don’t be mean.

           She looks at Shaun’s friends.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Hey guys. What’s up? Hi. Hi. 

           She goes for fist bumps and tries to turn them into a more 
           complicated exchange. It doesn’t work.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        How’s the BSU? You miss me? Just 
                        kidding, I’m kidding. You guys 
                        gonna vote for Shaun for BSU 
                        president? You should! Do it! Just  
                        kidding. I’m not involved anymore. 
                        Nevermind. Nevermind. Hey! What did 
                        you guys think of my speech?

           Shaun’s friends look at each other. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It’s archived. It’s archived on our 
                        official YouTube channel if you 
                        missed it. It’s official. I posted 
                        it on Facebook too, you should 
                        watch it.
                                 ANDRE AND FRIENDS
                        Whatever/Maybe/I guess...

                                 SHAUN
                        No, but for real guys, it was kinda 
                        legit. The audience went crazy.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah? You liked it?

           Harper playfully walks her fingers up Shaun’s arm.

                                 SHAUN
                        Okay, you don’t have to do that.

                                 HARPER
                        I want to ask you something.

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        Something personal. 

            He glances to his friends, uncomfortable. They snicker.

                                 SHAUN
                        Maybe not here...

                                 ANDRE
                        Oh, I think you should definitely 
                        ask him here.

                                 HARPER
                        I wanted to ask you... 

           Harper leans in close.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        ...do you think if we face swap on 
                        Snapchat, it counts as blackface? 
                        I’d never do that. I’d never face 
                        swap with you.

                                 SHAUN
                        Hey Harper, can you--

                                 HARPER
                        Ugphp!

           Harper starts to throw up, but catches it in her mouth. Her 
           cheeks are full. Some of it leaks out.
                                 SHAUN
                        Oh shit! Are you gonna--

           Harper nods, and tries to swallow, but she coughs, spurting 
           out more vomit. Shaun jumps back.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Harper covers her mouth with her hands and runs off. All of 
           Shaun’s friends look at him.

                                 ANDRE
                        You smashing though, right?

                                 SHAUN
                        Yeah.

                                 ANDRE
                        Dope.

           Shaun and Andre fist bump in agreement.

           INT. HARPER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Harper stumbles into her room, red from drinking with spots 
           of puke on her clothes. She drops onto her bed and holds up 
           her phone for another compulsive check of Instagram. As she 
           slowly falls asleep, and the phone falls out of her hand and 
           hits her face.

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY

           Shaun lounges on a futon, scrolling through Twitter on his 
           phone. Liz sits at a table, eating leftover pizza while 
           attacking a problem set. In the corner, Frances works on an 
           art project, gluing dishwashing gloves to a mop.

                                 FRANCES
                        Does it make you regret being born 
                        a male yet?

           Shaun considers Frances’ creation.

                                 SHAUN
                        Not yet. But I think you’re close?

           CLUNK! The three look at each other -- what was that sound? 

           Their question is answered seconds later as Harper enters, 
           dragging a large cork board and wearing a backpack.
                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        Finished sleeping off your 
                        hangover?

                                 HARPER
                        I woke up like two hours ago. And 
                        I’ve been working on this.

           Harper lifts the board and puts it on a table against the 
           wall. Attached to the board are dozens of notecards, each one 
           with a curse word or racial epithet on it: “cunt,” “wetback,” 
           “oreo,” etc. They are organized into different categories, 
           including “identity,” “gender and sex,” “misc.”

                                 SHAUN
                        What the fuck is that?

                                 HARPER
                        A start. This is the beginning of 
                        Wolcott’s official language guide. 
                        I am finally defining hate speech.

           She opens her backpack and dumps out piles of notecards, some 
           of them land on Liz’s notebook. 

                                 LIZ
                        I think this is the sort of 
                        behavior we’re supposed to report 
                        to health services.

           Liz picks up a card, reading it:

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        “Disabled.” What is this?

                                 HARPER
                        Turn it over.

                                 LIZ
                             (reading)
                        “Person with disability.”

           Harper takes the card from Liz and pins it to the cork board 
           under “abelism.”

                                 HARPER
                        We need to put the person first. So 
                        we don’t say “disabled,” we say 
                        “Person with disability.” I’ve 
                        created this board to identify the 
                        hidden dehumanizing stereotypes 
                        that have crept into our everyday 
                        speech. First we identify them, 
                        then we ban them.
                                 FRANCES
                        Oh, let me try!

           Frances grabs a card.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        “Poor Person.”
                             (thinks)
                        Person of Poverty?
                             (flipping card over)
                        “Person of low economic status 
                        related to a person’s education, 
                        occupation, and income.” Fuck.  
                        That’s way better.

           Shaun holds up another card with “American” written on it.

                                 SHAUN
                        What’s wrong with “American?”

                                 HARPER
                        It fails to recognize the entire 
                        continent of South America. 
                        American refers to one country when 
                        it actually describes two 
                        continents therefore reinforcing 
                        the damaging idea of United States 
                        superiority. “U.S. citizen” is how 
                        we need to describe ourselves.

           Harper starts making piles of the cards on the table.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I was hoping you could help me.

                                 SHAUN
                        You want us to create and sort 
                        racist cards?

                                 HARPER
                        Exactly.

                                 FRANCES
                        I’m in.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m gonna pass. I have a problem 
                        set due tomorrow. Good luck.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s okay, Liz. I don’t want to 
                        burden you any more than society 
                        already has.
           Liz gathers her books. Harper holds up a pile.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        So Shaun, do you want to start with 
                        racist slurs?

                                 SHAUN.
                        I mean... I guess?

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAYS LATER

           The table is littered with empty cans of disgustingly cheap 
           beer. The cork board’s filled with notecards, and there are 
           several neat piles on the table under separate headings. 
           Harper, Frances, and Shaun sit at the table, sorting.

                                 FRANCES
                        I finished gendered language.

           She points to four piles, each one smaller than the last.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what trans and nonconforming 
                        people can say, here’s what gay and 
                        lesbian people can say, what women 
                        can say, and finally, what straight 
                        white males can say.

           She pushes forward a significantly smaller pile.

                                 HARPER
                        Great progress. I can’t believe 
                        we’re almost there.

                                 FRANCES
                        I’m gonna take a bong break. Wanna 
                        join?

                                 HARPER
                        Nah, we’ll finish up what’s left.

           Frances leaves. Harper looks over the loose notecards.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Looks like we still have sexual and 
                        religious language left.

                                 SHAUN
                        Let’s do sexual. For sure.

           Shaun and Harper slide over next to each other, arms nearly 
           touching. Harper picks up the first card.
                                 HARPER
                        “Suck a dick.” Homophobic and sex 
                        negative.

                                 SHAUN
                        How did “sucking a dick” become a 
                        bad thing? It’s great! It’s doing 
                        something good in the world. 
                        Sucking a dick is an inspirational 
                        act. It should be a compliment.

                                 HARPER
                        You’ve been so helpful with these 
                        cards, Shaun. You’re really sucking 
                        a dick tonight.

                                 SHAUN
                        Why, thank you, Harper! Thank you 
                        for recognizing how hard I’ve 
                        sucked dick for you.

           They both laugh. Shaun leans in to kiss Harper. Harper grabs 
           Shaun and throws him on the table, knocking over the 
           remaining piles. She straddles Shaun and they hook up on top 
           of graphic sexual terms and religious epithets.

           INT. SHAUN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           In bed, Shaun sleeps as Harper scrolls through her phone.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper checks for any new likes or shares on 
           the meeting announcements she’s posted on Twitter, Instagram 
           and Facebook. 

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Tomorrow. 4PM. Intercultural House.  
                        Because fighting injustice can’t 
                        wait.

           Harper sits up, waking Shaun. He pulls her back into bed.

                                 SHAUN
                        No. Where are you going?

                                 HARPER
                        I have to work on what I’m going to 
                        say at this meeting. I haven’t even 
                        come up with a name for the group.

                                 SHAUN
                        Stay in bed. 5 more minutes.
                                 HARPER
                        I can’t.

                                 SHAUN
                        30 seconds. 10 seconds. C’mere.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not gonna lay awake in bed 
                        while you sleep.

                                 SHAUN
                        I’m not sleeping. I wanna... talk.

                                 HARPER
                        Really? About what?

           Shaun cuddles up to Harper.

                                 SHAUN
                             (sleepily)
                        Uh... what, um... what were you 
                        like in high school?

                                 HARPER
                        I was... boring.

                                 SHAUN
                        No way.

                                 HARPER
                        I was. There was this one semester 
                        I was lab partners with Jackie 
                        Callon, who was one of the popular 
                        girls. It seemed like she liked me. 
                        I thought we were going to be 
                        friends. Once she even told me I 
                        should do plays because I was so 
                        dramatic. But she ignored me 
                        outside of class. And I couldn’t 
                        join drama club because after the 
                        divorce my mom had to work so I had 
                        to take the bus home right after 
                        school. I dunno, I never really 
                        made any close friends in high 
                        school. But since coming here... 
                        now I can join anything. And I feel 
                        like I’ve finally found friends who 
                        really care. Friends who actually 
                        listen to me.

           She turns to Shaun. He is asleep.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it.
           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY

           Harper, nicely dressed, carrying a binder, walks down the 
           stairs. When she reaches the bottom, she stops in disbelief. 
           The living room is crowded with STUDENTS, a few familiar 
           faces from Intercultural Alliance meetings but also many new 
           ones, including frat guy Church, from Brodbeck’s class. 
           Harper is visibly relieved that people actually showed up.

                                 HARPER
                        Hello and welcome, everyone. Thank 
                        you for choosing to be here. After 
                        the town hall, you finally became 
                        aware of something that’s been 
                        obvious to me of for a long time: 
                        Wolcott needs to take broader steps 
                        to combat all anti-black, 
                        transphobic, cissexist, 
                        misogynistic, ablest, homophobic, 
                        islamophobic, xenophobic, anti-
                        semitic, racist, oppressive and 
                        violent speech acts. That’s why 
                        I’ve called this meeting. So I can 
                        officially introduce you to my new 
                        group: The Student Alliance For 
                        Equal Speech or “SAFES.”

           She turns the binder around and holds it proudly above her 
           head. The cover has a photo of a smiling multi-racial group 
           of friends with “SAFES” written over them. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I have a plan to eradicate hate 
                        speech on campus. We will start by 
                        recognizing our own unconscious 
                        bias and privilege through 
                        perspective-taking exercises...

           EXT. QUAD - DAY

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        ...like Privilege Walks.

           A line of STUDENTS from SAFES stand shoulder-to-shoulder on 
           the grass. Harper stands to one side. It’s a PRIVILEGE WALK.

                                 HARPER
                        If being sexually active improves 
                        your reputation, take a step 
                        forward.

           All the MALES uniformly step forward. As the Privilege Walk 
           continues, we hear Harper from the SAFES meeting:
                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        A micro-aggression is like a paper 
                        cut. One paper cut won’t kill you. 
                        But there are students on our 
                        campus who are getting paper cut 
                        after paper cut, day after day. 
                        Internalizing discrimination, 
                        internalizing micro-invalidations, 
                        internalizing hate. This starts to 
                        affect their mental health.

                                 HARPER
                        If your ancestors came to the 
                        United States by force, take one 
                        step back.

           A few STUDENTS OF COLOR take a step back. Passing students 
           whisper and giggle to each other -- what is this thing?

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY

           Harper continues to lead the SAFES meeting.

                                 HARPER
                        If you get enough paper cuts, 
                        eventually you will bleed to death. 
                        The student body is bleeding out 
                        and we hold the tourniquet! This:

           She holds up a manual titled “The Wolcott University 
           Inclusive Language Guide. First Edition.”

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        The Wolcott University Inclusive 
                        Language Guide which we created 
                        here at the Intercultural House.
                        This is how we stop the bleeding!

           EXT. CAMPUS CENTER - DAY

           Harper and SAFES MEMBERS march into the campus center.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Once we are aware of our own 
                        privilege and biases, we use the 
                        Inclusive Language Guide to 
                        identify them in others.
           INT. CAMPUS CENTER - DAY

           MONTAGE: Harper leads a group of STUDENTS from the SAFES 
           meeting, pointing out various people in the campus center.

           -A girl wearing turquoise jewelry walks by.

                                 HARPER
                        Cultural appropriation of 
                        traditional Indigenous jewelry.

           -A bathroom sign of a stick figure in a dress.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Gender non-inclusive and gender 
                        normative clothing.

           -The group follows Harper up the stairs.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ableist. I bet you didn’t even 
                        notice we were walking up stairs.

           EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

           A FIGURE clad in a black hoodie puts up Shepard Fairey-style 
           posters of Harper’s face with the word “Warrior” underneath.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Now we are ready for the next step: 
                        peer implementation. We enforce the 
                        inclusive language guide so the 
                        student body will no longer be able 
                        to claim ignorance of hate speech. I 
                        call this: “radical inclusiveness.” 

           As the figure runs away, their hood falls, revealing Frances.

           INT. CAMPUS CENTER - DAY

           SAFES MEMBER 1 argues with a WHITE STONER wearing dreads and 
           a Bob Marley shirt.

                                 SAFES MEMBER 1
                        Dreadlocks are appropriative of 
                        Rastafarian culture!

                                 WHITE STONER
                        The Vikings had dreadlocks! 
                                 SAFES MEMBER 1
                        There’s a picture of Bob Marley on 
                        your shirt!

                                 WHITE STONER
                        What do you care, you’re fucking 
                        white!

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        This is how change begins.

           EXT. QUAD - DAY

           Back to the privilege walk. There’s now a noticeable gap 
           between groups of privileged and less privileged students. 
           Out in front is Church. 

                                 HARPER
                        Now take a look around, this is how 
                        much privilege society has granted 
                        you or taken away from you!

           Church looks behind him, stunned at the results. Harper 
           approaches.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’re in Delta Nu, right? I want 
                        to talk to you about your Halloween 
                        party...

           INT. ACADEMIC SPACE - DAY

           A sterile multipurpose room somewhere on campus. 

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        This will be a difficult fight. So 
                        we will need a true safe space for 
                        self-care. A place where we can go 
                        when we feel triggered. A “Trigger 
                        Room.”

           TIME LAPSE: SAFES STUDENTS bring in games and toys, like 
           Scrabble, Play-Doh, and coloring books. The room is 
           transformed into a kindergarten play area.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        I’ve already blocked out the 
                        History Department common room 24/7 
                        for the entire year.
           Susan enters, her face a mix of confusion and horror upon 
           seeing the room. She’s very much triggered. She steps over a 
           bean bag chair as she crosses to her office door.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Because the History Department is 
                        where we will start our final 
                        phase: academic implementation. 

           INT. EUROPEAN INTELLECTUALS 201 CLASSROOM - DAY

           Susan lectures class, including Harper.

                                 SUSAN
                        Before you choose your paper topic, 
                        I’d recommend brainstorming--

                                 HARPER
                        Dr. Brodbeck! I request that you 
                        refrain from using the word 
                        “brainstorming” as it is non-
                        inclusive.

                                 SUSAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 HARPER
                        Per the Inclusive Language Guide, 
                        “Brainstorming” has negative 
                        connotations to those who suffer 
                        from seizures. Persons-with-
                        disabilities, like persons-with-
                        epilepsy, object to that term. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you have epilepsy?

                                 HARPER
                        No.

                                 SUSAN
                        You know I’m not going stop saying 
                        “brainstorming,” Harper.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        We will meet resistance. So we 
                        escalate.

           INT. HISTORY DEPARTMENT CLASSROOM - DAY

           A HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures his STUDENTS.
                                 HISTORY PROFESSOR
                        After much westernization--

           A WHISTLE rings out from the class.

                                 HISTORY PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Who did that?

                                 SAFES MEMBER 2 
                        Your use of “westernization” as 
                        synonymous with “progress” 
                        disregards the contributions of all 
                        non-western cultures. I 
                        conscientiously object to this 
                        reinforcement of western 
                        superiority!

                                 HISTORY STUDENT
                        Shut up!

           SAFES Member 2 blows the whistle again. Students look 
           annoyed.

           INT. ANOTHER HISTORY DEPARTMENT CLASSROOM - DAY

           An older, white, HIPPIE PROFESSOR, wearing an African Dashiki 
           walks into class, and a WHISTLE immediately blows.

                                 HIPPIE PROFESSOR
                        I haven’t even said anything yet!

                                 SAFES MEMBER 3
                        The dashiki has a cultural history 
                        tied to Africa and is therefore 
                        appropriative.

                                 HIPPIE PROFESSOR 
                        I got this in Africa when I was 
                        volunteering. As a gift from an 
                        African--

           A WHISTLE immediately blows again as well as an AIRHORN.

                                 SAFES MEMBER 4
                        I object to your whitesplaining!

           The Hippie Professor looks defeated.

           MONTAGE OF QUICK CUTS:

           SAFES MEMBERS in different classes blowing whistles and 
           interrupting HISTORY PROFESSORS.
           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

           A line of Harper’s warrior posters. A SENIOR draws a dick on 
           Harper’s face, then walks away.

           INT. TRIGGER ROOM - DAY

           It’s a different SAFES meeting but Harper is giving the same 
           lecture to a crowded room of NEW MEMBERS. They listen in rapt 
           attention as Harper finishes. The movement has grown. 

                                 HARPER
                        SAFES is a team effort. Collective 
                        allyship. That’s how we’ll finally 
                        make Wolcott safe for everyone. 

           The New Members enthusiastically snap in approval.

           INT. HISTORY DEPARTMENT STAFF ROOM - DAY

           Dean Gordon has totally lost control of a rowdy staff 
           meeting. The HISTORY PROFESSORS are yelling at Susan.

                                 HISTORY PROFESSOR 
                        I’ve been confiscating whistles 
                        like I’m some sort of high school 
                        gym teacher!

                                 HIPPIE PROFESSOR
                        Last week, I said “standard 
                        deviation” and half the class 
                        yelled that “’standard’ is enforced 
                        normative language.”

                                 SUSAN
                        They’re interrupting me too! This 
                        is Harper’s fault, not mine!

                                 PROFESSOR 3/CRAIG
                        Picking a public fight at a town 
                        hall is downright stupid!

                                 SUSAN
                        So is sleeping with a student, 
                        Craig!

           The room goes silent.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear 
                        that.
                                 SUSAN
                        Sorry.

                                 CRAIG
                        Sorry.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        I think we all need to take a 
                        moment and remember that we are 
                        responsible for the emotional, 
                        physical, and academic well-being 
                        of our students.

                                 SUSAN
                        Then what are they responsible for?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        There is no Wolcott without the 
                        students’ tuition.

           A ROAR comes up from the Professors.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        Everyone, please! Please! I 
                        understand your concerns but if you 
                        could all just calm down-- 

                                 SUSAN
                        Us? It’s Harper and her goons who 
                        need to calm down! Why won’t the 
                        administration step in and set some 
                        boundaries for these students? 
                        They’re just a vocal minority!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        The administration can’t get 
                        involved in a situation where we 
                        could be perceived as curtailing 
                        our students’ right to protest. We 
                        believe an educator’s role is to 
                        use any dispute as an opportunity 
                        to reframe the discussion. For 
                        example, Professor Collins teaches 
                        law and she can’t use the word 
                        “violate” because a student 
                        complained. She’s making it work. 
                        She now says, “this ‘disobeys’ the 
                        statute, or ‘disregards’ the law.” 
                        She sees it as a fun little game.

                                 HISTORY PROFESSOR
                        If you don’t do anything there are 
                        going to huge consequences!
                                 SUSAN
                             (to the Dean)
                        See!

                                 HISTORY PROFESSOR
                        No, Susan, for you. Do you think 
                        this department will continue to 
                        support your bid for tenure if this 
                        continues?  You need to fix the 
                        mess you’ve made.

           Susan looks around helplessly, the Professors all nod in 
           agreement.

           INT. FACULTY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           Susan sits with WILLIAM, CHRISTOPHER, and JOHN, (male, 40’s,  
           white, cisgender) in tailored suits, the male Stepford Wives.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ah, Susan! Thank you so much for 
                        meeting with us. William.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Christopher.

                                 JOHN
                        John.

           Susan shakes each of their extended hands.

                                 SUSAN
                        I was a little surprised to get 
                        your e-mail. You really think you 
                        can help me?

                                 WILLIAM
                        We work for a non-profit 
                        organization that fights the 
                        restriction of free expression on 
                        college campuses. 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Freedom Restorers for Education and 
                        Expression. You can call it “FREE” 
                        for short.

                                 JOHN
                        We do.

           They all laugh. William hands Susan a business card.
                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        We have Google alerts set for terms 
                        like “triggered,” and “safe space” 
                        at basically every northeastern 
                        school. It led us to that article 
                        about you in Wolcott’s newspaper, 
                        and the YouTube video of you at the 
                        town hall. We watched and let me 
                        just say this: What you are doing 
                        is really brave.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So very, very brave.

                                 JOHN 
                             (nodding)
                        Brave.

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Susan, something is happening to 
                        our college campuses. Something 
                        dangerous. Something evil. 
                        Something unamerican. Kids all over 
                        the country are putting a muzzle on 
                        rational debate. Since when does 
                        offensiveness dictate academic 
                        material? This is America, not some 
                        censorship state under Sharia law.

                                 JOHN
                             (shaking his head)
                        Millennials.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How are we supposed to teach 
                        students if they find everything 
                        “triggering?” Are they exempt from 
                        class?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Should teachers just sit there in 
                        silence?

                                 JOHN
                        Total silence!

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s a nightmare. They’re 
                        interrupting my classes with 
                        whistles and airhorns and the 
                        administration won’t do anything!
                                 WILLIAM
                        These kids are in a toxic cult that 
                        alienates them from society by 
                        teaching them to accuse everyone 
                        else of racism. It’s 
                        unconscionable. 

                                 JOHN
                        Crisis.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Without academic freedom, how are 
                        colleges going to create the next 
                        generation of free market leaders?

           Susan’s smile fades.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s okay to be offended! Are we 
                        supposed to go to jail every time 
                        we say “Merry Christmas” instead of 
                        “Happy Holidays?”

                                 JOHN
                        Christian rights are under assault.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        It’s mob rule! We had to defend a 
                        college paper that lost funding 
                        because they published an op-ed 
                        critical of black culture.

                                 JOHN
                        Black unwed mothers are the biggest 
                        impediment to economic progress.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh, shit.

                                 WILLIAM
                        “Oh, shit” is right! People need to 
                        realize that institutional racism 
                        is over in this country.

                                 SUSAN
                        Okay, thank you for your time.

           Susan gets up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s wrong?
                                 SUSAN
                        What’s wrong? You’re motherfucking 
                        conservatives. This group isn’t 
                        about free speech, it’s about 
                        pushing your asshole agenda on 
                        young kids. Rich white men pay 
                        millions of dollars to create 
                        groups like this to freak out when 
                        someone says “undocumented” instead 
                        of “illegal.” You’re part of a 
                        system that’s leveraged bigots, 
                        anti-Semites, and idiots to vote 
                        for you so you can disenfranchise 
                        minorities, immigrants, and women. 
                        You use corrupt, underhanded 
                        methods to keep your limp, 
                        shriveled, aging dicks wrapped 
                        around positions of power. It’s 
                        sickening.

           William shrugs.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah, that’s basically it.

           They all laugh. Susan turns to leave.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        We can get you on O’Malley.

           She stops.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’re not dumb, Susan. And neither 
                        are you. We’re here because smart 
                        young people are overwhelmingly 
                        liberal and we need to introduce 
                        them to our values without actually 
                        calling them “conservative.” 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Like how white supremacists are now 
                        “alt-right.”

                                 JOHN
                        Branding.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Exactly. For us, “free speech” is a 
                        much more attractive term. And the 
                        thing is, for this one issue, this 
                        one time, we are on the same side. 
                        Peter O’Malley has the top rated 
                        news show on the air.
                                 SUSAN
                        He’s a loud bigot who makes his 
                        money scaring old people.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maybe, but you’ll get a national 
                        stage to make your point. And with 
                        the attention that follows... 
                        Wolcott’s administration will have 
                        to take your side.

                                 SUSAN
                        Jesus. I can’t believe I’m still 
                        listening to this.

           Susan heads to the door.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Be sure to fuck yourselves on your 
                        way out.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You have our number!

           The three smile at each other.

           INT. EUROPEAN INTELLECTUALS 201 CLASSROOM  - DAY

           Susan stares at Harper and her SAFES members, who are ready 
           to pounce with whistles and airhorns. Susan waits a beat, 
           then starts her lecture:

                                 SUSAN
                        Today we’ll be discussing Rousseau’s 
                        belief that civilization--

           A chorus of HIGH PITCHED WHISTLES. Susan closes her eyes and 
           takes a deep breath, but continues:

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        --has moved us away from our 
                        primitive-- 

           WHISTLES and AIRHORNS.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Fine. Today, we are going 
                        to be 100 percent compliant with 
                        the SAFES Inclusive Language Guide.

           In the class, Harper smiles.
                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Please put away all laptops, books, 
                        and phones as there may be 
                        offensive language on them. Now, to 
                        avoid any triggering terms, we are 
                        going to sit in silence for the 
                        rest of the class. There will be 
                        absolutely no talking as this class 
                        is a safe space. 

           The students look around, unsure. Harper’s smile fades.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Anyone who doesn’t follow these  
                        new rules gets a zero added to 
                        their cumulative grade.

           The students start to put away their things.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and there will be a quiz at the 
                        end of the class. So while you are 
                        sitting silently, think really hard 
                        about Rousseau.

           Susan sits at her desk and pulls out a book. The class looks 
           around in confusion. Harper inhales sharply.

           INT. READING WEEK COFFEE - DAY

           The bohemian campus coffee shop. Ratty chairs, mismatched 
           tables, free tampons in a cup at the register. A sign for the 
           shop is defaced to spell out “Weak Coffee.”

           Frances and Harper sit on a couch, studying art history.

                                 HARPER
                        ...we obviously all failed the 
                        quiz. Dr. Brodbeck is just doing 
                        this to get back at me. She’s so 
                        petty.

           Frances holds up a flash card with a painting on it.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Rothko.

                                 FRANCES
                        Correct.

                                 HARPER
                        And now the whole class is pissed 
                        at me when it’s clearly her fault.

                        But she is not going to stop me. We 
                        have to be resolute in the face of 
                        adversity. That’s the lesson the 
                        civil rights movement taught us.

           Shaun enters behind the couch.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        So?!

                                 SHAUN
                             (sadly)
                        Sorry, Harps... 

           Shaun hops over the couch.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        But you’re looking at the next BSU 
                        President!

           Frances squeals and Harper gives Shaun a hug.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s fucking awesome!

                                 SHAUN
                        And the best part is they’ve 
                        already approved my plan for 
                        another protest against the lack of 
                        faculty diversity. We’re going to 
                        form a human chain around Conwell 
                        Hall and only let in the professors 
                        of color. All three of them.

                                 FRANCES
                        That’s so fun!

                                 SHAUN
                        It gets even better: I want SAFES 
                        to participate with us.

           Harper’s expression turns sour.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, cool, but right now SAFES is 
                        really primarily focused on hate 
                        speech.

                                 SHAUN
                        So?
                                 HARPER
                        So I don’t think SAFES is going to 
                        be able to help with any other 
                        causes this semester. We don’t want 
                        to muddy our message.

                                 FRANCES
                        But we partnered with Delta Nu for 
                        their halloween party.

           Harper glares at Frances.

                                 SHAUN
                        Thing is, I kinda already promised 
                        them that you’d be onboard for it.

                                 HARPER
                        You promised the BSU before you 
                        even talked to me?

                                 SHAUN
                        Yeah, because I know you believe in 
                        the BSU and the need for a more 
                        diverse faculty as much as I do.

                                 HARPER
                        I did, then they kicked me out. And 
                        now they come crawling back to me, 
                        asking for my help?

                                 SHAUN
                        No. They’re not asking. I’m asking. 
                        It’s my idea, Harper. We can make a 
                        real difference together.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not making a real difference?

                                 FRANCES
                        You’re definitely making a real 
                        difference!

                                 HARPER
                        You’re using me at the expense of 
                        my mission because you think your 
                        cause is more important than mine.

                                 SHAUN
                        I don’t really want to compare 
                        them.

                                 HARPER
                        No, no, compare them. Compare them. 
                        I will.

                        Because what I see in SAFES is a 
                        campus wide movement to create a 
                        school that welcomes every single 
                        person and it is blowing up my 
                        social media. But all you can think 
                        about is yourself. 

                                 SHAUN
                        Or maybe I just figured my 
                        girlfriend would support me instead 
                        of trying to sabotage me.

                                 HARPER
                        Dude. Girlfriend? ...We’re just 
                        hanging out.

           Shaun stares at Harper, injured but hiding it. He gets up.

                                 SHAUN
                        Okay. Then I’m gonna go hang out 
                        somewhere else.

           He leaves without another word.

                                 HARPER
                        What the fuck? What was that?

                                 FRANCES
                        I know? Right? What’s his problem?

                                 HARPER
                        Whatever, let’s just get back to 
                        studying.

           Frances holds up another card with a picture of a painting on 
           it. Harper looks at the door, just in case Shaun re-enters.

                                 FRANCES
                        Harper?

           Harper turns back.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s... I don’t know, Rembrandt?

                                 FRANCES
                        Caravaggio.

                                 HARPER
                        This is stupid.

           She looks back at the doorway again, then back to Frances.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I mean, who cares about art history  
                        anyway? Paintings are just rich 
                        people exploiting the talent of the 
                        lower class. What did art ever do 
                        for anyone? Its never changed 
                        anything. I shouldn’t have to take 
                        this test. I need to drop this 
                        class. Fuck this.

           Harper slams her textbook shut.

           INT. SUSAN’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Susan pulls a couple blouses from the closet. Mark sits on 
           the bed, holding a glass of white wine and a bag of Skittles.

                                 SUSAN
                        Which one do you like?

           She holds up two blouses.

                                 MARK
                        Neither, because going on TV is a 
                        stupid idea.

                                 SUSAN
                             (dry)
                        It’s a smart idea. Know how I know? 
                        Because I am a very, very smart 
                        person.

           She grins. He pulls her close.

                                 MARK
                        You are. But maybe you should try 
                        talking to her.

                                 SUSAN
                        Great idea. Why didn’t I think of 
                        that?

           Susan trades Mark her blouses for the Skittles and wine. She 
           eats the candy, then immediately slams back the wine.

                                 MARK
                        I meant again. You’re going on a 
                        show you said was “the death of 
                        western discourse.”

           She holds up some notecards.
                                 SUSAN
                        I have my talking points. All I 
                        have to do is stick to these and I 
                        can control the conversation.
                             (reading a notecard)
                        “I believe academic freedom is the 
                        most important tool we have to 
                        expose young minds to people and 
                        perspectives different from their 
                        own.”

                                 MARK
                        So last week, a customer came in 
                        with a broken pool pump. Wasn’t 
                        under warranty, totally the 
                        customers fault. But when he 
                        complained, I said “yeah, I see 
                        your point. I can’t offer you a 
                        full refund but what I can do is 
                        offer you 20% off on a replacement 
                        part.” I lose 20%, but I’m keeping 
                        the customer. It’s a compromise. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m not going to compromise with 
                        some nineteen year old micro-
                        dictator trying to destroy my 
                        career.

                                 MARK
                        You have to be the mature one.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m plenty fucking mature. That’s 
                        why I’m not engaging but instead 
                        I’m going on TV to make my case 
                        that Harper’s completely and 
                        utterly wrong.

           Susan eats another handful of Skittles.

                        I’m a pariah in my own department 
                        when I’m inches away from tenure. 
                        People watch O’Malley. They care 
                        about it. And those people are 
                        going to contact Wolcott and let 
                        the administration know they are 
                        not happy with how the school is 
                        treating me.

                        much pressure, the board will have 
                        to give me tenure or risk the wrath 
                        of the stupidest parts of the 
                        American public, and more 
                        importantly, the alumni donors.

           Mark smiles weakly and gives Susan a kiss on the forehead as 
           she goes back to her notecards.

           EXT. DELTA NU FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           A BIG FRAT DUDE, dressed as an astronaut, bounces people from 
           the party going on inside. A group of females approach, 
           consisting of a SEXY ANGEL, SEXY NURSE, and SEXY CAT (all 
           white, cisgender).

                                 BIG FRAT DUDE
                        Sorry. I can’t let you in.

                                 SEXY ANGEL
                        What? Why not? Isn’t this “Scary 
                        Bros and Halloween Hos?”

                                 BIG FRAT DUDE
                        Not anymore. This halloween party 
                        was thrown in conjunction with 
                        SAFES and according to their 
                        guidelines, you’re dressed as a 
                        religious figure which is 
                        culturally insensitive. This one--

           Big Frat Dude consults a SAFES printout then points to the 
           Sexy Nurse.

                                 BIG FRAT DUDE (CONT’D)
                        --reinforces a gender stereotype, 
                        not to mention being completely 
                        medically inaccurate. I’m pre-med.

                                 SEXY CAT
                        What about me? I’m a cat.

                                 BIG FRAT DUDE
                        You mean you’re dressed as a 
                        literal interpretation of a crude 
                        slang for the female anatomy? Not 
                        to mention your sexualization and 
                        objectification of yourself. I 
                        don’t think so.

           The girls walk away, disappointed.
                                 SEXY CAT
                        Wait. Why is that guy allowed to 
                        tell us how we can and can’t dress?

           INT. DELTA NU FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s a packed house for the Halloween party. Everyone is 
           dressed in a SAFES-approved costumes: mostly astronauts, some 
           generic zombies, and one Waldo.

           Harper, as Rosie the Riveter, stares at her phone while 
           Church, as Maverick from Top Gun, drunkenly rambles to her. 

           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper texts Shaun. It’s all blue bubbles 
           from Harper and not a single gray reply from Shaun.

                       HARPER (V.O.)
                                                         CHURCH
           Hey.
           Hello?
           Sup
           where r u?
           WTF 
                                              You know, ever since that 
                                              privilege walk, I’ve been 
                                              thinking. I like, totally 
                                              understand racism and sexism 
                                              now, it’s, like, awesome not 
                                              to be racist anymore. So I 
                                              want to thank you for that.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re welcome.

                                 CHURCH
                        And I’ve been trying really hard to 
                        check my privilege tonight.

           BACK ON PHONE: Three dots pop up -- Shaun’s typing a 
           response. They disappear. No text comes. She types:

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Cool ignore me whatever

           Harper finally faces Church.

                                 HARPER
                        Let’s get drunk.

           Harper grabs Church’s arm and leads him into the crowd.
           INT. O’MALLEY STUDIO - NIGHT

           Susan sits alone at a large U-shaped table. She swivels in 
           her chair a little as the CREW scurries about. A SOUND GUY 
           finishes fixing Susan’s mic. Susan nervously looks around. 

           Peter O’Malley heaves himself into the seat across from Susan 
           without acknowledging her. He studies his notes.

                                 SUSAN
                        Never been on TV before.

           O’Malley doesn’t look up.

                                 PRODUCER
                        And we’re on in 5... 4... 3...

                                 O’MALLEY
                             (to Susan)
                        Nice legs.

           Susan stares at O’Malley in disbelief.

                                 PRODUCER

           The crew goes silent as the camera lights turn red.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        And in our “Breaking Amuse” 
                        segment, Wolcott University’s whiny 
                        students and cowardly 
                        administration are allowing 
                        students to turn classrooms into 
                        “safe spaces” meaning no 
                        “offensive” words. Here with us 
                        leading the charge against this 
                        nonsense is Dr. Susan Brodbeck. 
                        Welcome to the show.

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you for having me.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        You are a stalwart defender of free 
                        speech, taking on the “safe spaces” 
                        ruining our universities.

                                 SUSAN
                        I think a free and open exchange of 
                        ideas on our campuses is of 
                        paramount importance, yes. 
                                 O’MALLEY
                        In my day, no one questioned the 
                        professors. Now it’s impossible for 
                        you to actually teach because of 
                        this student group at Wolcott, 
                        “SAFES.” Tell me about the girl 
                        who’s been terrorizing you. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m not here to single anyone out.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Then I’ll do it for you. Here’s a 
                        clip from a “Town Hall” with the 
                        ringleader of Wolcott’s intolerant 
                        left, Harper Penzig.

           INSERT: A clip from The Diversity and Inclusion Town Hall 
           fills the studio monitors.

                                 SUSAN 
                        But who gets to decide what’s 
                        racist, homophobic, or sexist?!

                                 HARPER 
                        I do! I decide what’s racist, 
                        homophobic, or sexist!

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Are crybullies like her liberal 
                        cowards or speech Nazis?

                                 SUSAN
                        I believe academic freedom is the 
                        most important tool we have to 
                        expose young minds to people and 
                        perspectives different from their 
                        own. It is a crucial weapon in the 
                        fight against the institutional and 
                        unconscious racism--

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Woah, woah, woah! We are talking 
                        about the destruction of the First 
                        Amendment here. These students are 
                        terrorists. We shouldn’t have to 
                        watch our every word!
                                 SUSAN
                        Shutting down the opposition, 
                        muzzling critics, making it 
                        impossible for dissenting voices  
                        to be heard is the beginning of the 
                        end. 

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Yes! Let’s be okay with calling 
                        people what they are: gays, 
                        illegals, violent Muslim 
                        extremists. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I mean -- let’s not--

                                 O’MALLEY
                        These liberal “millennials” bully a 
                        million white males everyday and no 
                        one says anything to stop them but 
                        as soon as one gay kid hangs 
                        himself they all lose their minds. 
                        That’s not fair to the majority in 
                        this country.

                                 SUSAN
                        I thought -- I’m trying to talk 
                        about the ability of teachers to 
                        work in a college environment.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        This Harper Penzig is everything 
                        that’s wrong with America today: 
                        Yes or no?

                                 SUSAN
                        I can’t answer that question.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Of course you can answer the 
                        question! It’s a yes or no 
                        question! It couldn’t be more 
                        simple. She’s calling you a sexist 
                        and a racist. Are you a sexist and 
                        a racist?

                                 SUSAN
                        No, absolutely not! 

                                 O’MALLEY
                        But that’s what she’s calling you! 
                        And she accused you of blackmail!

                        Her vicious lies are going to 
                        follow you for the rest of your 
                        career. 

                                 SUSAN
                        So let me just-- 

                                 O’MALLEY
                        No one will hire you now that she’s 
                        branded you a racist, crooked 
                        college professor! 

                                 SUSAN
                        Peter-- Peter--

                                 O’MALLEY
                        She is trying to shut you up by 
                        taking a crap on your reputation 
                        and you can’t answer the question?

           Susan doesn’t respond quickly enough for O’Malley.

                        These students and administrators 
                        are spineless scum. Someone needs 
                        to stand up and defend the First 
                        Amendment rights of every citizen 
                        in this great nation. Here is your 
                        chance to clear your name and let 
                        everyone know you’re not a racist! 
                        Right now, what do you want to say 
                        to Harper Penzig and the gutless 
                        administration that’s hanging you 
                        out to dry? You have the last word. 
                        Go.

                                 SUSAN
                        Uh-- Um-- I think... 

           The bright lights shine on Susan. It’s quiet. Everything 
           moves slowly. She stares out, searching. Then, reality rushes 
           back in and:

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Our society is becoming more 
                        divided, not less, because of 
                        people like Harper Penzig. Liberals 
                        used to represent the working class 
                        but today middle America doesn’t 
                        trust us because of fanatics like 
                        her. She wants to force you to 
                        listen to her. Listen to her 
                        bastardization of progressive 
                        ideals by silencing everyone else.

                        Do you know what the first priority 
                        of every totalitarian state is? 
                        Silence the opposition. I’m the 
                        opposition. Silencing my voice is 
                        an act of bias. I’m going to file a 
                        bias incident against Harper Penzig 
                        for censoring my views in my own 
                        classroom! Using her power to 
                        silence critics like me is an even 
                        more biased act than hate speech! 
                        And it spells the end of democracy!

                        There you have it! This political 
                        correctness is the disease 
                        corrupting our nation. A rash. A 
                        festering blister. And the reason 
                        our society is going down the 
                        tubes. Thanks for being here,

                        the O’Malley Show free from 
                        identity politics. Coming up next, 
                        are Mexican gangs using small towns 
                        in the US to move drugs to Canada? 
                        You should be scared.

           A black light, a Scarface poster, and a mini-fridge with a 
           keg-tap. Harper’s buzzed; Church’s smashed. 
           They fall into his bed, kissing, with Harper on top. She 
           doesn’t notice her phone clatter to the ground. Harper unzips 
           his costume.

                                 CHURCH
                        Wait, I don’t know-- I’m just, I’m 
                        drunk. I’m pretty drunk.

                                 HARPER
                        We can stop whenever you want. But 
                        you just look so hot in that flight 
                        suit.

           Harper slides her hands across his body.

                                 CHURCH
                        Really? D’ya think so? I’m fat.

                                 HARPER
                        No, those are your muscles. Your 
                        muscles are sooo big. 

                                 CHURCH
                        I don’t know.

                                 HARPER
                        Come on, let me see, baby.

           Church demurs, and flexes his bicep.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You look fucking hot.

                                 CHURCH
                        You think so? I don’t go to the gym 
                        enough. I’m gross... person.

                                 HARPER
                        C’mon, let me see.

           Church shimmies out of the top of his jumpsuit. They make out 
           until Church slowly stops, eyes closed. Passed out.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Church?

           Harper sighs, annoyed. She rolls him against the wall so 
           there’s enough room for her to sleep next to him.

           UNDER THE BED: Harper’s phone lights up...
           INT. CHURCH’S ROOM - MORNING

           Harper, tired and hungover, fixes the bandana of her Rosie 
           the Riveter costume. Church is still fast asleep.

           Harper searches for her phone and finds it under the bed. It 
           BUZZES. Harper ignores it and sneaks out.

           EXT. DELTA NU FRAT HOUSE - MORNING

           As Harper walks out she bumps into a SORORITY GIRL who’s 
           barefoot, holding her heels. They look at each other with 
           disgust. Harper pulls out her phone.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper wipes away a 5% low battery warning. 

           Then: HUNDREDS OF MESSAGES JAM THE NOTIFICATION BAR. DING! 
           DING! DING! BLOOP! DING!

                                 HARPER
                        What the fuck?

           Harper starts power-walking across campus. She pulls up 
           Twitter and sees a slew of negative tweets.

                                 @MAUZILLA (V.O.)

           BUZZ! DING! BLOOP! She’s still receiving notifications.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck! What is 
                        happening?

                             (screaming at her phone)
                        I have woken up!!

           Harper, not looking where she’s going, charges into a bush. 
           She drops her phone. PHONE OFF SCREEN.
           A MALE STUDENT eyes Harper. She’s covered in leaves and dirt.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What!

                                 MALE STUDENT
                             (snickering)
                        Walk of shame?

                                 HARPER
                        Fucking-- go judge someone else, 
                        sexist!

           Harper climbs into the bushes to retrieve her phone. She 
           looks at it again and starts running.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: BUZZ! BUZZ! The notifications are nonstop. 
           Harper goes to Facebook and sees new posts on her wall.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND (V.O.)

           Harper switches to text messages as she enters:

           INT. CAMPUS CENTER  - CONTINUOUS

           Harper reads the text messages in reverse chronological 
           order. They start frantic, then become more and more calm as 
           they are from earlier in the morning.

           Harper clicks on Frances’ messages.

                                 FRANCES (V.O.)
                        ARE YOU OKAYYYY?!?!

                        Dis is cute  

           A gif of a baby panda falling over. Harper clicks on Shaun’s 
           messages. There’s only one:

                                 SHAUN (V.O.)
                        This is fucked.

                        WHAT IS GOING ON!?

           Harper quickly clicks over to a text from Liz.

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                        Um... http://watcher.com/wolcott

           Harper clicks on the link and sees the article about her on a 
           clickbait website: “College Campuses Just Got Worse Because 
           Of This Girl.” Harper plays the embedded YouTube video:

                        I do! I decide what’s racist--

           Harper clicks through to YouTube: 56,742 views. Harper tries 
           to scroll but her phone freezes. A zero battery icon appears 
           and it shuts down. 

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

           PHONE OFF SCREEN. Harper runs towards TWO STUDENTS in the 
           Campus Center Cafe.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Hey! Do you have a charger? I 
                        need a phone charger!

                                 CAFE STUDENT 1
                        Nice costume.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck you!
                             (to the other student)
                        Do you have a charger? It’s 
                        literally life or death for me!

                                 CAFE STUDENT 2
                        Jesus. Sure, go ahead, take it.

           Cafe Student 2 hands Harper a black cord. Harper runs over to 
           a wall outlet, plugs in the charger and--

                                 HARPER
                        THIS IS FOR A FUCKING ANDROID!

           Harper violently throws the cord back at Cafe Student 2. It 
           lands very short. 

           Harper accosts passing STUDENTS, like she’s asking for a fix:
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        iPhone charger? I need an iPhone 
                        charger, now! Please!

           A GRAD STUDENT (male, Pakistani) hands her a cord, confused.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Thank god!

           Harper plugs it into the wall and charges her phone.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Come on! Come on!

           PHONE ON SCREEN: It boots up again. Harper goes to her text 
           messages and texts Frances.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Bring me a iPhone charger! Campus 
                        center! ASAP!!!!

           The Grad Student holds out his hand for the charger back.

           INT. SUSAN’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Mark makes breakfast. Susan’s on her laptop at the table. 

           LAPTOP ON SCREEN: Susan scrolls through Google images, the 
           search bar says “Harper Penzig.”

           There are a lot of memes of Harper’s screaming face with the 
           words “I do! I decide what’s racist!” 

           Susan clicks a photo of Harper with the caption “When my 
           girlfriend and I go out to eat.” At the bottom, it reads “I 
           do! I decide what’s for dinner!” Susan giggles.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 SUSAN
                        Nothing.

           Susan scrolls to the next image. It’s the same photo of 
           Harper but photoshopped with a Hitler mustache and a Nazi 
           uniform. Susan stifles another laugh. Mark looks over at her 
           laptop. He shakes his head disapprovingly.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MARK
                        She’s a kid, Susan. I know they 
                        look like they’re adults but 
                        they’re just kids. 

                                 SUSAN
                        She’s ruining my life and I can’t 
                        enjoy a harmless cartoon of her?

                                 MARK
                        You blamed her for destroying 
                        America on TV. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I was defending myself! 

           Mark shoves his phone in Susan’s face.

                                 MARK
                        You think those pictures are funny, 
                        but do you think these are funny?

           Mark takes the phone. PHONE OFF SCREEN.

                                 MARK
                        You don’t. You can’t. And 
                        definitely not from my account. 

           INT. CAMPUS CENTER - MORNING

           Harper, still tethered by a power cord, types furiously on 
           her phone as the Grad Student waits nearby.

                                 @SASSAFRATZER (V.O.)
                        @harpspen i hope ur dog gets hit by

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        @sassafratzer i don’t have a dog, 
                        so that’s an empty threat!

           SWISH. Tweet sent.

           Frances enters, holding a charger, and hurries to Harper.

                                 FRANCES
                        Sorry it took me forever, I was 
                        super high.

                                 HARPER
                        Give me that!
           She grabs the charger and thrusts it directly into the Grad 
           Student’s hands.

                                 GRAD STUDENT
                        This one isn’t mine.

                                 HARPER

                        Hey, so I don’t know how to tell 
                        you this but--

                                 HARPER
                        I already know! Brodbeck put a clip 
                        of me on the O’Malley show and it 
                        went viral and now a bunch of 
                        inbred idiots are trolling me 
                        nonstop!

                                 FRANCES
                        It’s not just that. Someone took a 
                        picture of you here. It’s on the 
                        front page of Reddit.

           Frances hands Harper her phone.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: A blurry picture of Harper texting in the 
           Campus Center. The title reads “#HasHarperWokenUpYet has been 
           on her phone since I got here.”

                                 HARPER
                             (to the Campus Center)
                        Who the fuck took a picture of me?! 
                        You are violating my privacy! If I 
                        could leave this wall I’d fucking 
                        find you!

                                 FRANCES
                        Shhh! Someone else might record you 
                        and post that!
                                 HARPER
                        Frances, there are people who are 
                        making fun of me! On the internet! 
                        If I don’t tell these assholes 
                        right from wrong, it’ll just 
                        reinforce their bad behavior and 
                        it’ll never end!

           Off Frances’ worried look.

           INT. DINING HALL - DAY

           Harper sits at a table engrossed in her phone, her untouched 
           food sits in front of her.

                        Good to know you haven’t changed 
                        since high school. Complex societal 
                        inequalities are clearly too 
                        challenging for you to even attempt 
                        to understand as is evidenced by 
                        this video. You’re a assbag.

           INT. OUTSIDE PRESIDENT TILTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           The phone is ringing off the hook. President Tilton’s 
           ASSISTANT struggles to answer all the incoming calls.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        President Tilton’s office, please

                        I can ask him about getting your 
                        name taken off our building--

           INT. PRESIDENT TILTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dean Gordon sits cowed in the stately office of PRESIDENT 
           TILTON (male, 50’s, white, cisgender, silverfox). Tilton 
           stands, towering over the Dean. He’s frighteningly calm.

                                 PRESIDENT TILTON
                        Do you know what my job is? My job 
                        is to travel the country and golf 
                        with very rich Wolcott Alums, then 
                        take their money. Do you know what 
                        your job is? 

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Dean of Faculty?

                                 PRESIDENT TILTON
                        No. To allow me to do my job. Right 
                        now, those rich alumni are calling 
                        me, very, very upset, which means 
                        you are very, very bad at your job. 
                        I want this story gone before it 
                        becomes a Jonathan Chait essay.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        The student in question is facing a 
                        bias incident conduct hearing next 
                        month--

                                 PRESIDENT TILTON
                        Make it tomorrow. And Saul? If you 
                        don’t contain this, I’ll expect 
                        your resignation.

           Dean Gordon nods frantically.

           INT. INTERCULTURAL HOUSE - DAY 

           SAFES MEMBERS are packed into the living room and flood out 
           onto the porch. Harper’s on a chair clutching the elephant, 
           trying to lead the raucous meeting.

                                 SHAUN
                        People are laughing at us!

                                 HARPER
                        Everyone -- I have the elephant!
                                 SHAUN
                        Harper, this video makes us look 
                        real fucking bad.

                                 HARPER
                        You don’t have the elephant!

                                 SHAUN
                        You screaming that “you decide 
                        what’s racist” just hit over three 
                        million views!

                                 HARPER
                        YOU DON’T HAVE THE FUCKING ELE-- 
                        wait, did you say three million? 
                        Holy shit. Are you counting re-
                        uploads and Facebook? 

                                 SHAUN
                        We’re getting slammed by think 
                        piece after think piece. It’s all 
                        over Medium. I mean, I expected 
                        something from The National Review 
                        and The Atlantic, but Huffpo and 
                        Slate and Jezebel and Vox? Fucking 
                        Vox is after us?

           The crowd chatters in agreement.

                                 HARPER
                        Don’t -- don’t listen to him. He 
                        has a personal vendetta against me 
                        because I don’t want to be his 
                        girlfriend!

                                 SHAUN
                        This has nothing to do with that!

                                 HARPER
                        And he tried to leverage our sexual 
                        relationship for favors from SAFES. 
                        Now he’s here interrupting my 
                        meeting because he’s jealous I 
                        spent last night at Delta Nu.

                                 SHAUN
                             (hurt)
                        You did?

           Rumblings from the SAFES Members.
                                 HARPER
                        Yes, I did. And if you value judge 
                        my choices, you are slut shaming. I 
                        am not afraid of my sexuality.

                                 SHAUN
                        We need distance SAFES from this 
                        video. And from her.

                                 HARPER
                        I created SAFES! Without me, none 
                        of this exists!

                                 SHAUN
                        Jesus. Fucking stop already. I’m so 
                        sick of the show.

                                 HARPER
                        The show?

                                 SHAUN
                        The Harper show.

                                 HARPER
                        The fuck?

                                 SHAUN
                        It’s a performance. The protests, 
                        SAFES, it’s just a performance you 
                        put on to make yourself look cool.

                                 HARPER
                        What could possibly make you think 
                        I spend any of my time trying to 
                        look cool?

                                 SHAUN
                        Are you. Fucking. Serious. 

                                 HARPER
                        I am fucking serious! I am!

                                 SHAUN
                        You just call yourself an ally--

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck you!

                        --the only reason you were hooking 
                        up with me is because I’m black.

                             (breaking down)
                        That’s not true! I’m not! It’s not 
                        a show! I-- I-- I don’t know what 
                        I’m supposed to do! If I do nothing 
                        I’m complicit in a racist system 
                        and if I do too much you’re saying 
                        I’m performing so there’s no way to 
                        help and now you’re mad at me for 
                        trying and I can't ask you what to 
                        do because it’s not your job to 
                        explain it to me and I remember 
                        when I tried to help you kicked me 
                        out of the BSU so I found a 
                        different way to help but now 
                        you’re saying that’s not help and 
                        you’re mad and they’re all mad and 
                        I’m crying now because any little 
                        thing I do gets the whole campus in 
                        an uproar and I’m getting mean 
                        comments but also hundreds of likes 
                        and you’re standing here yelling at 
                        me for doing it wrong and it’s 
                        paralyzing!

           Stunned silence.

                                 SHAUN
                        So what?

           Shaun turns to the group.

                        To save SAFES we have to take it in 
                        another direction. All those in 
                        favor of Harper stepping down as 
                        leader say “inclusion.”

                                 CROWD
                             (resounding, unanimous)
                        Inclusion!
                                 HARPER
                        No! You can’t do that! I started 
                        this group! It’s mine!

           Frances moves to comfort Harper.

                                 FRANCES
                        SAFES is based on radical 
                        inclusion. It’s everyone’s. 

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck you. They know I’m the best 
                        leader for this group. Follow me -- 
                        the only thing we have to lose is 
                        our chains!
                             (chanting)
                        SAFES, united, will never be 
                        divided!

           She canvases the room, trying to get people to join in. 
           Nobody responds. Harper looks to Frances, who is frozen. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                             (whispering, desperate)
                        Frances?
                             (loud)
                        SAFES, united--

           Frances doesn’t move. Harper tries to rouse the crowd.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        --will never be divided! 
                             (whispers)
                        Follow me out.
                             (loud)
                        SAFES, united--
                             (whispers)
                        C’mon follow me. Start chanting.

           Harper marches right out the side door into BRIGHT LIGHT...

           EXT. SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

                                 HARPER
                        --will never be divided!

           Harper’s all alone in a small yard covered in the brown grass 
           of late fall. The door thuds shut behind her.
           INT. TRIGGER ROOM - DAY

           Harper turns off the fluorescent lights and drops into a bean 
           bag chair. She lays motionless a moment, then pulls out her 
           phone and masochistically checks her feeds.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper opens an e-mail from a Wolcott 
           administrative account.

                                 DEAN GORDON (V.O.)
                        Dear Ms. Penzig, This e-mail is to 
                        inform you that we have rescheduled 
                        the bias incident review for your 
                        non-peer dispute to tomorrow at 3PM 
                        in Carmichael Hall. Please be 
                        advised that possible outcomes of 
                        disciplinary action include loss of 
                        scholarship and housing as well as  
                        dismissal from Wolcott. We advise 
                        you bring--

           Harper hears CHATTING and LAUGHTER coming down the hallway 
           towards the Trigger Room. It’s distinctly Susan’s voice. 
           Harper bolts out the back door as Susan and some HISTORY 
           PROFESSORS enter.

                                 SUSAN
                        Think we can burn all this crap yet?

           She gestures to a shelf of toys as the Professors laugh.

           INT. FRANCES’ ROOM - EVENING

           Frances doodles on a sketch pad when she hears a KNOCK at the 
           door. She opens it and a crying Harper blows past her.

                                 HARPER
                        Everyone hates me!

           Harper grabs Frances, sobs into her shirt. Frances hugs her.

                                 FRANCES
                        Hey, hey, it’s okay. I’m sorry 
                        about SAFES. I don’t know why I 
                        didn’t say anything in the meeting. 
                        I froze. I should’ve defended you.

           Harper looks up to Frances with her tear-stained face.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah.
                                 FRANCES
                        Do you... want to... stay in here 
                        tonight?

                                 HARPER
                        Really?  That’d be okay?

                                 FRANCES
                        Sure, it’s okay. Yes. Totally.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks.

           Frances takes Harper’s hands in hers. As Harper looks up, 
           Frances suddenly rams her face into Harper’s for a kiss. It 
           holds a beat: Frances, eyes closed, sensual. Harper, nose 
           smushed, grossed out. They part.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Frances?

                                 FRANCES
                        You’ve been so open about being bi, 
                        and how you knew, even though 
                        you’ve never been with a girl... 
                        that’s how I feel too.

           Beat.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 FRANCES
                        You’re bi... right?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes. I am! I’m totally bi! But it 
                        sucks that someone I thought was my 
                        friend only wants to sexually 
                        objectify me!

                                 FRANCES
                        No. I-- I really like you. I’ve 
                        always liked you. I was hoping we 
                        could be more than just friends.

                                 HARPER
                        So were you ever even really my 
                        friend or did you just want to hook 
                        up with me this whole time? You’re 
                        as bad as a straight white male.

           Frances starts to cry.
                                 FRANCES
                        Don’t say that. Please don’t say 
                        that. 

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe you’d try to take 
                        advantage of me when I’m at my most 
                        vulnerable!

                                 FRANCES
                        I’m sorry, please don’t tell 
                        anyone. Please don’t. I--

           Frances reaches for Harper’s hand. Harper yanks it away and 
           runs out of the room, leaving Frances sobbing.

           EXT. FRAT ROW - NIGHT

           Harper walks through a squad of SCANTILY-CLAD GIRLS headed to 
           the frats. On the Delta Nu porch, she spots Church making out 
           with a BLONDE in a mini-skirt. Harper puts up the hood on her 
           oversized sweatshirt and keeps walking.

           INT. TARGET - NIGHT

           Smooth jazz. White tile and fluorescent-lit aisles. Harper 
           silently pushes a cart when she sees some COLLEGE KIDS. She 
           heads in the opposite direction.

           INT. TARGET DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           SERIES OF SCENES:

           -Harper wears a faux-designer dress and tucks the tag behind 
           a strap. She takes a picture in the mirror with her phone.

           -PHONE ON SCREEN: Harper crops the picture tightly then 
           darkens the edges with a vignette.

           -Harper takes out a red solo cup, fills it with iced tea and 
           tosses in a ping-pong ball. She takes a picture.

           -Harper jumps and tosses her hair as her PHONE FLASH GOES 
           OFF. Her phone is wedged behind the clothing hook. 

           -Harper looks at the jumping picture. Not good enough. She 
           repeats the process until she is satisfied.

           -PHONE ON SCREEN: She creates a photo collage of the mirror 
           selfie, the beer pong cup, and the dancing pose. It looks 
           like she’s out partying. She posts it to Instagram:

           EXT. TARGET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           An expansive, nearly empty lot. The store is at half light in 
           the background. It’s clearly after closing. Harper sits alone 
           on the curb, scrolling on her phone. 

           A call comes in: DAD. She picks up. 

                                 HARPER
                        Hello?
                             (listens)
                        I’m good. Not much. 
                             (listens)
                        Yeah, there have been protests. How 
                        do you know about them?
                             (listens)
                        On TV? What show?
                             (listens)
                        There are a lot of comedy shows, 
                        Dad. How do you not know--
                             (listens)
                        No, it’s fine. Don’t ask Linda. Did 
                        they mention any students’ names? 
                             (listens)
                        I was just curious. Sure, I’ll stay 
                        away from the protests.
                             (listens)
                        Before you go, Mom wanted me to ask 
                        you about Christmas.
                             (listens)
                        No. It’s not Thanksgiving this 
                        year, you have me for Christmas.
                             (listens)
                        All the way through New Years. 
                        Sorry. 
                             (listens)
                        Okay. Text me if you remember which 
                        show it was. Thanks. Bye, Dad.

           Call end. Harper looks like she might cry.

           PHONE ON SCREEN: She googles “Wolcott late night talk show 
           joke.” The results show thumbnails of videos from various 
           talk shows. She’s everywhere. She navigates to Instagram. Her 
           photo now has 7.5k likes and 114 comments. She smiles. 
           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

           Harper walks along campus totally engrossed in her phone. As 
           students stare at her, she walks past a wall of defaced and 
           ripped “Warrior” posters.

                                 DEAN GORDON (PRE-LAP)
                        The Bias Conduct Review Board will 
                        now consider the bias incident 
                        filed by Dr. Brodbeck against Ms. 
                        Penzig.

           INT. LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dean Gordon, flanked by ADMINISTRATORS, presides over an ad-
           hoc trial. Susan and Harper sit across from each other in 
           silence. Shaun, Frances, Liz, and some other STUDENTS and 
           PROFESSORS sit in the back.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Dr. Brodbeck, your filing of a bias 
                        incident has accused Ms. Penzig of 
                        silencing your views based on your 
                        political beliefs. Is this 
                        accurate? 

                                 SUSAN
                        It is.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        The conduct board and myself have 
                        reviewed the relevant documents and 
                        e-mails you submitted to support 
                        your claim, as well as the 
                        testimonies from your colleagues 
                        which clearly corroborate your 
                        version of events. Ms. Penzig, do 
                        you wish to have any of your 
                        witnesses testify on your behalf?

           Harper looks back to Liz, Frances, and Shaun. They scowl. 
           Shaun crosses his arms.

                                 HARPER
                        No.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Then would you like to say anything 
                        in your defense?

                                 HARPER
                        No. Not in my defense. But I would 
                        like to say something.
           Harper stands.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        When I came to Wolcott I was... 
                        lonely. I didn’t know anyone. I 
                        didn’t even know myself. I wanted a 
                        community. I needed a community. So 
                        I built one for myself and for 
                        marginalized people. Because, in a 
                        very small way, I understand what 
                        it’s like to be an outcast.

           Liz looks over to Frances and Shaun.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Last night, I realized that my 
                        experience here was shaped by the 
                        people who supported me. They’ve 
                        changed my life and I hope in some 
                        small way I’ve changed theirs. And 
                        I want to thank them. All of this 
                        was all worth it if I’ve made even 
                        one person feel a little more 
                        included. 

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Well, Ms. Penzig, as you are not 
                        actually refuting this claim, the 
                        board has no choice but to impose 
                        the heaviest sanctions on you as is 
                        consistent with our code of 
                        conduct. The board hereby revokes 
                        the recognition of The Student 
                        Alliance For Equal Speech, as well 
                        as dismisses Ms. Penzig from 
                        Wolcott, which will be a permanent 
                        separation of the student from the 
                        university without an opportunity 
                        to re-enroll in the future.

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry, I-- can I say something?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Yes?

                                 LIZ
                        So I’m not really into taking a 
                        stand or anything. But Harper... 
                        she went out of her way to defend 
                        me. Even when it was annoying, or 
                        she went too far, or I didn’t want 
                        it or whatever, she still tried to 
                        help me.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I think you should reconsider and 
                        allow her to at least stay at 
                        Wolcott.

                                 FRANCES
                             (blurting out)
                        Me too!

           Frances stands up next to Liz.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        Harper’s had a major positive 
                        impact on my life too. I’m sorry I 
                        violated your trust, but you helped 
                        me realize something about myself 
                        and gave me the courage to finally 
                        say: I’m gay. 

           Frances looks around for approval, people are unfazed.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        So, uh, yeah, I also think she 
                        deserves to stay at Wolcott.

           Liz and Frances look at Shaun.

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

           Frances nudges him.

                                 SHAUN (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Harper, you just... frustrate 
                        me. But you get shit done. And if 
                        I’m being honest, I admire that. I 
                        get it. You needed us to be your 
                        community. And I think we needed 
                        you. I needed you. I’m... sorry. 
                        We’re proud to be your community.

                                 HARPER
                        Uh, I wasn’t talking about you. 
                        You’re not my community. 

                                 SHAUN
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        This is my community.

           Harper holds up her phone.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Why would I care about you? You 
                        betrayed me. You stole SAFES from 
                        me, something it took me nearly a 
                        semester to build! Last night, I 
                        realized this is where I get love 
                        and support and some very 
                        inspirational memes about feminism. 
                        My real friends are here-- 

           She shakes her phone in front of Shaun.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        --the rest of you, and the rest of 
                        Wolcott are assholes. Except for 
                        you Liz, I can’t imagine the 
                        challenges you’ve faced.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Okay then. Please know that none of 
                        this changes the board’s decision 
                        and due to the sensitive nature of 
                        the situation we are going to 
                        expedite the process. These 
                        sanctions will go into effect 
                        immediately.

           Susan smiles.

                                 HARPER
                        Before we leave this room, I have 
                        some demands.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Demands?

                                 HARPER
                        I demand to be put back in charge 
                        of SAFES and I demand my language 
                        guide be put into effect in every 
                        academic department across the 
                        entire school.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        I’m sorry, I believe you’ve 
                        misunderstood this situation.

                                 HARPER
                        Have I? Let me explain “this 
                        situation” to you. Last night my 
                        dad called me. And my dad never 
                        calls me.
                                 DEAN GORDON
                        What does that--

                                 HARPER
                        He called me because he heard a 
                        joke about Wolcott on TV. That 
                        means my movement reached him. Do 
                        you know how many followers I have 
                        since I went viral? 956 thousand. 
                        Everything I type is seen by 956 
                        thousand people. 

           Harper looks at Susan, then to the Dean.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve written an actual letter, 
                        stating that I intend to sue the 
                        university, Dr. Brodbeck and even 
                        you, Dean Gordon, for creating an 
                        unsafe, discriminatory, and hostile 
                        learning environment. 

                                 SUSAN
                        On what grounds?

                                 HARPER
                        You don’t get it. It doesn’t 
                        matter. Have you seen all the bad 
                        press Wolcott has gotten recently? 

           Harper holds up her phone.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        If I click this button, my letter 
                        about suing Wolcott goes out to all 
                        my followers. My side of the story 
                        will get retweeted and reblogged 
                        and podcasted by the people who 
                        love me and put on cable news and 
                        YouTube vlogs and late night comedy 
                        shows by the people who hate me. It 
                        doesn’t matter if they believe me, 
                        it’ll be everywhere. One touch and 
                        Wolcott’s name becomes synonymous 
                        with discrimination.

           She holds her thumb over her phone like a finger on a 
           detonator. 

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Oh, dear god.
                                 HARPER
                        Make me the head of SAFES or I’ll 
                        send this school’s reputation to 
                        hell.

                                 SUSAN
                        You can’t be taking this seriously. 
                        She’s just a narcissist with a 
                        Twitter account!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Hold on. Everyone just hold on 
                        here. Let’s not do anything rash.

           Harper’s finger hovers over the phone.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        Is it alright if I let all the 
                        students and professors go?

                                 HARPER
                        Dr. Brodbeck stays.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Yes, of course. I’d like to speak 
                        with both of you actually. Everyone 
                        else out! Now! Quickly!

           The students and professors casually exit. The Dean turns 
           back to Susan and Harper.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        I believe there is a way out of 
                        this. Susan, if you sign a 
                        retraction--

           Dean Gordon shuffles through his papers for a form.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        --we can make this all go away.

                                 SUSAN
                        There’s no way I’m signing that.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        What if I personally see to it  
                        that you get tenure this year and 
                        that Ms. Penzig is removed from 
                        your class. Everybody wins.

                                 SUSAN
                        But then she gets away with this! 
                        And gets to keep destroying our 
                        school!
                                 DEAN GORDON
                        No, her letter would destroy our 
                        school! Wolcott’s on the verge of 
                        becoming the butt of every joke in 
                        the Northeastern College 
                        Conference. We could drop five 
                        spots in the rankings and start 
                        losing students to Hamilton or 
                        Colby or, god-forbid, Tufts! Think 
                        of the alumni giving! Please, 
                        Susan.

           Beat.

                                 SUSAN
                             (to Dean)
                        Fuck you.
                             (to Harper)
                        And definitely fuck you.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck you too! I’m gonna do it!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Wait! Ms. Penzig. We can make a 
                        deal! What if-- what if-- what if 
                        you put the phone down and I’ll 
                        tell you what I’m prepared to 
                        offer.

                                 HARPER
                        It better be good.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        You can keep your status at the 
                        university and we will reinstate 
                        you as the head of SAFES--

                                 SUSAN
                        You can’t do that!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        --and you can oversee the 
                        incorporation of the SAFES language 
                        guide into the student handbook. 

                                 HARPER
                        Done. I accept.

           Harper lowers the phone and clicks it to sleep.
                                 DEAN GORDON
                        But you have to agree to disable 
                        and delete all your social media 
                        accounts.

                                 HARPER
                        You mean I have to stop posting?

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        No, you’d have to actually delete 
                        everything. No Twitter, Facebook, 
                        Instagram or whatever else out 
                        there exists or will exist during 
                        the time you are at Wolcott. You 
                        have to stay quiet.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s... that’s an infringement on 
                        my free speech!

                                 SUSAN
                        Ha!

           Harper wakes her phone again, threateningly.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        You get the chance to make all the 
                        important changes you want at our 
                        school and they’ll stay that way as 
                        long as you stay offline. Now, 
                        please, give me the phone.

           Harper considers. Susan looks back and forth between them.

                                 SUSAN
                        I never thought I’d see the day 
                        that you compromised your ideals.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not compromising.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re handing all your power over 
                        to the school. To a white man!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Susan, please! Harper...

           The Dean steps toward Harper.

                                 HARPER
                        Don’t take another step or I swear, 
                        I’ll do it! 
                                 DEAN GORDON
                        No, don’t do it!

                                 SUSAN
                        Go ahead and do it!

                                 HARPER
                        I will! I’ll do it!

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        No!

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes! Post the letter! So I’ll never 
                        have to see your smug face again. 
                        Then I can go back to educating 
                        young minds while you and the 
                        internet debate whether or not a 
                        white guy can eat a burrito!

                                 HARPER
                        Does he understand the culture that 
                        created the burrito?

                                 SUSAN
                        The culture?

                                 HARPER
                        And the context.

                                 SUSAN
                        The context of a burrito!

                                 HARPER
                        And the intent!

                                 SUSAN
                        The intent is he’s fucking hungry--

                                 HARPER
                        So a hungry white guy can do 
                        whatever he wants?

                                 SUSAN
                        He sure as fuck can eat whatever he 
                        fucking wants you fucking stupid 
                        moron!

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not stupid! I’ve got a message! 
                        A message of fucking compassion 
                        that I’ll share with millions 
                        starting right fucking now!
           Harper hits the post button on her phone. DWOOP.

                                 SUSAN
                        Good! You just ruined your life!

                                 HARPER
                        No! I just saved thousands of 
                        lives! Because my example--

           DEAN GORDON BURSTS INTO TEARS.

                                 DEAN GORDON
                        Why are you doing this to me?!

           They turn to look at the Dean.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been Dean of Faculty for 30 
                        years. 30 years! And I have never 
                        ever met a student so disrespectful 
                        or a professor so obstinate! I 
                        liked this job! And now, because of 
                        you two, Tilton is going to fire 
                        me! So-- so--

           Something behind his eyes clicks over from pathetic to 
           pissed. He’s reached the point of no return.

                                 DEAN GORDON (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! That’s right! I 
                        said fuck! Because you both deserve 
                        it! You deserve fuck! You’re 
                        expelled and you’re fired and I 
                        want you off this fucking campus by 
                        tomorrow and fuck you, you fucking, 
                        you fucking-- jerks!

           EXT. WOLCOTT CAMPUS - MORNING

           The yellow fall sun rises through naked tree branches and 
           brick buildings. Life goes on as normal. A STUDENT tapes a 
           Passovertones acapella flyer over the remains of a warrior 
           poster.

           INT. FREEDOM RESTORERS’ OFFICES - DAY

           A sleek, modern office. Through glass walls, we see Susan 
           talking to William, Christopher, and John from FREE. We can’t 
           hear them.
           William calmly slides a folded piece of paper across the 
           table. Susan looks at it and is visibly shocked. William puts 
           out his hand. Susan isn’t sure if she should shake it.

           INT. SUSAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Susan paces around the living room as Mark watches.

                                 SUSAN
                        --and academia no longer supports 
                        free speech, which is what their 
                        organization is all about. That’s 
                        the most important thing.

                                 MARK
                        But they’re conservatives.

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s triple my old salary. We could 
                        buy a house.

                                 MARK
                        You’ll be the spokesperson for a 
                        bunch of conservatives.

                                 SUSAN
                        Their political views don’t matter 
                        because for this one issue, this 
                        one time, we’re on the same side. 
                             (unconvincing)
                        It’ll be fine. I’ll be fine.

           EXT. CONWELL HALL - DAY

           Shaun, Olenna, the BSU, and SAFES MEMBERS form a human chain 
           around the building. WHITE PROFESSORS are stuck outside.

           As Harper walks past, she catches Shaun’s eye. Then she gives 
           him the finger. He ignores her.

           INT. TRIGGER ROOM - DAY

           Harper enters, looking for something. She finds it underneath 
           the table: the bullhorn. She tucks it in her bag.

           She picks up a coloring book and some crayons. She sits at 
           the table and draws. She finds it relaxing.

           Susan, carrying a cardboard box of her things, walks out of 
           her office and sees Harper sitting there, scribbling in a 
           coloring book. They both stop. They say nothing. 
           Susan plops her cardboard box down on the table. Her stress 
           ball jangles loose and rolls over to Harper.

           Susan looks at the ball, then at Harper. Harper rolls the 
           ball back to Susan, maybe little too hard. Susan takes this 
           as a challenge and sends the ball back at Harper even faster.

           Harper picks it up and lobs it to Susan. It harmlessly 
           bounces off her palm. Harper smiles, satisfied--

           THEN SUSAN WHIPS the ball towards Harper’s head. It barely 
           misses her and knocks a Connect Four to the ground, checkers 
           spilling everywhere.

           Harper grabs the nearest throwable object, a mound of Play-
           Doh, and chucks it at Susan. It misses and sticks to the wall 
           next to her.

           Harper and Susan circle the center table.

           Susan closes the distance and nails Harper with a beanbag 
           chair. Susan swings again and Harper grabs a hold of it, 
           creating an impromptu tug of war.

                                 HARPER
                        There’s no violence allowed in a 
                        safe space!

           The beanbag catches a sharp edge of the table and rips open, 
           spilling Styrofoam pellets all over the floor. 

           It quickly turns into an all out brawl as Harper and Susan 
           fight using the various toys around the room. They destroy 
           everything in the process.

           -Harper throws Monopoly houses at Susan.

           -Susan mushes Play-Doh into Harper’s hair.

           -Harper shoots a Nerf bow and arrow gun at Susan’s face.

           -Susan whips Harper with a blanket.

           -Harper attempts to strangle Susan with a Slinky.

           -Susan jams a bunch of crayons into Harper’s mouth.

           -Harper uses a doll to shield herself from a Koosh ball. 

           -They crash into the photocopier, paper and ink go flying.

           -Susan pushes Harper down and knocks over a bookshelf. 
                                 SUSAN
                        Enough! Enough, okay? I’m sick of 
                        this!

           Susan stops pursuing Harper.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        All of this bullshit only happened 
                        because of you. My entire career 
                        ruined, and not because you’re 
                        being marginalized by society, but 
                        because you are so goddamn selfish, 
                        Harper. You only care about 
                        yourself. That’s why you have no 
                        real friends and that’s why 
                        everyone hates you.

           Harper looks down. She’s on the verge of throwing up, or 
           sobbing hysterically or -- she looks up. Quietly:

                                 HARPER
                        You’re a hundred times more selfish 
                        than me. A thousand.  

           Susan is stunned -- what?

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        All I wanted was two seconds. For 
                        people to stop and think for two 
                        seconds before saying something that 
                        could hurt someone else. Those two 
                        seconds of thought could change 
                        everything -- for you, for the troll 
                        on the internet, for the classmate 
                        who dismisses me as a crazy bitch. 
                        Discrimination isn’t obvious 
                        anymore. It’s not even conscious. 
                        But it’s there, deep in our minds -- 
                        in all of us. And each time you 
                        don’t take those two seconds to 
                        recognize that, you tell the world 
                        that your time is too precious, 
                        that you are too important to give 
                        even the slightest consideration to 
                        others. Think about the things 
                        you’ve called me. “Immature.” 
                        “Stupid.” Empty insults. But they 
                        make you feel good. Make you feel 
                        like you’ve won. Like you’re better 
                        than me. All I’m trying to do is 
                        make the world a little less shitty 
                        and a little more fair. A place 
                        where we treat each other just a 
                        little bit better.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        We’re not here because of me... 
                        we’re here because you couldn’t 
                        take those two seconds. You’re a 
                        million times worse than I am.

           Beat. Susan reflects.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m... sorry.

           Harper nods.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry this got so ugly.

                          HARPER
                                                     SUSAN (CONT'D)
           FUCKING BITCH!
                                              YOU CUNT!

           Harper and Susan run at each other and just before they 
           collide we SMASH TO TITLE:
