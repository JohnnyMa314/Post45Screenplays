           EXT. LAKE EYRE - DAY

           A sweeping aerial shot - a giant dried-up lake bed. 

           Small feathered corpses litter the ground like piles of trash. 
           Pelicans, huddled in small, mud-encrusted mounds. 

           It is desolate. A wasteland. 

           A biblical, apocalyptic event has occurred here. 

           As the camera sweeps in from above, towards the centre of the lake 
           bed, we see small white dots - lying unmoving on the ground. 

           A DISSONANT HARMONY rises in the background, voices wavering in 
           and out, in an eerie combination of hymn and tribal chant. 

           The sound rises higher, and higher-

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. BILLABONG - AFTERNOON

           Two young girls dip their feet at the edge of a billabong. 

           They are conservatively dressed in plain, white robes - sleeves 
           down to their wrists, hems down to their ankles. Their hair is 
           long, and braided in thick plaits down their back. 

           SELAH and TAMAR. Sisters. 

           Selah is the glowing picture of health - on the cusp of  
           teenagehood, but reluctant to let childhood go. Her hair is 
           blonde, almost shockingly so, white even in the dappled shade of 
           the billabong. 

           TAMAR is thinner, and has darker colouring, with long black hair, 
           and a BIRTHMARK that runs like wine down one side of her face. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Do you think something lives in there? 

                                 SELAH
                        Under the water? 

           They both consider the billabong - it looks peaceful, and still. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think so. What could be down 
                        there? 
                                 TAMAR
                        Anything. A giant snake. Or a monster - 
                        to pull us in! 

           Tamar pokes Selah in the side - tickling her, threatening to push 
           her in. They splash each other, the water flying up in tiny 
           droplets. 

           There’s a DISTANT SOUND - hollow and eerie. They both pause. 

                                 SELAH
                        Must be dinner time.

           She gets up and holds out her hand to Tamar. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                             (mock-formally)
                        Shall we go, sister-mine?  

           Tamar smiles at her, and grabs her hand. 

                                 TAMAR
                             (mock-formally)
                        Why thank you, my sister-mine. I 
                        believe we shall. 

           They brush off their robes and tidy their hair - making themselves 
           presentable, before setting off through the bush. Still holding 
           hands. 

           INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

           The middle of an animated family dinner.

           The atmosphere is relaxed - there is the loud hum of chatter, and 
           occasional laughter.

           The firelight is warm, and the food is a bounty of simple, country 
           fare - meats, potatoes, bread. 

           At one end of the table, women talk and gossip, passing food and 
           bread between them.

           At the other end, the children sit, slightly rowdy but well-
           behaved, playing and laughing together as they eat. We see Selah 
           and Tamar whispering together - thick as thieves.

           But - 

           There are only women. And girl children. 

           These are the WIVES and the SISTERS.
           They are all dressed in white robes, and their long hair is up in 
           beautiful braids - ridiculously complex loops and shapes, each 
           braid unique to each woman or girl. (NB: Unless otherwise noted, 
           their hair is always braided.) 

           At the head of the table, sits SHEPHERD.

           Father, leader, prophet - all rolled into one. Father of every 
           sister, husband to every wife. 

           But -

           He’s not what you’d expect. Not a stern patriarch, presiding over 
           a table of quiet women. He’s charming; laughing with one of the 
           wives, rubbing the arm of another. Smiling constantly.  

           His hair is shoulder-length, and unbound, and his beard is thick 
           and well-trimmed. Around his neck, we see a glimpse of RAM HORNS 
           ON A NECKLACE, although they are mostly covered by his robes. 

           At the Shepherd’s right hand sits MARIA. She is older, with only a 
           touch of grey to her hair, maybe 35 - although her face is lined 
           from being outside in the sun.

                                 MARIA
                        But is it the right time for the flock 
                        to grow, my Shepherd? If they won't 
                        trade with us, the grain stores won't 
                        last us till -

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Lambs are always a blessing, my clever 
                        wife. Never a burden. We will find a 
                        way-

           One of the youngest sisters comes up behind the Shepherd’s chair 
           as he talks to Maria. He turns and grabs her, tickling her as she 
           squeals in agonized delight.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (teasing)
                        Got you, you cheeky thing!

           He tickles the child in his arms again, and then releases her, 
           turning to Maria again. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (jokingly)
                        I think dinner is over - if I am being 
                        viciously attacked at my own table!

           Maria claps her hands, and the older children rise to clear the 
           plates away, Selah and Tamar amongst them.
           The Shepherd gets up, and the mood changes. 

           There is silence, and unexpectedly, tension/anticipation is 
           suddenly in the air-

           Without saying a word, he walks along the table, touching two of 
           the wives - stroking his fingers gently over their uniquely 
           braided hair.

           One of them is ADRIEL. She looks like she is about 7 months along, 
           but carrying it well - she looks fertile, and glowing. She’s 19 at 
           most.  

           Adriel and the other wife leave behind the Shepherd, as the 
           sisters continue to clear the plates. The chosen wives don’t seem 
           sad - if anything, there is a spring in their step. 

           At the table, the other wives exchange glances - judging his 
           choices, their expressions a mix of jealousy and relief. 

           At the door, red dust swirls from outside, as the Shepherd and his 
           two chosen wives leave. 

           INT. SLEEPING HALL - MORNING

           Selah, Tamar and another one of the sisters, sleep in a single 
           bed, a warm tangle of arms and legs. The other sisters sleep in 
           single beds beside them. Their hair is braided even in sleep. 

           In the same room, the Wives sleep too - sleeping double to a bed 
           as well.

           There’s the same EERIE HOLLOW SOUND - this time it is just 
           outside.

           The wives and sisters begin to stir. 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - DAY

           The chaos of a busy farm in the morning. 

           Selah ducks and weaves amongst it all, her robe flapping as she 
           runs. Red dust whirling around her feet. 

           We follow her amongst the buildings, seeing the layout of the 
           farm. The weavery, the barns, the dairy, the nursery. Made of 
           packed earth, they are basic but functional - their roofs made of 
           thatch, with simple wooden doors. The walls of each building are a 
           riot of primary colors; bright happy murals and bucolic landscapes 
           of green, lush fields. The Shepherd features prominently in many 
           of them, a golden staff in his hands. 
           Ewes are led from one barn to another, their coats thick and 
           unshorn - while elsewhere, other ewes are milked, bleating 
           pathetically. 

           Some wives are sorting wool, while others are in an open shed, 
           weaving and singing as they work. They’re weaving intricate, 
           colourful rugs, and it is complicated, skilled work. 

           They sing a CHEERFUL HYMN, in a major key - the harmonies clean 
           and beautiful. The sounds twist and writhe, mirroring their hands 
           as they weave. Maria leads the harmonies. 

                                 WIVES
                        Over the mountains,
                        (Over the mountains,)
                        Over the sea,
                        (Over the sea,)
                        I have no fear,
                        (I have no fear,)
                        For he watches me.
                        (For he watches me.)
                        And if I fall,
                        (And if I fall,)
                        I fall gladly,
                        (I fall gladly,)
                        For I know,
                        (For I know,)
                        The Shepherd is with me.
                        (The Shepherd is with me.)

           As Selah runs through it all, the song follows her - dogging her 
           steps.

           And everywhere, all around her - are signs of The Flock.

           Hanging murals sway in the breeze on porches, made of intricately 
           woven wool and bone. 

           Ewe’s skulls adorn the top of posts, carved until they are more 
           work of art than skull.

           Selah reaches the centre of the courtyard, and pauses in the chaos 
           - slowing down. Distracted in spite of herself. 

           In the middle of the courtyard, under a specially made shelter, 
           sits THE RAM. Next to him is the giant CALLING HORN, polished and 
           gleaming in the  sun.

           (NB: This is the source of the eerie sound that wakes them in the 
           morning, and summons them to worship.)

           The ram is tough-looking, and in its prime. His horns curl back 
           and then come back around, sticking out from his head proudly. 
           This is a magnificent beast - wild, and a bit mad.
           Attached to his thick wool are braids of leather and bits of 
           braided hair. Tokens of worship. 

           Selah observes him through the fence. Awe in her eyes.

           This is it. This is their most sacred. A living vessel.  

           And then - the ram locks eyes with her. Its long lashes framing 
           impossibly deep, dark eyes.

           Selah creeps closer, holding the ram’s stare for a long moment.

           As she holds it, a challenge passes between them -

           - the stare is held that beat too long, and the ram stamps once at 
           the ground, readying itself to charge -

           There’s the SLAM of a door nearby, and Selah looks away. 

           Adriel, the pregnant wife, has emerged from one of the buildings - 
           the Shepherd’s Hut. The outside has been decorated and painted to 
           within an inch of its life with stylised images of the Shepherd.

           Adriel’s hair is long and scandalously unbound down her back, her 
           feet bare. She has the small secret smile of a woman who has just 
           had very satisfying sex. 

           Selah watches as Adriel picks her way across the courtyard towards 
           the sleeping hall, and then turns back to the ram -

           - but the moment has gone. The ram is now lying down in the 
           corner, its back to her. 

           Selah looks for a moment longer, disappointed. Then, runs on. 

           INT. MILKING BARN - MORNING

           The inside of the barn is cool and still - especially after the 
           heat of the day.

           Selah sits at the side, churning sheep’s milk by hand. EVELYN sits 
           beside her. She is about the same age as Selah, with a petulant 
           mouth, and brown hair. 

           Evelyn churns her butter just a touch faster than Selah does - 
           looking over occasionally to compare their progress.

           Selah stops, and looks around, and dips her finger into the churn, 
           tasting the butter with her tongue, closing her eyes with obvious 
           pleasure. Almost sensual. Evelyn sees. 
                                 EVELYN
                             (whispering)
                        What are you doing?

                                 SELAH
                             (whispering as well)
                        I’m just checking it! 

                                 EVELYN
                        You are not! I’ll tell one of the 
                        wives!

           Selah’s face screws up - and she pinches Evelyn sharply on the 
           thigh.

                                 SELAH
                        Sheep-shit you will! Must you be a 
                        tattle in every way? 

           Evelyn gasps in outrage, and they scuffle, knocking over one of 
           the churns of milk in the process. 

           One of the wives, HANNAH, notices, and strides over.

                                 HANNAH
                        Sisters! What is this? 

           The girls stop fighting immediately, both looking ashamed.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Selah? Have you anything to say? 

           Selah looks to Evelyn, and shakes her head. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Evelyn? 

           There’s a pause - and then Evelyn snitches. 

                                 EVELYN
                        She tasted the butter, even though it 
                        was only meant to be for dinner, and 
                        then when I said-

           Hannah holds up her hands. Selah glares daggers at Evelyn.

                                 SELAH
                             (under her breath to Evelyn)
                        Tattle-tale. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What was that Selah? 
                                 SELAH
                             (sullenly)
                        Nothing. 

           Hannah looks at her for a moment - this half-child, half-teen, in 
           the throes of adolescent rage. 

                                 HANNAH
                        If you sisters cannot work together, as 
                        sisters should, then I guess I will 
                        have to separate you.

           Selah and Evelyn both look happy at that - no love lost here. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Selah - can you go to the kitchen 
                        please, and get the scraps. And go to 
                        the hut. 

           Selah looks at her in disbelief. 

                                 SELAH
                        But, that’s not fair -

           Hannah continues as if Selah hasn’t spoken. 

                                 HANNAH
                        And Evelyn - seeing as Selah will be 
                        going to the hut. You will just have to 
                        churn the rest of the butter on your 
                        own. 

                                 EVELYN
                             (primly)
                        I would be happy to. 

           Selah sneers at her. What a suck up.

           Hannah folds her arms, and Selah sighs and gets up - her footsteps 
           dragging reluctantly. 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - DAY

           Selah makes her way through the shade of the buildings, until she 
           reaches a track, winding its way through the bush. She carries a 
           small bowl, covered with a plate. 

           EXT. BUSHLAND - DAY

           Selah picks her way along the track, her eyes on the path. 
           Around her is a riot of colours and nature - native birds call to 
           each other in the trees. A bush paradise.

           Along the path, there are small signs of The Flock - small 
           tokens of wool and bone in the trees. Marking the way. 

           EXT. SHACK - DAY

           Selah approaches a small, run-down shack - alone in the middle of 
           a small clearing.

           It is in sharp contrast to the state of the farm’s buildings - it 
           looks shabby, and ill-kept. 

           Selah goes to the door, and knocks. 

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Come in. 

           Selah goes inside. 

           INT. SHACK - DAY

           After the bright sunlight outside, the hut is miserable and dark. 
           There’s just a small table, and a few thin mats on the ground. 

           There are two wives inside. One is lying down, with a red binding 
           around her lower abdomen, the bright red contrasting with her 
           white robes - ELOISE. 

           The other wife crouches in the shadows behind the door.

                                 SARAH
                        So, you bring us our daily bread, 
                        Selah? 

           The wife, SARAH, comes into the light, and Selah looks away - 
           uncomfortable. 

           Sarah’s skin is a ruin - untreated skin cancers mottle the side of 
           one cheek, and descend down her neck.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Put it down on the table. 

           Selah puts the bowl down, and Sarah lifts up the plate. It is 
           slops - worse than you’d feed to animals. Sarah lowers the plate 
           again.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                             (sarcastically)
                        The offerings from the Shepherd are 
                        rich today I see.

           Selah looks stung. 

                                 SELAH
                        You know the food is meant as penance. 
                        To help purify. 
                             (pointing at wife on the 
                              ground)
                        Does not the Shepherd tell us, that 
                        this is a just monthly punishment, for 
                        woman’s pride? 

           Sarah laughs, at this young girl preaching to her.

                                 SARAH
                        Look at you child. So wise, so sure. 

           Selah soldiers on.

                                 SELAH
                        And if you are impure, is it not right 
                        to drive out the rot?

           Sarah stops laughing, and touches her face - her rotting face. 
           This child preaching to her isn’t so funny anymore.

           Sarah grabs Selah by the arm, bruisingly hard. 

                                 SARAH
                        Bring more next time, pious and perfect 
                        sister-child. Don’t just bring these 
                        scraps that are worse than what his 
                        dogs get-

           Selah breaks free of Sarah’s hold. 

                                 SELAH
                        Don’t touch me! You are unclean.

           Sarah looks as if she is going to say something more, but then in 
           the distance - that EERIE SOUND from the Calling Horn. 

           Sarah sighs, the battle gone out of her. She knows what it means. 

                                 SARAH
                        You best go. Don’t want to be late.

           Selah leaves.
           EXT. BUSH PATH - DAY

           Selah runs along a bush track - flashes of her white robes 
           appearing and reappearing as she darts through the trees. The 
           charms in the trees swaying as she rushes past. 

           Her hair comes out of her braid as she runs. 

           EXT. OUTDOOR CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

           An outdoor chapel. Sacred space amongst the swaying gum trees.

           It is the style of a travelling church. Rough pews have been 
           made from logs, and more decorations of woven wool and sheep 
           skulls hang from the trees. There is a giant colourful rug on 
           the ground, over the bare dirt, dyed in the colours of a 
           bright sunset.

           The Shepherd stands at the front, behind a wooden pulpit. The 
           edges of the pulpit have been carved to look like a shepherd’s 
           staff. 

           To the side sit his FOUR BLACK-AND-WHITE SHEEPDOGS. Well-trained 
           working dogs, they watch the Shepherd constantly. Waiting for 
           their cues. 

           Selah creeps in, trying to be inconspicuous. She is late, and the 
           sermon has already started. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        And as we seek to find the true path - 
                        ahh, Selah.

           The congregation (all the wives and sisters) look at Selah, and 
           the Shepherd gestures to her. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Come to the front. 

           There is a moment of tension. The congregation seems to hold its 
           breath - 

           Selah goes right up to the front, trembling -

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Sit here, child-mine. 

           The Shepherd points to an empty space in one of the front rows, 
           and the tension passes. He continues his sermon. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        As we seek to find the true path, we 
                        must ask ourselves - do we walk true?
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        Or have we lost our way?  

           There is a murmur of dissent amongst the congregation. 

           He leaves his pulpit, walking back and forth. Energetic. 
           Captivating. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        My lost ones. My precious flock. 
                        You all came to me broken. You all 
                        came to me lost. Hurt by a cruel 
                        world, that cared not for you. 

           He leans down, and grips one of the wives gently by her chin, 
           who holds a young baby in her arms.  She looks up at him, 
           both fearful and adoring. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (to her / to the whole 
                              crowd)
                        And I took you in, and made you 
                        whole again. Protected you. Gave 
                        you shelter, and love - 

           He lets go of her chin, and briefly strokes the soft downy 
           hair of the baby in her arms.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        - and life.

           He moves away, and the wife slumps - like a puppet whose 
           strings have been cut. Exhausted from his attention.  

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        But, we must ask ourselves. Have we 
                        truly worked hard enough, at 
                        ridding ourselves of outside sin?

           At the front, Selah shines with faith and certainty as she watches 
           him, cross-legged on the ground. His most ardent disciple.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (louder now)
                        Of cleansing ourselves of the 
                        impurity of the outside world, that 
                        so stains our souls? Of banishing 
                        those impure thoughts that whisper 
                        to us on the wind, in our darkest 
                        hours? 

           His eyes seem to drill straight into every wife, every 
           sister. As if he is talking only to them.
                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        But, do not be afraid, my dear, 
                        sweet flock. Only a strong flock, 
                        free from sin, can find the true 
                        path. But we know that the lambs 
                        are weak. We know that the ewes are 
                        easily led astray. The ram must be 
                        strong.

           As he says ram, he grabs the horns around his neck, pulling them 
           free from his robe. The ends of the horns have been cut bluntly, 
           and a hole drilled through each of them for the leather tie. 

           One of the branches sways in the wind, and a BEAM OF SUNLIGHT 
           briefly illuminates the Shepherd - his hair turning golden in the 
           sun. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        For although the path may be 
                        fraught, you will always have your 
                        humble Shepherd by your side. 
                        Walking with you. 

           He sits down on one of the logs - right next to Selah. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Let us sit. And pray. And reflect on 
                        our blessings. 

           The Shepherd bows his head, and they all follow. 

           And for a moment - all that can be heard is the soft rustle of the 
           gum trees, and birds amongst the trees. 

           EXT. TRACK - AFTERNOON - LATER

           Selah and Tamar walk back along the bush track, talking softly to 
           each other. 

                                 SELAH
                        And then Evelyn pushed the milk over, 
                        and Hannah completely took her side -

           Tamar pulls on Selah's arm gently, cutting her off. Selah looks 
           up.

           The Shepherd is waiting up ahead, on the side of the path - his 
           dogs at his feet.

           The Shepherd smiles at them both, although it seems strained when 
           he looks at Tamar. Tamar doesn't make eye contact with the 
           Shepherd - scared to be the focus of his attention.  
                                 TAMAR
                        I’ll see if Maria needs help. 

           Tamar walks off quickly - leaving the Shepherd and Selah alone.

           They start to walk sedately along the path. Selah is flustered - 
           delighted to get some time alone with her father, but in awe of 
           her Shepherd. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Did you like today’s sermon, Selah? 

           Selah nods, tongue-tied.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad.
                             (teasing)
                        I can always tell when my sermons are 
                        boring, for your gaze wanders amongst 
                        the trees. I always wonder what you see 
                        up there.

           Selah is shocked out of her silence. 

                                 SELAH
                        My Shepherd, no, your sermons are 
                        always wonderful-! 

           He laughs, and holds up his hands. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        I’m only teasing. I know you listen 
                        most ardently. More than some of the 
                        wives, truth be told.  

           They walk along in silence again for a moment, Selah demurely 
           looking at the ground in front of her. 

           Some of her hair has come loose from her tightly woven braid, and 
           the Shepherd lifts a strand of her blonde hair, holding it gently 
           between his fingers. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (about her hair)
                        So beautiful. Like sunlight.

           He smiles down at her. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Just like your mother’s. 

           Selah looks up at him - excited. Eager. 
                                 SELAH
                        Can you tell me again? The story of 
                        when you first saw her? 

           But they have come through the trees, out of the still silent 
           grace of the bush. The buildings and distant paddocks of the 
           station can be seen in the distance. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Maybe another time, child-mine. But 
                        now, I must go gather the flock - 
                        before it gets too dark. A shepherd’s 
                        work is never done. 

           He carefully tucks the strand of hair back into her braid. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (gently but firmly)
                        Make sure one of the wives re-braids 
                        your hair. 

           And with that, the Shepherd walks away, his sheepdogs at his 
           heels. 

           INT. SLEEPING HALL - NIGHT

           Selah sits on the floor in front of Hannah, her hair being worked 
           into an intricate braid.

           The hair pulls painfully at Selah’s scalp as Hannah braids her 
           hair tightly. Selah doesn't make a sound. 

           INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

           The tail end of another communal dinner. 

           Selah sits with the other sisters, her hair now neatly braided.

           The Shepherd consults with Maria who sits to his left. She 
           consults a tiny book, with a crude moon calendar in it, and then 
           whispers in his ear. (NB: She is telling the Shepherd which wives 
           are probably ovulating.) 

           The Shepherd gets up, and chooses two wives, like before, and 
           then leaves.

           INT. SLEEPING HALL - NIGHT

           Selah lies in bed - curled up against Tamar and another of 
           her sisters.
           Then, a sound - the SLAM of a car door. Selah jolts awake. 

           Through the window, red-and-blue lights strobe over Selah’s 
           face.

           Selah sits up, and looks through the window. A police car is 
           parked outside, with a POLICEMAN standing next to it, talking 
           to Shepherd. The cop is clean-shaven, and dressed in a 
           country cop’s uniform.

           (NB: This is the first sense we have had that there is a 
           modern ‘outside’ world.)

           Selah observes through the window for a moment, then gets out 
           of bed, careful to not disturb her sleeping sisters. She 
           creeps to the window, and opens it a crack.

           Selah can’t quite make out the conversation, although 
           Shepherd is clearly angry.

           And then the wind changes direction in a swirl of red dust, 
           and Selah can just hear snatches of their conversation - 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        - this is religious persecution! 
                        We’re breaking no laws.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Doesn’t matter. One of the families 
                        - they say their missing daughter 
                        is underage, and they think she’s 
                        here. It’s enough of an excuse for 
                        a raid.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        We just want peace. To live our 
                        lives, how we please. 

           The policeman shrugs.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Not up to me. This was just a 
                        friendly warning. You’ve got a few 
                        weeks, but I won’t be coming round 
                        anymore. 

           The policeman goes to his car, and opens the door. 

                                 POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a pity. I always enjoyed my 
                        visits. To ‘check up’ on your 
                        flock.
           The car door slams, and there’s the sound of wheels on 
           gravel. 

           The Shepherd puts his head back, and looks up towards the sky 
           - almost despairing. Looking for answers. 

           He looks over towards the building briefly, at the window 
           that Selah was sitting at - 

           There’s no one there, but the window is still open a crack. 

           He strides over, and looks through the window. At the 
           sleeping tangle of childish arms and legs. The back of 
           Selah’s head.

           Unseen by the Shepherd - Selah’s eyes are open in the 
           darkness. 

           INT. SLEEPING HALL - MORNING

           The Calling Horn sounds. The sisters slowly wake in their 
           beds, stretching and yawning. 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - DAY

           The sisters and wives come out into the courtyard, ready for 
           the days chores -

           But the Shepherd is standing in the middle, next to the horn. 
           Waiting for them. 

           In one hand he holds his staff, and in the other hand he 
           holds the barbaric Ram, on a leash of braided leather.

           His face is stern, and harsh - this is not the smiling 
           patriarch of before. 

           Silently, the sisters and wives gather around him in a semi-
           circle - sitting on the dusty ground in their robes. The red 
           dust stains their robes instantly. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        My Flock. I have good news. Last 
                        night - I had a vision. 

           Gasps from the crowd. Selah’s eyes go wide. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I had a vision of a journey. A 
                        journey of many days. With my 
                        faithful flock beside me. 
           His eyes are alight with religious fever, and his voice is 
           smooth and powerful - his words wrap around them, like a 
           snake.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        And at the end of our journey, I 
                        had a vision of a new place. A 
                        better place. 

           There is a fearful murmuring amongst the wives and sisters. 
           Some of the younger ones start to cry. 

                                                          SISTERS
                                               I don’t want to go. / I’m 
                                               scared. 
                      WIVES / SISTERS
           We will leave the farm? / But 
           what of the flock? / Where 
           will we go? 

           The Shepherd strides into the crowd, but not in anger.

           He gentles them, touching one on the arm, stroking another’s 
           braid - soothing them, calming them down.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        My dear, sweet flock. Leaving our 
                        home breaks my heart as well. You 
                        must believe me. And yes, the 
                        journey will be hard. And yes, we 
                        will be tested. 

           He steps back, and gazes upon them all. Warmth and love in 
           his gaze. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        But, this journey will cleanse us. 
                        And we will be reborn. Reborn 
                        without sin. And we shall find our 
                        rightful home - a place far away 
                        from the cruel sin of the outside 
                        world. A place we can be safe, 
                        forever. 

           A beat - and then the wives begin to cheer, and laugh, and 
           cry, embracing each other on the ground. A joyous moment. 

           Tamar smiles widely, cheering along with the rest of them. 

           Strangely - Selah isn’t cheering. She looks scared and 
           unhappy.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Once the signs are right, and once 
                        the flock is ready - we will leave 
                        this place. We have outgrown it. It 
                        is time to find our true paradise. 
           The Shepherd smiles down at them from above - still holding 
           the ram’s leash in one hand, and his shepherd’s crook in the 
           other.

           EXT. BILLABONG - DAY

           Tamar and Selah, sit at the billabong’s edge.

           They are both making TINY LEAF BOATS out of white-grey gum leaves, 
           and watching them float in the water. 

                                 TAMAR
                        I wonder what we will see, on the 
                        journey. 

           Selah shrugs. Her eyes on the leaves. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        I wonder if the wind feels different, 
                        out there. Or if the rain will fall a 
                        different way on our skin. Or if we 
                        will swim in deeper water. 

           Selah stares out across the billabong - her expression sullen. 

                                 SELAH
                        I wish we could just stay here. 

                                 TAMAR
                        You don’t wish to go on the journey, 
                        sister-mine? 

                                 SELAH
                        It is perfect here. We have the 
                        Shepherd’s love. And the grace of the 
                        flock. And the perfection of the ram.
                             (plaintively)
                        I don’t want to leave. 

                                 TAMAR
                        You sound just like him. Saying his 
                        words. He might as well be here! 

           Tamar gets up - her movements angry. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        It’s not perfect for me here, Selah. 
                        Not like it is for you. 

           And this is the crux of it. The hidden resentment between the 
           blessed sister and cursed sister. 

           Tamar points back towards the station. 
                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        You know they whisper behind me. Say 
                        I’m cursed. That my skin shows my sin.

                                 SELAH
                        You should not listen Tamar. You know 
                        the sisters, the wives - as the 
                        Shepherd says, women are gossips, able 
                        only to think of their vanity-

           Tamar touches her face - her birthmark. 

                                 TAMAR
                             (whispering)
                        But Selah - sometimes I do feel cursed. 
                        When the Shepherd’s gaze looks at me, 
                        and then he looks away. As if I am not 
                        worthy.

           Tamar looks at Selah - trying to make her see. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        With you - he is all smiles. You 
                        can do no wrong. You are his golden 
                        lamb, and whatever Selah does 
                        cannot be wrong. 

           Selah stands as well - equally angry now. 

                                 SELAH
                        Well, maybe the Shepherd is right! 
                        Maybe he can sense the hate in your 
                        heart. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Can’t you just listen for once, Selah! 
                        Instead of preaching! It is as if you 
                        are his puppet - he pulls on your 
                        strings, and you dance for him. 

           Selah is stung, and lashes out. 

                                 SELAH
                        Maybe your face is a mark Tamar! Maybe 
                        it is to punish you for your pride, and 
                        your mouth. So all know you cannot be 
                        trusted. 

           Tamar stares at Selah in shock. Selah seems to realise what she 
           has said, in her rage. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        Tamar, I - 
           Tamar whirls and runs into the bush. 

           Selah watches her go, and then sits by the billabong again - her 
           eyes shiny with unshed tears. 

           In the water, the white-grey leaves of the gum tree boats have 
           partially submerged - and as Selah watches, they sink out of 
           sight.

           EXT. BUSH PATH - DAY

           Selah walks along the bush track - her arms wrapped around 
           herself.

           EXT. OUTDOOR CHAPEL - DAY

           The chapel is empty, and silent - only the rustle of leaves above. 

           Selah approaches, and kneels at the front on the rug, and bows her 
           head. Desperate for the blind solace that faith can bring. 

           A voice from behind startles her - Shepherd. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Selah - ? What are you doing here? 

           Selah turns, surprised - she has been crying. 

                                 SELAH
                             (hiccupping)
                        I am sorry Shepherd, I will go-

                                 SHEPHERD
                        No, no. Please stay. 

           The Shepherd sits down next to her, on a log. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        What is wrong, my lamb? 

                                 SELAH
                        Shepherd, I - I don’t want to leave the 
                        station. I love it here. 

           Selah bows her head again - ready for his anger. The Shepherd just 
           laughs. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Our journey is an important one. One 
                        that we cannot forsake. But I am glad 
                        to know that you treasure our home 
                        here. 
                                 SELAH
                        Why can't we stay? Is it to do with 
                        that man? 

           The Shepherd's eyes turn sharp.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        What man? 

           Selah bows her head. The picture of penitence. 

                                 SELAH
                             (whispering)
                        I woke during the night Shepherd. 
                        And saw that man. Is he why we must 
                        leave? 

           The Shepherd relaxes, and places a fatherly hand on Selah's 
           thin shoulder. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        I did not wish to scare the others, 
                        my Selah. And you must not mention 
                        it to them. But that man - he plans 
                        to bring others. Other men. To take 
                        you away. To take you all away - 
                        from me.

                                 SELAH
                        No! 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        And I prayed on it, and saw a vision of 
                        a new place. Where those men won't be 
                        able to find us. Unless we leave - we 
                        will never be safe here. Never be truly 
                        free. 

                                 SELAH
                        So we can never come back? 
                             (vehemently)
                        I hate them. I hate the outside.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        It is something we must do. Sometimes, 
                        we must sacrifice something for the 
                        good of the flock.

           He wipes one of her tears away with his finger, gently. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I am relying on you Selah. You are one 
                        of the oldest sisters. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        The younger ones will look to you for 
                        guidance during the journey. You must 
                        be strong in your faith.

           Selah takes a long shuddering breath - pulling herself 
           together. 

                                 SELAH
                        I will be, my Shepherd. I won’t let you 
                        down. 

           She smiles at him - sincere in her hero worship. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        The journey will be hard. But I 
                        will be with you, every step of the 
                        way. And I promise you, child-mine - 
                        the end of the journey, that sight 
                        is something worth seeing. 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - DAY

           Selah walks through the courtyard, deep in thought. 

           She passes the ram’s enclosure, and pauses.

           The ram is standing in the shade in the far side of the enclosure, 
           but at Selah’s approach, he comes over. 

           Selah takes a cautious step closer, and kneels - pulling some 
           grass from the ground, where it grows just out of reach of the 
           ram. 

           She delicately puts it through the fence, and the ram considers 
           her for a long moment-

           Then gently eats the grass from her hand, before ambling away back 
           to the shade. 

           Selah stays kneeling for a long moment, her hand still stretched 
           through the fence, happy tears trailing their way down her cheeks.  

           INT. WEAVING SHED - DAY

           The sisters are gathered in a circle - sorting through the wool. 
           Picking it apart, and bundling it up. Their small hands sort 
           through quickly and cleanly. 

           Selah sits across from Tamar. Tamar looks across at Selah, and 
           then away again. Still angry. 
                                 EVELYN
                        But where will we go? Across the 
                        desert? 

           One of the littlest sisters, LILY, sits next to Evelyn - she is 
           about five. 

                                 LILY
                        I’m scared.

                                 SELAH
                        We must have faith. Shepherd will be 
                        with us. 

           She smiles at Lily - and for a moment, we see a flash of Shepherd 
           in her eyes. That pure charm and charisma.

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        And with his guidance - I know that we 
                        shall find our way.

           Selah looks at Tamar, and seems to aim her words at her. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        And maybe the journey will help us 
                        remember that sometimes we do things or 
                        say things we don’t mean. Things that 
                        are not generous in our heart.

           Tamar looks up. Is that an apology? 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - DAY

           The sisters exit the shed - holding Hessian sacks of freshly 
           sorted wool. 

           Tamar stops next to Selah. They are both silent for a moment, and 
           then-

                                 TAMAR
                        I shouldn’t have said-

                                 SELAH
                        Sister-
           Tamar tries again. 

                                 TAMAR
                        I shouldn’t have shouted at you Selah. 
                        Or said those things.

                                 SELAH
                        Tamar - I was wrong. 
           Tamar looks relieved-

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I spoke to the Shepherd. And he helped 
                        me see - the journey will be hard. But 
                        it will be worth it. If we trust in 
                        him. 

           Tamar deflates again.

                                 TAMAR
                        That wasn’t what I was -  

                                 SELAH
                        - and I know it has been hard for you 
                        here, my sister. 

           Selah grabs Tamar’s hand, holding on tight. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                             (intensely)
                        We shall explore together. And do all 
                        the things you dream of. Feel the new 
                        wind. Taste the rain. Swim in deep 
                        water together.

           Tamar still looks unsure-

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I have many sisters. But-
                             (she leans in to whisper)
                        You are the sister of my heart. I 
                        cannot go on the journey unless you are 
                        with me. 

           A moment - and then they embrace.

           Tamar whispers into her hair. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Of course. I would not let you go 
                        without me. 

           Tamar rests her forehead against Selah’s briefly - blonde hair 
           contrasting starkly with dark hair.

           Finally, Tamar pulls away reluctantly. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        I must go. I promised Adriel that I 
                        would help with settling the little 
                        sisters for their afternoon nap. 
                                 SELAH
                        I’ll come with you. It’ll be quicker if 
                        I help. 

           A peace offering. Tamar smiles - their fight completely forgiven. 

           INT. NURSERY - DAY

           A nursery, filled with small children - newborns, all the way up 
           to five-and-six-years-old, in cots and sleeping mats. 

           Selah and Tamar walk among the mats, settling them down, getting 
           them ready for sleep. Adriel is there as well, her pregnant belly 
           huge in front of her. 

           Selah is crouched next to Lily - trying to lull her to sleep. 

                                 LILY
                        Can’t I stay up? Please? 

                                 SELAH
                             (gently)
                        You have to rest now, Lily. You know 
                        the rules. 

                                 LILY
                        But I’m not tired.

                                 SELAH
                        Just close your eyes. And imagine our 
                        flock in the field. The ram, and the 
                        ewes. And all their little lambs. See 
                        if you can count them all. 

           Lily closes her eyes - but opens them again almost instantly, 
           still restless.  

                                 LILY
                        Can’t you tell me a story, Selah? A 
                        story about the sisters? 

           Selah opens her mouth - unsure how to respond - but Adriel has 
           already heard. She bustles over, pushing Selah gently out of the 
           way. 

                                 ADRIEL
                        Lily. We’ve talked about this. 

           Lily looks mutinous, her lower lip trembling. Adriel’s colouring 
           and Lily’s are the same - they are mother and daughter. 

                                 LILY
                        But I want a story. 
                                 ADRIEL
                        Stories can only be about the flock and 
                        the Shepherd, Lily. And only the 
                        Shepherd is allowed to tell them. You 
                        know that. 

           Adriel points at Selah. 

                                 ADRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You don’t want to get Selah in trouble 
                        now do you?

           Lily shakes her head. 

                                 ADRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Now - I want you to apologise to Selah 
                        for asking her to break the rules, and 
                        then go to sleep. Can you do that for 
                        me Lily? 

                                 LILY
                             (softly)
                        I’m sorry Selah.

                                 SELAH
                        It’s ok. I know you didn’t mean it. 

           Adriel walks away. Selah strokes Lily’s hair softly, waiting for 
           her to drift off. 

           EXT. BUSH PATH - DAY

           Selah makes her way along the track - holding a covered bowl 
           again. 

           INT. SHACK - DAY

           Selah enters the hut - looking around the dim room. 

           It’s just Sarah, alone in the hut this time - Eloise is gone. 
           Sarah is lying down on one of the mats, and she looks thinner. As 
           if she is shrinking away.  

           Selah places the bowl down. Sarah gets up slowly, and lifts the 
           lid. It is better food this time - there is a half loaf of bread, 
           a chunk of cheese. 

                                 SELAH
                        These are the leftovers today.

           It’s clear that Selah has made an effort to find better food. 
           Sarah smiles at her, and brings the bowl back to her mat. 

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you. I haven’t had cheese in... 
                        months.

           Sarah starts to eat, and Selah looks around. 

                                 SELAH
                        You are alone now?

           Sarah shrugs. 

                                 SARAH
                        Eloise’s monthly time had ended. But I 
                        don’t mind. It is nice to be alone 
                        sometimes.

                                 SELAH
                        Maria bade me to tell you - the 
                        Shepherd has had a vision. We are going 
                        on a journey.

           Sarah looks surprised at this, although she continues eating.

                                 SARAH
                        Huh. I never thought he’d leave. I 
                        thought he’d die here, in his kingdom. 
                        With us all entombed with him. 

                                 SELAH
                        It is to cleanse ourselves of sin. 

           Sarah looks out the window thoughtfully, still chewing - then 
           looks back to Selah. 

                                 SARAH
                        Even the littlest sisters? How have 
                        they sinned? 

           And with that challenge to the Shepherd’s words - the moment of 
           accord between them is broken. Selah gets up, frowning. 

                                 SELAH
                        You know nothing, cursed-wife. 

           Selah goes to leave, but turns back as she pushes open the door.

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        The Shepherd has said. We leave once 
                        the last of the ewes has lambed.
           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - DAY

           Selah walks through the courtyard. 

           The Shepherd’s black-and-white sheepdogs run up to her - circling 
           her, attempting to herd her. Snapping, aggressive. 

           A moment of tension -

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Heel! 

           They slink away - back to the Shepherd, who has appeared from one 
           of the out-buildings.

           He is wearing his robes, but for once, he looks more like a farmer 
           than a prophet. He has sturdy leather sandals, and a wide-brimmed 
           leather hat.

           A few wives accompany him, Maria and Hannah among them. They are 
           dressed practically as well. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        My Selah. How fortuitous. 

           He turns to Maria. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Were you not just saying we needed some 
                        more help in the fields?
                             (to Selah)
                        The last of the ewes are in lamb. The 
                        wives take turns watching over them, 
                        and helping if they get into trouble. 

           Maria looks at Selah - her lips tight.

                                 MARIA
                        She is too young-

           The Shepherd stares at Maria for a moment - his gaze growing cold. 
           His authority is not normally challenged. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                             (backpedaling)
                        Although, the sisters must learn the 
                        ways of the lamb eventually.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        And Selah is one of the oldest. And 
                        most devout. 
                                 SELAH
                        Whatever Shepherd would have me do - I 
                        would do gladly.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Excellent.

           He gestures to Selah, and walks with her, out of earshot from 
           the wives. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        After our talk yesterday, I thought 
                        long and hard, my Selah. Your faith 
                        is strong, but you just need a 
                        reminder. A reminder of how the 
                        flock strengthens and nurtures us. 
                        And there is no more sacred task 
                        than bringing new members of our 
                        flock into the world. 

                                 SELAH
                        I would be honoured, my Shepherd. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        And if we are to be truly ready for 
                        this journey - we must have lambs.

           He locks stares with her - intense. Compelling. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        You must open your mind Selah. Be 
                        ready for grace. Ready for 
                        enlightenment. 

                                 SELAH
                        I - I will try my Shepherd.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Good. 

           The Shepherd and Selah rejoin the wives, who have been 
           patiently waiting for them. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (to Maria)
                        Make sure that she is included in the 
                        cleansing.  

           He walks away, his dogs trotting loyally after him. Selah and the 
           wives stare after him. 
           INT. WEAVING HALL - DAY

           The weavery has been transformed, into a primitive sweat 
           lodge. Steam fills the air, obscuring the half-clad forms of 
           the wives.

           There's a LOW HUMMING in the air - not a melody, but a single 
           unified sound as they cleanse themselves.

           Selah sits next to Maria on a wooden bench. They are both 
           only in undergarments. Strands of hair sticks to the sweat at 
           their temples, although their hair is still firmly braided. 

           Maria hands water in a bowl to Selah, who drinks deep. She 
           then hands her a small piece of meat - rare, almost bloody. 

           Selah brings the meat to her mouth and rips off a bit with 
           her teeth. Juice from the under-cooked meat runs down her 
           face. 

                                 MARIA
                        This will be your last food and 
                        drink, sister-child. We cannot 
                        contaminate the lambing with 
                        impurities. We must be as close to 
                        without sin as possible, and 
                        fasting is how we achieve purity. 

           There's a SWISH. Through the steam, Selah sees one of the 
           wives whipping herself with a eucalypt branch. Her skin is 
           red, and clearly marked. 

           Selah's eyes widen. Maria follows her gaze. 

                                 SELAH
                        Do I have to do that-?

           Maria takes pity on her. 

                                 MARIA
                        Not this time.

           Maria sits back on the bench, leaning against the wall. Selah 
           copies her, still chewing on her piece of meat.

           In the steam, she rubs at her stomach - furtively. Grimacing.

           EXT. PADDOCK PATH - DAY

           The wives, Shepherd and Selah walk along a well-worn track. 

           Selah now has a hat, attached to a braided leather cord, as well 
           as a small, blunt knife.
           EXT. SHEEP PADDOCK - DAY

           They stand at the bottom of a steep paddock, where sheep are 
           grazing. The ground is a combination of hard tufty grass, and red 
           dust - a far cry from the green fields depicted in their murals. 

           There are large rocks scattered through, and sheep are resting in 
           the shade in place. 

           The Shepherd smiles at the assembled group. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        And now - I shall leave you. But good 
                        luck, my faithful ones. 
                             (to Selah)
                        You’ll be fine. 

           He leaves, and after a moment, Selah rubs her stomach - the ache 
           is still there. Maria notices. 

                                 MARIA
                             (alarmed)
                        Are you ill child? 

                                 SELAH
                        Just hungry, I think. 

           Maria looks sternly at her. 

                                 MARIA
                        You won’t eat now until we're done. 
                        This is a sacred duty. 

           Maria gestures to Hannah, who lies down awkwardly on the ground - 
           as if she is an ewe herself.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I want you to watch closely Selah. You 
                        have attended a birth of one of your 
                        sisters before, yes? 

           Selah nods. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Good. It’s like that -  sometimes we 
                        need to help the lamb come out. When 
                        the ewe is ready, she goes into the 
                        birthing position, to help the lamb 
                        arrive. If she isn’t, you need to turn 
                        her on her side. 

           Maria touches Hannah on the side, and something passes between 
           them. A moment of sexual tension almost. 
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        If you see the hooves - you may need to 
                        reach in, and help the lamb on its way. 

           Maria mimes doing this against Hannah’s stomach - not quite 
           touching her.

           Maria looks at Selah. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        It is the most natural thing Selah. But 
                        also the most sacred duty. The Shepherd 
                        is trusting you greatly to ask this of 
                        you. If it looks like anything is going 
                        wrong, come and get one of us. We will 
                        help you. 

                                 SELAH
                        I will.

           Maria takes out a water bottle, and the wives all get in a line - 
           Selah at the end.

           Slowly, she pours water over each of their hands - ritually 
           cleansing them. None of them drink the water. 

           As Maria passes each wife, she talks to each one, and sends them 
           to a different section of the paddock. They each bow their heads 
           and leave. 

           Finally, she reaches Selah. Maria pours water over her hands. 

                                 MARIA
                        Most of the flock is within eye sight, 
                        but there are always ewes that wander 
                        off. I want you to go right to the 
                        upper paddock. Look for any ewes that 
                        look like their time is near.  

           Selah nods - then starts to make her way up the hill. 

           EXT. SHEEP PADDOCK - UPPER SLOPES - DAY

           Selah sits in the shade of a rock - shielding her eyes, and 
           looking down at the paddock below.

           Nearby, a few ewes are also lying in the shade to escape the heat 
           of the sun.  

           In the distance - the small white dots of the wives, and the white 
           dots of the rest of the flock, blur together in Selah’s vision. 
           (NB: the white dots are visually similar to the opening shot.) 
           Selah sits - alert. Ready. 

           LATER

           In the shade of the rock, Selah dozes - jerking herself awake 
           sporadically.

           Red dust swirls around her legs in the wind. 

           And then - almost human cries fill the air.

           Selah jolts fully awake, and looks around, disorientated. The 
           world seems to shift around her, dehydration making her confused. 
           Unable to see where the sound is coming from. 

           As Selah gets up, she stumbles - dizzy and sweaty.

           She looks around for the sound again, heading around the rock to 
           find -

           - an ewe in labour. Hidden from view from the rest of the paddock. 
           The ewe is old, and broken-mouthed - her teeth look rotted. 

           Selah crouches down next to the distressed ewe, and begins to try 
           to help - turning the ewe on its side, copying what she saw Maria 
           do. 

           Incredibly quickly, the two hooves of the lamb are coming out.

           Selah grips the hooves with one hand as Maria showed her, delving 
           obscenely deep into the ewe with the other hand. She cradles the 
           body of the lamb, trying to ease its passage.

           The look on Selah’s face is fear and wonder combined.

           This is new life. New, sacred life in her hands, as she cradles 
           the lamb deep inside. 

           The ewes cries increase in intensity, but Selah breathes through 
           it - calm and steady.

           She can do this.

           And then, the lamb is free, sliding onto the dusty ground, encased 
           in a birthing sac.

           The ewe nuzzles at the lamb, and Selah steps back - wiping her 
           bloody hands on her white robes. Staining them. 

           But when she moves forward to get a better look - 

           The lamb is deformed.

           Wrong.
           It’s misshapen, and contorted - it is a husk of a lamb, its limbs 
           twisted and its body thin.

           And worst of all - its face looks almost human. Not like a lamb at 
           all. 

           Selah stumbles backwards, horrified - tripping over her own feet 
           in the dirt. 

           Her skirt rides up, exposing her inner thighs. Her inner thighs, 
           which are stained with a red-brown blood. 

           Selah screams - covering her mouth with her hands (already bloody 
           from the birth). 

           She is impure. She’s gotten her first bleeding - while helping at 
           the most sacred of duties.

           This omen, this curse - it is her fault.

           Selah leans over and vomits - yellow bile spatters on the ground.

           Shaking, she wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, and sinks 
           onto the ground in shock. 

           LATER

           An indeterminate amount of time has passed. Selah looks blankly 
           ahead. Still almost catatonic. Blood on her face, her hands. Flies 
           on her skin. 

           Finally, she looks up - her eyes focusing on the ewe nuzzling the 
           pathetic form of the lamb for a long moment. 

           A DULL ROAR suddenly starts to drown out all other sound, and the 
           world becomes TINGED WITH WHITE - right at the edges.

           Selah gets up - her hands still bloody. Rigid, moving almost 
           mechanically. 

           She walks over to the ewe, and gets out her small knife. There is 
           a moment of tension - but she just grabs a hunk of the ewe’s pelt, 
           and cuts off a chunk of it.

           She pulls up her robe, and shoves the wool in there quickly - a 
           makeshift pad. 

           Selah gently pushes the ewe’s head away from nuzzling the lamb, 
           where it lies bleating pathetically on the ground.

           She picks the lamb up, cradling it carefully, walking away as the 
           ewe’s frantic bleats follow her. 
           Selah places the lamb on a small rock. Its small body is almost 
           spread-eagled. She gets her knife from her belt and plunges the 
           knife into the lamb again and again - 

           - the DULL ROAR increasing in intensity, WHITE spiking the edges 
           of her vision -

                                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. SLEEPING HALL - NIGHT

           Tamar lies awake, her eyes wide open and reflective in the 
           darkness. 

           She looks over at the door, worried - and then stares into the 
           darkness again. 

           Finally the door opens, and a small figure slips inside, moving 
           carefully, like she’s been injured.

           It’s Selah. 

           Selah climbs into bed next to Tamar - crying out softly in pain  
           as the mattress hits her back. Tamar lets her settle. 

                                 TAMAR
                        What did he say? 

           There’s a pause. 

                                 SELAH
                        He.. I got the leather braid. 20 
                        strokes. But I deserve it. I-

           She draws a deep breath.

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t have fallen asleep. If I 
                        had, the wild dog wouldn’t have got the 
                        lamb. 

           She lied. She lied to Shepherd. And worse - she lied to Tamar.

           Tamar reaches over in the darkness, and entwines their fingers. 

                                 TAMAR
                        It’s not your fault. 

           Selah takes a shaky breath.
                                 SELAH
                             (whispering)
                        I didn’t believe hard enough in the 
                        flock. In the Shepherd. I was impure. 

                                 TAMAR
                        What have you done that was impure 
                        sister? Nothing that I know of. I know 
                        of none more devout than you. 

                                 SELAH
                        I... I guess so. 

           Selah didn’t tell the truth about getting her period either - and 
           she is truly trapped in her lies now. 

           Tamar embraces Selah in the darkness carefully, avoiding her back.

                                 TAMAR
                        Sleep now, sister-mine. In the morning 
                        light, I know you will feel 
                        differently. And we will go on the 
                        journey soon, and the Shepherd and the 
                        wives will think this long forgotten.

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - DAY

           Selah works outside with the other sisters, in the hot sun. A few 
           days later, she still moves carefully, but her back is now almost 
           healed from the beating. 

           They’re packing food and supplies into backpacks, made from rough 
           material. Getting ready for the journey.

           Selah wipes her brow, sweating - just as the Shepherd comes up. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Are you well, child-mine?  

           Selah looks at the ground - still ashamed. 

                                 SELAH
                        I am well, Shepherd.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Good, good. 

           He grips Selah by the chin, gently and forces her to look at him.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I did not rejoice in your punishment. I 
                        would have you know that.
                                 SELAH
                        Yes, Shepherd. I - I know.

           One of the wives comes out from the weaving shed, and lets out a 
           piercing whistle.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        You should go. 

           He touches her back softly. Tenderly. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I am glad you are healed. I did not 
                        like marking your skin. 

           The Shepherd lets Selah go, watching her as she walks away,  
           joining the others. 

           INT. WEAVING SHED - DAY

           The wives and sisters sit in a circle - weaving the yarn in time 
           with each other.

           As they work in the ‘weaving circle’, they sing in rounds of 
           chanting. Their voices harmonize in a minor key - it is simple, 
           but beautiful, in the way that only many voices can be. 

           The song’s rhythm guides their hands - their hands guiding the 
           song’s rhythm in return. 

                                 WIVES (MANY)
                        When I was a young maid,
                        I would say to thee,
                        Will you not sit,
                        And worship with me.

                                 SISTERS (MANY)
                             (in response)
                        When I was an old wife,
                        I would say to thee,
                        Why did you not sit,
                        And worship with me.

                                 WIVES & SISTERS
                             (all together)
                        For if you had sat,
                        And worshipped with me,
                        We could be together,
                        Happy and free.

           Selah works with them - her hands in perfect time with the others. 
           Tamar next to her. Surrounded by her mothers and her sisters. 
           It is.. Peace.

           A transcendent moment. 

           And then - Selah looks up. Shepherd is standing in the doorway, 
           watching this deeply female ritual.

           The sun is behind him, and his face is cast in shadow - his 
           expression is hard to read.

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - CENTRAL COURTYARD - MORNING

           The central courtyard is organized chaos.

           Sheep mill just outside the gate - the dogs duck and weave, 
           working the sides of the flock effortlessly.

           The wives bustle around as well - crude Hessian sacks with straps 
           on their backs, loading up the older sisters with supplies as 
           well. 

           They are almost on their way. 

           EXT. SHEEP STATION - FRONT GATE

           The entire group stand at the front gate - the Shepherd at the 
           front.

           We see the full flock of sheep for the first time. There are about 
           one hundred ewes, and about thirty lambs, of various ages.

           And the ram - being held apart from the rest of the flock, being 
           led by Maria. His horns have now been tipped with silver chains - 
           he looks terrifying, and barbaric. 

           Right at the back, Sarah stands apart, finally free of her hut. 
           Her face half hidden with a scarf, covering her cancer-riddled 
           face. 

           Shepherd holds up his hands for attention, and they quickly hush. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Before we go on this path, know that 
                        our way will be long, and arduous. But 
                        with faith - we will find our way. To 
                        rebirth.

           They all bow their heads for a moment of silence. 

           And then, with a great clamor of hooves, and the barks of the 
           dogs, the flock sets off. On their journey. 
           EXT. DROVING TRACK - DAY

           They walk under the hot sun - the Shepherd at the front of the 
           flock, striding along - his long hair and beard flowing 
           majestically, his robes pristine. He looks like an old testament 
           style prophet. 

           The sisters and wives chatter to each other as they follow behind 
           him. The mood is upbeat - there are snatches of song and laughter. 

           Some of the stronger wives have the littlest sisters on their 
           backs, or baby girls strapped to their fronts in slings. Behind 
           them, the dogs wheel and dart, controlling the flock effortlessly. 

           Behind them, a large cloud of red dust swirls in their wake. 

           And at the very back - Sarah coughs into her arm, dust in her 
           lungs. Shunned. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK

           The sisters and wives gather around a campfire - resting after a 
           long day.

           In the background, a few basic tents have been assembled - just 
           mere squares of fabric stretched out over ropes strung from trees. 

           There is a water pump, and the flock is settled in a nearby 
           corral. (NB: This is a droving track, which means there are 
           regular campsites with watering holes along the way.)

           Maria approaches the Shepherd - a newborn lamb in her arms. He 
           takes it from her. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        For our journey. We give thanks. With 
                        this flesh - we shall be reborn. 

           Swiftly, he cuts the throat of the lamb. It bleats pathetically as 
           it bleeds out on the ground (NB: it sounds a lot like the death 
           sounds of the deformed lamb). 

           Selah looks sick, and glances away, looking into the fire instead. 
           There is a FLICKER OF WHITE in the flames as she looks at it. Just 
           like when she killed the deformed lamb. 

           As she stares into the fire, the background noise around her fades 
           away, until you can only hear the CRACKLE of flames. 
           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT - LATER

           The group sits around the fire, eating lamb stew (from the lamb 
           the Shepherd just killed.)

           The skull has been picked clean, and put on a flat rock, to the 
           side of the fire. It is surrounded by small bits of ephemera - 
           feathers, rocks, bits of wool. A tiny travelling alter. 

           Selah eats slowly - looking across at the wives’ faces across the 
           flames.

           In the firelight, they look sinister - almost demonic.

           One of the wives picks a bone with meat on it from her bowl, and 
           bites it - juice running down her chin. 

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. EDGE OF CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Selah throws up against a tree - her thin body heaving, as every 
           last bit of the stew comes up. Throwing up the sacred offering. 

           There’s a sound from the darkness, and she whirls around, guilty, 
           caught -

           But it’s just Sarah. Ostracized from the campfire.  Lurking at the 
           edges. 

           She looks at Selah, but doesn’t say anything. 

           Selah wipes her mouth, hiding the evidence of her illness, and 
           then turns and runs back towards the campfire.

           Sarah stares after her. Considering. 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - DAY

           Another day of travelling.

           The wives look a bit more weary, as do the sisters. Only the 
           Shepherd is the same - strong and sure at the front. 

           Maria and Hannah are at the front too, near the Shepherd, talking 
           together, affection between them. 

           In the middle of the group, Adriel is soldiering on - every 
           footstep a struggle, her pregnant belly straining at the front of 
           her robe. Her robes wrap around her ankles - dragging at her 
           heels. The hem is stained with red dust. 
           Selah walks next to Tamar - deep in thought, brow furrowed. Tamar 
           looks over at her. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Sister-mine, what’s wrong-

                                 SHEPHERD (O.S.)
                        Selah. 

           Selah and Tamar both start with surprise - the Shepherd has come 
           up beside them, abandoning his place at the front of the pack. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Will you walk with me? 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - FRONT OF THE FLOCK

           Selah and the Shepherd walk next to each other, their steps in 
           sync. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        I have been thinking, Selah. Thinking 
                        about the nature of truth. 

           Selah tenses next to him. Has he found out about the lamb somehow? 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        We must be honest with ourselves Selah. 
                        Life is too short to live fearfully. 
                        Without grasping what we want.

                                 SELAH
                        Shepherd - I don’t understand. 

           He turns to look at her. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        This journey will test us. But at the 
                        end - I have faith that the flock will 
                        be stronger for it.  

                                 SELAH
                        But how long will it be? The journey? 
                        And where will we go...? 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        All in good time, my Selah. All in good 
                        time. 

           EXT. ROCKY CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Another campsite - this one a bit more barren.
           The wives and sisters are eating lamb stew again. Another tiny 
           alter has been set-up next to the fire. 

           Selah doesn’t eat her meal - instead, she looks up at the night 
           sky above. 

           There is a FLASH OF WHITE in the atmosphere - a comet burning up? 
           Or another hallucination? 

           She looks back at the fire. 

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Selah and some of her sisters are sleeping into one of the tents - 
           huddled together for warmth. 

           There is a sound from outside - the CRACK of a branch snapping. 

           One of the youngest sisters, Lily, starts crying.

                                 LILY
                        I’m scared. Is there a monster?

           Tamar comforts her. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Shh. It will be ok. There’s no monsters 
                        outside. 

           There’s another sound from outside - Lily cries harder.

                                 SELAH
                        Lily, have I told you - the glories 
                        that our Shepherd told me about today?

                                 LILY
                             (hiccup crying)
                        I thought you weren’t allowed to tell 
                        stories Selah. Adriel said only the 
                        Shepherd-

                                 SELAH
                        Don’t worry - Adriel wouldn’t mind. I 
                        promise. I am only repeating what the 
                        Shepherd told me. 

           Across the tent, Evelyn looks unsure. 

                                 EVELYN
                        Selah, it is forbidden -
                                 LILY
                             (hiccup crying)
                        What did he say? 

                                 SELAH
                        He told me of a place where we can be 
                        with the flock. Where we will all be 
                        safe. 

           Selah’s voice is soft - but grows as she gains confidence. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        He told me of a place where all our 
                        doubts - all our fears - will go away. 

           Tamar rocks Lily in the darkness - who is watching Selah with 
           shining eyes. Selah’s voice is captivating - charismatic. 

           Selah reaches across - and grasps the young sister’s hand. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                             (whispering intensely)
                        We just have to have faith in him. 

           INT. TENT - MORNING

           The sisters wake up slowly in their communal tent - birds singing 
           loudly outside in the dawn light. 

           Evelyn looks over at Selah - and screams.

           The back of her white robe has a spot of blood. Selah has got her 
           period. 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - BACK OF THE FLOCK - DAY

           At the back of the flock, Sarah trudges along, alone. 

           In the distance, a figure walks towards her. Selah. Banished to 
           the back of the flock. A red sash wrapped around her waist.

           Sarah nods. Without saying a word, she hands Selah a spare scarf, 
           and mimes wrapping it around the lower half of her face, to shield 
           her face from the dust. 

           That done - they start walking again. Two outcasts at the back of 
           the flock. 
           EXT. REST STOP - DAY

           Selah and Sarah sit in the shade of a tree. The rest of the wives 
           and sisters can be seen in the distance, sharing water and food.  

           Sarah has unwrapped her face. Her cancer is bare in the sunlight, 
           and looks painful.

           Selah passes Sarah some water, and Sarah takes a careful sip.

           Sarah passes the water bottle back - looking at Selah’s face 
           carefully as she does so. Examining her. 

                                 SARAH
                        You look a lot like your mother. 

                                 SELAH
                        You knew my mother? 

           Sarah smiles, and the cancer stretches her face - rippled and 
           horrible.

                                 SARAH
                        Briefly. 

                                 SELAH
                        What was she like?

           Sarah thinks for a moment. 

                                 SARAH
                        Beautiful, of course. Wives are always 
                        beautiful. But she was smart too, 
                        although she worked to hide it. 

                                 SELAH
                        Did you like her? 

                                 SARAH
                        I was jealous of her at first. I had 
                        been his favourite. Before her. But 
                        after she died, my womb still never 
                        quickened. And he grew tired of me.

           They sit in silence for a moment. 

                                 SELAH
                        Did that happen after-? 

           Selah gestures to her own face - where the cancer grows on Sarah’s 
           face. 
                                 SARAH
                        It is death. It grows inside of you. It 
                        happened after I was no longer his 
                        favourite. I used to think it was 
                        punishment, for my pride.
                             (beat)
                        Now, I am not so sure.

           In the distance, the wives and sisters start to gather their 
           things. They are on the move again.

           Sarah and Selah get up as well. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think he’s ever really 
                        forgotten her. His golden wife. 

           Sarah looks at Selah - at her bright white-blonde hair. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        You are a lot like her. 

                                 SELAH
                        Thank you. 

                                 SARAH
                        It is a curse, child. His attention - 

           She gestures to the sun in the sky. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        - it is like the sun. It is bright and 
                        glorious, but it will burn you. You 
                        will feel yourself being stifled by 
                        him, until it feels like you can’t 
                        breathe when he’s around. 

           Selah shakes her head. 

                                 SELAH
                        You can’t - don’t talk about the 
                        Shepherd that way. 

           But her protest lacks the heat of their earlier arguments. 
           Something has shifted. 

           EXT. EDGE OF CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Selah and Sarah lie in their robes, under a ratty looking sheep 
           fleece - next to a tiny fire, its flames guttering and dying.

           Without even a tent to shelter them.
           In the distance, there is the chatter of laughter and voices, as 
           the wives and sisters eat around the fire. 

           Selah’s teeth are chattering - and Sarah draws her into her 
           embrace. For warmth. For comfort.

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - BACK OF FLOCK - DAY

           Sarah and Selah trudge along together. 

           Selah looks tougher now somehow - she’s been at the back of the 
           flock for a few days now, and red dust covers her once-pristine 
           robes. She still has the red sash wrapped around her waist. 

           Up ahead, there is a whistle - and the dogs begin to bring the 
           herd to a stop.

                                 SELAH
                        Why are we stopping?  

                                 SARAH
                        I think there’s a watering hole up 
                        ahead. It’s been about the right 
                        distance.

                                 SELAH
                        Water! I’m so thirsty.  

           Sarah looks at Selah.

                                 SARAH
                        The others will take their water. Then 
                        the flock. Then us. 

                                 SELAH
                        How did you know there was going to be 
                        water here? 

           Sarah gestures to the track behind them. It is clearly well-worn, 
           and has been here for years. 

                                 SARAH
                        This road is much older than you or I. 
                        Or the Shepherd. 

           As she talks, the wind whistles around - whipping the red dust up 
           along the road.

           Selah focuses on Sarah intently - colours seem slightly sharper, 
           sounds slightly louder.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        There have always been secret roads. 
                        Roads that only drovers or shepherds 
                        know about. 

                                 SELAH
                        Shepherds..?
                             (There is more than one 
                              Shepherd?)

                                 SARAH
                        Did you think he was the only one 
                        child? And this the only flock? 

           Selah digests this revelation, as Sarah continues talking. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        They’re called the Long Paddock. Secret 
                        roads, that only sheep or cattle can 
                        walk on. Made for large flocks. They 
                        have grassy verges, and watering holes, 
                        and campsites along the way, with 
                        places for rest. 

           As she talks, Selah hears it - the sound of sheep bleating and 
           cows mooing, and the sound of many hooves, along a long road. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        But, most importantly - all the roads 
                        of the Long Paddock are connected. Even 
                        if they’re not joined by land. 

           Sarah smiles at Selah. The sun outlines her face from behind, and 
           its light obscures her cancer for a second - making her beautiful 
           once more. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Those that walk on these roads are 
                        always walking together - even when 
                        they’re walking alone. 

           There is a sound in the distance - and the dogs bark as the flock 
           begins to move. Sarah gets up - the moment is broken.

           Selah stares after her for a moment, and then looks down back the 
           road that they have come - stretching far off across the 
           landscape. 

           EXT. WATERING HOLE - DAY

           Selah and Sarah fill up their water skins - the watering hole is 
           muddy and filled with debris, from the flock. 
           EXT. DROVING TRACK - BACK OF FLOCK - NIGHT

           Sarah and Selah settle in for the night.

           There is a sound in the darkness - and Evelyn appears.

                                 EVELYN
                        The Shepherd asks - are you still 
                        unclean?

           Selah hesitates- does she want to go back? Back to the Shepherd? 

           Sarah sees Selah’s hesitation, and responds for her.

                                 SARAH
                        The first bleeding is often erratic. 
                        She is still unclean. A few more days. 

           Evelyn looks unsure, and looks at Selah. After a moment, Selah 
           nods. 

                                 EVELYN
                        I will tell him. 

           Evelyn disappears back into the night. 

           Selah lets out a shaky breath. She just avoided returning to him. 
           What has she done? 

           Sarah observes her for a moment - then sets to work building up 
           their small fire. 

                                 SARAH
                             (to the fire)
                        Sometimes. Back at the station. In the 
                        hut. 

           Sarah feeds a small stick into the flames. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I would wait until the moon was full in 
                        the sky. And everything was quiet. 

           The stick suddenly catches - the bark burning quickly. 

           Selah stares at the flames - are they tinged with white? 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I would take off my robe until I stood 
                        naked. And I would go out, into the 
                        bush or the paddocks. And just - stand.
                                 SELAH
                        But - the Shepherd. If he had caught 
                        you -

           Sarah continues as if she hasn’t heard Selah. 

                                 SARAH
                        And I would feel the stars gaze upon 
                        me. And the moon’s light upon my skin. 
                        And I would feel free.

           Sarah turns to face Selah, finally dragging her gaze away from the 
           flames. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        And even when I was in that hut, day in 
                        and day out - I carried that freedom 
                        inside of me. 

           Sarah puts her hand to Selah’s chest - over her heart.

           And they sit for that moment - the night sky painfully bright 
           above them. 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - BACK OF FLOCK - DAY

           A few days later.

           Selah walks away from Sarah, up the side of the flock, back 
           towards the other wives and sisters - and the Shepherd. The red 
           sash is off her waist. 
           Sarah squints into the sun, shading her eyes with her hand - 
           watching Selah go.

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - FRONT OF FLOCK - DAY  - CONTINUOUS

           Selah walks up to the Shepherd - her hair is bedraggled, her robes 
           covered in dust.

                                 SHEPHERD
                             (smiling)
                        Welcome back my child. 

                                 SELAH
                             (meekly)
                        Thank you Shepherd.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        We missed having you in the flock. Your 
                        grace always brings me joy. 

           With that, he reaches out, and cups her cheek with her hand.
           Selah smiles at him - but for once, instead of adoration, it looks 
           a bit forced. 

           He looks at her a moment longer, then lets out a piercing whistle. 
           His sheepdogs bound over. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Away to me! 

           The dogs bound away. 

           He turns away from Selah, striding forward, as the flock starts to 
           move again. 

           Selah looks after him, her eyes wide - conflicted. 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - FRONT OF FLOCK - DAY - LATER

           Selah walks next to Tamar and Evelyn, in among the other sisters 
           and wives. They talk quietly.  

                                 TAMAR
                        Did it hurt? 

                                 SELAH
                        Like an ache from bad food? It was not 
                        so bad. 

                                 EVELYN
                             (primly)
                        It is a sign of sin. 

           Tamar and Selah both look at her. Evelyn looks at bit embarrassed.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        From Eve’s original sin. The Shepherd 
                        says so.

                                 SELAH
                        It must be, if the Shepherd says so. 

           Her tone is ambiguous - outwardly respectful, but with just a hint 
           of sarcasm.

                                 TAMAR
                        You’re the first sister to get her 
                        monthly time. I wonder what it means.

           Selah shrugs. 

                                 SELAH
                        I am almost the oldest.
                                 TAMAR
                             (teasing)
                        But not the wisest! 

           Selah tickles Tamar’s side as retaliation, and Tamar laughs. 
           Evelyn looks on jealously.

           EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

           The group has stopped in the sparse shade of some stunted trees.

           Selah, Tamar and Evelyn are sharing a waterskin - Evelyn tips her 
           head back, drinking the last few drops. 

           Nearby, Selah sees Adriel - sitting on a rock, looking exhausted. 
           She looks swollen and tired, and her lips are dry. 

           Selah looks at the waterskin - regretful, and then gets up and 
           goes to Adriel. 

                                 SELAH
                        Do you need some water? 

           Adriel smiles tightly, looking exhausted. 

                                 ADRIEL
                        That would be lovely. 

           Her features are taut with pain - she’s clearly struggling, 
           especially in the heat.

           From behind them, Evelyn pipes up. 

                                 EVELYN
                        I’ll go and ask the Shepherd for some. 

           Adriel’s eyes widen, but it’s too late - Evelyn has already run 
           off. 

           Tamar crouches down in front of her - gesturing for her to lift 
           her left foot. 

           After a moment Adriel complies, and Tamar begins to massage it. 
           Selah crouches down as well, and does the same to the other foot. 

                                 ADRIEL
                        Oh my darlings. That feels heavenly. 

           But just as she is beginning to relax - she grimaces in pain, 
           grabbing at her stomach. 

                                 SELAH
                        Is it time? 
           Adriel looks at her - and we finally see how truly, deeply afraid 
           she is. 

                                 ADRIEL
                             (whispering)
                        It’s too soon. It can’t be time. 

           She gestures around at the desolate landscape; the broken trees, 
           the dust. 

                                 ADRIEL (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do this here. I wish we were 
                        home. I wish we’d never left.

           Evelyn returns - with the Shepherd and Maria, who are each holding 
           a water skin. Maria assesses the situation at once. 

                                 MARIA
                        How far apart are they? 

           Adriel grimaces -

                                 ADRIEL
                        A few minutes? 

           Maria stands - trying to hide her fear from Adriel. She turns to 
           the Shepherd. 

                                 MARIA
                        My Shepherd, the babe is coming soon. 
                        Are we near a resting place? With 
                        water? 

           The Shepherd pulls out a leather wallet, and opens it - revealing 
           the FOLDED-UP MAP inside. It is covered with writing and markings - 
           it has been used often. Selah notes the map, and the reverence 
           which the Shepherd gives it. 

           He consults it carefully - looking up at the sun to judge 
           direction. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Maybe an hours walk away?

           Maria helps Adriel to her feet - grimly determined. Adriel grips 
           Maria’s hand tightly - sweat has started to drip down Adriel’s 
           face. 

                                 MARIA
                             (gently)
                        You can do this.

           The Shepherd strides away, whistling for his dogs. The flock 
           starts to move again. 
           Maria stares after him - disbelieving. 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - FRONT OF FLOCK - DAY

           Adriel struggles along, Maria supporting her on one side, and 
           Hannah on the other. 

           Adriel stops and doubles over in pain - trying to breathe through 
           it. 

                                 MARIA
                        Just a bit further. I promise, just a 
                        bit further. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - GUM TREE - DAY

           Selah and the other sisters sit in the shade of a giant gum tree. 
           Tamar is holding Lily. 

           There’s a scream from nearby, echoing across the landscape - 
           Adriel is in labour, and in pain. 

                                 LILY
                             (plaintively)
                        How long has it been now?

                                 EVELYN
                        Too long. It’s been hours. 

           Lily starts to cry in Tamar’s arms. Tamar glares at Evelyn, and 
           then cuddles the little girl to her protectively. 

                                 TAMAR
                        These things can take time my love. 
                        Sometimes a sister doesn’t want to come 
                        into the world to say hello.

                                 LILY
                             (sniffling)
                        Can’t I see her? 

           Tamar shakes her head. 

                                 TAMAR
                        We must wait here. Until it’s over. 

           Another scream - guttural and in pain. Lily begins crying again. 

                                 SELAH
                        Once, long ago - there was a woman. 

           Lily stops crying, and looks at Selah - is this story allowed? 
                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        And sometimes, in the dead of night, 
                        she would leave her hut. To walk 
                        amongst the trees -

           But before Selah can continue - there is the WAILING of a newborn. 

           Lily squirms out of Tamar’s arms - and sets off running, towards 
           the wailing. Tamar looks worried, but lets her go. 

                                 EVELYN
                             (sighing in relief)
                        I didn’t think the birth would ever 
                        end. 

           And then, from a distance - the PIERCING SCREAM of a little girl.

           EXT. PYRE - DUSK

           A half-built pyre - almost three metres high. 

           Adriel’s body lies on top of it, her stomach still protruding, the 
           bottom of her robe stained with blood. 

           She has been placed on top of a colourful woven blanket. Its red 
           and orange colours contrast sharply with the brown of the wood. 

           Lily lies in the crook of her arm, nestled in, hiding her face in 
           her mother’s body - she has clearly been there for some time. 

           Around her, wives and sisters gather sticks and logs in silence. 
           Carefully building the pyre up and up. 

           Sheep’s wool has been tucked amongst the wood - some has been 
           braided roughly, while other bits are just clumps. 

           The Shepherd stands a distance away, his hand on his staff, his 
           dogs at his feet.

           Beyond him even further - Sarah stands and watches. 

           Cradling a BABY - Adriel’s baby. 

           Finally, Maria goes over to the Shepherd. She looks angry, 
           although she tries to hide it. 

                                 MARIA
                        She’s ready. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Good, good.

           He clasps Maria’s shoulder. 
                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Birth, death. They are always two sides 
                        of the same coin, are they not? You did 
                        all you could.

                                 MARIA
                        If I had had hot water, a birthing bed, 
                        maybe we could have -

           The Shepherd shrugs. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        What is good for the flock, will always 
                        ultimately, be what passes. You must 
                        have faith, my wife. 

           Maria looks unconvinced, but says nothing. 

           The Shepherd looks up the pyre - at the sad, still form of Adriel. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        And after all that - such a pity about 
                        the baby. 

           He strides over and goes to the side of the pyre, where Lily still 
           clings to her mother. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Time to get down, my child.

                                 MARIA
                        Come on Lily. Come down now. 

           Lily shakes her head mutely, tears still streaming down her face 
           as she clings to her mother - unable to let go. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Child, I said - get down. 

           He pulls at her arm, and Lily screams - clawing at his hand with 
           her tiny nails. 

           He rears back, instantly furious - his hand bleeding from a tiny 
           cut. His face twists - cruel and cold. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        You’ll get down soon enough. 

           He walks off, and Maria darts forward to the base of the pyre. 

                                 MARIA
                             (frantically)
                        You need to get down. Please get down. 
                        Please, please- 
                                 SELAH (O.S.)
                        Lily. Look at me. 

           The little girl looks over - where Selah stands now at the base of 
           the pyre. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        We need you down here. Tamar is so 
                        upset. And she says only you can 
                        comfort her?

           Lily wipes at her eyes, looking over at Tamar - who does look 
           upset.

           Then she carefully gets down, climbing down the side of the pyre, 
           using the layers of wood as steps. She goes to Tamar, who embraces 
           her protectively against her side.

           Evelyn grabs the sleeve of her robe, and wipes at a smudge on 
           Lily’s face - protective too. 

           The Shepherd returns - a glowing branch from the fire in his hand. 
           Blood runs down his arm in a tiny stream. 

           He sees Lily standing by Tamar’s side, and looks furious - as if 
           he wants to put her back up on top of the pyre.

           But the wives and sisters are all standing together.

           Almost in a wall against him. 

           Instead, he stands in front of the pyre. The branch in his hand 
           glowing brightly. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        The gift of motherhood is the most 
                        precious of all. For your sacrifice - 
                        we give thanks.

           He lights the pyre. The wool doesn't burn quickly, and the air is 
           quickly filled with smoke. 

           The Shepherd observes for a moment - until the smoke reaches him. 
           It surrounds him almost like it has a mind of its own, moving 
           against the wind currents. He starts to cough and wave at it. 

           He backs away from the pyre, still coughing and finally leaves - 
           calling his dogs to him with a whistle.

           Not even waiting for the flames to reach Adriel’s body.

           The wives and sisters stay - their eyes streaming from the smoke, 
           and tears. 
           And then, in the hazy smoke filled air, in the dying light of 
           sunset - Maria starts to sing.

                                 MARIA
                        When I was a young maid,
                        I would say to thee,

           The other wives join in. 

                                 WIVES (MANY)
                        Will you not sit,
                        And worship with me.

                                 SISTERS (MANY)
                             (in response)
                        When I was an old wife,
                        I would say to thee,
                        Why did you not sit,
                        And worship with me.

           Their voices are hoarse in the smoke - but the tune is haunting 
           and melodic over the crackle of the flames. 

           In the smoke, Hannah comes next to Maria, and embraces her. In 
           comfort - and something more. 

           Lily’s voice is pure and high - and she stares at her mother’s 
           face as she sings. Desperate for a last glance. 

                                 WIVES & SISTERS
                             (all together)
                        For if you had sat,
                        And worshipped with me,
                        We could be together,
                        Happy and free.

           There is a WHOOSH as the rug catches on fire - and Adriel’s body 
           is consumed by flames.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           The wives and sisters sit in silence, eating tiny serves of lamb 
           stew from their bowls. The Shepherd sits in the middle, next to 
           the fire - glowering at them all. 

           Selah eats hers - looking unwell.

           EXT. PYRE - NIGHT

           Selah throws up the lamb stew, leaning against a tree - her legs 
           shaking as her stomach heaves. The pyre still smoulders nearby. 
           The wind whips up suddenly, and ash from the pyre dances around 
           her, like dark snowflakes. Ash speckles across her face, catching 
           where her eyes teared from throwing up.

           Painting her face into something dark, and new. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Selah returns to the campfire. But just before she steps back into 
           the firelight, she walks past the tree where the ram is tied up - 
           separate to the rest of the flock.

           Selah looks at the ram, ash still smearing her face. It returns 
           her gaze steadily.

           Selah takes a step towards the ram, sudden fury in her expression, 
           angry at the ram, angry at the Shepherd, angry about Adriel - 

           - and it steps back. Eyes rolling in fear. 

           Selah stops, her eyes wide in her face.

           What does it mean? Her god retreating from her? 

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - FRONT OF FLOCK - DAY

           The group marches along - the sky vast above them. Blue and 
           punishing in its cloudlessness.

           There is the bleat of the sheep, and the barking of the dogs - 
           they are on the journey again. Leaving Adriel behind, under the 
           gum tree.  

           Selah walks next to Tamar, who has Lily on her back. 

           But then - some instinct makes Selah stop and turn.

           Behind them, hazy in the dust, Sarah stands in the middle of the 
           road. Adriel’s baby in her arms. Watching them leave. 

           Selah looks confused, and pushes her way back through the flock.

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Selah makes her way through the last of the flock, and stands in 
           front of Sarah, panting. 

                                 SELAH
                        What are you doing? Why aren’t you 
                        coming with us? 
           Sarah smiles at her - a beautiful, motherly smile. She looks 
           radiant, better than we have seen her before. 

                                 SARAH
                        He was going to leave him. 

                                 SELAH
                        Who? 

                                 SARAH
                        The Shepherd. He was going to leave the 
                        boy here. Said he should be with his 
                        mother’s ashes. 

                                 SELAH
                             (wondering)
                        The baby... it’s a boy? I didn’t know 
                        babies could be boys. 

           Sarah laughs - although there is little humour in it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Only one ram in a flock, child. Only 
                        one ram in a flock. 

           She coos at the baby protectively, then looks up at Selah again. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        You go on. If you hurry, you’ll be able 
                        to catch up. 

                                 SELAH
                        But.. You’ll starve. You’re all alone 
                        out here. 

           Sarah gestures to her face - where the cancer is eating away at 
           her skin.  

                                 SARAH
                        I didn’t have much of a chance to begin 
                        with. And this way, maybe the babe will 
                        live. Who knows. I’m just going to 
                        walk, find another one of the Long 
                        Paddock roads. See where that leads me. 

           She smiles at Selah - more at peace with her actions and her 
           choices than ever before. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Rather be free out here. Than trapped 
                        with him there. 

           She pulls Selah to her in a fierce hug - the baby wailing in 
           between them, hungry for milk that isn’t coming.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                             (whispering fiercely)
                        Just remember child. Strength isn’t in 
                        bone or sinew. It’s in the blood.

           And then, she pushes Selah away.

           Selah runs back towards the flock - through the dust, the figure 
           of the wife getting smaller and smaller behind her.

           EXT. DROVING TRACK - DAY

           The flock has been stopped in the middle of the road. 

           The Shepherd has walked a distance away, and has pulled out his 
           map - looking up at the sun, trying to orient himself. 

           The wives and sisters sit baking in the hot sun - waiting for him.

           They all look thinner and wearier - several days have passed since 
           they left Sarah behind. 

           Finally, he comes back to the group. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Our way shall become clear. We must 
                        have faith. 

                                 WIFE
                        Is it very far Shepherd?

           He smiles down at her, and at the rest of the group - although 
           even he looks tired from the heat. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        I never said the journey would be easy, 
                        my loyal flock.

                                 WIFE #2
                        Are we lost? 

           The change is immediate - the wife instantly realises her mistake, 
           and shrinks back into the crowd, trying to escape.

           The Shepherd grabs her by her arm, and hauls her upright - 
           dragging her like a doll. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Do you doubt our path?! Do you doubt 
                        what I say?  

           He’s right in her face - yelling almost against her skin. 
           Everyone else’s eyes are downcast - even Selah’s. Like children in 
           a classroom, glad that the teacher is picking on someone else 
           today. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Is it that you think yourself superior 
                        to me? Too good for my flock? 

                                 WIFE #2 
                        No! Please, my Shepherd, I didn’t mean-

           He lets her arm go - flinging her onto the ground in front of him. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Strip. 

                                 WIFE #2 
                        ...what? 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Strip. Take off your robe. 

           Slowly - hesitantly - the wife starts to undress.  

           On the ground, Selah reaches for Tamar’s hand, and grips tightly. 
           And then, to the other side of her, Evelyn reaches for the other. 
           Selah looks at her in shock, but grips Evelyn’s hand too. 

           Finally, the wife is standing in front of him, naked and 
           trembling. She’s given birth - she has stretch marks striping 
           across her stomach, and she hunches in on herself. Trying to hide. 

           The Shepherd circles her like a wolf - his eyes raking up and down 
           her body. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        It is strange. For one who thinks 
                        herself so superior - you don’t look 
                        like anything special.

           His words are cold - cruel. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Your thighs are lumpy. Your breasts 
                        sag. You think you have worth? You 
                        don’t. You disgust me. 

           She huddles in on herself - making herself as small as possible in 
           the face of his wrath. 

           He spits at the ground, in front of her feet - then gestures for 
           her to pick up her robe. She puts it back on quickly. 
           He turns to the rest of the group - his charming mask firmly back 
           in place. As if the terrifying psychopath was never there. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        As I was saying. Above all else - 
                        we must not lose our faith.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           The wives and sisters straggles across the landscape, walking 
           slowly up a dusty incline - the flock struggling along beside 
           them.

           At the front, the Shepherd leads on, more than a hundred metres 
           out in front.

           He is Moses, parting the red sea of dust and sand - armed only 
           with a staff and a fury at the world. 

           Any semblance of a road or path is long gone. All around them, 
           there is only flat, arid land, baked into a hard clay. The ground 
           shimmering in the heat. 

           Tamar carries Lily on her back - still somehow impossibly strong, 
           seemingly inexhaustible. Moving forward solely on the force of her 
           inner strength. 

           Selah is near the back, sweat dripping from her brow. Close to 
           exhaustion; hungry, dehydrated.

           Something catches Selah’s eye, and she pauses for a moment - 
           swaying as she looks across the landscape.

           And in the distance - a small white speck on the ground.

           She squints across the desert, trying to make it out.

           Is it... could it be a lamb? A small, broken lamb?

           Selah looks down at her hands - and in the light, it almost seems 
           as if they are covered in red.

           Red dust? Or red blood? 

           And there’s a GLINT of white light in the sun, and a ROARING in 
           Selah’s ears. Is she having a vision? 

           And then - a cry goes up. Selah looks away - and when she looks 
           back, the ‘lamb’ is gone. 

           The Shepherd has reached the top of the incline, and he stands 
           confidently at the top. His arms reaching towards the sky in 
           victory.
           The wives and sisters start to run towards him. Their robes thick 
           around their ankles, dust kicking up around them. There is hope in 
           their footsteps now, as they run faster and faster-

           The dogs are frenzied, barking and snapping at the sheep as they 
           start to stampede..

           And then, they reach the peak. Some fall to their knees. Others 
           cry. What is it?

           It is disaster or salvation? 

           Selah is the last to arrive, having fallen slightly behind, and as 
           she crests the hill we see-

           EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING LAKE EYRE - LATE AFTERNOON

           - a paradise on earth. 

           A lush oasis of water and life. Birds wheel up above, diving and 
           darting into the lake, capturing fat fish in their beaks.

           It is a giant crater - the hill they have been climbing forms one 
           of its sides. Small river tributaries flow into it from every 
           direction, with the giant lake at its centre.

           NB: It is the same shot as in the opening scene, but a direct 
           contrast - the lake is alive and vibrant.) 

           Selah looks stunned - but then starts to smile. Hope in her eyes 
           again. 

           They made it. They actually made it.

                                 SHEPHERD
                        My flock! My dear faithful flock! 

           He points to the lake. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        As a reward for our faith. For your 
                        trust in me. I give you - an oasis. 
                        Paradise on earth. 

           The wives and sisters cheer tiredly again.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Only at the most holy times, does 
                        this lake appear. For years, it is 
                        dry, and barren, until one day, it 
                        fills with water and life. And it 
                        is in these sacred waters, that we 
                        shall be reborn. 
           Triumphant, the Shepherd whistles the dogs to him, and starts to 
           gather the flock - before starting to walk down to a small 
           campsite right at the edge of the lake. 

           The group gathers itself and follows him. 

           Only Selah is left standing, on the ridge. Legs planted firmly 
           apart. Considering the lake. Her pose mirroring the Shepherd's 
           before. 

           And in the late afternoon light - it is almost hard to tell them 
           apart. 

           EXT. LAKE EYRE CAMPSITE - LATE AFTERNOON

           They make camp - for a final time. The mood is upbeat again - 
           wives sing snatches of songs, some of the sisters laugh and play. 

           Selah supervises some of the sisters - directing them as they put 
           up their tent. 

                                 SELAH
                        No, not that branch. Attach it to the 
                        other one! The other one! 

                                 EVELYN
                        Well, if you’re so sure - why don’t you 
                        do it then? 

           Selah smiles at her - mischief in her eyes. 

                                 SELAH
                        Great leaders don’t do. They lead. 

           Evelyn snorts, and looks to Tamar for support, who is sitting on 
           the ground playing with the little ones.

           The journey has changed them both - there is a camaraderie between 
           them now.

                                 EVELYN
                        That’s sheep shit Selah.

           Tamar laughs, and covers Lily’s ears - but then nods her agreement 
           over her head. 

                                 SELAH
                        If I wasn’t telling you what to do, how 
                        would you know what the right thing to 
                        do is?  
                                 TAMAR
                             (gently)
                        I’m sure we’d muddle along Selah.

           Evelyn’s eyes widen, as she sees something over Selah’s shoulder. 

           Selah turns - to find the Shepherd standing behind her. How much 
           of the conversation has he heard? 

           He smiles at her - benevolent, but with a hint of something in his 
           smile. Threat? Malice? 

           He walks to Selah, his steps measured - and the group falls 
           utterly silent. The air is suddenly thick with tension. 

           He leans down, and cups the back of her head with his hand, and 
           kisses Selah firmly on the forehead. The kiss lasts just a 
           fraction too long. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        My Selah. Such a good example to your 
                        sisters. Guiding them for me. 

           It is a rebuke, hidden as praise. 

           Selah looks up at him, standing tall above her. For once she 
           doesn’t smile - doesn’t look away. It is a battle of wills - and 
           it is the Shepherd who looks away.

           He releases her, and steps away. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Make sure that the tent is up before 
                        the sun goes down. We will have our 
                        last supper tonight - under the stars 
                        of the lake. 

                                 SISTERS
                             (except Selah)
                        Yes Shepherd. 

           The Shepherd walks away, and Selah stares after him. Their dynamic 
           has changed. 

           EXT. LAKE EYRE - LAKE’S EDGE - DUSK

           Selah sits by the edge of the lake, red mud staining the hem of 
           her robe, where it lies in the water. She looks out across the 
           lake, and the birds circling above. 

           There is a soft cough - and then Tamar sits down beside her. 
           Their pose is the same as how they were at the billabong - except 
           this time, they are looking out at the vast majesty of one of the 
           world’s great wonders. 

           They sit in silence for a moment. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Are you glad Selah? 

                                 SELAH
                        Glad for what, my sister-heart?

                                 TAMAR
                        Glad that we left. Glad we came here. 
                        Is it not beautiful? 

           Selah looks across the lake. It is beautiful. Utterly alien, and 
           so painfully, painfully beautiful. 

                                 SELAH
                        I am glad. Although-

                                 TAMAR
                        Although? 

                                 SELAH
                        I thought it would feel.. Different. I 
                        thought I would feel different.

           Tamar looks at her - questioning. Selah shrugs.  

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I thought I would feel pure. Or 
                        changed, from the journey. But I still 
                        feel the same. 

           She looks at her hands, and grips them together into fists. 
           Remembering the lamb. 

           Tamar looks at Selah - her gaze troubled.

                                 TAMAR
                        I think - I think a journey can only be 
                        what you let it be, my Selah. 

           Selah looks at her. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        You can let it be anger, and pain.

           She grips Selah’s hand, where it sits in the mud - and brings it 
           to Selah’s own heart. Staining her robe with red mud at her heart. 
                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        Or you can let it be peace. And joy. 
                        You can let yourself go free. 

           They sit together. Watching the sun set slowly across the lake. 

           EXT. LAKE EYRE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           The sisters and wives sit around the fire. One last dinner.

           The Shepherd doles out the stew into their bowls - but only the 
           sisters are fed. Not the wives. 

           Tamar notices, and goes to give her bowl to Hannah. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (gently)
                        Thank you, Tamar. But we are 
                        fasting. To make sure we are pure 
                        enough for tomorrow. 

           Next to her, Maria looks angry but resigned. 

           Selah observes across the campfire. She looks to the Shepherd 
           - who is eating stew heartily, juice dripping from his beard.

           Selah begins to eat as well - hesitantly at first, but then 
           suddenly, she is ravenous. Not ill at all. 

           She eats her entire bowl, scraping the sides, and sits back - 
           fully sated for the first time since the journey began.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           The sisters are getting comfortable, getting ready to go to sleep. 
           The little ones already half asleep, and Tamar lies curled with 
           Lily.

           Selah and Evelyn lie cradling one another - their animosity a 
           distant memory.

           From outside - a deep voice. The Shepherd. 

                                 SHEPHERD (O.S.)
                        Selah, Selah. Come outside. 

           Selah rises in the darkness. Evelyn grabs her wordlessly, telling 
           her not to go-

           But she slips away, out through the front of the tent, into the 
           waiting dark. 
           EXT. TENT - NIGHT

           The Shepherd stands outside the tent, outlined under a double moon 
           - the moon in the sky, and the moon on the lake. 

           The moonlight is bright - and his face is made up of shadows and 
           hollows.

           He walks a little distance from the tent, and sits down - patting 
           the ground beside him. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        Lie down next to me, Selah. 

           Selah hesitates. Then, in just her under robe, her arms bare, she 
           picks her way carefully across the ground towards him. She lies 
           down next to him on the ground. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Unbraid your hair. 

           Slowly, hesitantly, Selah sits up and unbraids her hair - until it 
           is loose, and silver down her back in the moonlight. 

           They lie next to each other for a while - each looking up at the 
           stars. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Your mother was so beautiful. 

           Selah draws a breath - his words catching her unawares in the 
           dark. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        All mothers are beautiful, of course. 
                        When they are with child, or with a 
                        daughter on their hip, all mothers are 
                        beautiful. The beauty of a thing being 
                        what it is meant to be.

           He sighs - reminiscing. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        But even so - your mother was...

           The Shepherd leans over, and touches Selah’s hair - the blonde has 
           been turned almost silver in the moonlight. He holds it between 
           his fingers. Marvelling at it. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        I remember when I saw her, looking so 
                        lost. Travelling on a lonely road, her 
                        thumb outstretched.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        And I knew she would be a wife, one of 
                        my wives, and I saw what she would look 
                        like in robes, and how she would look 
                        like with her belly full, and how she 
                        would stand with a daughter on her hip.

           And then, his hand trails gently over Selah’s face - lightly. The 
           most delicate touch. Selah has almost stopped breathing.

           The hand trails lower - over her bare collarbone.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        But I think, when I first saw her on 
                        the side of the road - that was when 
                        she was most beautiful. When she held 
                        the promise of being a mother. The 
                        promise that all daughters hold. 

           His fingers trail their way down Selah’s bare arms, until they 
           reach her hands.

           He entwines their fingers - pressing her hand into the dust, the 
           promise of dominance, of violence - before letting go.

           And then, as if nothing has happened, the Shepherd gets up, 
           brushing off his robe. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Good night my sweet Selah. I always 
                        enjoy my talks with you. 

           He leaves her, lying on the cold ground. 

           After a moment, Selah begins to shake with a delayed reaction. A 
           tear trails out from the corner of her eye.

           Lying on the ground - she grips the ground where he pressed her 
           hand into the dirt, and makes a fist.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Selah re-enters the tent. All the sisters are wide awake, waiting 
           for her.

                                 EVELYN
                        What did he want? Why did he call you 
                        out in the night? 

                                 TAMAR
                             (reaching for Selah)
                        Selah, what happened..? 
           Selah ignores them, pushing Tamar’s comforting hands away, and 
           sits on the ground, cross-legged. 

           She takes a deep breath - then begins to speak. 

                                 SELAH
                        There once was a woman. And she was a 
                        wild woman. Made of moonlight, and 
                        teeth.

           You could hear a pin drop. The tent is silent. Captivated.

           Her voice has the cadence of a sermon, or chant - but older. 
           Almost tribal. It has the feel of an ancient story, long forgotten 
           - and only remembered now. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        And her face was half dark and half 
                        light - for she was a moon woman, and 
                        lived in both worlds. 

           Tamar touches the side of her face - where her birthmark is. 
           Wondering. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        And sometimes, she would roam in the 
                        bush. Looking for something. Hunting. 

                                 EVELYN
                             (whispering)
                        Selah, you can’t... this isn’t one of 
                        Shepherd’s stories. 

           But Selah ignores her. Continues on. 

                                 SELAH
                        And the wind and the dust would speak 
                        to her. Talk to her and tell her tales. 
                        Tell her where to go. Tell her to be 
                        free. 

           At that exact moment - a gust of wind blows through the tent, 
           bringing dust and leaves from outside. 

           Some of the girls scream, others shield their eyes. 

           Only Selah remains unmoving. 

           They uncover their faces, and there is a new look in their eyes as 
           they look at her. 

           Faith. And fear. 
           EXT. LAKE EYRE - LAKE’S EDGE - MORNING

           The sisters and wives are gathered at the edge of the lake. The 
           sisters’ hair is intricately braided - pulled back from their 
           youthful faces.

           The wives’ hair is long and unbound. Their unbound hair is 
           shocking, after seeing it braided for so long - it is an intimacy 
           to see the wives this way. They look tired - exhausted and 
           dehydrated from fasting.

           The Shepherd stands at the edge of the lake - his arms 
           outstretched theatrically towards the rising sun. His dogs at his 
           feet. 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        A time of rebirth. A time to wash away 
                        our sins. A time to reclaim our purity, 
                        from this impure, corrupting world. 

           With that - the Shepherd starts to walk into the lake, using his 
           staff to steady himself, and the wives and sisters follow.

           The red, dried mud crunches beneath their feet, until it becomes 
           mud, then shallow water, as they get deeper into the lake.

           The dogs stay on the shore. Vigilant.

           EXT. LAKE EYRE - SHALLOWS - CONTINUOUS

           The sisters are in a line, one by one - with the littlest being 
           carried at the end. The wives stand behind them. 

           Evelyn is first - the Shepherd gently lowers her backwards, until 
           she is completely submerged - then raises her again. 

           Selah is next. The Shepherd approaches her, and they lock eyes. 
           Almost a challenge between them.

           He lifts a single strand of her blonde hair - looking at it in the 
           sunlight. 

           Selah tenses, but before she can do anything, she is falling, 
           flailing through the water. His strong hands pushing her down.

           She struggles - there is a ROARING in her ears, and she sees the 
           sun FLASH WHITE through the water above her -

           And then she is up. Gasping. 

           Freshly baptized. 

           The Shepherd has already moved on.  
           Then he comes to Tamar - looking at her with distaste. But, he 
           folds her back into the water, covering her completely in the 
           lake’s waters, before bringing her back up. 

           Selah watches closely, tense as the Shepherd touches Tamar. 

           As Tamar comes back up through the water, for a moment - in slow 
           motion - the water is unbroken over her face. Like a second skin.

           And then Tamar is up, gasping. The Shepherd has moved on down the 
           line. 

           Tamar turns to Selah, her eyes bright and shining. Her joy almost 
           infectious. 

                                 TAMAR
                        Did you feel it? 

                                 SELAH
                        What?  

           Tamar smiles at her - radiant. 

                                 TAMAR
                        I feel different.

                                 SELAH
                        Like the Shepherd said? 

           Tamar nods. She leans in to whisper - for Selah’s ears only. 

                                 TAMAR
                             (whispering)
                        I think this is a sacred space. Even 
                        before he bought us here. Look at this 
                        place - how could this beauty not be 
                        sacred? 

           Selah looks at the calm waters of the lake around them. The birds 
           wheeling overhead.

                                 SELAH
                             (whispering)
                        But don’t you feel it? We don’t belong 
                        here. This isn’t our sacred place. 

           Tamar looks confused, and starts to ask why -

           There is a baby’s wail from the end of the line - the youngest 
           sister has been baptized.

           The Shepherd wades back to the middle - addressing all the 
           sisters, and the wives standing behind them. 
                                 SHEPHERD
                        My children. My dear sweet sisters. You 
                        have done well - you are now all 
                        cleansed. As I submerged you - I saved 
                        you. 

           He spreads his arms wide - charismatic. Handsome. He points 
           back towards the lake’s edge. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Sisters - return to the shore. Wait for 
                        us there. Wives, we must go out 
                        further. Our sin is far too deep for 
                        these shallow waters. 

           The sisters slowly turn, and start to make their way back to the 
           shore. Only Selah lingers. Walking slower than the others. A 
           premonition.  

           When Selah is almost at the shore, she turns back. The wives 
           and the Shepherd have stopped, and the Shepherd appears to be 
           preaching to them. 

           The wind whips across the surface of the lake, bringing 
           snatches of the Shepherd's words to her. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (indistinct)
                        Must sacrifice.... only way to be 
                        safe... The sisters.

           Selah shields her eyes from the glare of the lake. Trying to 
           get a closer look. The wives appear to be arguing, and one of 
           them almost turns to go back to shore - 

           But then, the Shepherd turns, and begins to wade out into the vast 
           lake.

           And one by one, the wives follow him. 

           Maria and Hannah are two of the last to follow. Maria is grasping 
           Hannah's hand. Holding it tightly, as they wade deeper into the 
           lake. 

           None of them look back. 

           Their white robes growing more and more indistinct, until they are 
           just tiny white dots in the distance. 

           Out into the deep water. 
           EXT. LAKE EYRE - SHALLOWS

           The sisters sit at the banks of the lake. Waiting. 

           The dogs sit a little way off, alert for their master to return. 

           Selah sits in the water, alone. The tiny ripples of the lake 
           lapping at her wet robes, over her crossed legs.

           Selah looks at her hands, covered in red dust and mud, hovering 
           over the water.

           The WHITE LIGHT glints off the surface, the colours around Selah 
           starting to white out. The DULL ROAR in Selah’s ears begins 
           softly. She is hallucinating again. 

           But then, Tamar joins her - sitting in the water as well. 

                                 SELAH
                        I was wrong before. 

           Tamar looks at her. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I do feel different now. I’m not 
                        sure how. But -

           Selah puts her hands in the water - the red dust and mud washing 
           away. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        I have been carrying this heaviness, 
                        Tamar. Like a stone, it sits in my 
                        stomach, eating at me.
                             (beat)
                        This doubt. About what to do. About - 
                        what I’ve done. 

           Tamar looks at her - understanding that Selah is finally opening 
           up. 

           Under the water, Selah’s hands now look pale and clean. Pure 
           again.

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        But maybe - but maybe now they do feel 
                        a bit lighter. And I have hope. That I 
                        won’t always feel this dark heaviness 
                        inside me.

           Tamar looks at Selah - her expression filled with love, and a bit 
           of sadness. 
                                 TAMAR
                             (gently rebuking)
                        Sister-mine - did you not think? 

           Tamar reaches over - and kisses Selah on the forehead.

           It is the opposite of the Shepherd’s display of dominance before - 
           it is so light, and so filled with love. 

                                 TAMAR (CONT’D)
                        Any burden will crush you, if you do 
                        not let your sisters help you carry it. 
                        And any weight you hold, can be shared, 
                        until it feels like nothing at all. 

           The DULL ROAR in the background stops - cutting out completely. 
           The colours stop whiting out. 

           Selah is at peace. Here with her sister. 

           It is just the sound of the lake, peacefully lapping at both of 
           their legs. The distant sounds of birds above them. 

           And in the distance - across the water, there is a GLINT of white 
           light - fading, fading.

           EXT. LAKE EYRE - LAKE’S EDGE - DAY - LATER

           Selah, Evelyn and Tamar are playing a game of chasey with the 
           other girls - shrieking and laughing. 

           The dogs start BARKING, and the girls all look to the lake, 
           shielding their eyes - looking for the Shepherd and the wives. 

           But it is just the Shepherd. Slowly making his way back to shore. 

           Alone. 

           He reaches them, and leans on his staff - exhausted. 

           He slicks his hair back from his face - it is long, and tangled 
           from the lake’s water. In his bedraggled state, the Shepherd looks 
           less powerful - smaller.   

           Selah steps forward - pointing out to the vast lake.  

                                 SELAH
                             (angrily)
                        Where are the wives?

           He straightens - the old Shepherd once more. Imperious, and in 
           control. 
                                 SHEPHERD
                        I have good news, my dear faithful 
                        ones. There has been a miracle. 

           His voice is smooth, and deep - and he is as calm as if he is 
           standing at a pulpit.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        The sacred lake of rebirth has given 
                        the wives the gift of eternal life. 
                        They have ascended.

                                 EVELYN
                        Ascended?

                                 TAMAR
                        But where..? 

                                 SHEPHERD
                        It is only their earthly shells that 
                        have been left behind.

           And then suddenly - the spell is broken.

           There are screams, as they realise. Their mothers are gone.

           Some of the sisters run towards the lake, Evelyn among them, and 
           Selah and Tamar hold them back, trying to keep them from the 
           water’s edge. 

           But then, the dogs are there, black-and-white furies. 

           Snapping and herding, following the Shepherd’s shouted commands, 
           until the sisters are all standing in a little huddle.

           The Shepherd stands in front of the group - and then for the first 
           time, kneels. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                             (to the group of sisters)
                        As we travelled, we sacrificed the 
                        lambs. They were your death. But this - 
                        this is your rebirth.

           He places his hands on his thighs, palm up - open, beseeching. 
           Almost begging. His eyes look straight into Selah’s.

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        It is the only way. For the sisters to 
                        become the wives. 

           And suddenly - it is all so clear. It has always been clear. 

           It was always going to end this way.
                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        Selah. My sweet Selah. Come. 

           As if in a daze, Selah steps forward. Her hair is still in its 
           careful braid for the baptism - from a lifetime ago. 

           She steps up to the kneeling Shepherd, and he carefully turns her, 
           gently unbraiding her hair, until it hangs long and loose around 
           her. Like it did that night. 

           He turns her back around, and smiles at the halo of blonde hair 
           around her face.

           Selah looks at him, and says something indistinct. 

                                 SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
                        What was that, my Selah?

           He leans in, and she presses her lips right up against his ear. 

                                 SELAH
                             (whispering)
                        You are not our Shepherd. 

           He rears back - shocked. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        You are not our Shepherd.
                             (to the sisters)
                        Your path is false. Your words are 
                        lies. You cannot be our Shepherd, for 
                        you do not know the way. 

           She is using his language against him - his own rhetoric.

           His face twists, and the ugly darkness that is always just 
           underneath the surface comes rushing up. 

           He SLAPS her - the sound is shocking. His huge form towering over 
           hers. 

           Selah is unbroken. Unmoving. 

           He slaps her again. But Selah remains standing - a tree rooted 
           deep, in the face of a summer storm. Regal. 

           The Shepherd turns, and looks at the sisters.

           They huddle together, still afraid of him and his dogs - but they 
           all look at Selah like they used to look at him. As if she could 
           conquer anything. 

           Tamar’s beautiful, marked face looks out at Selah - pride and love 
           in her face. 
           The Shepherd is weaker than her. 

           He SCREAMS - a burst of frustration. Of rage. A child, deprived of 
           his toys.  

           Then, before Selah can move, he strides into the huddle, and grabs 
           Tamar by the arm, dragging her free, as Evelyn tries to hold onto 
           her. 

           He strides towards the lake, walking to the water with Tamar in 
           his arms, and it is chaos, and Selah is screaming and clawing at 
           him -

           - he flings Tamar into the shallow, red mud on the lake’s edge. 

           And with a shouted word from him, the dogs are on Tamar.

           Tamar tries to get up, but they are at her face, at her neck, and 
           she slips and tries to cover her face with her arms. 

           Selah is struggling to get to her, but the Shepherd is restraining 
           her as Selah kicks and screams - 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        Tamar! Tamar!!

           And then, Tamar lies still in the mud. 

           The Shepherd whistles, and the dogs return to him.

           He releases Selah, and she runs to Tamar - pushing at her, 
           pulling, but she won’t get up, she won’t move. 

           The Shepherd stands at the lake’s edge - triumphant. Secure in his 
           power again. 

           As Selah looks at him -

           He seems to shrink in front of her. Becoming lesser. 

           Becoming just a man. 

           That DULL ROAR sounds, louder and louder- 

           From the edges in, her VISION FINALLY WHITES OUT COMPLETELY, 
           the madness overtaking her -

           A kaleidoscope of images - frenetic, chaotic, so fast we 
           almost can't make sense of them. Over them all, the DULL ROAR 
           of Selah's visions.

           - Selah ripping at the Shepherd, pulling at his beard and 
           hair with maniac strength. The wind whipping around them, 
           dust in his eyes, blinding him. 
           - The sisters helping her, swarming him, madness in their 
           teeth and eyes. 

           - The Shepherd falling, tripping over his own robes. 

           - The dogs barking and snapping, as one of the sisters grabs 
           a rock, bringing it down on the Shepherd's mouth, his teeth 
           crunching. 

           - The dogs barking and snapping, biting Evelyn on her arm - 
           before she flings it off, hitting it with the Shepherd’s 
           staff where it has fallen from his grasp, hitting until the 
           dog lies still on the ground. 

           - Selah, bloodied, standing atop the Shepherd’s wheezing 
           body, his breath rattling in his throat. She leans down, and 
           whispers in his ear, her mouth still bloody from where she 
           bit him. 

                                 SELAH (CONT’D)
                        We were always stronger than you. 
                        It's in our blood to be stronger 
                        than you. We just didn't know it 
                        yet. 

           - FINALLY, She raises her hands to the sky in triumph, in 
           madness - gripping bits of the Shepherd’s hair in her hands.

           She screams, and the sisters scream with her, and the DULL 
           ROAR in the background harmonizes with her, the two sounds 
           finally merging-

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE EYRE - DAY

           A sweeping aerial shot, of a giant dried-up lake bed. (NB: A 
           repeat of the opening shot.)

           We hear the same eerie harmonies - realising now that it is the 
           same song the wives sing, but in a haunting minor key. 

           But this time, the camera pans - and we see a small plume of dust 
           rising. Towards the middle of the lake. 

           A police car.

           The technology is startling, after so long in this world of dust 
           and sky. 
           We get closer and closer, sweeping behind the car, engulfed by the 
           dust thrown up in its wake. 

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. DRIED UP LAKE BED -  LATE AFTERNOON

           Two cops stand on the dried up lake bed - looking down at 
           something, half buried by the dried up mud. One is OLDER and one 
           is YOUNGER. 

           They’re dressed in modern police uniforms, although the country 
           version - their sleeves are short, and their uniforms look well-
           worn. 

           Piles of dead pelicans surround them, sad tufts of feathers  - 
           victims of feast turned to famine. 

           The older cop sighs, and crouches down, making a note on a MAP OF 
           THE LAKE.

           The younger cop takes picture after picture - careful to not 
           disturb the evidence.

           (NB: the flash on his camera is NOT on.)

                                 OLDER COP
                        Who reported it? 

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Tourists. They called the office - I 
                        took the call, said we’d check it out. 
                        They came to the lake bed for some 
                        sightseeing, and found them. 

           And from another angle, we see what they’re looking at.

           A dried up body, half encased in mud. Dressed in a once-white 
           robe. A hand outflung to the side. Tufts of its long hair blow in 
           the wind. 

           The older cop stands up, and looks out at the lake bed - shielding 
           his eyes in the sun. Seeing the other white dots, scattered across 
           the lake bed. 

           They walk to the next body. And the next. And the next. Until 
           they’ve seen every last one. 

           All of the wives. Left where they fell. 

           The younger cop marks where each of the bodies lies on his map 
           with careful crosses. 
                                 OLDER COP
                        Can’t confirm until the autopsies, but 
                        I’d say they all drowned.

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        So, must have been at least a month 
                        ago. When the lake was flooded. 
                        Surprised that there’s this much of 
                        them left.

                                 OLDER COP
                        The mud must have preserved them, at 
                        least partially.

           The older cop looks at the map in the younger cop’s hands. 

                                 OLDER COP (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the other thing? 

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        At the old campsite. Near the hill. 

           EXT. LAKE EYRE CAMPSITE -  DUSK

           The two cops stand on either side of a strange, beautiful tableau. 

           Looking at the dead body of Shepherd. 

           He lies naked, spread-eagled on the ground - his hands and legs 
           bound, stretched out impossibly wide. 

           His hair and beard are bloody and patchy, as if chunks have been 
           ripped out in places, and his hands are covered in defensive 
           wounds. His mouth is bloody.

           He has been stretched out over the body of a ram - his back bowing 
           over the carcass, its horns digging into his side. The ram’s horn 
           necklace is still around his neck. 

           At his feet - the dead black-and-white bodies of four sheepdogs. 
           Their jaws unhinged, their legs broken. 

           A little way away from this macabre, grim site - there is what 
           remains of a pyre. The ash mostly blown away. 

           And in the centre of the pyre - a tiny skull. A lamb’s skull. With 
           a tiny braided piece of wool placed under it. 

           After a long moment of silence-

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Well, this is fucked. 
                                 OLDER COP
                        Yup. 

           They both consider the scene again. It doesn’t look any better. 

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Got anything to do with the woman out 
                        in the centre? 

                                 OLDER COP
                             (shrugging)
                        Probably a good bet they’re related.

           He looks at the rest of the campsite. 

                                 OLDER COP (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna have a look around. 

           The younger cop gets out his camera again, and starts to take 
           pictures of the Shepherd.

           In the flash of the camera's light, it almost looks as if the man 
           and the ram are one, as if he has sunk into its pelt. 

           The older cop returns. 

                                 OLDER COP (CONT’D)
                        Something up this way. For your camera. 

           EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING LAKE EYRE -  SUNSET

           At the top of the ridge - a strange effigy. 

           It is two dolls - woven from white sheep’s wool, and affixed to a 
           shepherd's staff. A braid of black hair dangles from it. 

           One is of a woman - exaggeratedly feminine, all wide hips and lush 
           breasts, in the style of primitive fertility icons. 

           The doll’s face is bisected - smeared with a paste of red mud and 
           ash, down one side.

           By her side is a second doll. A tiny lamb. Tethered to her. Part 
           of her flock. 

           The younger cop takes pictures of them - then looks out across the 
           desert, where faint tracks can just be seen.

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        How many do you reckon? 
                                 OLDER COP
                        At least 50, maybe a hundred. And some 
                        tracks. Looked like kids’ feet - 
                        heading north. Back into the desert. 

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Who’d bring a flock of sheep here...? 
                        And kids?

           The older cop shrugs.

                                 OLDER COP
                        Used to be pretty common to come up 
                        here, for the lake flooding. Along the 
                        old droving roads. Haven’t heard of 
                        anyone doing it for a while though. 
                        Most of the tracks aren’t in good shape 
                        anymore.

           He looks across over the desert again. 

                                 OLDER COP (CONT’D)
                        Something to follow up tomorrow. 
                        Getting too dark now. 

           The younger cop takes one last picture of the doll, before putting 
           his camera away. They start back towards the car.

           INT/EXT. POLICE CAR - DUSK

           The older cop drives, while the younger cop looks out the window 
           at the lake.

           Both lost in their thoughts. About what they saw at the lake.

           The younger cop turns around - looking at the sun setting over the 
           desert behind them. 

           Just as the sun dips below the horizon -

           There is a FINAL WHITE FLASH. Only visible for a moment. Lighting 
           up the desert. 

           The cop turns back in his seat. 

           They drive on. 

           Red dust spirals up, forming shapes and whirls in their wake.

           THE END
