           Kingmaker 

           king-mey-ker / noun: 

           1. a person outside the royal or political ranks who brings 
           leaders to power through the covert exercise of influence.
           The definition fades into the onyx blackness, leaving only 
           “Kingmaker.” Like a vintage flip clock, a flap flips down 
           replacing “maker” with “breaker.”

           TITLE UP: THE KINGBREAKER

           OVER CREDITS: STOCK FOOTAGE--

           REVOLUTIONS all over the globe. Hell on earth being raised in 
           an attempt to create utopia-- 

           CUBA, 1961. Armed EXILES storm the beach during the Bay of 
           Pigs, scores surrender. FIDEL CASTRO wildly denounces the 
           failed American-backed invasion.

           IRAN, 1979. Protestors burn and stomp pictures of the Shah. 
           The AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI’s fiery eyes glare down at them from 
           posters being waved.

           KOSOVO, 1998. NATO planes drop bombs on Serbian kill squads. 
           SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC stands trial for war crimes at The Hague. 

           SYRIA, 2011. Rioters hurl Molotov cocktails at RIOT COPS. 
           Whole blocks burn. BASHAR AL-ASSAD gives a defiant interview.

           LIBYA, 2012. MUAMMAR GADDAFI strides through an opulent 
           palace. Now bloodied, he sits in a truck bed, terrified and 
           surrounded by an angry mob toting AK-47s. 

           EGYPT, 2013. A million demonstrators mass in Tahrir Square, 
           CHANTING and SINGING. Soldiers fire into the crowd. President 
           HOSNI MUBARAK awaits trial behind bars.

           TURKEY, 2016. Tanks roll through Istanbul. President RECEP 
           TAYYIP ERDOGAN implores his people to take to the streets and 
           stop the attempted coup. Police barricade state buildings as 
           protestors amass outside. 

           END CREDITS.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. PERIMETER WALL - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - DUSK

           PROTESTERS rally outside a barricaded checkpoint. A phalanx 
           of SOLDIERS in RIOT GEAR stand SHIELD-TO-SHIELD.

           DOZENS of SECRET POLICE, known as “The Krypteia,” back them 
           up from positions atop transport trucks and two guard towers. 
           Clad head-to-toe in BLACK body armor and slung with H&K G36 
           ASSAULT RIFLES, these elite forces are easily distinguishable 
           from the regulars. Faces obscured behind BALLISTIC FACE 
           MASKS. Their presence feels cold, menacing. 

           Despite the overwhelming show of force, protesters continue 
           their CHANT. 

           SUP: Tarmania. Right Now.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

           Welcome to Tarmania, a country on the Balkan peninsula that’s 
           so tiny most people wouldn’t know if we made it up or not.

           Dilapidated buildings line the pot-holed street. Most are 
           pockmarked with decades-old scars of bombs and bullets.

           CLOSE ON: A SPEED LIMIT SIGN reads 35 KPH. “BRANKO OUT! 
           FREEDOM NOW!” has been GRAFFITIED over it. 

           WHOOSH! 

           POLICE, light bars flashing, rush past like a locomotive 
           leading a freight train of LUXURY VEHICLES. They clearly 
           don’t give a shit about the speed limit.  

           Sandwiched between a COLUMN of MERCEDES G-WAGONS, POLICE CARS 
           and MOTORCYCLES, is a blacked-out-- 

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM (MOVING)

           Its spacious cabin is decked-out with rare-wood panelling 
           inlaid with flat-screen displays. 

           Reclined in a plush leather seat, a GENTLEMAN with an aura of 
           importance gazes out the window. A bespoke suit emphasizes 
           his athletic build, crested with a classic fade. All but the 
           handsome curves of his face are obscured by shadows. 

           We’ll call him... BOB... yep, just Bob. 

           EXT. PERIMETER WALL - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

           The MOTORCADE slows as it approaches the picket line. Police 
           WHOOP their SIRENS, trying to get protestors to make way.
           INT. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM (SLOWING)

           Bob looks to the other passenger, GENERAL VUKOVIC (50s), who 
           sits erect in formal dress uniform adorned with a chest-full 
           of medals. You could put this guy in a Hawaiian shirt and 
           Birkenstocks and his stoic demeanor would still scream “not 
           to be fucked with.” 

           The General checks his WATCH. Bob notices. 

                                 BOB
                        President said 7 o’clock. Nervous 
                        you’re going to make the belle late 
                        to the ball? 

           Vukovic doesn’t acknowledge the comment. 

                                 BOB
                        Don’t blame you. I’ve seen what he 
                        does to people who make him wait.    

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                             (cutting)
                        If we are late it will be thanks to 
                        these traitors you drummed up.

                                 BOB
                        Revolutionaries are only traitors 
                        until they win. 

           EXT. PERIMETER WALL - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           The protestors reluctantly part as police YELL THREATS over a 
           PA SYSTEM. The motorcade slinks through the crowd...

           I/E. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM (MOVING)

           Bob peers through the bullet-proof glass as those feeling 
           particularly brave take parting shots. Some SLAM FISTS on the 
           sides of the vehicles and JEER loudly as the car passes. 

           EXT. PERIMETER WALL - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           The Krypteia watch the mob ROCK their commander’s car side-to-
           side. They’ve had enough and FIRE into the crowd-- 

           Protestors SCREAM and FLEE, leaving the wounded behind.
           I/E. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM (MOVING)

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        What do you call them now? Martyrs?

           Bob eyes the massacre with an almost reptilian apathy. 

                                 BOB
                        Useless. 

           EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

           The convoy clears the SECURITY GATE. It travels down a 
           driveway long enough to land a jumbo jet. 

           At the end, the drive weaves around a massive fountain and 
           under the porte-cochère of a monstrous PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. 
           Colored LED lights accent its gargantuan stone edifice. 

           The COMPOUND covers ten square blocks. SECRET POLICE stand-
           guard at every possible point of entry.

           The Rolls stops at a RED CARPET. Follow the crimson silk road 
           to a GRAND DOOR.

           TWENTY SECRET POLICE dismount and form a perimeter. SERVANTS 
           open the Rolls Royce’s doors. 

           Bob’s Italian-leather shoes step down to the carpet.

           We get our first full look at his 30-something FACE-- CHEEKS 
           BRUISED BLACK AND BLUE, SWOLLEN. Contrasting his dapper 
           dress, his mug looks like he’s been through hell and back.

           Police salute and stand at attention. 

           Vukovic steps out and returns their reverence with a stiff 
           salute. Bob just nods dismissively.  

           The servants escort them into the-- 

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           Bob and General Vukovic are ushered through the grand 
           entrance, a labyrinth of giant rooms. Everything is plated, 
           gilded, trimmed, embroidered or cast in solid GOLD. 

           Think Donald Trump on... well, Donald Trump.
           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           Massive and opulent. Waterford crystal chandeliers hang over 
           a fifty-foot Italian marble dining table.

           Bob and General Vukovic enter, accompanied by servants. They 
           show Bob to his place setting. The General stays by the door.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        This is where I leave you.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, you’re not joining us? Surely 
                        Branko invites a man of your esteem 
                        to dinners like this all the time.

           They both know that’s not true. The General’s slighted. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        President Zahradnic insisted that 
                        it be just the two of you tonight. 

           He leaves the room. 

           Bob stands there awkwardly, flanked by servants. 

           He checks out his place setting. A dozen pieces of gold 
           flatware surround a fine china plate hand-painted with the 
           President’s seal. 

           He eyes an ANTIQUE GOLD GRANDFATHER CLOCK that towers against 
           the wall across from him. Bob’s gaze focuses on its SECOND 
           HAND, methodically TICKING. His host is late.

           Speak of the devil-- a door at the end of the room OPENS.

           Draped in an even finer suit, PRESIDENT BRANKO ZAHRADNIC 
           (50s) enters with a stately stride. He greets Bob with a 
           veneer-white garish grin and open arms. Branko speaks with a 
           vaguely Eastern-European accent.

                                 BRANKO
                        Bob! So good to see you.

           Branko is good-looking in the conventional sense, but 
           something is off. His face is unnaturally smooth. Skin pulled 
           tight like a drum. His plastic surgeon was going for Don 
           Draper but ended up with Wayne Newton. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Welcome back to Tarmania! Thank you 
                        for accepting my invitation. 
                                 BOB
                        Well, my schedule freed up so...

           Branko lets out a HAUGHTY CHUCKLE.

                                 BRANKO
                        I missed that sense of humor. Come 
                        here, old friend.

           He gives Bob a stiff embrace and a kiss on each cheek, which 
           Bob accepts uncomfortably. 

                                 BRANKO
                        I’m sorry you’ve had to go through 
                        so much trouble.

                                 BOB
                        It’s all part of the job.

                                 BRANKO
                        And what a magnificent job you’ve 
                        done. 

           Servants pull out their chairs. Bob and Branko take their 
           seats at opposite sides of the lengthy table.

                                 BOB
                        I should say the same to you. Love 
                        what you’ve done with the place. 

                                 BRANKO
                        I owe it all to you. You helped me 
                        ascend this throne, and thanks to 
                        you I will remain firmly seated 
                        upon it. So tonight let us break 
                        bread in a feast of celebration. 

           He raises his chalice to Bob. 

                                 BRANKO
                        To The Kingbreaker! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GOTHIC CATHEDRAL - DAY

           SUP: Berlin. 180 Days Ago.

           Bob sits in the back row. His tattered clothes, ratty beard 
           and shaggy hair give him the appearance of a HOMELESS MAN.

           He watches a humble WEDDING in progress. The bride and groom 
           exchange rings and kiss. They shed tears of joy.
           Bob squints like he’s trying to figure something out. Cocks 
           his head to the side like he has ahold of the answer, but it 
           slips away. He shakes his head in disappointment. 

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Are you with the bride or groom?

           SAM JONES (60s) walks down the aisle behind him. Sam is a 
           born Texan. His stocky frame suggests he was once formidable, 
           but being behind a desk for the last couple decades has 
           earned him a potbelly.  

                                 BOB
                             (German)
                        <Sorry, I don’t speak English.> 

                                 SAM
                        Don’t give me that shit. I scanned 
                        for frequencies before I came in. 
                        We’re clear.

           He takes a seat next to Bob. 

                                 SAM
                        I have another op for you.

                                 BOB
                        Not talking until you hand over the 
                        goods. 

                                 SAM
                        I fly halfway across the world and 
                        that’s how you greet me? 

                                 BOB
                        You opened with “I have another 
                        op,” so... 

           Sam’s really annoyed now.

                                 SAM
                        Like your fucking delivery boy. 
                        Christ. 

           Sam looks up at the crucifix in the front and self-
           consciously crosses himself.

           He pulls a MCDONALD’S BAG from a backpack, slings it to Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Extra pickles, extra special sauce?
                                 SAM
                        Of course. Want me to put on an 
                        apron and say “have it your way”?

                                 BOB
                        That’s Burger King.

           Whatever. Bob digs in ravenously. Sam watches, disgusted.

                                 SAM
                        You look like shit, partner. Stink 
                        like shit, too.   

                                 BOB
                        I’m a bum. Gotta smell the part. 

                                 SAM
                        What on earth for?  

                                 BOB
                        Being homeless is the perfect 
                        cover. No one looks me in the eyes. 
                        Cops never ask me for I-D. Shelters 
                        give me hot meals. Tourists give me 
                        change. 

                                 SAM
                        Guy with a two-grand-a-week agency 
                        stipend chooses to live like a bum. 
                        You’re a real piece of work. 

                                 BOB
                        You come here to stroke my ego or 
                        tell me about an op?

           Sam hesitates for a beat. He goes to speak--

                                 BOB
                        And spare me the grandstanding. 
                        Who’s the target?

           Bob rummages through the bag of food.

                        Branko Zahradnic.

                                 BOB
                        Whoa, whoa whoa. Hold on. 

                                 SAM
                        Now hey, I get that taking down a  
                        guy you installed is a tall order, 
                        but look at it as a new challenge.
                                 BOB
                        You have got to be kidding me.  

                                 SAM
                        Come on. I really need you to play 
                        ball, Bob. We need our best regime-
                        change guy on this one.

                                 BOB
                        What? I’m not talking about the op. 
                        They forgot my barbecue sauce.

           Sam understands the miscommunication. Pulls out some BBQ 
           SAUCE PACKETS from his backpack, gives them to Bob.

                                 BOB
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ about... 

           Bob peels one open, dunks a handful of fries and consumes 
           them with satisfaction.  

                                 SAM
                        So what do you say? Branko’s 
                        starting to make the North Koreans 
                        look like humanitarians. Black-
                        bagging dissidents. Public 
                        executions...  

                                 BOB
                             (interrupts)
                        Fine, whatever. I’ll do it. 
                        Changing a regime is like changing 
                        a light bulb. I’ve got no loyalty 
                        to the guy. Who’s our “Mandela”?

           Relieved, Sam hands over a FILE.

                                 SAM
                        Here’s the brief on his 
                        replacement. We’ve already got a 
                        safe house up and running, and the 
                        Puzzle Palace owns his closed-
                        circuit network. 

                                 BOB
                        Wonderful. Give me 72 hours to work 
                        my magic. I’ll need a suite at the 
                        Ritz. And have them confirm that 
                        the mattress is a Tempur-Pedic. I 
                        need that Swedish sleep.  
                                 SAM
                        Oh okay, I’ll make sure they leave 
                        extra towels, too. Jesus, I’m not 
                        your fucking travel agent either.  

           Sam self-consciously crosses himself again.

                                 BOB
                        You gonna keep doing that?

           Sam gives him the MIDDLE FINGER. Bob grins.

                                 SAM
                        Are you gonna keep insisting that 
                        we meet in churches? 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t tell me you found God.  

                                 BOB
                        What I found is a one-stop shop for 
                        observing human emotion. Weddings, 
                        christenings, funerals... 

                                 SAM
                        So you’re using it like a zoo?

                                 BOB
                        Your words, Sam... Just trying to 
                        figure out what I’ve been missing.

                                 SAM
                        It’s called empathy. And it ain’t 
                        in the job description, Bob. We 
                        pick sociopaths for a reason.

           Bob bristles at that word. 

                                 BOB
                        Do you really need to go labeling 
                        people? And you say I’m the one who 
                        doesn’t understand feelings...

           Sam rolls his eyes.

           The wedding procession makes its way up the aisle and out of 
           the cathedral. As a GUEST walks past, he pauses to shake 
           Sam’s hand. 

                                 GUEST
                             (German)
                        <Good for you, sir, feeding the 
                        needy. You’re a kind soul.>
                                 SAM
                        <It’s the least I could do.>

           Sam smiles and nods. Bob grins like the Cheshire Cat through 
           his Special-Sauce-soaked beard. Good cover, huh?

           When the guest is out of ear-shot, Sam drops his smile.

                                 SAM
                             (to Bob)
                        You smug son of a bitch.

           EXT. COMMERZBANK ATM - NIGHT 

           Bob wheels a ratty SUITCASE up to an ATM in a posh section of 
           Berlin. He inserts a card. The balance of his CIA account has 
           a lot of zeros. 100 EURO notes WHIR out of the machine. 

           INT. LOBBY - RITZ-CARLTON, BERLIN - NIGHT

           Bellhops and concierge glare as Bob shuffles up to reception. 
           There’s no way a bum can afford this hotel.

           They’re shocked to find he actually has a reservation.

           INT. SUITE - RITZ-CARLTON - LATER

           Bob unzips the suitcase to reveal all the necessities of a 
           luxury traveler, including a tailored SUIT and a neatly 
           organized TOILETRY KIT.

           He showers off the grime in silence, steam swirls around his 
           weathered, but chiseled physique.

           Bob stares coldly into the mirror as he meticulously shaves 
           with a straight-razor.

           In a hotel-branded robe, he studies the file on Branko and 
           his opposition. Swipes through articles on a TABLET: mostly 
           accusations of corruption, ostentatious displays of wealth.

           LATER

           Bob’s hit a wall with the research. Now dressed in the SUIT, 
           he KNOTS his tie and SPLASHES on some cologne. 

           INT. LOBBY BAR - RITZ-CARLTON - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob slides up to the bar next to a WOMAN dressed a little 
           tawdry for this joint. Her bright RED drink is almost empty.
                                 BOB
                        It’d be a shame if a woman as 
                        beautiful as yourself was drinking 
                        alone tonight.

                                 WOMAN
                        Then it’s a shame. Care to join me?

           She went for that a little too easily. 

                                 BOB
                        Absolutely. Can I get you another 
                        cranberry juice? 

                                 WOMAN
                             (surprised)
                        Wait, how did you know...? 

                                 BOB
                        Or, we could skip ahead to the part 
                        where you tell me you’re “working” 
                        tonight, and we go up to my suite. 
                        Already hit the ATM. I’m flush. 

           He flashes the wad of CASH.

                                 WOMAN
                        All business. Yeah, works for me. 

           Bob turns, heads for the door. She follows tentatively.

           INT. SUITE - THE RITZ-CARLTON - LATER

           The fun just ended, if you can call it that. Bob stares 
           blankly at the ceiling, deep in thought. Thin linen sheets 
           display the opaque silhouettes of their nude bodies.

           The woman slides out of bed, pulls on her dress and ZIPS it. 
           She grabs the rest of the CASH off the table.

           She glances over at Bob, still off in his own world. 

                                 WOMAN
                        You know, you’re actually a good 
                        looking guy. Probably wouldn’t have 
                        to pay for sex.

                                 BOB
                        Like you said, all business. I 
                        prefer it this way.

                                 WOMAN
                        Nobody prefers it this way. 
           But her insight’s totally lost on Bob... 

           ...he’s already moved on, now watching Looney Toons on his 
           tablet- the crafty ROAD RUNNER dupes WILE E. COYOTE into 
           being flattened by his own anvil.

           She slips out as Bob giggles like a kid on Saturday morning. 

           Then, an IDEA hits him. 

           EXT. MONTE CARLO - DAY

           SUP: Monte Carlo. 168 Days Ago.

           The MONACO GRAND PRIX is underway. Formula One cars snake 
           through winding streets at blinding speeds under an azure 
           sky.

           Packed temporary grandstands line the Circuit. Hotel 
           balconies teem with spectators. 

           A flotilla of mega-yachts chokes the harbor. Toys of the uber-
           elite in attendance for the most glamorous and prestigious 
           auto race in the world.  

           INT. VIP PADDOCK - CIRCUIT DE MONACO - DAY

           A luxury paddock lounge overlooks the street circuit. 

           Billionaire racing team owners graze on a full spread of 
           gourmet provisions and champagne. Dozens of 100-inch curved 
           TVs broadcast the race live. 

           Branko watches intensely, behind a buffer of suited Krypteia. 

                                 BRANKO
                             (into a Bluetooth headset)
                        Tell him to pit on lap 70. Tires 
                        are slick. Turns look sloppy. We 
                        need a strong finish. 

                                 PIT CREW CHIEF (V.O.)
                        Yes, sir.

           An OLDER MAN moves in beside him. This is HENRY STONECUTTER 
           (60s). In contrast to Branko, he’s casually dressed in his 
           team’s racing jacket and cap.  

                                 HENRY
                        Beautiful day for a race. 

           Henry extends Branko his hand. 
                                 HENRY
                        Henry Stonecutter, pleasure.

           Branko doesn’t even acknowledge his gesture.

                                 BRANKO
                        My men ran a security check when 
                        you reached out. I was inherently 
                        skeptical when I hadn’t heard of a 
                        man who owns stakes in the lion’s 
                        share of the Fortune 500. 

                                 HENRY
                        I take great care to stay out of 
                        the press.

                                 BRANKO
                        Anti-trust laws don’t matter if no 
                        one knows you have a monopoly.  

                                 HENRY
                        Something like that. 

                                 BRANKO
                        So, you have something to offer?

                                 HENRY
                        Indeed I do. Access to something 
                        you don’t realize you already have. 

           He has Branko’s attention.

                                 HENRY
                        One of my companies discovered the 
                        largest deposits of rare-earth 
                        minerals in the world, buried in 
                        Tarmania. You grant me exclusive 
                        mining rights, and I’ll give you 
                        100 billion up front, plus 10% of 
                        whatever we pull out of the ground. 
                        You’ve been trying to get Tarmania 
                        a seat at the U.N. That kind of 
                        juice could be just what you need. 

           Branko shrugs in admission, but he’s not that easy.

                                 BRANKO
                        If these minerals are located in my 
                        country, then you just gave up your 
                        only bargaining chip. 
                                 HENRY
                        You’ll need my satellites to 
                        pinpoint the deposits, unless you 
                        want to waste a decade digging. 
                        It’s more than a fair offer. 

                                 BRANKO
                             (scoffs)
                        I didn’t get where I am by being 
                        fair. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fine. How about we settle this like 
                        gentlemen? A wager.

           Branko’s ears perk up. Henry points to the screen.

                                 HENRY
                        Your car is leading mine by six 
                        seconds. You beat me to the finish, 
                        you name the terms. I cross first, 
                        you accept my offer, as is.

           Branko can’t help himself. They shake hands. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Deal.

           EXT. CIRCUIT DE MONACO - DAY

           The Formula One cars glide around hairpin turns. The high-
           pitched WHINE of their supped-up engines is deafening.

           Branko’s BRIGHT YELLOW CAR blisters down a straightaway. Five 
           cars back, Henry’s BLUE CAR makes a pass, gaining. 

           INT. VIP PADDOCK - CIRCUIT DE MONACO 

           Branko watches in tense silence. 

                                 PIT CREW CHIEF (V.O.)
                        Come in to pit.

                                 BRANKO
                             (into Bluetooth headset)
                        No. Skip the pit.

                                 PIT CREW CHIEF (V.O.)
                        Sir, you said to change on lap 70. 
                                 BRANKO
                             (into Bluetooth headset)
                        Now I’m ordering you to skip it. 

           Eavesdropping, Henry leans in.  

                                 HENRY
                        Risky move. I respect that.

                                 BRANKO
                        I’m prepared to win at all costs.

           EXT. CIRCUIT DE MONACO 

           The cars blitz into the Circuit’s famous tunnel. 

           A few tight turns and Henry’s blue car is neck and neck with 
           Branko’s yellow car.

                                 BRANKO
                        Faster. Go. Go.

           Branko’s driver punches it into another straightaway. His 
           rear tires BLOW-- SPINS OUT of control as he crosses the 
           finish line ahead of Henry’s car and SLAMS into the wall. 

           INT. VIP PADDOCK - CIRCUIT DE MONACO - DAY

           Branko fist-pumps in celebration, without the slightest care 
           for the wellbeing of his driver. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Yes! I win. You lose.

                                 HENRY
                        Very well. What are your terms?

                                 BRANKO
                        No terms. The deal is, there is no 
                        deal. And if you or any of your 
                        affiliates set foot in my country 
                        and attempt to mine my land, the 
                        only thing you will be digging is a 
                        mass grave. 

           Branko rises, heads for the door. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s quite the shame. Hopefully 
                        Tarmania’s next President is a 
                        little more pragmatic.  
           Branko stops, turns back. 

                                 HENRY
                        Read the news? Dictators are 
                        getting deposed all the time.   

           Branko doesn’t appreciate being threatened. That’s his move. 

                                 BRANKO
                        How do you Americans say? 
                             (beat)
                        Go fuck yourself.

           He SNAPS at his guards, who surround him as he leaves.

           I/E. TRANSPORT TRUCK - NIGHT

           A Soviet-era 6X6 TRANSPORT TRUCK rumbles down a moonlit, 
           rocky road.

           SUP: Tarmania/Serbia Border. 153 Days Ago.

           BOB sleeps soundly in the back of the truck despite being 
           jostled by the rough terrain. 

           The truck stops. Armed SMUGGLERS jerk open the tailgate, 
           throw up the canvas cover and shine a flashlight inside.  

                                 LEAD SMUGGLER
                        We’re here. Get out. Hurry up!

           Bob, now wearing medical scrubs, calmly wakes, rubs his eyes 
           and gets up. He’s been using a brick of heroin as a pillow. 

           Faking a bum knee, he struggles to climb down. The smuggler 
           jerks Bob’s arm, making him fall to the ground.

                                 BOB
                        Thanks for the help.

           The smuggler waves in his crew, who chuckle as they step over 
           Bob and off-load the cargo. 

           EXT. BALKAN MOUNTAIN PASS - MOMENTS LATER

           They transfer the bales of drugs to their cohort’s VANS.  

           Bob hobbles to his feet, dusts himself off. The smugglers 
           toss WOOD CRATES stenciled “MEDICAL SUPPLIES” on the ground.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, be careful with those. 
                                 LEAD SMUGGLER
                        Shut up. You, money now. 

           Bob fishes out an envelope from his satchel. The smuggler 
           snatches it away, opens it and counts the stack of EUROS.

                                 LEAD SMUGGLER
                        This is not enough.

                                 BOB
                        We agreed on your fee... That’s all 
                        the cash I have.

           The smuggler motions to his crew.

                                 LEAD SMUGGLER
                        Put these back on the truck.

                                 BOB
                        No, please, you can’t! 

           Bob hobbles in front of the crates like a human shield. The 
           smuggler draws a Nagant REVOLVER, puts it to his head.

                                 BOB
                             (feigned panic)
                        Whoa, easy there. I’m with Doctors 
                        Without Borders. We’re just trying 
                        to get this medicine to sick 
                        Tarmanian children.  

           He COCKS the revolver. Bob throws up his hands, exposing a 
           GOLD ROLEX on his wrist.

                                 BOB
                        You don’t care. Okay, let’s work 
                        something out... What about my 
                        watch? It’s a Rolex. 

           The smuggler eyes it, interest piqued. 

                                 BOB
                        I’ll take it off, and you can see 
                        for yourself, just don’t shoot.

           Bob unclasps the watch, hands it over. The smuggler looks it 
           over, feels the weight. It’s real. What’s he going to do with 
           a million IUs of polio vaccine anyway?

           He lowers the gun, waves to his crew.

                                 BOB
                        Don’t I get a ride?
           Everyone hops into their vehicles and drives away, leaving 
           Bob stranded and alone. 

           Bob drops his act and digs into the open crates. Hidden under 
           layers of medical supplies are a new watch, a PASSPORT for 
           Bob’s new cover, COMPACT WEAPONS, cash in multiple currencies 
           and a host of HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT. 

           Bob inserts a clear, micro EARBUD COM-UNIT and keys it up.

                                 BOB
                             (to earbud)
                        ACME, Road Runner is in country. 
                        The Wile E. Coyotes took the bait. 
                        Time to drop the anvil.

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DRONE BAY 

           Sam stands watching a drone-fed MONITOR. Through the INFRARED 
           we can see Bob looking straight up at us. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Told ya they’d try to fuck me.

                                 SAM
                        Shit. Anyone ever told you you’re a 
                        sore winner? 

           He points to a TECH who controls the PREDATOR via joystick.

                                 SAM
                        Send it.

           I/E. TRANSPORT TRUCK - NIGHT

           Lumbering back across the border.

           Inside, the smugglers pass around, admire Bob’s Rolex. 
           They’re confused when they find a BLINKING RED LIGHT. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS 

           Bob watches the truck’s headlights rise and dim as it curves 
           through the pass in the distance. 

           SHOOM! A MISSILE streaks from the sky, OBLITERATING the truck 
           in a FIREBALL-- the product of a DRONE-STRIKE.

           The flame’s orange glow illuminates Bob’s deadpan expression.
                                 BOB
                             (a la Road Runner; cold)
                        Beep. Beep.

           EXT. TENEMENT, TARMANIA - DAY

           A TAXI pulls away, leaving a thick cloud of black exhaust. 

           Bob stands on the sidewalk next to his crates of gear, 
           staring up at a concrete tenement. Laundry hangs from many of 
           the windows. Bit of a step down from the Ritz.

           INT. HALLWAY - TENEMENT

           Bob stops at a door. Flips open the DOORKNOB to reveal a 
           FINGERPRINT SCANNER. Presses his thumb to the plate. 

           SCHUNK! The sound of hidden steel bolts retracting. The door 
           pops open and Bob enters--

           INT. KITCHEN - SAFE HOUSE 

           He sets a bottle of Kentucky BOURBON on the counter. Opens 
           the fridge- empty. Great. The only food in the place is a 
           cupboard full of military-issue Meals Ready to Eat (MREs).

           INT. BEDROOM - SAFE HOUSE 

           A lone mattress on the floor. Bob sits at a desk pre-staged 
           with an ultra-thin LAPTOP. He opens it, types a password into 
           a secure NSA terminal. 

           ON SCREEN: Feeds from Branko’s palace security cameras 
           POPULATE. Bob cycles through them-- dining room, master 
           bedroom, master closet, barber shop, terrace, garage. 

                                 BOB
                        Thank you, N-S-A. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           And we’re back in the PRESENT with Bob and President 
           Zahradnic at the palace banquet table. Servants present the 
           first course. The gray, gelatinous clump jiggles as it’s set 
           in front of Bob-- he’s repulsed.
                                 BOB
                        This looks... amazing. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Goat brain is a Tarmanian delicacy. 

           One of the servants tastes Branko’s food for him.

                                 BOB
                        Is it? Well, I always thought 
                        governments could use more brains.

           Branko CHUCKLES. Bob randomly plucks one of the gold forks 
           and takes a bite. He chews, it tastes worse than it looks.

                                 BRANKO
                        How do you like it? Creamy, no?

                                 BOB
                        Could use a little salt. I don’t 
                        see a shaker on the table...

           Branko smirks.

                                 BRANKO
                        There’s a salt cellar to your left.

           Bob settles on a gold double-lidded salt cellar, opens it.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, look at that. There’s a little 
                        spoon inside. How sophisticated.

           Bob heaps salt onto the dish. Branko watches him, fascinated. 

                                 BRANKO
                        When the chance for this reunion 
                        presented itself, I just couldn’t 
                        resist. So, tell me about this 
                        illustrious career of yours. 

           Bob’s picking up on Branko’s sudden deference. The 
           President’s trying to butter him up.

                                 BOB
                        My record is 19 regimes toppled, no 
                        losses... and one draw.

                                 BRANKO
                        How does a revolution end in a tie?
                                 BOB
                        Cuba. I had ‘em on the ropes and 
                        the suits threw in the towel, re-
                        opened diplomatic relations. 
                             (beat, asserting himself)
                        Getting pulled out doesn’t count as 
                        a loss. That’s a draw.

           Branko lets out a maniacal BELLY LAUGH. 

                                 BRANKO
                        That’s good, I like that. I’m 
                        fascinated to learn your process.

                                 BOB
                        This’s where the Agency taught me 
                        to say “that’s classified” or “if I 
                        told you, I’d have to kill you.” 
                        But... 

           Bob ponders this. Branko hangs on his every word. 

                                 BOB
                        ...fuck it, okay. What’s the 
                        difference anyway, right?  

           Branko grins wildly and CLAPS in excitement.

                                 BRANKO
                        My sentiments exactly.

                                 BOB
                        Well, grab your popcorn and settle 
                        into your seat. You’re about to 
                        hear my six simple steps for 
                        overthrowing a regime.

                        Step #1: Know your target.  

           Beat.

                                 BRANKO
                        You profiled me.

                                 BOB
                        I profiled you when I put you in 12 
                        years ago. And I profiled you again 
                        when I was tapped to take you out. 

                                 BRANKO
                        And what did your analysis reveal? 
                        How have I changed?
                                 BOB
                        People don’t change. Wealth and 
                        power just amplify who they are. 
                             (beat)
                        First off, you’re paranoid...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Fleets of armored G-Wagons, Suburbans run idle. 

           Branko enters one of SIX identical armored Rolls Royce 
           Phantoms, adorned with the TARMANIAN FLAG and Presidential 
           Seal-- part of a MOTORCADE that dwarfs the one we saw Bob in. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        You have body doubles to confuse 
                        enemies. 

           At the back entrance, the REAL BRANKO is covertly escorted 
           out into an identical motorcade. 

           The TWO motorcades simultaneously pull out of the compound, 
           heading opposite directions onto--

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           With speed and numbers, the Presidential Motorcade dominates 
           streets and highways, chugging diesel fuel. 

           Secret Police speed ahead to shut off intersections and 
           exits. They don’t hesitate to RUN CARS OFF THE ROAD if the 
           drivers do not comply. 

           EXT. PRESIDENTIAL RETREAT - NIGHT

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        You never sleep in the same palace 
                        more than two nights in a row.
           The motorcade is cleared to enter the compound, where a 
           behemoth Mediterranean-style mansion is perched on the SHORE.

                        If you or your regime is mentioned 
                        in a manner other than that of 
                        pious exaltation, the culprits are 
                        to be arrested, interrogated and 
                        jailed, or worse.

                                 BRANKO
                        Surely a spy can’t call our 
                        security protocols paranoid.

           A servant places the next course in front of them, cabbage 
           soup. He tastes Branko’s food again. 

                                 BOB 
                        Case in point: This is your palace, 
                        staffed with your people. That’s 
                        your food, inspected by your 
                        Agricultural Department and you 
                        still have a taster make sure it 
                        isn’t poisoned. Not paranoid?

           Branko becomes self-aware of this point, smirks.

                                 BRANKO
                        What you call paranoid, I call 
                        pragmatic. With men like you out 
                        there lurking in the shadows, men 
                        like me can never be too cautious.

                        You’d prefer to kill someone rather 
                        than admit you were wrong. Anyone 
                        who questions you is executed.

                        And your methods have gotten 
                        increasingly creative.

           Branko and General Vukovic sip vodka in a lavish box. Branko 
           raises a pair of GOLD BINOCULARS. 

           THROUGH BINOCULARS: Floodlights illuminate every corner of 
           the SOCCER FIELD below. The stadium is empty, save for a 
           POLICE VAN parked near one of the GOALS.

           SECRET POLICE shove a PRISONER out the back of the van. They 
           jab their rifles at him. He takes off running. 

           SWING OVER TO: Guards release a SIBERIAN TIGER from a cage. 
           It bounds after the prisoner, leaps onto his back, sinks its 
           jaws in, tackling him. It devours its SCREAMING prey alive.

           Branko grins wildly. Vukovic grimaces-- it’s a bit excessive.

                        You’re extremely vain.

           Branko, sprawled out in the middle of a giant bed, sleeps 
           soundly. He slowly wakes and unravels himself from the silk 
           sheets and TWO NAKED WOMEN. Leaves them there. 

           INT. PRIVATE BARBER SHOP - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           Branko sits in a gold chair. His HAIRSTYLIST fearfully trims.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        You’ve had at least ten cosmetic 
                        surgeries and every morning you’re 
                        groomed in your own barber shop. 
                        Your appearance must always be 
                        flawless.

                        In fact, you tortured two hair 
                        stylists and a plastic surgeon when 
                        they couldn’t achieve perfection.

                        Even though every designer already 
                        makes your size, you insist that 
                        everything you wear is bespoke.

           Now groomed, Branko stands on a literal golden pedestal while 
           his TAILOR takes his measurements. Servants wheel away racks 
           of barely-worn clothes.

           INT. BEDROOM - SAFE HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Bob watches this through Branko’s security camera feeds on 
           his ultra-thin laptop, taking notes.

                        You never wear the same suit more 
                        than once, and insist on having 
                        them burned instead of dry-cleaned. 

           Out back, the servants peel the worn suits off gold hangers, 
           throw them into a FURNACE with the rest of the palace refuse. 
           Hundreds of thousands of dollars go up in smoke. 

           INT. MASTER CLOSET - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        You’re obsessed with fashion... 

           Racks of brand new designer clothing are brought in. Branko 
           is pleased. Servants present him with the day’s dress 
           options. He selects an outfit.

           EXT. TERRACE - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - DAY

           Branko, in his new outfit, eats an indulgent breakfast under 
           a vine-covered stone TERRACE. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)

           WOMEN of questionable age-of-consent are trotted out IN 
           BIKINIS by servants. Branko scans their bodies for 
           imperfections, selects the one with the fewest.

           INT. MASTER GARAGE - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE

           Only someone like Branko could call this a garage. It’s the 
           size of an airplane hangar and houses Branko’s massive 
           collection of RARE and EXOTIC SPORTS CARS.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        ...and sports cars. 

           SIX SUPERCARS run idle, having been prepped by servants for 
           their leader’s daily drive. Branko selects one, a-- 

           I/E. BUGATTI CHIRON (MOVING)  - DAY

           Branko, in his new clothes, with his new girl riding shotgun, 
           drives his new BUGATTI CHIRON through Tarmania’s countryside. 
           His Secret Police have blocked off a circuit like the Monaco 
           Grand Prix. But today’s track is just for him. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        ...and you think you’re invincible. 

           He cruises around hairpin turns and into a straightaway. 
           Pushes the $2.6 million supercar to speeds over 200 MPH!

           The GIRL at least acts like she’s turned on, having fun. From 
           where Branko is sitting, it’s good to be the king.

           HIGH ABOVE-- a glint in the sky overhead. ZOOM into a DRONE. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME

           Bob sips tea at an outdoor cafe. Tweed suit, spectacles. A 
           WOODEN CANE rests against his chair. He’s clearly going for 
           Indiana Jones meets Professor X, and nailing it. 

           The DRONE FEED is projected into the lens of his GLASSES. The 
           clear micro EARBUD COM-UNIT rests in his right ear.

                                 BOB
                             (to earbud)
                        Switch to mark two. 

           THROUGH HIS LENS: the drone camera PANS to a rusted-out 90’s 
           Peugeot traveling down a nearby dirt road. 
           The drone silently stalks the car as it enters the city, 
           winding through alleyways and back roads. 

           Bob’s feed ZOOMS IN as the Peugeot stops in front of a PUB.

           Bob peers over the top of his glasses to see--

           ACROSS THE STREET-- the same Peugeot parked right in front of 
           him. A STOCKY MAN gets out, enters the pub. 

           Bob kills the feed. He stands, bracing himself on the cane, 
           and follows the man with a slight LIMP.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

           Bob loudly SLURPS his cabbage soup. Branko watches this, 
           irritated.

                                 BOB
                        You’ve come a long way from that   
                        shit-box army tent I found you in. 
                        Not bad for a kid from the sticks. 

           Branko smirks.

                                 BRANKO
                        I can’t deny my humble beginnings, 
                        but look at what I’ve become. Sure, 
                        I spoil myself a little, but people 
                        respect leaders they want to be. I 
                        give them something to look up to.

                                 BOB
                        Oh yeah, you’re a great role model.  
                        Strange that it was so easy to find 
                        people who don’t like you. 
                             (beat)
                        Step #2 is: to locate, infiltrate, 
                        befriend, motivate and organize the 
                        opposition.

           INT. PUB - DAY

           SUP: Tarmania. 137 Days Ago. 

           Bob enters-- the dive is quiet and empty, save for a few 
           PATRONS huddled around a far table. They keep their voices to 
           a murmur. 
           The BARTENDER looks up, startled, to see Bob. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        We don’t open for two hours.

           He moves within arms-reach of sawed-off AK-47 leaning against  
           the inside of the bar. Bob clocks this, almost imperceptibly. 

           He holds up his TREMBLING right hand. 

                                 BOB
                        Apologies. Can you spare an early 
                        pint? Best medicine to keep the 
                        shaking under control. 

           The bartender steals a glance toward the group of patrons. He 
           cautiously pours Bob a beer. 

           Bob perches on the nearest bar stool and opens a book.

           CLOSE ON: the micro EARBUD in his right ear. Amplifying the 
           patrons’ conversation--

           A spirited debate is taking place. The leader of the 
           opposition movement “Freedom Now!,” FILIP (30s), makes his 
           case. He’s the man Bob followed earlier. 

                                 FILIP
                        I’m tired of waiting. We need to 
                        make the first move. 

           The only woman at the table, TERESA (late 20s), nervously 
           rubs a PENDANT hanging from her neck. 

                                 TERESA
                        We have. The second distribution of 
                        flyers already went out.

                                 FILIP
                        Flyers are pointless. Twenty people 
                        showed up to our last rally.

                                 TERESA
                        Maybe forty show up next time. Then 
                        eighty. Eventually we’ll have more 
                        supporters than Branko can silence.

                                 FILIP
                        Don’t you get it? The only thing a 
                        man like Branko understands is 
                        violence. 

                                 TERESA
                        So, what are you suggesting? 
                                 FILIP
                        I’m talking about going to war. 
                        Revolution. The only way he leaves 
                        that palace is if we drag him out 
                        of it and put a bullet in his head. 
                        Just look at Libya.

           Bob continues to feign reading while he eavesdrops--

                                 TERESA
                        We don’t have enough supporters for 
                        a rally, much less an army.

                                 FILIP
                        Because our message is weak. People 
                        will rise up if we give them a 
                        cause. Revolution is simple. 

                                 TERESA
                        The Krypteia and the military would 
                        crush us. Even if we survived, the 
                        window for change slams shut for a 
                        century. Branko’s grandchildren 
                        would rule Tarmania. 

                                 FILIP
                        They will now! The only way things 
                        change is revolution. It happened 
                        here before, it can happen again. 

                                 TERESA
                        The military isn’t a bunch of 
                        faceless soldiers. They’re fellow 
                        countrymen who love Tarmania. I’m 
                        willing to spill my own blood for 
                        freedom, but not theirs. 

           Bob turns around to face the table, interjects.

                                 BOB
                        Pardon me, miss, but you’re being a 
                        little naive to the reality of the 
                        situation. 

           The whole table tenses. Eyes swivel to Bob at the bar, 
           leaning on his cane. Teresa’s infuriated by the interruption. 

           Filip aggressively moves to Bob, his barrel-chest puffed up.

                                 FILIP
                        Nobody asked your opinion...
                             (looking Bob up and down)
                         ...cripple.
                                 BOB
                        I understand, and those are both 
                        astute observations. But you should 
                        hear me out before you thrash me.

                                 FILIP
                        Who the fuck are you? You Krypteia? 

           Filip draws a Makarov PISTOL. A few others follow suit, 
           including the bartender. 

                                 BOB
                        For the past few minutes I’ve 
                        listened to you all openly discuss 
                        sedition. If I were Secret Police, 
                        a team would’ve already raided this 
                        place, and you’d be dead. 

           Filip looks to Teresa, he makes a good point. Bob gestures to 
           his hand on his cane, SHAKING.

                                 BOB
                        You see that. It’s called resting 
                        tremor. It’s a symptom of 
                        Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
                             (off his blank look)
                        A-L-S is a degenerative nerve 
                        disease that progressively attacks 
                        the nerves in my brain and spinal 
                        cord. Doctors gave me a few years, 
                        tops. Until then I will be, as you 
                        so succinctly put it, a “cripple.”

           Filip reassesses. Doesn’t get more unassuming than that. 

                                 FILIP
                        Fine. Enough with the sob story. 
                        Who are you?

                                 BOB
                        My name is Dr. Spartak Luga. I’m a 
                        son of Tarmania. Exiled when Branko 
                        took power. Since then, I’ve lived 
                        in the West. Studied at Boston 
                        College, where I’m now a Professor 
                        of Political Science. 

                                 FILIP
                        None of that is enough to stop me 
                        from killing you right now.
                                 BOB
                        I don’t fear death. My condition 
                        has forced me to reconcile with a 
                        short life. What I fear, is dying 
                        without making a difference. 

           Something stirs in a few of them. 

                                 TERESA
                        Why are you here? Why us?

                                 BOB
                        I’m here to help. When I sensed 
                        revolution brewing again, I had to 
                        return to my homeland, help oust 
                        Branko and ensure that the next 
                        leader is an honorable one.

           Filip lowers his gun, motions others to do so. 

                                 FILIP
                        How can a cripple help win a war?

                                 BOB
                        I’ve studied everything there is to 
                        know about revolutions. I know how 
                        they’re won, and lost. I can teach 
                        you how to beat Branko at his own 
                        game. Free our homeland. 

           Filip shrugs, he makes another good point. 

                                 FILIP
                        Join us for a drink. We’ll see what 
                        you know.

                                 BOB
                        One drink. Then we must all leave 
                        this place and never come back. If 
                        I can find these little not-so-
                        secret meetings, Branko can too. 

           He’s already teaching.

           They pat Bob on the back. He takes a seat. Most at the table 
           have been disarmed, but Teresa remains suspicious. 

           LATER

           Now chumming it up with the group, Bob drinks and laughs. 

           Teresa gathers scraps from the leftover bar-food into a 
           BURLAP SACK and leaves the table. Bob tracks her movement.  
           EXT. BACK ALLEY - PUB - NIGHT

           Teresa slips out the back exit, pulls out her CELL PHONE, 
           opens a GOOGLE SEARCH and types in Bob’s alias. 

           INT. PUB - SAME TIME

           They all LAUGH at a joke Filip has just told. Bob acts like 
           it’s the funniest thing he’s ever heard. 

           He scans the pub, hiding his concern at Teresa’s absence. 

                                 BOB
                        That one almost made me piss my 
                        pants. I need to take a leak. 

           He shakily rises with the aid of his cane. 

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - PUB - NIGHT

           Teresa opens the first link. It’s an OP-ED ARTICLE in the NEW 
           YORK TIMES by Professor Luga, but there’s NO PICTURE.

           Her eyes narrow, suspicion building. 

           INT. PUB 

           Bob moves past the bathroom, pace hindered by his feigned 
           limp. Once he’s out of sight, he picks it up.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - PUB 

           Teresa opens the second link-- the Professor’s PROFILE PAGE 
           on BOSTON COLLEGE’S WEB SITE. She eyes the HEADSHOT... it’s 
           definitely Bob. His story checks out.

           She shakes her head, disappointed her intuition was wrong. 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        I hope I didn’t scare you off. 

           Teresa turns to find Bob approaching unsteadily, leading each 
           step with his cane. 

                                 TERESA
                        Pretty presumptuous of you.

           She eyes him with simultaneous feelings of sympathy and 
           anger, still frustrated with Bob from their debate. 
                                 TERESA
                        There was plenty of good food that 
                        didn’t get eaten. I won’t let it go 
                        to waste when there are children 
                        going hungry.

           She distributes the burlap sack of leftovers to nearby 
           HOMELESS CHILDREN. She is kind and gentle with them. 

           Some graciously accept the donation and embrace her, while 
           others snatch morsels from her hands and scurry off to eat 
           what is most likely their largest meal of the day.

           Bob is surprised by the genuineness of her sentiment.

                                 BOB
                        That’s very admirable of you.
                             (silent beat)
                        Listen, I want to apologize if I 
                        upset you. Sometimes I can be a bit 
                        too candid. 

                                 TERESA
                        It’s fine.  

                                 BOB
                        Good. But I want to be clear, what 
                        I said in there is valid. 
                        Historically, freedom is the 
                        exception, not the rule. Power 
                        concentrates itself. It operates by 
                        the same natural law as gravity. 
                        The bigger something is, the 
                        greater its forces to attract more 
                        of the like. If it grows big 
                        enough, the only thing that can 
                        break the cycle is to introduce a 
                        greater force, upset the status 
                        quo. That’s what a revolution is. 
                        And that’s why Tarmania needs one.

                                 TERESA
                        Don’t lecture to me like one of 
                        your students. There’s no one that 
                        wants Branko to fall more than I 
                        do. It’s the violent means I refuse 
                        to accept. 

                                 BOB
                        Revolution isn’t for the faint of 
                        heart. Tyrants don’t just give 
                        power back to the people because 
                        they asked for it nicely. 
                                 TERESA
                        We’re not asking. We are demanding.

                                 BOB
                        “We” who... you and the coalition 
                        of eight in there? Probably got 
                        that many because of the free food. 

           Teresa’s so offended, she almost laughs.

                                 TERESA
                        I see what you mean by “a bit too 
                        candid.”

           Bob self-consciously reins it in.

                                 BOB
                        I respect your desire to do this 
                        peacefully, I really do. But when 
                        Branko turns violent, which tyrants 
                        always do, you better have the will 
                        to defend yourself and your ideas 
                        with force. Revolution is a zero-
                        sum game. It’s liberty or death.

           He jabs the ground with his cane- an exclamation point.

                                 BOB
                        And dying for your cause only 
                        matters if there are people left 
                        alive to see it through. 

           Teresa thinks this over, slowly rubbing her pendant. 

           Bob sees it’s an ANTIQUE COIN dangling from some twine.

                                 TERESA
                        You know, while you were safe in 
                        America, I was here, growing up on 
                        the streets. Trying to avoid 
                        starving or becoming a plaything 
                        for the Krypteia. I watched Branko 
                        turn my country into a prison. 

           She’s recalling something very painful.

                                 TERESA
                        I may wish for peace and give food 
                        to the hungry, but don’t for 
                        another second mistake my kindness 
                        for weakness. 

           She marches back inside. 
           Bob nods, fascinated. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING

           A sheet of plywood laid over sawhorses provides a makeshift 
           table. Another fashioned with 2x4s is a crude chalkboard. 

           Bob stands in front, like a professor. His pupils, the entire 
           ranks of “Freedom Now!”-- twenty is a generous estimate. 

                                 BOB
                        There is one key concept that 
                        determines the outcome of all wars, 
                        but particularly revolutions. 
                        Anyone know what that is?

                                 TERESA
                        Who has the truth on their side.

                                 BOB
                        Wrong. In 1938, Adolf Hitler 
                        convinced Germany, Japan and Italy 
                        that the truth was on his side. 

           Filip offers a guess.

                                 FILIP
                        Which side has the most power.

                                 BOB
                        Close. It’s the side with the 
                        perception of power. All three Axis-
                        countries were relatively small. 
                        But their tyrants perceived they 
                        could take over the world. Right 
                        now Branko perceives that his power 
                        is greater than ever. We, my 
                        patriots, are going to change that. 

           The rebels are inspired.

                                 BOB
                        We’ll start with recruitment. Each 
                        of you will create ten anonymous 
                        social media accounts with “Freedom 
                        Now!” in the title. Spread them 
                        across Twitter, Snapchat and 
                        Instagram. Subscribe them to each 
                        other, along with a few celebrities 
                        so they aren’t flagged as bogus. 

           The aspiring revolutionaries take notes, captivated. 
                                 BOB
                        After we’re done here tonight, 
                        instruct every friend you trust to 
                        follow them and then tell all of 
                        their friends to do the same. This 
                        way, every time we post against 
                        Branko, it will reach millions of 
                        our citizens. If only 1% turn out 
                        to protest, it’ll be enough to pack 
                        Victory Square so tight Branko will 
                        be shitting his silk underwear.   

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - DAYS LATER

           The space has been arranged like a conference hall. A crude 
           STAGE and PODIUM are set up against a CURTAIN.

           The last few SUPPORTERS are covertly let in through a 
           basement entrance by rebels with AK-47 MACHINE GUNS. There 
           must be sixty people in attendance for this secret gathering. 
           They’re making some real progress.  

           BEHIND THE CURTAIN-- Bob coaches a very nervous Filip through 
           his speech. Teresa stands nearby, providing moral support.  

                                 FILIP
                        The time for fear is... fuck... 
                        I’ve been shot at, and I’ve never 
                        been so nervous in my life.

                                 BOB
                        You have to speak with confidence. 
                        Believe your words. Connect with 
                        your audience. Remember, everyone 
                        out there risked their lives to be 
                        here. They’re afraid. Be fearless.

           Filip nods hard. 

                                 BOB
                        Now try it with me. Chin up. Eyes 
                        forward. Head swiveling. Engage 
                        every corner of the room. Never 
                        have both hands on the podium. 
                        Always have an open palm driving 
                        the point home. 

           Filip starts with an open palm.

                                 FILIP
                        The time for fear is over. Courage 
                        is now our greatest ally.
                                 BOB
                        When the point changes, use the 
                        other hand. Aggressive points, use 
                        a fist. 

           Filip switches hands, balls up his fist.

                                 FILIP
                        It is Branko who should fear us. 
                        Tarmania is a proud nation.

                                 BOB
                        When talking about the country, 
                        touch your heart. For the people, 
                        open your arms wide. 

           Filip practices the movements, breathes deep.

                                 BOB
                        Good. It’s showtime. 

           Filip exits the curtain, faces the CHEERING crowd and waves.

           Bob’s impressed. Without taking his eyes off Filip--

                                 BOB
                             (to Teresa)
                        Have you thought about what you 
                        want to say when it’s your time?

                                 TERESA
                        I want the people to stand up to 
                        Branko with words instead of 
                        bullets. How quickly we forget. Our 
                        streets still bear the scars of 
                        battles fought on our own 
                        doorsteps. Branko’s war against the 
                        king turned families against one 
                        another. Children were orphaned as 
                        their parents were slaughtered. 
                             (beat; turns to Bob)
                        I was one of them.

           Bob swivels to meet her gaze. He realizes that he’s directly 
           responsible for the death of Teresa’s parents. If there was a 
           time he’d feel a fraction of empathy, it would be now. 

                                 BOB
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 TERESA
                        Don’t be. They supported him. 
                        Didn’t live long enough to see 
                        everything he sold was a lie.
                                 BOB
                        Well, I did. 
                             (then)
                        I supported Branko, too.  

           This admission catches her off-guard. Bob shrugs guiltily. 

                                 BOB
                        Fear can persuade even good folks 
                        to comply with just about anything.  
                        After I fled, my parents stayed 
                        behind. Never saw them again.

                                 TERESA
                        Seems we’re both fighting to 
                        liberate our country from the 
                        mistakes of the past. 

           She gives him a comforting smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Branko and Bob continue their dinner. A three-foot smoked 
           sturgeon lies on a gold platter. A servant cuts into its 
           belly-- black caviar gushes out. 

           Branko’s amused. Bob’s stomach turns.

                                 BRANKO
                        I am rather relishing hearing the 
                        magician reveal his secrets. 

                                 BOB
                        And vice versa. I’ve decided the 
                        fate of nations, and the only 
                        credit I’ll get is a star chiseled 
                        on a wall at the Agency. It’s fun 
                        to have my time in the spotlight.

                                 BRANKO
                        Very good. If you’re not having 
                        fun, then what’s the point of life?

           Bob nods in agreement. 

                                 BOB
                        I know, right? Well, this next one  
                        probably wasn’t fun for you. Step 
                        #3: Ridicule the leader for past 
                        transgressions and invent new ones. 
                        Incite protests. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        If they don't turn violent, make 
                        them. Blame the leader. Legitimize 
                        his opposition.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE 

           SUP: 92 Days Ago.

           Bob oversees Filip and Teresa, who manage dozens of 
           SUPPORTERS creating POSTERS with humiliating PHOTOS-- 

           -- One, an unflattering angle of Branko in a Euro-swimsuit 
           getting out of a Monaco hotel pool surrounded by women in 
           bikinis written over with “#BRANKO THE PLAYBOY.” 

           -- Another, Branko’s head with devil horns and bloody fangs 
           stenciled with “#BRANKO THE TYRANT.”

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           A THOUSAND “Freedom Now!” SUPPORTERS assemble in VICTORY 
           SQUARE-- ten square blocks of cement in the heart of 
           Tarmania’s Capital. They carry SIGNS and BANNERS that read: 
           “#DOWN WITH BRANKO,” “#FREE TARMANIA,” “#FREEDOM NOW!” 

           A 50-foot tall BRONZE STATUE OF BRANKO towers over them all.

           COLUMNS of TARMANIAN POLICE in RIOT GEAR have cordoned off 
           streets, confining the protestors to the square. Behind their 
           SHIELDS and FACE-MASKS, the policemen are on edge.

           So far, the demonstration is PEACEFUL.

           INT. THIRD-FLOOR APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Bob, Filip, Teresa and a few other “Freedom Now!” Leaders 
           observe their creation stirring below. Filip is agitated. 

                                 FILIP
                        I don’t understand why we’re up 
                        here just watching. We should be 
                        down there with our people.

                                 BOB
                        For better or worse, humans are 
                        social creatures. But group 
                        together more than ten of them, and 
                        they will fail to work together 
                        effectively without leadership.
                                 FILIP
                        Exactly. So let’s go down there.

                                 BOB
                        That’s a marvelous idea. We’ll get 
                        you a t-shirt and a clipboard and a 
                        bullhorn. And when the Krypteia 
                        figure out you organized this 
                        protest they’ll shoot you on sight. 

           Bob asserts eye contact with Filip and Teresa, head 
           oscillating unnaturally with tremor. 

                                 BOB
                        Leadership isn’t effective if the 
                        leaders are dead. 

           Filip looks like he just got slapped. Bob lowers his glasses, 
           wipes his face with a handkerchief. Suddenly, he stumbles 
           back. Teresa catches him, Filip helps steady his cane.

                                 TERESA
                        Spartak, are you alright?

                                 BOB
                             (feigning exhaustion)
                        I’m fine. My condition is very 
                        taxing. I’m afraid all of this 
                        stimulation has sapped my energy. I 
                        just need to lay down for a moment. 
                        Somewhere quiet.

                                 FILIP
                        There’s a bedroom in the back. 

           INT. BACK BEDROOM - THIRD-FLOOR APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Teresa helps Bob limp inside. 

                                 BOB
                        This is quite nice.

                                 TERESA
                        The owner is a long-time supporter.

           Bob strains, trembling as she helps lower him onto the bed. 

                                 BOB
                        Thank you. I’ll be fine in an hour.

           She moves to the door, hesitates, then closes it behind her. 
           Bob checks his WATCH, waits a beat. Gets up and moves to a 
           window, draws the curtains and silently climbs out.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           With incredible agility, Bob stealthily FREE-CLIMBS the 
           building. Shimmies along a ledge forty feet above the cement. 

           Eyes the adjacent building, focusing on a window ledge one-
           story below-- he takes the insane leap of faith.

           Free falling across the divide, Bob catches his full weight 
           on a sliver of cement with just his fingertips. Holy shit. 

           He repeats the acrobatics, eventually landing on the ground.

           EXT. NEARBY STREETS - VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           Bob pays-off some TEENS with CASH. As they scurry off, he 
           clocks TWO RIOT POLICE dragging a BOUND WOMAN into an alley.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The riot cops tower over their defenseless victim. She tries 
           in vain to squirm away as #1 undoes his belt. 

           Out of nowhere, two hands grab #2, spin him around--

           ...BOB STRIKES #2 in the THROAT, crushing his trachea with a 
           sickening CRUNCH... 

           ...as he goes down, Bob simultaneously strips him of his 
           rifle and kicks #1 in the groin-- he crumples. 

           Bob bludgeons #1 with the rifle butt again and again. He 
           pivots, does the same to #2. Confirms they’re both dead. 

           It’s VIOLENT, and it’s over in three seconds flat.

           Bob checks both ends of the alley, coast is clear. No one 
           heard them over the din of the protest. 

           With a finger to his mouth, he motions “shhh” to the woman. 
           Cuts her zip-ties. She can’t run away fast enough. 

           Bob drags the cops behind the dumpster and strips one of his 
           uniform and...
           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE 

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

           -- Bob’s group of teens enter the mass of protestors and 
           weave their way to the front, where others taunt the cops.  

           -- The teens HURL ROCKS at the RIOT POLICE.

           -- Behind the front line-- Bob, now dressed in a riot police 
           uniform, flips down his face shield. Takes aim with an RG-6 
           GRENADE LAUNCHER and FIRES TEAR GAS into the crowd.

           -- Confused, ANOTHER COP SHOOTS a gas canister into the 
           protest. Like an avalanche, the rest join in. THUNK! THUNK! 

           -- Plumes of noxious gas rise. The angered crowd fights back. 
           Police beat them back with their SHIELDS and CLUBS.

           -- The peaceful protest rapidly mutates into an all out RIOT.

           -- One protester boldly picks up a tear gas canister and lobs 
           it back at the cops, who choke on their own medicine.  

           INT. THIRD-FLOOR APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Filip and Teresa watch the protest devolve into violence. She 
           thumbs her coin necklace, gravely concerned. He’s captivated.  

                                 TERESA
                        Spartak was right. They shot 
                        first... I should check on him.

                                 FILIP
                        He said he wanted to rest.

           But Teresa can’t hold back her suspicious intuition. She 
           moves through the back hall, cracks the door to see--

           INT. BACK BEDROOM - THIRD-FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The bed is EMPTY. Concerned, she enters, scanning the rest of 
           the room, but it’s TOTALLY VACANT. Bob is gone.

           The SHUNK! of old plumbing startles her. The BATHROOM DOOR 
           opens. Bob exits, patting his WET FACE with a handtowel.

                                 BOB
                        Sorry to make you jump. Splashing 
                        cold water on my face wakes me up. 
                                 TERESA
                        No worries, just looking in on you.

           Teresa shakes it off, leaves. Bob’s expression drops, cold. 
           He wads up the rag, tosses it over his shoulder like trash.

           EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

           More RIOT POLICE rush toward the chaos in the square. One of 
           them notices something, stops. 

           A BOOT protrudes from a pile of trash. 

           The cop furiously tosses the refuse aside, uncovering Bob’s 
           victims. He blows a WHISTLE to alert the others.

           EXT. PASTURE - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Branko rides atop a pale white STALLION with a flowing mane 
           as it gallops over several equestrian JUMPS.  

           General Vukovic waits patiently. Branko trots the horse over 
           to him. Its bridle, reins and saddle are in-laid with GOLD. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Can’t you see I’m busy?

           General Vukovic pushes past it.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Mr. President, there is a matter of 
                        national security I think you would 
                        like to be aware of. 

           Branko doesn’t dismount, forcing Vukovic to look up at him. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Fine. What is it?

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        A protest in Victory Square.

           Branko slumps his head to the side... “Big whoop.”

                                 BRANKO
                        So detain them.

           He snaps the reins-- the horse saunters along slowly. Vukovic 
           hurries to keep up. 
                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I’m afraid that’s not possible, Mr. 
                        President. Our estimates have them 
                        numbering more than a thousand.

           Branko perks up, skeptical. 

                                 BRANKO
                        A thousand?

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Yes, sir. And the demonstration has 
                        escalated into a riot. Our police 
                        forces are facing widespread 
                        resistance. Two of our men were 
                        found dead, sir.

                                 BRANKO
                        A thousand people don’t just 
                        spontaneously assemble.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Initial intelligence suggests the 
                        protest was conceived over several 
                        social media sites and coordinated 
                        using cell phones. We’re working to 
                        identify those involved.

           The hairs on the back of Branko’s neck tingle. He knows from 
           experience that uprisings aren’t always grassroots.

                                 BRANKO
                        Is foreign influence possible?  

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Always, but unlikely. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Are you certain?

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        We’ve been able to track the meta-
                        data from the devices to entirely 
                        domestic server hubs. 

           Hearing this, Branko’s relieved. The answer is so simple. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Shut down the Internet. Then 
                        dispatch the Krypteia to crush 
                        this... demonstration. Decisively. 

           Vukovic lets the gravity of this order sink in. 
                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Yes, Mr. President. 

           The General hurries off.

                                 BRANKO
                             (to himself)
                        Branko gives and Branko takes away. 

           He whips the horse with a riding crop, it trots away. He’s 
           already moved on with his life.

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           The protesters have gained ground, pushing the riot police 
           back. Emboldened, more join in.

           Some try to check their phones, but-- THE SIGNAL IS GONE.

           Mass confusion spreads. 

           Seemingly out of nowhere, a REGIMENT of Secret Police MOUNTED 
           on HORSEBACK flanks them and CHARGES right into the CROWD.

           Protesters are TRAMPLED, bones crushed between steel 
           horseshoes and the pavement. 

           Krypteia pummel those left standing with STEEL BATONS.

           Its nerve lost, the crowd flees the square in panic. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Looney Tunes play on TV-- Road Runner and Coyote at it again. 

           Bob assembles a collapsible SATELLITE DISH. He connects it to 
           a HI-TECH WIRELESS ROUTER and stuffs it into a backpack. 

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - NIGHT

           The once-chaotic square is now silent, void of people. Faint 
           moonlight casts a shadow of BRANKO’S STATUE. 

           INT. BRANKO STATUE 

           INSIDE THE STATUE’S HEAD: Bob, dressed in all black, conceals 
           his device. The statue now acts as a SATELLITE ANTENNA.  

           He pulls a mask over his face, descends the SPIRAL STAIRCASE 
           and out a door into--
           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           He exits the statue’s base, locks the door behind him. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The “Freedom Now!” leadership is frantic.

                                 FILIP
                        Our entire network is paralyzed. 
                        We’re dead in the water. 

                                 TERESA
                        How can you think about the 
                        Internet when our own supporters 
                        and police are dying?

           He’s not going to be drawn into another debate with her.

                                 FILIP
                        What’s important is that we fight 
                        on, so they didn’t die for nothing. 
                        And we can’t win a revolution if we 
                        can’t organize!

                                 TERESA
                        We organized without the Internet 
                        before, we can do it again. 

           Bob enters.

                                 BOB
                        We won’t have to. 

                                 FILIP
                        What? It’s going to take a miracle 
                        to get Branko to turn it back on.

                                 BOB
                        Give me your phone.

           Teresa does. Bob types into the phone. 

                                 FILIP
                        That might as well be a doorstop 
                        without a connection. 

           Bob hands the phone back to Teresa. 

                                 BOB
                        Google something.
                             (on her look)
                        Just try it. Humor me.
           Teresa opens a GOOGLE SEARCH PAGE. She types in a search. To 
           her bewilderment, the results populate.

                                 TERESA
                        What did you do? 

                                 BOB
                        You asked for a miracle, I give you 
                        W-LAN Wi-Fi. 

                                 TERESA
                        What network are you using?

                                 BOB
                        See for yourself.

           Teresa checks her phone. She’s connected to a WI-FI NETWORK 
           named: “FREEDOM NOW!”

                                 TERESA
                        How is this possible?

                                 BOB
                        An array of geosynchronous 
                        satellites 90 miles above us beams 
                        down the signal, creating a massive 
                        Wi-Fi hotspot. A private network. 
                        All you need is the password.

                                 TERESA
                        Who has the technology to do that?

                                 BOB
                        My university developed it so 
                        scientists conducting studies in 
                        remote parts of the world can share 
                        data in real-time. 

                                 FILIP
                        You set this up? You knew Branko 
                        would cut off the Internet?

                                 BOB
                        Of course. The first freedom 
                        tyrants must take away is speech. 
                        They know that if subjects can say 
                        what they want, whenever they want, 
                        they won’t be subjects for long. 

                                 TERESA
                        This is incredible.

                                 FILIP
                        We’re back in business.
                                 BOB
                        We’ve only just begun. 

           INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT

           “Freedom Now!” holds a SERIES of secret rallies:

           -- BAR BASEMENT -- Filip addresses the crowd. He’s getting 
           the hang of it, gesturing as Bob taught.

                                 FILIP
                        Look at what Branko has done. He is 
                        a tyrant. The Krypteia violate us 
                        and subject us to constant terror. 

           The people BOO and JEER.

                                 FILIP
                        But that fear ends now. He’s got to 
                        go! Branko out, freedom now!

           -- RESTAURANT, AFTER-HOURS -- Teresa speaks to the crowd.

                                 TERESA
                        Let us do away with hate and 
                        bigotry! Let us bring civil rights 
                        to Tarmania. 

           -- SUPPORTER’S HOUSE -- Packed to the rafters. 

                                 FILIP
                        No more will Branko levy unjust 
                        taxes while his regime is exempt! 
                        No more will he cut off our imports 
                        and force us to buy only his goods 
                        from his outlets at obscene prices!

           -- WAREHOUSE --

                                 TERESA
                        Brothers and sisters, in the name 
                        of virtue and liberty let us unite!  

           BEHIND THE CURTAIN-- The crowd cheers as Bob watches with 
           Filip beside him. 

                                 BOB
                             (to Filip)
                        Inspiring stuff. Unity’s a powerful 
                        message. 
                                 FILIP
                        We don’t need unity, we need to 
                        prepare for war.  

                                 BOB
                        And that attitude is why you should 
                        be leading “Freedom Now!”.

           Filip looks equal parts complimented and confused. 

                                 BOB
                        The committee approach is nice, but 
                        every movement needs a face. A 
                        “Mandela.” Someone who can inspire, 
                        but also make the tough decisions. 
                        Only one man can succeed Branko.
                             (then)
                        When that happens, your influential 
                        friends will become dangerous.

           Filip’s ego inflates.

                                 FILIP
                        I have no problem breaking a few 
                        eggs.

           Bob leans in, WHISPERS something.  

                                 PROTESTORS (PRE-LAP)
                        Branko out! Freedom Now! 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           “Freedom Now!” SUPPORTERS use Bob’s satellite Wi-Fi network 
           to coordinate another PROTEST. 

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           Branko gives a speech at a podium in front of NEWS CAMERAS. 

                                 BRANKO
                        ...they claim they speak for all of 
                        Tarmania. They lie. My fellow 
                        citizens, I ask you to take to the 
                        streets. Show these traitors how 
                        much you love your President.

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           “Freedom Now!” protesters CLASH with Pro-Branko SUPPORTERS. 
           Some wear bandanas or Guy Fawkes masks. 
           Citizens battle with improvised weapons-- slingshots, clubs, 
           trash can lids as shields. Hurl Molotov cocktails. 

           Cars and piles of trash BURN. It’s a war zone. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Bob and Branko finish the course. 

           As a servant clears Bob’s plate, he notices that Bob has 
           arranged the remnants of his vegetables into a SMILEY FACE. 

           Branko dabs the corners of his mouth with a SILK NAPKIN.

                                 BRANKO
                        Our grand game of tug-of-war 
                        provided quite the spectacle.

           The room’s crystal chandeliers DIM.

                                 BOB
                        What’s with the mood-lighting? You 
                        trying to seduce me?

                                 BRANKO
                        I like to have a little 
                        entertainment to break up the meal. 
                        Gives us a chance to digest.

           THIRTY members of an ORCHESTRA emerge, instruments in hand. 

                                 BOB
                        Oh, I get it. Like a halftime show. 

           A servant places a PLUSH CHAIR and leather VIOLIN CASE at the 
           front. Branko opens it. Removes a pristine STRADIVARIUS. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Antonio Stradivari handcrafted this 
                        in 1723. Worth 16 million. 

           The orchestra slowly crescendos as Branko sits, draws the 
           bow. Starts to PLAY-- but he’s off. Flat, out of tune. 

           Bob covers his mouth, stifling a giggle. 

           Branko notices, annoyed. He continues furiously. The 
           orchestra plays louder, trying to cover his mistakes. 

           Bob tries to stonewall, but he’s full-on LAUGHING now. Branko 
           STOPS. Unsure and uneasy, the band keeps playing.
                                 BRANKO
                        What is so funny?

                                 BOB
                        You. You’re awful! And you don’t 
                        realize it because you play with a 
                        bunch of spineless yes-men who 
                        can’t tell you the truth. 

           Branko’s eyes read FIRE. He rears back, SMASHES the antique 
           violin on the chair OVER AND OVER until only SHARDS remain.

           Talk about an overreaction to criticism. 

           The MUSIC STOPS. Everybody stands at attention, frozen.

                                 BRANKO
                        That’s enough! Leave us!

           The musicians and servants rush out of the room. 

           Bob slugs back his drink, enjoys getting under Branko’s skin. 

                                 BOB
                        Well, you clearly didn’t pick up 
                        much of the playbook on the last go 
                        around. Step #4 is: Be disruptive, 
                        unpredictable. Use sabotage to keep 
                        the leader off-balance. Make sure 
                        you have the world’s attention when 
                        he overreacts.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           SUP: 54 Days Ago. 

           Bob has MAPS up on the board. The “Freedom Now!” leadership 
           listens as he briefs them on their mission.

                                 BOB
                        We can’t hit his military forces 
                        directly. So we hit Branko where it 
                        hurts: the state distribution 
                        routes and the harbor. These are 
                        his pressure points. Squeeze them.

           EXT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           A POLICE CRUISER parks. TWO POLICEMEN get out and are 
           welcomed into a BROTHEL by ESCORTS.
           Filip and Teresa covertly break into the cruiser, steal it.

           EXT. STATE FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTER - DAY

           A SEMI TRUCK pulls out of the giant complex’s loading bay and 
           is cleared through a heavily-guarded perimeter gate. 

           I/E. SEMI TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER (MOVING)

           FOUR ARMED GUARDS sit on benches. Clearly Branko thinks their 
           cargo is valuable enough to require this level of protection. 

           The DRIVER sees a POLICE ROADBLOCK ahead. He slows the semi 
           to a stop, rolls down his window. 

           CLICK! Filip jams his Makarov in the driver’s face. He 
           reaches inside the cab and unlocks the doors.

           SUPPORTERS with AK-47s rush in from their hiding-spots in the 
           DITCH and throw the rest of the doors open. 

           It all happens so fast the guards are not able to react. They 
           surrender peacefully.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           The guards are lined up, held at gunpoint by Filip’s men. 

           Teresa opens the rear hatch of the SEMI TRAILER- it’s not 
           carrying gold or diamonds, but FOOD. Pallets of simple 
           staples-- bread, milk, eggs, bottled water.

                                 TERESA
                        There’s enough food here to feed a 
                        thousand people for weeks. 

           Filip nods. He and his men EXECUTE the guards with MACHINE 
           GUN FIRE-- bodies fall into a pile in the ditch. 

           Teresa’s jaw drops, horrified. She stumbles toward the ditch, 
           eyeing the carnage. Tears stream.  

           She spins, barrels toward Filip, glassy eyes now shooting 
           daggers.

           She SHOVES Filip, beats on his chest with her flailing fists.

                                 TERESA
                        Monster! What is wrong with you?! 

           Filip grabs her wrists, stopping her assault. 
                                 FILIP
                        They get fat while we starve. Fuck 
                        them. 

                                 TERESA
                        We don’t murder people who 
                        surrender peacefully. We have to be 
                        better than Branko.

           Filip shrugs her off, gestures to his men.

                                 FILIP
                        Everybody load up.

           Filip climbs into the semi. Teresa glares as it pulls away.

           EXT. TARMANIA HARBOR - NIGHT

           A massive CARGO SHIP stacked tall with SHIPPING CONTAINERS is 
           ported in the HARBOR. 

           EXT. CONTAINER SHIP 

           Filip, Teresa and a dozen masked supporters armed with AK-
           47s, swarm onto the DECK like pirates. Climbing LADDERS and 
           ROPES they hook onto the side of the ship. 

           The element of surprise allows them to get the drop on ARMED 
           PORT GUARDS, who are forced to comply without resistance. 

           Filip uses their keys to open the CONTAINERS. Jackpot. 
           They’re filled with CRATES OF FINE WINE, BOURBON and CLOTHES. 

           Parked inside one is a LAMBORGHINI VENENO-- the most 
           expensive car in the world.

           Supporters TOSS armfuls of DESIGNER CLOTHES into the HARBOR 
           as Teresa RECORDS the whole thing on her PHONE.

           They use an impromptu ZIP-LINE to off-load some of the crates 
           into VANS parked on the DOCK. 

           Once the vans are packed to the gills, Filip motions 
           everybody to retreat to the vans for extraction. 

           Each supporter clips on, RIDES the zip-line down to the vans.

           Filip stays behind. He STARTS the LAMBORGHINI. Jams a PIPE in 
           between the ACCELERATOR and driver’s seat. The engine ROARS 
           as it revs. He shifts it into DRIVE and-- 
           INT. THEATER - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE

           Branko watches in horror as the Lamborghini shoots out of the 
           container like a MISSILE. It splashes down into the harbor 
           and sinks amid the floating debris of FINE GOODS.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        Terrorist group “Freedom Now!” took 
                        credit for the attack in a video 
                        posted on Twitter this morning.

           General Vukovic stands tensely by his side.

                                 BRANKO
                        Get that off the broadcast! Now! 
                        Have whoever put that up killed.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Yes, Mr. President.

           With a nod, General Vukovic commands two Krypteia to do so. 

                                 BRANKO
                        What the fuck is going on?! 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        We’ve doubled our security on food 
                        distribution convoys. But we had no 
                        intelligence they’d be coordinated 
                        enough to hit the port. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You told me they were coordinating 
                        using social media. So tell me how 
                        they’re still able to do it without 
                        the FUCKING INTERNET?!

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I do not know, sir. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You better find out. How’s the U.N. 
                        going to take me seriously if I 
                        can’t even control my own people?
                             (pacing; frantic)
                        I’m declaring a state of emergency. 
                        Institute Martial Law. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Sir, I’m obligated to remind you, 
                        that would effectively grind 
                        Tarmania to a halt, and likely 
                        escalate the situation. 
                                 BRANKO
                        Escalate?! This movement is growing 
                        exponentially. 
                             (beat)
                        People don’t organize at this level 
                        without being led. Find the 
                        leaders. Kill them. Quickly.

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT

           MARTIAL LAW is in effect-- CONVOYS of Secret Police patrol 
           the city. Occasionally they make a stop, dismount and RAID--

           I/E. MULTIPLE LOCATIONS - DAY/NIGHT

           -- Secret Police RANSACK houses, tenements, businesses-- 
           searching for some shred of evidence that would lead to the 
           identity of the leadership. 

           -- They emerge, perp-walking ZIP-TIED CITIZENS at gunpoint, 
           force them into the back of ARMORED VANS.

           -- Krypteia gather families in front of their homes. They 
           single-out a father. Force the rest to watch as they BEAT him 
           to DEATH with clubs- a brutal example. 

           INT. BASEMENT - PUB - NIGHT

           It’s been converted into a REFUGE to hide its leadership from 
           the Krypteia’s Martial Law tactics. 

           A flickering OIL LANTERN drives the darkness from one corner 
           of the dank space, dimly illuminating stacks of food-stuffs, 
           cases of bottled water and rows of thin COTS. 

           Among them, Teresa tosses and turns under a gauzy blanket-- a 
           futile attempt to get comfortable on the frigid cement floor.  

           ACROSS THE ROOM-- While the others try to get some sleep, 
           Filip paces around the lantern, mumbling to himself. 

           From a bar chair, Bob sips a shot of fine bourbon and 
           watches, trying to hide his amusement at Filip dancing around 
           the flame like a moth. 

                                 BOB
                             (voice low)
                        Filip, you look like you could use 
                        a drink. A shot of Kentucky’s 
                        finest might help you sleep.
           Bob pours a shot for Filip, who doesn’t acknowledge.

           Bob shrugs and takes the shot for himself. Sighs, it’s good. 

           INT. SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS - SAME TIME

           Kitted up in tactical gear, General Vukovic briefs two teams 
           of KRYPTEIA COMMANDOS on a mission.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        New intelligence from an informant 
                        suggests the rebel leadership has 
                        been squatting at this bar to avoid 
                        our sweeps. This is our target.  

           INT. BASEMENT - PUB - SAME TIME

                                 FILIP
                        I can’t take being down here 
                        another second. We do nothing while 
                        Branko and his Krypteia destroy 
                        everything we have built.

                                 BOB
                        You have to be tired of hearing it, 
                        because I am tired of saying it: 
                        this is all part of the plan.

           ON TERESA’S COT-- She listens in on Bob and Filip, skeptical.

                                 FILIP (O.S.)
                        Yes, well, hiding in this shit hole 
                        like vermin waiting to be 
                        exterminated has me questioning 
                        this plan of yours. 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Fear is toxic, and not a quality 
                        people value in a leader.

           BACK ACROSS THE ROOM-- Bob winks, pours another shot for 
           Filip and himself.

                                 BOB
                        So, you might want to keep your 
                        voice down. People are trying to 
                        sleep.

           Filip senses Bob’s manipulation. He bows up his chest.
                                 FILIP
                             (raising his voice)
                        No... I won’t keep it down. I’ve 
                        had enough of this shit. We deserve 
                        to know what is going on.

           The rest audibly stir, in agreement with Filip.

           EXT. SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           General Vukovic and the Krypteia commandos mount up into 
           armored Suburbans and move out. The convoy speeds past the 
           secured perimeter. 

           INT. BASEMENT - PUB 

           Bob senses the brewing mutiny. The eyes of the grimy, weary 
           and disillusioned leadership are all fixed on him now.  

                                 FILIP
                        How can we win a war against Branko 
                        if we are not even fighting it? 

           Bob rises with the aid of his cane, ALS trembling.

                                 BOB
                        Okay. You’re right. Allow me to 
                        enlighten you. 
                             (beat; to all)
                        You see, the battlefield is not out 
                        there on the streets... It is 
                        inside people’s minds. And it’s 
                        there, that Branko is losing. 

           Filip doesn’t understand, almost taking it as disrespect. 

                                 FILIP
                        For two weeks now we’ve been eating 
                        where we’re sleeping, and sleeping 
                        where we’re shitting, and we have 
                        not had a single rally. Not one. 
                        Make us understand why. 

                                 BOB
                        There is a time for everything. 
                        Soon, it will be time for us to 
                        strike back.

           Filip grandstands, looking to his audience, chuckling.  

                                 FILIP
                        Strike back?... With what army?
           EXT. PUB - NIGHT

           The Krypteia convoy switches its lights off, silently rolls 
           up to the front of the bar. General Vukovic orders his 
           commandos to dismount, stack on the ENTRANCE.

           INT. BASEMENT - PUB 

                                 BOB
                        I’ll reach out to some of my 
                        colleagues. They’ll arrange for the 
                        firepower to be delivered. 

                                 FILIP
                        So now we’re supposed to believe 
                        your college comrades can get us 
                        truckloads of A-Ks and R-P-Gs?

                                 BOB
                        More like C-N-Ns and B-B-Cs. My 
                        friends don’t carry guns, they 
                        carry cameras. And when they 
                        broadcast Branko’s atrocities live 
                        to the world in crystal clear 4-K, 
                        the U.N. will crawl so far up his 
                        ass, they’ll be chewing his food 
                        for him. 
                             (beat)
                        He’s been so busy looking for us, 
                        that he’s failed to look at 
                        himself. That’s misdirection. 

           EXT. PUB - NIGHT

           The Krypteia BASH open the door with a battering ram. 

           INT. PUB - CONTINUOUS

           The commandos rush inside, clearing every section...then down 
           to the basement... 

           ...but it’s totally EMPTY. 

           They’re dumfounded. General Vukovic is furious. 

           POP WIDE: We realize, this is a completely DIFFERENT bar from 
           where they are hiding. They held a rally here once. But Bob 
           was smart enough not to use the same place twice.  
           INT. BASEMENT - PUB - SAME TIME

           Bob confidently pours himself another shot of bourbon. 

                                 BOB
                        Branko is a man possessed by 
                        vanity. He won’t be able to bear 
                        his reputation being sullied on the 
                        global stage. So he’ll be forced to 
                        yield to the mounting political 
                        pressure and suspend Martial Law. 
                             (beat)
                        And when he does, everyone he’s 
                        abused along the way will flock to 
                        join us.  

           Bob slams the shot like a boss. 

           Filip looks to the others-- visibly satisfied. Teresa tries 
           to hold back an impressed smile-- this is more her speed.  

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           The “Freedom Now!” PROTESTORS are back. There’s more than 
           ever, and they are pissed. They CHANT and wave signs decrying 
           the Martial Law and the Secret Police’s brutal tactics.

           RIOT POLICE passively keep them at bay, now held in check by 
           international peacekeepers of a sort-- JOURNALISTS and NEWS 
           CREWS from CNN, the BBC, Deutsche Wells, France 24-- 

           You name ‘em, they’re here, and they’ve been camped in the 
           square for days like a Forward Operating Base-- 

           A cavalry of NEWS VANS mounted with satellite dishes 
           broadcast LIVE from artillery batteries of high-def CAMERAS 
           covering every sector.   

           A STATE SEMI-TRUCK approaches a VEHICLE CHECKPOINT to the 
           square. Police wave it through. Protestors make way as it 
           pulls into the center of the square. 

           Its DRIVER gets out, joins a few COHORTS, who throw open the 
           trailer doors and distribute food to the protestors-- we 
           RECOGNIZE THEM as some of the movement’s most loyal 
           supporters, disguised in state guard uniforms.

           One of them unfurls a banner on the side of the trailer that 
           has been GRAFFITIED with “COURTESY OF FREEDOM NOW!”. We can 
           now tell it’s the STOLEN semi.

           Realizing they’ve been had, the police seethe.  
           Protesters swarm in. CHEER in support. Cry tears of joy as 
           they receive armfuls of FOOD. Show it to the news cameras. 

           The media eats it up.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - LATER

           Branko wears a silk robe, drinks champagne while he channel-
           surfs on a 100-inch curved TV from his massive bed. A pair of 
           passed-out GIRLS flank him. Classic Branko. 

           Servants are posted at every doorway. 

           He irreverently picks through an assortment of fine cheeses, 
           dried dates, nuts and fresh grapes artfully displayed on a 
           gold-gilt platter set across his lap.

           Branko thrusts his gold chalice into the air. After a beat, 
           he impatiently twiddles it.

                                 BRANKO
                             (to servant)
                        Idiot, this means more.

           A servant draws a bottle of Cristal champagne from a gold 
           bucket of ice and fills Branko’s chalice in a hurry.

                                 BRANKO
                        Next.

           Branko SNAPS his fingers at another servant with an iPad. 

           The channel changes to CNN-- ANDERSON COOPER reports on the 
           grassroots uprising and deteriorating situation in Tarmania.

           SNAP! Now MSNBC-- RACHEL MADDOW scolds Branko for imposing 
           Martial Law on his impoverished people while he lives large.

           Branko’s anger is escalating exponentially. SNAP!

           Onto HBO-- JOHN OLIVER skewers Branko over photos showing him 
           in various unflattering poses-- highlighting his plastic 
           surgery, hair plugs, douchey clothes.

                                 JOHN OLIVER
                        Tarmanian President Branko 
                        Zharadnic has officially won the 
                        award for world’s creepiest clown, 
                        just barely edging out Stephen 
                        King’s Pennywise, Ronald McDonald 
                        and the reigning Clown-in-Chief, 
                        Donald Trump.
           Branko’s face is now flush red, blood boiling, fuming.

                                 BRANKO
                        Turn it off or die!

           Enraged, he throws the food off the tray. Catches his own 
           reflection in the gold-plating-- warped like a funhouse 
           mirror. Leans close to examine his hairline. Pokes at 
           blemishes on his face. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Get out! Get out, get out, GET OUT!

           Terrified, everyone flees the room. 

           Branko continues obsessing over his imperfections. Underneath 
           all the bravado lies massive insecurities.

           INT. SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           A room full of the Krypteia’s high-level brass present intel 
           briefs to their commanding officer, General Vukovic.

           Branko storms in with no regard for his interruption. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Suspend Martial Law!

           Vukovic and his men scramble to stand at attention.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        What?

                                 BRANKO
                        Are you fucking deaf?! Suspend 
                        Martial Law at once! I won’t let a 
                        bunch of bleating sheep jeopardize 
                        my bid to the U.N.

           AND Branko is gone just as quickly as he came. 

           Vukovic waits a beat until Branko is certainly long gone. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Yes, sir... Mr. Clown-in-Chief.

           The room chuckles at Vukovic’s rare exhibition of humor. Even 
           he cracks the first hint of a smile we’ve ever seen from him. 
           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Citizens flocking to join the movement cram inside for 
           another RALLY. 

           Teresa serves them HOT MEALS and Branko’s FINE WINE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Bob and Branko consume rare roast beef and boiled potatoes. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Losing a shipload of my effects was 
                        nothing but an annoyance.

                                 BOB
                        Those who have much, have much to 
                        lose, huh?

                                 BRANKO
                        I have no problem giving my enemies 
                        a chance to eat and drink like 
                        kings before they’re executed. 

                                 BOB
                        Watch out, pretty soon they’ll be 
                        calling you Branko the Benevolent. 

           Branko’s picking up on Bob’s sarcasm. Waves him to continue.

                                 BOB
                        Still can’t take a joke. Okay, Step 
                        #5: Select the new leader from the 
                        opposition movement. Once the 
                        country has fallen into chaos, 
                        offer him to the people as an 
                        alternative that promises to 
                        restore order.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           SUP: 31 Days Ago.

           Riots, unrest and anarchy have spread all over the country. 

           Protestors BURN BRANKO IN EFFIGY.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Prepped for another rally. The “Freedom Now!” leadership sit 
           at a table, locked in a heated debate. 

                                 BOB
                        We all have an equal voice at this 
                        table, and that won’t change. But 
                        the fact remains, Branko needs a 
                        challenger. A singular face of the 
                        movement people can rally behind.
                             (beat)
                        My vote goes to Filip.

           Filip shoots Bob a knowing glance.

           Teresa looks around the room as one-by-one, the leadership 
           votes for Filip. She can’t believe, out of all the decent 
           candidates, they’ve chosen the biggest asshole of the bunch. 
           Strength has been valued over empathy. 

           It’s her turn. She acquiesces to the will of the majority.

                                 TERESA
                        So it’s Filip, then. 

                                 FILIP
                        I’m honored. We’re going to change 
                        this country, together. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Bob shovels the remains of the course into his mouth. Branko 
           watches on, disturbed at Bob’s degrading manners. 

                                 BRANKO
                        I wonder, why did you pick Filip as 
                        the one to usurp me? We have 
                        nothing in common. 

           Bob chomps his dinner while he talks. Flecks of food fly.

                                 BOB
                        That’s incorrect. 

                                 BRANKO
                             (offended)
                        Name one thing.
                                 BOB
                        Besides overcompensating for a tiny 
                        dick-tator? 

                                 BRANKO
                        Quite the silver tongue you have. 
                        Shall I have them cut it out?

           Bob gulps his wine, swishes it in his mouth like Scope and 
           washes it all down with an obnoxious BELCH.

                                 BOB
                        Was that over the line?
                             (sighs)
                        Okay, you and Filip both possess 
                        the three “must haves” of any 
                        successful revolutionary leader.
                             (beat)
                        He must be revered by the populous.

                                 BRANKO
                        Of course.

                                 BOB
                        He must have been persecuted for 
                        his political beliefs.

                                 BRANKO
                        Sounds familiar.

                                 BOB
                        He must be perceived as an 
                        unwavering patriot.

                                 BRANKO
                        Definitely me. 

           Bob nods to Branko, cocky.

                                 BOB
                        See. Told you.

           Bob returns to eating his food. Branko digs for a comeback. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You left out the most important 
                        one. “He must live long enough to 
                        see victory.” 

           Bob shrugs, giving Branko props. He raises his wine glass

                                 BOB
                        Touché, Mr. President. 
           Branko grins in satisfaction, finishes the rest of his wine 
           in one long confident swig. That tasted incredible. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE 

           SUP: 23 Days Ago.

           General Vukovic and his staff update Branko on their 
           investigation into the growing movement. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Despite their attempts to stay 
                        hidden, we’ve identified the inner 
                        circle running “Freedom Now!”. The 
                        good news is, it’s small. 

           An ORG CHART of the leadership is projected onto the wall. 

           Vukovic changes the slide to a PHOTO of Filip. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        We believe the ringleader is this 
                        man: Filip Dragic. 

           Branko’s eyes narrow on the photo, the face of his enemy.  

                                 BRANKO
                        Tell me everything about him.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Dragic was one of our own, enlisted 
                        in our army and rose to the rank of 
                        sergeant before he was caught 
                        distributing subversive material. 
                        He spent four years in Krypteia re-
                        education camp and was released 
                        just nine months ago-- 

                                 BRANKO
                             (cutting him off)
                        There is no way a sergeant has even 
                        a shred of the cunning it would 
                        take to organize and lead a faction 
                        of this magnitude. Who’s next? 

           General Vukovic flips to the next slide-- a PHOTO of Teresa.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        This is Teresa Kasun. She was 
                        educated at Tarmania University--
           Branko’s chauvinism instantly dismisses that she could be a 
           threat to his power.

                                 BRANKO
                        A woman? Psshh. Next... This is all 
                        you have?

           Vukovic flips through the slides. One catches Branko’s eye-- 
           an IMAGE capture from a Krypteia surveillance feed-- a wide 
           shot of the leadership exiting the pub. It flips to another.  

                                 BRANKO
                        Stop. Go back.

           The General does. Branko’s eyes narrow on the surveillance 
           image- amongst the group is BOB, in his Dr. Spartak Luga 
           cover. He looks so familiar, Branko’s having déjà vu. 

           Then the realization hits him. 

                                 BRANKO
                             (blurting)
                        Everyone out now! General Vukovic, 
                        you stay.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        You heard the President!

           The Intelligence Officers scurry out of the room. 

           Branko gets up, points to Bob on the screen.

                                 BRANKO
                        Who is this man?

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        We haven’t been able to I-D him 
                        yet, but our intelligence suggests 
                        he’s not a key player.

                                 BRANKO
                        Then our intelligence has failed. 
                        You don’t recognize this man? Think 
                        hard.

           General Vukovic is drawing a blank.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        No, sir. We cannot seem to find 
                        much on him either. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Of course you can’t! That’s because 
                        he’s The Kingbreaker!
           It takes a moment for the General to place that name. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        The C-I-A man?

                                 BRANKO
                        He’s behind this uprising. I want 
                        to know why. And this doesn’t leave 
                        the room. You and I are the only 
                        ones who know about last time. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Are you sure?

                                 BRANKO
                        Absolutely. I killed the rest. And 
                        you buried the bodies.

           Vukovic starts to think he might be next. 

                                 BRANKO
                        I can’t believe you let him get 
                        this far. Find him. Or take his 
                        place on the blocks.

           Vukovic was right. Branko storms out of the room. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Branko catches Bob staring at the ANTIQUE GOLD CLOCK.

                                 BRANKO
                        I’ve noticed you have an affinity 
                        for that clock. You have good 
                        taste. It’s a Breguet, worth over 8 
                        million, U.S. 

           Bob doesn’t respond. Just stares at the clock.

                                 BRANKO
                        Must be difficult watching the last 
                        few moments of your life tick away. 
                        Tic. Toc. Tic. Toc.

           Bob snaps out of it. He looks to Branko, angered.

                                 BOB
                        Hey pal, you offered me a five-star 
                        meal and a quick death if I told 
                        you my process. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        But instead, I’m choking down goat 
                        brain while you drone on like an 
                        obnoxious child that won a stuffed 
                        animal at a carnival! It’s worse 
                        than the fucking torture!

           Bob waves in a servant for more wine.

                                 BOB
                        One more over here.

           The servant fills his glass from a crystal decanter. Bob 
           immediately chugs it. He grabs the servant’s arm.

                                 BOB
                        Let me just save you the trip.

           Bob downs the rest of the glass and presents it again.

                                 BOB
                        Fill ’er up. 

           Branko eyes Bob almost feeling pity. Bob slumps, broken.

                                 BRANKO
                        Do you even know why you were sent 
                        to depose me?

                                 BOB
                        Don’t know. Don't care. Never have. 
                        Order came down from above. I’m 
                        just here to do a job and win.

                                 BRANKO
                        Unfortunately for you. You’ve lost.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           SUP: 6 Days Ago. 

           The leadership of “Freedom Now!” has convened at their HQ. 
           Filip addresses them. 

                                 FILIP
                        Branko is weak. We are strong. The 
                        time has come to raise an army and 
                        go to war!

           Some of them CHEER. 
           Bob notices Teresa watching, pained, rubbing her pendant. She 
           wipes away tears, hoping no one noticed. Bob approaches. 

                                 BOB
                        Can I trouble you for some tea? 
                             (on his tremor)
                        I’d just make a mess.

                                 TERESA
                        Sure. 

                                 FILIP
                             (continuing his speech)
                        The time has come to drag Branko 
                        and every last one of his dogs out 
                        of their mansions and onto the 
                        streets they’ve neglected and put 
                        fucking bullets in their heads!

           The leadership CHEERS even louder. Filip eyes Bob and Teresa 
           moving to the makeshift--

           KITCHEN-- Teresa fills a kettle with water, uses a long match 
           to light a portable propane stove. 

           Bob notices he’s not the only one shaking.

                                 BOB
                        Teresa, are you alright?

           Teresa SLAMS the kettle down on the burner.

                                 TERESA
                        No, I’m not alright! Filip is going 
                        to start a civil war that will 
                        destroy what’s left of our country. 
                        I prayed it wouldn’t come to this.

           Bob puts his arm around her shoulder, it tremors.

                                 BOB
                        I understand. 

           Teresa sees the toll the movement has taken on him.

                                 TERESA
                        No, I’m sorry. You’ve given so much 
                        time and energy to this. It must be 
                        so hard with your condition.  

                                 BOB
                        I don’t do well with pity.  
                                 TERESA
                        Not pity, gratitude. Everything’s 
                        happening so fast, I just realized 
                        I’ve never stopped to ask you about 
                        your life.

                                 BOB
                        I told you I’m a professor...

                                 TERESA
                        I know the genius doctor with the 
                        plan. But who are you really? Like 
                        on the inside?

                                 BOB
                        Inside?

                                 TERESA
                        Yeah, you know, is there anything 
                        you’re passionate about other than 
                        this revolution? What are your 
                        hopes? Dreams?
                             (beat)
                        Is there a Mrs. Luga waiting back 
                        in Boston? Do you have children?

           The sort of people Bob deals with never ask personal 
           questions. Don’t care enough to. He improvises an answer.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I married this girl. We had a 
                        couple kids. 

                                 TERESA
                        You must feel miserable being away 
                        from your family for so long.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, it has been miserable. But 
                        hey, it is what it is.

           Teresa picks up on Bob’s tone- cold, detached. His sociopathy 
           makes it difficult to lie about such foreign emotions.   

                                 TERESA
                        Really? See, I couldn’t bear that. 
                        Are they young?

                                 BOB
                        Very young. 

                                 TERESA
                        I bet your wife can’t wait until 
                        you come home.
                                 BOB
                        Oh, she died a while back. 

                                 TERESA
                        I’m so sorry. Who’s taking care of 
                        your kids?

           The TEA KETTLE starts to WHISTLE. 

                                 BOB
                        My parents...

           Teresa blinks, processing-- suddenly it dawns on her-- Bob’s 
           story doesn’t add up. 

                                 TERESA
                        The ones who died in Tarmania after 
                        you went into exile?

           Bob realizes he’s caught in his own lie.

           Teresa’s empathy meter is so sensitive she can tell he’s full 
           of shit. She always knew something about him was off, but 
           overrode her intuition. 

           The kettle whistle has built to a PIERCING crescendo. 

           A moment of frozen intensity. What’s her next move?

           BOOM! An explosion rocks the building, drawing Bob and 
           Teresa’s attention. 

           RATATATAT! The sound of machine gun fire nears.

           MAIN AREA

           A REBEL yells out. 

                                 REBEL #1
                        Krypteia! It’s a raid!

           He’s RIDDLED with bullets as Krypteia rush in, guns blazing. 

           They’re not here to take prisoners. This is a kill squad.

           Rebels ready their AK-47s to engage the invaders...

           ...but they are out-gunned and out-numbered by the 
           professionals.  

           Rebels fall one after another like bloody dominos. 

           Even those who surrender aren’t met with mercy. 
           KITCHEN

           Teresa freezes. Bob’s demeanor shifts, DROPS HIS COVER ACT-- 
           posture straightens, eyes focus. He drops the cane, loses the 
           glasses. Moves to the door, peers out-- it’s a bloodbath.

           He drives his shoulder into the refrigerator, topples it 
           over, barring the door.

                                 TERESA
                             (sputtering fragments)
                        How did? Who are? What’s going? 

                                 BOB
                        We have to go. I’ll explain later.

                                 TERESA
                        What... what about the others?

                                 BOB
                        They’re not gonna let anyone leave 
                        this building alive. We need to 
                        worry about ourselves.

           He grabs Teresa’s hand and urgently leads her down a stairway 
           into the BASEMENT. 

           BEHIND THE CURTAIN

           Filip throws open a case revealing an PKM BELT-FED MACHINE 
           GUN. He loads it up. 

           MAIN AREA

           The Krypteia spread out tactically, engaging rebels. 

           Filip emerges from the curtain and lets loose with the PKM. 
           RATATATAT! Successfully downs a handful of Secret Police. 

           Others RETURN FIRE. 

           Filip’s HIT multiple times, but continues to SPRAY WILDLY. He 
           steadies his machine gun on the podium, hitting a few more. 

           The rest key-in on Filip-- bullets splinter the podium, rip 
           through wood and flesh-- a detonation of blood and debris. 

           Filip finally succumbs, falls to his back-- DEAD. 

           BASEMENT

           Bob moves through the darkness with Teresa in tow. He can 
           HEAR movement at the far end. RATATAT! Bob pulls her to cover 
           at the last second. 
                                 TERESA
                        How can they see us?

                                 BOB
                        Thermal optics.

           Bob notices they are leaning against a crate of Branko’s 
           stolen LIQUOR. 

           He takes out a bottle, tears off some of his shirt sleeve and 
           stuffs it inside-- an improvised MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. He sparks 
           a zippo, lighting the cloth fuse.

           Bob hurls the flaming bottle at the TEAM of Secret Police 
           stalking closer. 

           It shatters on the cement floor, the blaze ENGULFS the front 
           three commandos. The rest are BLINDED, their thermal optics 
           overwhelmed by the flames. 

           Bob charges, snatches the RIFLE from a blinded gunman and 
           sends him careening into the others with a push-kick.

           He DROPS each Krypteia with a precise DOUBLE-TAP to the 
           chest, then to the head. By the time the final piece of brass 
           hits the floor, all resistance has been eliminated.

           Bob returns to Teresa and puts out his hand.

                                 BOB
                        Let’s go.

           Teresa rises, she looks to Bob with shock. This isn’t the 
           work of a nerve disease-addled professor.

           Bob leads them out of the basement and up to the--

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Bob and Teresa emerge from a hidden stairwell. 

           Bob moves to a POLICE CRUISER guarding the outer perimeter. 
           An unsuspecting OFFICER stands nearby, mesmerized by the 
           fireworks of the raid. It’s an action movie playing out live.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Hey, bud.

           The officer turns to see Bob, who lands a few quick and 
           BRUTAL strikes. He grabs the officer’s head and smashes it 
           against the cruiser’s hood, hard. The cop goes limp.
           Teresa is in shock at Bob’s display of physicality. Bob opens 
           the cruiser’s driver-side door.

                                 BOB
                             (to Teresa)
                        Get in.

           RATATAT! A PATROL of Secret Police fires on them-- 

           Bob drops behind the cruiser, snatches up the cop’s PISTOL. 

           He rolls in-line with the front axle. Using it for cover, he 
           RETURNS FIRE underneath the car. Shooting the THREE attackers 
           in the legs, then finishes them off as he runs DRY. 

           But Bob knows more are coming. He slams in a fresh MAGAZINE, 
           slingshots the slide. Climbs behind the wheel of the-- 

           I/E. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Bob straps in, starts the cruiser. He looks for Teresa, still 
           standing outside frozen in shock.

                                 BOB
                        Get in the car now!

           Teresa snaps out of it and gets in. 

           Bob looks straight ahead, TWO Secret Police Mercedes G-WAGONS 
           round a corner, heading straight for him.

           Bob shifts it into reverse and guns the throttle. Using the 
           mirrors, he drives the cruiser BACKWARDS.

           The G-Wagon’s engines ROAR as they gain on Bob and Teresa.

           Bob cuts the wheel, spinning the cruiser 180 degrees and 
           throws it into first gear, speeds through an INTERSECTION. 

           He navigates the city streets at high speeds with the skill 
           and proficiency of a Formula One driver.

                                 BOB
                        Shit, this thing’s a bullet magnet, 
                        and they have armor.
                             (to Teresa)
                        In the back seat, there’s a bag of 
                        riot gear. You see it?  

           Teresa gets eyes on the BAG.

                                 TERESA
                        Uh... I see it. 
                                 BOB
                        There’s a level-four vest inside. I 
                        need you to unfold it and lay it 
                        across so the armored plates are 
                        flat up against the back seat. 

           Teresa follows his instruction.

           A BURST of BULLETS punch holes in the cruiser’s rear window. 
           Bob sinks as low as he can.

                                 BOB
                        Get down and stay down.

           In the REARVIEW MIRROR: Krypteia jut out from the MOONROOF of 
           each G-Wagon, spray H&K MG4 machine guns at Bob’s cruiser-- 
           barking muzzle-flashes into the night like dragon’s breath. 

           Bullets penetrate the cruiser’s thin skin with ease. 

           The rear window SHATTERS. The bulletproof vest dances 
           violently as it absorbs the supersonic projectiles.

           Bob knows it won’t stop much more. He flips a few switches, 
           kicking on the POLICE LIGHTS and SIREN. 

           He jerks the wheel, right into OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. 

           The G-Wagons follow suit. Incoming cars swerve to avoid the 
           FLASHING police cruiser. Bob weaves through the onslaught. 

           The Secret Police try their damnedest to keep up, but Bob’s a 
           superior driver. 

           In a straightaway, one of the G-Wagons gains as its gunner 
           continues to RAIN FIRE on the cruiser.

           Bob guns it, playing chicken with an oncoming car. Teresa 
           loses her breath, braces for impact. 

           At the last possible moment, Bob swerves, sheering off the 
           side-view mirror-- leaving the G-Wagon on his tail with no 
           time to react.

           It impacts the oncoming car in a HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION-- 
           headlights go dark in a cloud of shredded metal and dust. 

           But Bob and Teresa still have one G-Wagon in pursuit. Bob 
           clocks it closing on them. 

                                 BOB
                        Fasten your seat-belt. Keep your 
                        arms in your lap. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        And no matter what, don’t tense up. 
                        We’re about to get in a wreck.

           Teresa’s eyes go wide. She does as instructed.

           He CRANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The cruiser’s wheels lock up. 

           The G-Wagon can’t slow down fast enough and SLAMS into the 
           rear-end of the cruiser. 

           The cruiser’s airbags go off, catching Bob and Teresa’s limp 
           bodies. The mass of crumpled steel screeches to a stop.  

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Bob pushes out of the wrecked cruiser, getting his bearings. 

           He surveys the wreckage-- the G-Wagon’s bumper smashed all 
           the way into the cruiser’s back seat. The moonroof gunner 
           lies in a mangled heap on the cruiser’s hood. The bloodied 
           driver hangs out of his open window. 

           The driver sees Bob approaching and scrambles for his 
           SIDEARM. Bob snatches the pistol from him and puts a SAFETY 
           SHOT in his head. 

           Traffic has stopped to eye the carnage. Bob levels the pistol 
           at a HATCHBACK and motions for the driver to get out. 

           Bob scoops a barely conscious Teresa out of the cruiser 
           wreckage, helps her into the hatchback. He pulls away.

           EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Bob screeches around a corner to a side street. He checks the 
           REARVIEW: doesn’t spot any pursuers.  

           INT. SINGLE-CAR GARAGE - TENEMENT BUILDING

           Bob parks. He hops out, pulls down the door.

           INT. HALL - TENEMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob approaches the SAFE HOUSE door with Teresa in tow. 

           He keys in using the hidden FINGERPRINT SCANNER. Steel bolts 
           retract. The door swings open--
           INT. SAFE HOUSE

           Bob flicks on the lights. Teresa surveys the sterile space, 
           extreme confusion almost leaving her frozen in a fugue state. 

                                 BOB
                        Give me your cell phone.

           She hands it over. Bob takes it and moves into the--

           KITCHEN

           He opens the MICROWAVE and puts his phone inside. 

           Hesitates, makes sure he’s out of view... opens her phone and 
           TYPES something, hits SEND. 

           He tosses hers in, closes the microwave door, hits START. 

           Their phones SPARK, SIZZLE and POP as they fry.

           Bob fishes out the bottle of BOURBON. Pours four fingers into 
           a coffee mug.

                                 BOB
                        Your adrenaline is still spiking 
                        from the shock. 

           LIVING AREA

           He brings the mug in to her. 

                                 BOB
                        Drink this. It’ll calm your nerves. 

           She sips the bourbon, stops when it burns.

                                 BOB
                        No. Finish it.

           She gulps the rest of it down.

                                 BOB
                        Now lie down on the couch and close 
                        your eyes. You need to rest. 

           Not knowing what else to do, Teresa takes his advice. Bob 
           turns to head into the BEDROOM. She sits up, worried.

                                 TERESA
                        Where are you going?

                                 BOB
                        I’ll just be in the other room. 
           He closes the door behind him. Teresa lays back down, spent.

           BEDROOM

           The CASES of GEAR we saw Bob smuggle into the country sit 
           open on the floor next to the mattress. 

           He approaches the desk. Opens his ultra-thin LAPTOP, types in 
           the password. A SECURE VIDEO-CHAT pops up... 

           LIVING AREA

           Through the silence, Teresa can faintly hear Bob conversing 
           with someone. Curious, she gets up and sneaks over to the 
           bedroom door. 

           She silently opens it a crack. Peeks inside--

           BEDROOM

           Bob briefs Sam on the FUBAR status of his op.

                                 SAM
                             (over video chat)
                        You screw the pooch?

                                 BOB
                        Well, my cover’s blown. I exfiled 
                        to the safe-house. H-Q is a total 
                        loss, but I was at least able to 
                        get the girl out in time.

                                 SAM
                        Good. Lay low ‘til morning, then 
                        head for the border. A welcome 
                        party will be waiting.

           The video-chat ends. Bob closes the laptop. He swivels to 
           catch Teresa spying on him. 

                                 BOB
                        I told you to lay down.

           Teresa confronts Bob. 

                                 TERESA
                        You also told me you were a 
                        crippled professor! Who are you?!

                                 BOB
                             (coming clean)
                        What can I say? I’m a spy. A C-I-A 
                        regime-change specialist. My real 
                        name is Bob and I’m from Cleveland. 
                                 TERESA
                        You are so full of shit! Why should 
                        I believe anything you say?

                                 BOB
                        Because you don’t have a choice.

                                 TERESA
                        We always have a choice. Watch me 
                        make mine.

           Teresa makes for the door. Bob cuts her off. 

                                 BOB
                        Teresa, stop.

           She tries to shove through, but he doesn’t budge.

                                 TERESA
                        Get out of my way! 

                                 BOB
                        Listen, I’m on your side. I was 
                        tapped to overthrow Branko and 
                        install Filip as the new leader. 

                                 TERESA
                        And who gave you the authority to 
                        decide that? 

                                 BOB
                        I’m sorry for lying to you, but 
                        I’ve been helping your movement. 
                        What difference do the details make 
                        at this point?

           His audacity enrages her. She SLAPS him across the face.

                                 TERESA
                        “What difference?” You USED me and 
                        my friends. You deceived us so you 
                        could play God. People died. Only 
                        someone who’s completely detached 
                        from humanity wouldn’t understand 
                        why that matters.
                             (beat)
                        You’re no different than Branko.  

           Bob’s psyche stings more than his skin. But even if she’s 
           right, he doesn’t have time for it. 

                                 BOB
                        He’s trying to kill you, and I’m 
                        trying to save you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        So we can sit here and debate 
                        geopolitical ethics all night, but 
                        it won’t change the facts: Filip is 
                        dead. The movement is in shambles. 
                        The Krypteia are hunting you down. 
                        And this safe house is the only 
                        place in Tarmania they won’t find 
                        you.
                             (beat)
                        I know this may be difficult and a 
                        lot to absorb, but you need to 
                        accept the situation and get some 
                        sleep. I’ll handle the rest. 

           She processes, centers. Although she trusts him even less 
           than before, she knows the smart play is to stick with Bob. 

           Bob heads for the door.

                                 TERESA
                        What kind of man can be so 
                        mechanical about all of this?

           He stops, turns back. Coming to terms with it--

                                 BOB
                        A sociopath. But I’m all you’ve 
                        got. 

           And he’s out the door.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAWN

           Bob sits in the desk chair, gun in his lap. He’s been 
           watching Teresa sleep. Was he up all night?

           She stirs and wakes to Bob’s gaze, uncomfortable. 

           Without a word, she slides out of bed, pulls on her shoes. 
           Bob sits up, curious.

                                 TERESA
                        Okay, double-oh-seven, what’s next?

           He stands abruptly. 

                                 BOB
                        My op’s been compromised. New 
                        orders are to exfil the fuck out of 
                        Tarmania, with or without you. Your 
                        call. 
                                 TERESA
                        I’m not running away.

                                 BOB
                        You’re not running. Call it a 
                        “strategic retreat.” You know, live 
                        to fight another day.

                                 TERESA
                        I can’t change anything by hiding.

                                 BOB
                        No, but when the time is right, 
                        things have cooled down, you return 
                        home. With the right plan, the 
                        right backing, you’d finally be 
                        able to free your country. Branko 
                        would never see you coming. 

           She thinks it through. Smirks at his pitch.

                                 TERESA
                        You’re a total con-artist.

                                 BOB
                        Am I wrong?

                                 TERESA
                        No.

                                 BOB
                        Good. 

           KITCHEN

           Bob tears open two MRE POUCHES and stands them up on the 
           counter. He pours bottled water inside, seals them shut, 
           shakes them up.

           Teresa emerges from the bedroom.

                                 BOB
                        Here.

           He slides an MRE and a plastic spoon to her. 

           She opens the pouch, skeptically eyes the steaming-hot soggy 
           yellow mixture inside.

           Bob shovels spoonfuls of his own MRE into his mouth. 

                                 TERESA
                        What is it?
                                 BOB
                             (reading the package)
                        U.S. Army calls this one “Denver 
                        Omelette.”

           She loses her appetite at the sight. He rolls his eyes. 

                                 BOB
                        Hey, I don’t care what you think it 
                        tastes like. You need the fuel. Got 
                        a long road ahead of us.  

           Bob can tell he was too harsh. He softens.

                                 BOB
                        Besides, when’s the last time a man 
                        cooked you breakfast?

                                 TERESA
                        If you were actually from Tarmania, 
                        you’d know that’s never happened.

           His grin is infectious, she can’t help but smirk.

                                 BOB
                        Happy to be your first. Now eat up. 
                        Sooner you finish, sooner we can 
                        get going. 

           She reluctantly digs in.

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

           -- BATHROOM -- Bob rinses DYE and CHEMICAL RELAXER from 
           Teresa’s hair, revealing it’s no longer brown and frizzy, but 
           now DIRTY BLONDE and STRAIGHT. He helps her insert CONTACTS, 
           making her brown eyes BLUE. BUZZES his head to a high-fade. 
           He now looks like the Bob WE KNOW FROM DINNER.

           -- LIVING AREA -- Bob SNAPS HEADSHOTS of their new looks.

           -- BEDROOM -- He uploads them to the laptop, connects a hi-
           tech device-- uses the PHOTOS to CREATE GERMAN PASSPORTS. 

           -- LIVING AREA -- He smashes the laptop with the butt of his 
           gun, tosses it into the fireplace with the rest of his 
           sensitive material. Douses it with fuel. Sets it ablaze.  

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           -- Posing as German tourists on holiday, Bob and Teresa 
           shuffle in line for a CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT. 
           -- She squeezes his hand nervously, he squeezes back. 
           Reassures her with just a look. 

           -- A CUSTOMS AGENT scans Bob’s passport, a GREEN LIGHT 
           indicates it’s CLEARED, and he’s let through. 

           -- Bob checks his WATCH-- their train departs in two minutes. 

           -- Teresa is next. The agent scans her passport. A RED LIGHT 
           indicates its authentication is INVALID. He is uneasy. 

           Bob gestures for him to try again. He does. A tense beat 
           while the scanner authenticates... RED LIGHT. The agent takes 
           a hard look at Teresa. Does he recognize her? 

           The agent BARKS into his radio.

           A SUPERVISOR comes over, pulls Teresa aside. He looks at her 
           face. The passport. Back to her face. 

           Bob’s hand moves close to the gun concealed in his waistband. 
           Wound tight, ready for anything.  

           The supervisor nods, a slight smirk crosses his lips. He 
           leans in close to Teresa.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                             (whisper)
                        Freedom now.

           He WAVES HER THROUGH. A look of relief and gratitude washes 
           over her. 

           Bob relaxes. That was close. 

           EXT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY

           Bob and Teresa board the TRAIN just before the doors close, 
           and it departs the station right on time. 

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN (MOVING)

           They move through PASSENGER CARS, into a FIRST CLASS CAR and 
           enter a-- 

           I/E. FIRST CLASS SLEEPER - TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           The train rips down the tracks. Even with the cabin door 
           closed, Teresa is still on edge. She stares out at the forest 
           whipping by, rubs her COIN NECKLACE. Bob notices.
                                 BOB
                        You can relax now.

                                 TERESA
                        I am relaxed.

           Bob shakes his head, he knows better.

                                 BOB
                        Every time you get nervous, you rub 
                        that necklace. What is it? 

                                 TERESA
                        It’s a coin from ancient Greece. 

                                 BOB
                        What’s it mean to you?

                                 TERESA
                        You wouldn’t understand.

                                 BOB
                        Try me.

           She holds it up for Bob to see.

                                 TERESA
                        It’s engraved with the word 
                        “Eleutheria.” It means liberty. 
                        This coin was minted when 
                        philosophers of this land birthed 
                        the very notion of democracy. 
                             (beat)
                        I wear it to remind me that if my 
                        homeland was once free, there is 
                        hope it can be again.
                             (then)
                        Because of you, I have a second 
                        chance at being a part of that. 

           Through all her anger and distrust, all she feels now for Bob 
           is gratitude. 

                                 TERESA
                        Thank you.

           But Bob can’t feel her deep appreciation. Tries to mask it. 

                                 BOB
                        Just another day at the office. 

           She moves in closer.
                                 TERESA
                        No, I mean it. Really. You saved my 
                        life. I’m eternally grateful. I 
                        want you to feel that...

           Teresa gazes deep into his eyes, searching for a vestige of 
           humanity. For once Bob is speechless. 

           She puts his right hand over her heart.

                                 TERESA
                        Can you feel it?

           To his surprise, he can. 

           Overwhelmed, he moves in for a kiss... 

           But he’s INTERRUPTED by the train JOSTLING.

           His expression drops. He moves to the cabin window, peers 
           out, concerned. 

                                 TERESA
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 BOB
                        We’re slowing down.

                                 TERESA
                        So? We have one more stop before 
                        the border.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, but we’re seven minutes ahead 
                        of schedule for that stop. If 
                        there’s one thing tyrants get 
                        right, it’s that the trains always 
                        run on time. 

           The train STOPS. Her fear and panic rush back. 

                                 TERESA
                        You said if we made it through 
                        customs we were home free.

                                 BOB
                        Apparently not. 

           Bob slides open the cabin door and peeks out. 

           Three cabins away-- FOUR SECRET POLICE sweep the hall, re-
           checking each passenger against PHOTOS of Bob and Teresa. 
                                 BOB
                        Krypteia. They’re coming for us. I 
                        need you to hide. It’s going to get 
                        crowded in here.

           She ducks into their private lavatory.

           The Secret Police KNOCK on the cabin door.

                                 SECRET POLICE (O.S.)
                             (through the door)
                        Krypteia. I-D check. Open up.

           Bob opens the door. 

                                 BOB
                        Sure, let me get my passport.

           Two of the Secret Police enter. Bob ambushes them with QUICK 
           BRUTAL strikes to the throat, eyes, nose, groin, knees...

           ...the other two push inside...

           ...Bob takes them all on at the same time. 

           One-by-one, they crumple unconscious at his feet. 

           Bob has to clear the bodies to let Teresa out. She exits to 
           see the aftermath.

                                 BOB
                        We’re getting off here.

           He SMASHES out the cabin WINDOW and throws a blanket over the 
           window sill to cover glass shards and...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           She lands next to the train tracks, which carve through a 
           dense FOREST. Bob follows.

           At the front of the train, TWO TEAMS of Secret Police spot 
           them and OPEN FIRE-- RATATAT!

           Bob draws from concealment, and in less than a second, FIRES 
           back, downing TWO. 

           He pushes Teresa behind a tree for cover. 

                                 BOB
                        We need to make a run for the 
                        border. Follow me. 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Bob and Teresa sprint through the WOODS, trees obscure what’s 
           coming up and what’s behind them. 

           Their hot breath pumps into the cold mountain air like steam.

           Bob hears the BARKING HOUNDS of an incoming patrol. He 
           motions to Teresa to stop. 

                                 BOB
                        There’s a patrol up ahead. We have 
                        to hide. Let them pass. 

           He shows her how to rub soil and crushed pine needles all 
           over her face, hands.

                                 BOB
                        It’ll cover our scent. Throw off 
                        the dogs.

                                 TERESA
                        The dogs?

           Bob buries her in mud and dead tree branches on the forest 
           floor. He conceals himself in the same way.

           BOB’S POV: Dirt and leaf obstructed, he can see the Krypteia 
           patrol enter the clearing. They carefully sweep the area, 
           following their rabid dogs. 

           TERESA’S POV: The patrol moves close to where Bob is hidden. 
           One dog hits a scent hard on the mound of forest debris. The 
           Secret Police PUMP HALF A MAG into the pile.

           Teresa’s jaw drops in horror. 

           But the Secret Police turn it over. It’s EMPTY.

           They continue their sweep, moving toward the train. 

           Teresa trembles with panic, strains to hold back her tears, 
           hyperventilating. 

           A HAND reaches from BEHIND, covers her mouth... 

           ...Teresa whips around to see...it’s Bob. Motions “shhh” with 
           his other hand. She nods. They whisper. 

                                 TERESA
                        I thought they killed you.
                                 BOB
                        That won’t happen. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen, we’re clear. They’ll sweep 
                        back to the train. Border is that 
                        way. Let’s go.

           Bob helps Teresa dig out of her hide. Now both covered in 
           soil, leaves, they get back on the run.

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           They’ve covered miles of rough terrain. Bob motions to Teresa 
           to stop. They take cover behind a felled, rotting tree. 

                                 BOB
                        Fifty meters up. That’s it. There’s 
                        no fence or border checkpoint. 

           She nods, trying to catch her breath. He’s barely winded.  
           She can’t hold it back any longer and PUKES. 

                                 TERESA
                        My lungs are burning.

                        Breathe deep. Slow your heart rate.
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna need you at a dead sprint 
                        until we’re on the other side of 
                        the border.

           She heeds his advice. Calms her breathing and takes his hand.

           A long beat.

                                 BOB
                        Alright, ready?

           Teresa looks to Bob like “I’ll never be ready,” but she nods 
           like a champ.

                                 BOB
                        Good. On my count.
                             (beat)
                        Move. 

           They both SPRINT... 

           ...weaving through the forest’s dense foliage.

           Bob sees the BORDER CLEARING just up ahead... 
           ...no resistance in sight. They push out of the woods and 
           straight into-- 

           TWO SECRET POLICE PATROLS that have been waiting, posted at 
           angles to remain out of sight. They train their weapons on 
           Bob and Teresa. 

           Bob locks eyes with their commander-- General Vukovic.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        You are surrounded! Get on the 
                        ground with your hands up! 

           Teresa looks to Bob in total fear, her eyes scream “what 
           should we do?”.

           Bob shakes his head in anger and disappointment. He raises 
           his hands to the sky and complies.  

                                 BOB
                        I’m sorry, Teresa.

           They have no choice but to surrender.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRISON - DAY

           Bob, bloodied and stripped to the waist, hangs from CORDS 
           tied around his WRISTS and ANKLES.  

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        We can do this all day, Bob. This 
                        brings me no pleasure. I will stop 
                        if you tell me everything. How you 
                        operate. Your process. Your 
                        contacts in “Freedom Now!”.

                                 BOB
                        I won’t give you a word.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Hit him again.

           A faceless guard pummels Bob’s sensitive areas with a RUBBER 
           TRUNCHEON. This has been going on for days.

                                 BOB
                        Same old Vukovic. The consummate 
                        soldier. Except you’re so focused 
                        on following orders you don’t stop 
                        to think if the man giving them is 
                        actually interested in the nation’s 
                        better good. 
                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I swore an oath to Tarmania and 
                        President Zahradnic is our leader.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, because I made him. Funny, 
                        you would’ve been my first choice. 
                        But I knew you didn't have the 
                        stomach for politics. Ironic, since 
                        you have the stomach for torture. 

           General Vukovic doesn't show it, but that got to him.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        Hit him again.

           The guard SLAMS his fists into Bob like a punching bag.

           Vukovic sees a RED LIGHT pop on above the TWO-WAY MIRROR.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        That’s enough for now.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - PRISON - SAME TIME

           ON THE OTHER SIDE-- Branko watches the mirror-- it’s the 
           silver-screen of a poshly decorated cinema. Vukovic enters.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        He is unresponsive to our 
                        interrogation methods. 

           Branko nods, whispers a command into his ear.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob hangs, spent. General Vukovic enters, approaches.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        President Zahradnic would like to 
                        offer you a deal. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Branko and Bob watch a servant at a table-side stove-cart 
           prepare dessert like a showman-- pours brandy into a pan, 
           with a match, ignites the flambéd bananas. 

           Two more servants present the sweets to Bob and Branko.
                                 BOB
                        Finally, something that won’t look 
                        better on the way out. 

           Bob chews slowly, savoring the flavor of the last course of 
           the last meal he’ll ever eat. He sighs with satisfaction.

                                 BOB
                        Mmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmmmmm! 

           Bob’s over-the-top theatrics have made Branko lose his 
           appetite-- drops his gold fork, pushes his plate away. 

                                 BRANKO
                             (abruptly)
                        So, why did you take Teresa with 
                        you? 

                                 BOB
                        I just reacted. She’s valuable to 
                        the movement. 

           Bob's answer doesn't check out.

                                 BRANKO
                        No. I know what that was. 

           Bob feigns ignorance, poorly. 

                                 BOB
                        What?

                                 BRANKO
                        I can tell by the look on your 
                        face. You fucked her. She got you 
                        pussy drunk, didn’t she?

                                 BOB
                        Please, I’m a professional. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Yes, that’s it. She is a fine piece 
                        of ass, I’ll give you that.  

           Bob smirks, feigning guilt. Branko smiles.

                                 BRANKO
                        That’s what I thought.

                                 BOB
                        It doesn’t matter. That’s not 
                        enough of a slip-up for you to 
                        track me down. There has to be 
                        more. 
           Branko shrugs coyly. 

                                 BRANKO
                        True.

           Bob leans in, hungry for the answer. 

                                 BOB
                        So what was it? 

           Branko revels in the fact that his creator is asking him how 
           he was outsmarted. He has a thought. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You know what? Since you have 
                        honored your end of the deal, I 
                        will reciprocate. Tell you how I 
                        beat the mighty Kingbreaker.
                             (to servants and guards)
                        Everybody out. Leave us, lock the 
                        door and do not enter unless I 
                        explicitly call for you... Now!

           They rush out of the room, locking the door behind. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Now that we have some privacy, let 
                        me regale you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - DAY

           SUP: 23 Days Ago. 

           Branko storms in holding the PHOTO of Bob.

           He sits behind his large antique desk in an oversized dark 
           leather chair, deep in thought-- stares at the photo. 

                                 BRANKO (V.O.)
                        I was racking my brain trying to 
                        figure out why you were back in 
                        Tarmania trying to overthrow a 
                        regime you installed. There had to 
                        be an outside influence.

           Branko has an idea. He flips through his APPOINTMENT BOOK and 
           stops when he finds what he’s looking for. He makes a call.

                                 BRANKO
                        Get me Henry Stonecutter. Now. 
           LATER

           Branko stands in front of a large monitor on a VIDEO CALL. On 
           the other end-- Henry Stonecutter from his PRIVATE JET.

                                 HENRY
                        Good to hear from you, President 
                        Zahradnic. How are things in your 
                        fine country of Tarmania?

                                 BRANKO
                        Spare me the platitudes. Are you or 
                        are you not behind the revolution? 

                                 HENRY
                        Revolution? I’m confused. I assumed 
                        you reached out in regards to my 
                        offer. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Maybe I did. The last time we met 
                        you intimated that I might be 
                        deposed. A brief time passes, and 
                        now there is a C-I-A operative in 
                        Tarmania fomenting a revolution. I 
                        do not believe in coincidences.

                                 HENRY
                        Neither do I. 
                             (beat)
                        Well done. You got me. I admit, I 
                        have many friends in high places.
                             (then)
                        If you reconsider my offer, they’ll 
                        leave you alone.    

           Branko seethes with fury.

                                 BRANKO
                        Then I agree to your terms.

                                 HENRY
                        Perfect.

                                 BRANKO
                        So, you will call off your dogs?

                                 HENRY
                        With the next call I make. In fact, 
                        I’ll even throw in the agent that’s 
                        been causing you all this trouble 
                        to sweeten the deal. 
                                 BRANKO
                        You would just hand him over?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m paying his handler enough he 
                        won’t mind. Bob’s past his prime, 
                        headful of secrets. He's 
                        expendable. Do whatever you want 
                        with him. Kill him. Hell, use him 
                        and then kill him. Nothing rallies 
                        people like a foreign threat.

           Branko shrugs, that’s not a bad idea. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE (NOW)

           Bob stares at the ANTIQUE GOLD CLOCK-- ticking down his last 
           moments. Fury blazes in his eyes.

                                 BOB
                        It seems irony’s trending... 
                        betrayed by my own handler. Spent 
                        half my life working with Sam and 
                        the crusty son of a bitch sold me 
                        out just like that. 
                             (beat)
                        Both of you just bent over and 
                        kissed this guy’s ring. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Ha! I have no intention of honoring 
                        the deal. Now that I have you, 
                        Stonecutter no longer has any 
                        players on the board. I’m just 
                        going to kill them both.

                                 BOB
                        Can you at least make it slow and 
                        painful? For me. 

                                 BRANKO
                        It would be my pleasure to grant 
                        you this final wish. 

                                 BOB
                        So, what do you get out of this 
                        besides revenge?

                                 BRANKO
                        Global respect. A massive mineral 
                        discovery puts Tarmania on the map.

                        They’ll have to give me a seat at 
                        the U.N. As a bonus, I plan to keep 
                        all of the money for myself.

                                 BOB
                        Why do tyrants always wrap their 
                        greed in nationalism? You don’t 
                        give a single fuck about the 
                        people. You have no regard for 
                        anyone but yourself. This is all 
                        about a simpleton trying to amass 
                        enough wealth and power to make 
                        people forget who he is. A nobody. 

           Now Branko is furious. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Look around you. Is this the home 
                        of a nobody?! No. This is the 
                        palace of a king. And my people are 
                        nothing but mindless animals that 
                        need to be controlled. They don't 
                        deserve wealth and wouldn't know 
                        what to do with it if they had it. 

                                 BOB
                        Says the guy who spends their 
                        fortune on racing cars, riding 
                        horses and a pet tiger. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m gone for like five minutes, and 
                        you go from freedom fighter to a 
                        walking cliche.

                                 BRANKO
                        I quickly learned military men are 
                        just loyal dogs that are to be used 
                        as expendable pawns so that true 
                        leaders can keep their rightful 
                        seat of power. And now your death 
                        will serve this purpose. 

           Bob deflates, defeated.

                                 BOB
                        Bravo, you have learned something. 
                        You even figured out the final step 
                        on your own. Step #6: Topple the 
                        leader and install his successor. 
                        Clean up. Persuade the new leader 
                        to eliminate his compatriots. They 
                        are now threats to his power.
                                 BRANKO
                        Well, it looks like I’ll be 
                        following the latter half of that 
                        step to the letter when I execute 
                        you tomorrow. Your failed coup will 
                        give me just the popularity boost I 
                        need to rally public support around 
                        me. 

                                 BOB
                        How’s that?

                                 BRANKO
                        I’ll reveal that a foreign 
                        government is meddling in my 
                        country's affairs in a rousing 
                        speech that will stir up the 
                        people's nationalism. I will then 
                        publicly execute you and that rebel 
                        cunt in the square to show my 
                        strength in standing up to foreign 
                        manipulation and domestic traitors. 
                             (beat)
                        Now that I think of it, I will even 
                        create a new agency: “The Ministry 
                        of National Safety and Security”.

                                 BOB
                        Catchy. 

                                 BRANKO
                        By killing you, I’m finally 
                        finishing what you started all 
                        those years ago. You got me into 
                        power and, in fact, did become a 
                        threat. Even according to your own 
                        rules, you must die. Tomorrow, 
                        Frankenstein will kill his creator. 
                        Poetic. Isn’t it?

                                 BOB
                        Hate to burst your bubble there, 
                        but you’ve got that backwards. Dr. 
                        Frankenstein was the creator... and 
                        the monster killed himself.

           Branko shakes his head in fury. Keys an intercom.

                                 BRANKO
                        We’re finished here. Take him away. 

           Guards enter and escort Bob out.
                                 BOB
                             (on his way out)
                        See you in the morning. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

           Bob, now wearing fine silk pajamas, slips himself between the 
           satin sheets of a king-sized bed. He lays his head on the 
           fluffy pillow. 

           He looks cool as a cucumber.  

           INT. CELL - PRISON - SAME TIME

           A shaft of light carves through the dingy, dark cell from an 
           open door. Teresa struggles as guards force her inside. 

           One RIPS OFF her COIN NECKLACE, then throws her to the ground 
           with a THUD. The door SLAMS shut.

           They’ve given her the royal treatment. She wears little more 
           than rags. Blood seeps from her nose and lips. 

           Too weak to move, she curls up on the cold concrete for the 
           night, rubbing the bare skin where the COIN used to rest. 

           INT. TARMANIAN HOME - SAME TIME

           A large Tarmanian family huddles around a TV, watching the 
           State News Report announcing Teresa’s forthcoming execution. 
           It’s the same family that watched Krypteia beat their 
           patriarch to death in the street.  

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. The eldest TEENAGE BOY opens it 
           to find a “Freedom Now!” supporter we recognize.   

                                 SUPPORTER
                        Freedom now.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Freedom now.

           They shake hands, and the teenager slips out with the 
           supporter. They head for the next house and... KNOCK. 

           The KNOCKS continue and--

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
           FADE IN:

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           Still packed with protestors. Riot police blockade all routes 
           into and out of the square. But today they’re backed up by 
           TRUCKLOADS of SOLDIERS, geared up and ready for a war. 

           A MASSIVE STAGE has been erected at one end so that Branko 
           can admire his own statue staring back at him. 

           Guarding the stage are 300 SECRET POLICE. They ominously scan 
           the crowd like vultures, de-humanized by their BALLISTIC FACE 
           MASKS. SNIPERS are perched on every high point.    

           ON STAGE-- A podium sprouting with a bouquet of microphones 
           is flanked by teleprompters. 

           Behind it, Tarmania’s LEADERSHIP is in attendance, dressed in 
           their best. Among them is General Vukovic. Behind them, a 
           full MILITARY BRASS BAND plays. 

           IN THE CROWD-- INTERNATIONAL PRESS CREWS stand by. Cameras 
           roll, producers prep their TALKING HEADS with makeup and 
           talking points-- eager to capture what will surely be their 
           Pulitzer winner. 

           Though the people intermingle, they remain ideologically 
           divided-- a third protest Branko, another third support 
           Branko and the last third don’t have a clue who they should 
           support.

           WHOOSH! 

           THREE AW101 VVIP luxury HELICOPTERS emblazoned with the 
           Tarmanian flag and Presidential Seal SOAR over the teeming 
           square so low that their rotor-wash blows hats off heads and 
           signs out of hands.

           The impressive aircraft suck everyone’s attention to the sky 
           like a giant vacuum.   

           People shield their eyes as the choppers bank hard in front 
           of the sun. Two of them hover high above while only the third 
           descends behind the stage. 

           Heads swivel to a Jerry Jones-sized JUMBOTRON-- 

           It broadcasts the live State News feed of the helicopter as 
           it hovers above the square and settles on the cobblestone-- 

           Branko’s version of Marine One landing on the South Lawn. 
           Krypteia open the helicopter’s hatch, lower its stairs to the 
           end of a long RED CARPET. They stand at attention on either 
           side like columns, awaiting their leader.

           An ANNOUNCER comes over the SPEAKERS--

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        His excellency, the President of 
                        Tarmania, Branko Zahradnic!

           Branko emerges, wearing formal MILITARY DRESS that’s a little 
           too tailored and stylish to really sell him as a warrior. His 
           suit-coat is adorned with a ceremonial sash and enough 
           service MEDALS to cover his chest. 

           The Krypteia stiffly salute Branko in unison. Branko returns 
           the salute, like he actually gives a shit.  

           He waves to the cameras as his massive security detail 
           escorts him down the red carpet and up the side of the stage. 

           The crowd BOOS and CHEERS while the band plays INTRO MUSIC as 
           Branko enters the stage-- handshaking the elite on his way up 
           to the podium.  

           The degree to which Branko’s lavish lifestyle is disconnected 
           from that of his people is so obvious, it’s cringe-worthy. 

           ON STAGE-- Branko takes the podium. He salutes the crowd like 
           all dictators do. 

                                 BRANKO
                        My fellow Tarmanians. The sun 
                        shines down upon our great nation  
                        today, because our future is 
                        bright. We are set for our debut on 
                        the global stage. Under my 
                        direction, our Department of State 
                        Mineral Resources has discovered 
                        one of the largest deposits of rare 
                        minerals in the world. This gift 
                        from our homeland will bring 
                        billions of dollars and tens of 
                        thousands of jobs to Tarmania. 

           Branko gestures as he speaks-- we notice remnants of Bob’s 
           training from all those years ago.

                                 BRANKO
                        Noble citizens of Tarmania, I vow 
                        that each and every one of you will 
                        share in this wealth. This 
                        prosperity will bring you untold 
                        opportunities. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRANKO (CONT'D)
                        The world will no longer be able to 
                        deny the significance of our small 
                        but mighty country. 

           Branko’s supporters CHEER. 

           He’s one hell of a liar.

           Bob and Teresa are trotted out in CHAINS underneath a GALLOWS 
           that’s been installed stage left. On the scaffold above, a 
           hooded EXECUTIONER readies ropes tied off with NOOSES.

                                 BRANKO
                        But unfortunately there are some 
                        that are trying to hinder our 
                        nation’s progress. The turmoil and 
                        chaos that you’ve endured has been 
                        caused by these traitors. They 
                        don’t want you to have the wealth 
                        and respect you deserve. 

           The Krypteia force Bob and Teresa up the gallows’ stairs. The 
           Executioner moves each of them over a trap-door. 

                                 BRANKO
                        Working with foreign intelligence 
                        agencies of the West, they have 
                        plotted to overthrow your rightful 
                        leader...

           ON BOB AND TERESA-- Without a word, the Executioner 
           methodically cinches a noose around each of their necks-- 
           positioning the knots at the base of the skull to ensure a 
           clean break.  

           Teresa weeps, but given the circumstances, she’s actually 
           holding it together pretty well. 

                                 BOB
                        Don’t be afraid, Teresa.

                                 TERESA
                        I’m not afraid to die anymore. But 
                        when you told me this would end 
                        with liberty or death, I was hoping 
                        it would be liberty.

                                 BOB
                        Me too. But as long as there’s 
                        still blood in your veins and air 
                        in your lungs, you’re still in the 
                        fight. You’re not dead till you’re 
                        dead. Got it? 
           She nods, the new perspective surges her full of might-- 
           what’s she got left to lose? She CRIES OUT--

                                 TERESA
                        Branko out! Freedom now! Branko 
                        out! Freedom now!

           IN THE CROWD-- A few REBELS begin chanting.

           BACK ON BRANKO-- He hears the chant, but scans for its 
           source. He tries to ignore it and continues.

                                 BRANKO
                        ...I will restore law and order so 
                        that together, we can make Tarmania 
                        great again!

           IN THE CROWD-- More Rebels start picking up Teresa’s chant. 

                                 REBELS
                             (all together)
                        Branko out! Freedom Now!

           ON STAGE-- Teresa continues to call out. 

                                 TERESA
                        Shake off the chains of bondage! 
                        You have the power to choose!

           The Executioner puts his hand on the lever. Waits for the 
           order to throw it, and hang Bob and Teresa.

                                 TERESA
                        I'd rather die standing for liberty 
                        than live one more breath as a 
                        slave! 

           Branko tries to stonewall.

                                 BRANKO
                        And every single person responsible 
                        for--

           But the CHANT only grows LOUDER.

                                 BRANKO
                        --every single person responsible 
                        for sending this country into chaos 
                        will be found, and executed...

           IN THE CROWD-- The UNARMED REBELS have amassed around the 
           stage, closing in. 

           They egg-on others to join them. 
           ON STAGE--

                                 TERESA
                        Absolute power corrupts absolutely! 
                        That's why no one should have it! 
                        But his power comes from each of 
                        you! And you can take it back! 

           IN THE CROWD-- Seeing Teresa show such strength in the face 
           of death inspires even Branko’s supporters. Many convert and 
           join in the CHANT.

           ON STAGE-- Branko fumes. He’s had enough.

                                 BRANKO
                        “Freedom Now!” is a false movement! 

           He loses control.

                                 BRANKO
                        There is no such thing as freedom! 
                        It is a lie, sold by the West so 
                        they can conquer nations and expand 
                        their empire!  

           The CHANT GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER until it is so ROARING 
           Branko can barely hear his own voice.

                                 BRANKO
                        The truth is-- all people need a 
                        ruler! They need structure! Freedom 
                        is chaos! I provide order...

           Bob calls out to Branko from the gallows. 

                                 BOB
                        I don’t think they’re buying it. 

           Branko steps back from the podium and turns to Bob. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You think I care? What are they 
                        going to do about it? They’re not 
                        armed. My men are.  

           IN THE CROWD-- The REBELS push forward, climbing over the 
           cement K-RAIL barriers where a phalanx line of RIOT POLICE 
           stand ready.

           The riot police hold their shields together. But the force of 
           human mass moving against them is too great. 

           It drives them apart. 
           ON STAGE-- Bob grins smugly at Branko. 

                                 BOB
                        There’s too many of ‘em. Armed or 
                        not, they’re comin’ through.

           Branko eyes the horde encroaching, turns to--

                                 BRANKO
                        General Vukovic, command your men 
                        to open fire on these instigators! 

           The General readies a handheld RADIO COM. He goes to speak 
           into it, but... he stops himself. 

                                 BRANKO
                        What are you waiting for?! Do it!

           Vukovic simmers on this for a beat. The past twenty years of 
           his command will be defined by what he does next.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                             (into radio)
                        Krypteia, stand down. Do not fire. 
                        These people are unarmed. 

           Almost in disbelief, his Secret Police look to their 
           commander to confirm the order. 

           General Vukovic waves them to lower their ASSAULT RIFLES. 
           They comply and let the rebels through. 

           The rebels STORM THE STAGE, climbing up the scaffolding...

           Branko marches to Vukovic.

                                 BRANKO
                        What are you doing?!

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I will not order MY men to fire on 
                        unarmed protestors. You’ve betrayed 
                        Tarmania far more than any of these 
                        people. You’ve stolen its wealth. 
                        You consider its soldiers and 
                        citizens as nothing but livestock 
                        on your farm. 

           IN THE CROWD-- Everybody watches this play out on the BIG 
           SCREEN. They can hear everything from the stage MICROPHONES 
           over the SPEAKERS. 

           ON STAGE-- Gobsmacked, Branko cuts to the Executioner. 
                                 BRANKO
                        You, hang the spies! 

           The Executioner pulls down on the lever... 

           ...Teresa and Bob share one last look... moments from 
           death... the trap-door rattles...

           ...But before the Executioner can pull the lever all the way, 
           he turns to see the rebel mob NOW STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HIM. 

           He looks to Branko, then back to the rebels-- about to tear 
           him apart if he makes the wrong move... 

           ...It's futile. Self-preservation kicks in, he RELEASES the 
           lever and backs away. 

           “Freedom Now!” rebels, many recognizable from before, grant 
           the Executioner a stay. They CUT Teresa and Bob FREE.

           Branko continues to spin out. 

                                 BRANKO
                        General, stop this madness at once!

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I am. When I helped you take power, 
                        I supported you because I believed 
                        that you had the nation's best 
                        interests at heart. Now I know that 
                        was a lie. 

                                 BRANKO
                        You’re a soldier. Where is your 
                        loyalty to your Supreme Leader?!

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I swore my life to this country, 
                        not to you.

                                 BRANKO
                        You are an insubordinate traitor! 
                        Someone shoot this piece of shit!

           Branko looks around frantic for someone to intervene. 

           Krypteia and Military don’t budge, just stare back at him, 
           seeing him in a whole new light. The emperor has no clothes.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        No, Branko, you’re the traitor.

           Vukovic rips off Branko’s MILITARY MEDALS from his chest.
                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        You’re not fit to wear these. And 
                        you’re not fit for this office. 

           Rebels move in, CAPTURE Branko. Bob approaches.

                                 BOB
                        Remember when I told you there were 
                        six steps to my process? I lied. 
                        There’s actually eight. 
                             (beat)
                        And Step #7 is: You've won their 
                        hearts and minds, but true 
                        political power comes from the 
                        barrel of a gun. Be sure the 
                        military is on your side.

           Branko is having a total “WTF?!” moment. 

                                 BOB
                        You did that for me by revealing 
                        your true character in front of 
                        General Vukovic. 

           This realization crystallizes in Branko’s mind. He’s dug his 
           own grave. 

                                 BOB
                             (gloating)
                        I orchestrated this whole thing. I 
                        got you to sit the spy down to 
                        dinner and concoct this elaborate 
                        plan to kill him, and then I turned 
                        it on you. I actually had a lot of 
                        fun with it. Now, I’m off to enjoy 
                        step eight. 

           As rebels drag Branko away, he yells back, still obsessed 
           with how Bob beat him.

                                 BRANKO
                        What’s step eight?! Bob?! BOB!

           Bob stares blankly as Branko is hauled off.

                                 BOB
                             (a la Road Runner)
                        Beep. Beep.

           ACROSS THE STAGE-- Teresa huddles with her revolutionaries. 
           Bob approaches.
                                 BOB
                        People are on edge. It’s going to 
                        get real ugly, real fast unless 
                        someone takes the mic to settle 
                        them down. Reassure them. I think 
                        it should be you.

           Teresa doesn’t know what to say.

                                 TERESA
                        I don't think I’m the right person 
                        for this. Everyone thought Filip 
                        was the best choice... 

                                 BOB
                        Filip was an asshole. He was going 
                        to kill you and the rest of the 
                        leadership as soon as he got in 
                        power. 

           Teresa’s shocked. 

                                 BOB
                        I was wrong. Wrong about Filip, 
                        wrong about you, wrong about what’s 
                        good for Tarmania. Now I know that 
                        the people need YOU to lead them.

           Teresa’s head is spinning. 

                                 TERESA
                        I’m not even sure I want to. All 
                        leaders eventually become 
                        corrupted. I could never live with 
                        myself if I went down that path.  

                                 BOB
                        And that’s exactly why you must 
                        lead. I’ve been all over the globe, 
                        and you are the only genuine, 
                        selfless and virtuous rebel that 
                        I’ve ever met. Everyone else was 
                        just greedy for wealth or power. 

           Bob puts her hands in his. 

                                 BOB
                        But you give me hope that the world 
                        can change for the better. You will 
                        bring freedom to Tarmania. But it’s 
                        up to you whether or not you 
                        fulfill that destiny.
           Teresa wipes away the tears Bob’s words brought out of her 
           and steels herself. 

           She takes the PODIUM--

                                 TERESA
                             (off the cuff)
                        Tarmania. Do not be afraid. 
                        Dictators like Branko want to 
                        convince us that we cannot be free. 
                        That we are too stupid or too weak 
                        to know what to do with freedom. 
                        That is the lie of all tyrants.

           Teresa COVERS HER HEART, just like Bob taught her. 

                                 TERESA 
                        The truth is, we all want to help 
                        one another. We want to love one 
                        another. We want to defend 
                        ourselves and each other.  

           Talking about the people, she OPENS HER ARMS WIDE.

                                 TERESA 
                        If we embrace this truth, people of 
                        every kind can live in harmony. 

           She drives home the point with an OPEN PALM.  

                                 TERESA 
                        Progressing toward more freedom, 
                        not more tyranny.

           She SWITCHES HANDS, changing the point. 

                                 TERESA 
                        Dictators like Branko stoke the 
                        flames of division. They know that 
                        as long as we fight each other, we 
                        can’t unite against them. We cannot 
                        allow them to poison our souls with 
                        fear and hate any longer. 

           She uses a FIST to nail down the aggressive point. 

                                 TERESA 
                        Instead, let us prove to the 
                        tyrants of the world that we are 
                        responsible enough to wield the 
                        great power of liberty. Let us be 
                        accountable to each other and to 
                        nature. And to use our freedom for 
                        the gain of others.
           Teresa is now swelling with emotion. The crowd CHANTS. 

                                 CROWD
                        Te-re-sa! Te-re-sa! Te-re-sa!

           She can’t stop her tears.

                                 TERESA
                        I don’t want to rule anyone. I ask 
                        you to demand that we will have an 
                        election. You deserve the right to 
                        choose your own leader.

           The crowd loves her and CHEERS. Citizens cry tears of joy at 
           her message. 

           ACROSS THE STAGE-- Bob leans in to General Vukovic.

                                 BOB
                        Listen to her. She’s a righteous 
                        lady. The people love her. But 
                        she’s going to need a running mate 
                        to win an election. 

           General Vukovic seriously considers this as he continues to 
           watch Teresa deliver her rousing speech.

           As Bob silently exits stage-right, he turns back, proud to 
           see Teresa rise to the occasion. He’s going to miss her. 

           As he slips away we CUT BACK TO WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE BEFORE:

           -- CATHEDRAL -- Sam hands Bob the FILE. Inside is a PHOTO OF 
           TERESA. She was really who the CIA had selected as the next 
           leader all along.

           -- MONACO GRAND PRIX -- After Stonecutter finishes meeting 
           with Branko, he peels off a MASK revealing HE’S ACTUALLY SAM. 

           -- PALACE DINING ROOM -- Bob explains his criteria for 
           choosing a leader to Branko:

                                 BOB
                        ...both possess the three “must 
                        haves” of any successful 
                        revolutionary leader: He must be 
                        revered by the populous. 

           -- PUB BACK ALLEY -- Teresa gives the leftovers to poor 
           children on the street.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        He must have been persecuted for 
                        his political beliefs. 
           -- PRISON -- Teresa is beaten and tortured, then dragged into 
           a CELL. 

           -- VICTORY SQUARE -- She's shackled to the STAGE for 
           execution.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        He must be perceived as an 
                        unwavering patriot.

           -- AT THE PODIUM -- Teresa delivers her speech to an 
           enthralled crowd in VICTORY SQUARE. She's a natural.

           -- “FREEDOM NOW!” HQ WAREHOUSE -- 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Step #6: Topple the leader and 
                        install his successor. Clean up. 
                        Persuade the new leader to 
                        eliminate his compatriots. They are 
                        now threats to his power.

           We see that Bob protected Teresa from being killed by making 
           sure she was out of harm’s way before the Secret Police raid.

           Filip and the rest of his men are killed, removing any 
           potential threats to Teresa's leadership.

           -- SAFE HOUSE -- Just before Bob puts Teresa’s phone in the 
           microwave. We see what he typed-- a TWEET to her “Freedom 
           Now!” account. 

           It READS: “I’m alive. The movement lives with me. Branko’s 
           men will capture me, but come free me from his chains and 
           together we will free Tarmania!”

           -- SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Step #7: You've won their hearts 
                        and minds, but true political power 
                        comes from the barrel of a gun. Be 
                        sure the military is on your side.

           General Vukovic sits behind a monitor watching the dinner 
           over the SURVEILLANCE FEED from a CAMERA hidden in the 
           ANTIQUE GOLD CLOCK. Bob stares back at him through the lens. 

           Vukovic is DISGUSTED as Branko RANTS.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

                                 TERESA
                        Brothers and sisters of Tarmania, 
                        in the name of virtue and liberty, 
                        let us all unite!

           Teresa finishes to THUNDEROUS applause. 

           She turns back to her elated supporters. She scans for a 
           particular face, moves to get a better view, but still can’t 
           find who she’s looking for.

           Bob is long gone. Like he was never there. 

           Teresa is surprised by the void Bob’s absence has left in her 
           heart. A major force in the movement just evaporated into 
           thin air. 

           General Vukovic approaches. He kneels before her, presenting 
           his decorative sword.

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        The seat of power is yours for the 
                        taking. I have trespassed against 
                        our nation. I submit to you. 
                        Imprison me, exile me or kill me. 
                        It is your choice to make.

           Teresa accepts the sword. Eyes the instrument of power that’s 
           just been handed over to her.

                                 TERESA
                        You’re right. I could do all of 
                        those things. But I won’t. I’m not 
                        a tyrant like Branko. And I won’t 
                        assume power unless the people 
                        elect me. They decide. Now rise. 

           General Vukovic stands. Teresa gives him back his sword.

                                 TERESA
                        I don’t want to punish you. I want 
                        to thank you, General Vukovic. In 
                        standing up to Branko, you helped 
                        free our nation. You’re a true 
                        patriot. 
                             (beat)
                        If you would like to run against 
                        me, I completely understand. 
                        Tarmania deserves the opportunity 
                        to choose who represents them. 
           Vukovic smiles. She is lovely. Just the sort of leader that 
           he’s always wanted to serve. 

                                 GENERAL VUKOVIC
                        I have no intention to run against 
                        you. In fact, I will not only 
                        support your campaign, but if you 
                        would have me, I would be proud to 
                        be your running-mate in your bid 
                        for our nation’s Presidency. 

           Teresa’s overwhelmed by the honor. Accepts with a stiff 
           handshake. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. VICTORY SQUARE - DAY

           Teresa and General Vukovic hold a campaign rally. 

           They watch BULLDOZERS bring down Branko’s massive statue. A 
           cathartic resolution to a dark chapter in Tarmania’s history.  

           Someone hands her a VELVET BOX. 

           Curious, she opens it to find-- her stolen COIN NECKLACE. 

           Along with a NOTE: “Remember, as a Head of State, above all, 
           it’s liberty or death...” 

           Teresa smiles. It doesn’t say who, but she knows it’s from 
           Bob. Ironically, she hopes she’ll never see him again, 
           because she knows what that would mean. 

           INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY

           SUP: Montenegro.

           Bob sits in the back row watching a baptism.

           He squints as the priest pours water over the baby’s head. 
           The parents radiate sheer joy. 

           The corners of Bob’s mouth turn up slightly. A smile. He’s 
           finally figured out what he’s been missing. 

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Nice to see you dressed respectably 
                        in church for once. 

           Sam slides into the pew next to Bob. Reaches into his 
           satchel... 
                                 SAM
                        Here you go. Before you crawl up my 
                        ass about it... 

           He pulls out a McDonald's bag and cup. Bob grins.

                                 BOB 
                        Step #8: Savor the sweet taste of 
                        victory.

           Sam rolls his eyes, quips-- 

                                 SAM
                        I had to go to Sarajevo for this.

           Bob digs into his meal.

                                 BOB
                             (with satisfaction)
                        Oh, it was worth it. 

                                 SAM
                        Well, it’s official. Teresa and 
                        Vukovic won in a landslide. Signed 
                        a constitution guaranteeing civil 
                        liberties and a representative 
                        legislature. And Branko finally got 
                        his seat at the U.N. Too bad for 
                        him it’s in a jail cell at The 
                        Hague awaiting trial for crimes 
                        against humanity.  
                             (beat)
                        I gotta hand it to you, Bob. You 
                        did it again. 

           Bob’s enjoying his meal so much he’s not even paying 
           attention to Sam’s admiration. 

           Sam smirks, some things don’t change. 

                                 SAM
                        I gotta know, why McDonald’s?

                                 BOB
                        Been around the world enough to eat 
                        some really shit food. But no 
                        matter where you go, you can count 
                        on the same level of shit from 
                        Micky D’s. I find that reassuring.

                                 SAM
                        Not much of a reward. 
                                 BOB
                             (mouth full)
                        Winning is my reward. Some people 
                        play the lottery, some play the 
                        stock market. I just played a 
                        nation. And won.

           Bob slurps his drink straw, washing it down with a smile.

                                 BOB
                        And nothing makes me hungrier than 
                        some good ole' fashioned regime-
                        change.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
