           ANIMAL'S POV - EXT. WOODS - DAY

           We slowly move through a wooded area. Early-blooming flowers 
           pepper the grassy ground. Fresh saplings pull themselves 
           toward the sun. Buds and baby branches jut out from seasoned 
           tree trunks.

           SUPER: Spring

           We dip our snout down, nibble on some freshly sprouted grass. 
           Then continuing on our --

           A BOOM! in the distance. We turn to the --

           THWACK! Everything starts to blur. We take a few wobbly steps 
           before dropping to the ground...

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

           The sound of rough cutting.

           SOMEWHERE

           A buck knife cuts between the ribs of a fur-covered belly. 
           Blood pours out behind the blade.

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           A knife cuts through a large steak. Red liquid seeps out from 
           its pink center.

           A fork brings it to a pair of feminine lips.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        How is it?

           A smile.

                                 REIN
                        Perfect.

           BEN (30s, long hair, beard) smiles back at REIN (30s, well 
           kept).

                                 REIN (CONT'D)
                        Same as always.
           They sit at a small table in the main room of a cabin, an 
           open kitchen connected to a living room. Candles and a 
           roaring fire light the room. No electronics whatsoever, as 
           well as no pictures or distinguishing decoration.

           Rein dabs her mouth with a napkin.

                                 REIN
                        So, what's the plan for tomorrow?

                                 BEN
                        Well.
                             (finishes chewing)
                        I figured I'd get started on the 
                        list.

                                 REIN
                        It's already time?

                                 BEN
                        I mean, it's a little early. But, 
                        don't want a repeat of February.

                                 REIN
                        I guess. It really wasn't that bad.

                                 BEN
                        You keep saying that, but no point 
                        in chancing it. Deer've been 
                        changing their routes lately. 
                        Anyway, I'm sure we'll be fine.

           He smiles. She returns it.

                                 BEN
                        What about you?

                                 REIN
                        I've got some stuff I'm finishing 
                        up.

                                 BEN
                        Are they Dr. Larson approved?

           Rein laughs.

                                 REIN
                        We'll see.
           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein lie asleep in bed. Their dog, COWBOY (a huge 
           Rottweiler) at the foot.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - NIGHT

           The cabin lies in a secluded clearing, tucked away in the 
           woods. An outhouse, a shed, a workshop, and a small barn all 
           inhabit the surrounding area.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           SHUCK. SHUCK. SHUCK. A well handle pumps up and down. Water 
           shoots into a pail.

           Ben carries two buckets toward the cabin, Cowboy running 
           ahead. Just the hint of sunlight in the sky.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAWN

           A pencil hovers along a detailed checklist of supplies.

           Ben sits in the kitchen, going over the list. A pot boils on 
           the stove.

           LATER

           He pours coffee through a strainer into two mugs. Rein 
           enters, still half asleep.

                                 REIN
                        Morning.

           A good morning kiss. He hands her a mug.

                                 BEN
                        Morning.

           They look out the window, the sunrise poking through the 
           trees.

           EXT. CABIN - DAWN

           Ben sits on the porch, drinking his coffee. Cowboy at his 
           side.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           Ben pulls open the doors of the modest barn.

           INT. BARN - DAWN

           Ben light-heartedly does chores. Feeds and waters the 
           animals, collects eggs, shovels manure, etc.

           The two pigs, BERT and ERNIE, happily snort about their pen.

           LATER

           Ben sits on a stool, milking their cow.

           His hands squeeze the raw milk from the squishy sack. It 
           sprays into a pale.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           CHOP! An axehead splits a log in two.

           Ben chops wood outside the barn, covered in sweat. Cowboy 
           lies nearby, panting.

           Ben takes a break, wipes the sweat off with a towel. Watches 
           a flock of birds shoot out of a nearby evergreen and 
           disappear over the treetops.

           He returns to work. Swings the axe over his head --

           ACROSS THE YARD

           Rein pulls weeds in a huge garden behind the cabin. The sound 
           of wood splitting in the distance.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben enters, takes a big drink of water.

           He splashes some on his face at the sink. Looks out a window 
           at Rein in the garden.

           INT. CABIN, OFFICE - DAY

           A key turns in a lock.
           The door of a wooden gun case opens, an array of rifles 
           housed inside.

           Ben pulls out a .30-06 Springfield.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Cartridges are pushed into the chamber.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein continues her work in the garden. Ben heads away from 
           the cabin in the background. She notices him, waves.

           ACROSS THE YARD

           Ben waves back as he continues on.

           Soon, he disappears into the woods...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben makes his way through the woods. Climbs over a fallen 
           tree, pushes through bushes, etc.

           LATER

           Ben stops, something catching his eye. He kneels down, looks 
           through his scope.

           [Note: All action seen through a scope will be in RED.]

           A doe walks amongst the trees, vegetation killing the 
           sightline.

           Ben takes his eye off the scope. Moves to follow.

           LATER

           He again stops, gets ready.

           The doe moves about in a clearing, unaware of Ben's well-
           hidden presence in the treeline across the field.

           Ben takes a deep breath.
           The doe slowly moves along the clearing. It takes a nibble at 
           some grass, nips a le-- It stops, slowly turns its head... 
           and looks straight at us. Not just in our direction, right at 
           us. Another moment, and it turns and runs straight away --

           BOOM! Ben takes a shot.

           The deer bounces away into the woods.

           Ben sighs.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein at dinner. Pork chops.

                                 REIN
                        Well, it doesn't sound that weird.

                                 BEN
                        I guess you had to be there. I 
                        swear, it looked right at me.

                                 REIN
                        Why is that so crazy? I feel like 
                        they're watching me, sometimes.

                                 BEN
                        I was like a quarter-mile away in 
                        the trees, there's no way it 
                        could've. Something else must have 
                        spooked it.

                                 REIN
                        It's still spring, we've got lots 
                        of time.

           Ben nods. Rein puts a hand on his arm.

                                 REIN
                        Hey.

           He looks up.

                                 REIN (CONT'D)
                        Don't worry. We've made it this 
                        long. We'll be okay, Ben.

           She smiles. He returns it.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           Ben pulls open the doors to the shed.

           REVEAL: A shiny, new-looking 2012 Dodge Ram sits inside.

           Ben pulls the truck out. There being no road here, he drives 
           it across the yard and into a small gap in the treeline.

           EXT. TRUCK - DAWN

           The truck rolls out of the woods and onto a gravel road.

           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Ben pulls onto a highway.

           LATER

           The truck flies down the road, electrical poles lining the 
           sides. The sun's already distanced itself from the horizon.

           Inside, Ben listens to the radio.

                                 MULTIPLE (O.S.)
                        ...some boos in the audience before 
                        Senator Rand Paul shouted out.
                             (and)
                        Hey, look. Look, he's already 
                        hedging his bet on the Clintons, 
                        okay? So if he doesn't run as a 
                        Republican, maybe he supports 
                        Clinton...

           Something catches Ben's eye.

           A snowy owl watches the truck go by from its perch on a 
           branch.

           Ben focuses back on the road.

                                 MULTIPLE (O.S.)
                        ...say that he's already hedging 
                        his bets because he's used to 
                        buying politicians.
                             (and)
                        Well, I've given him plenty of 
                        money.
                             (and)
                        Trump calmly exp--

           He turns it off, shakes his head.

           The truck flies down the road.

           EXT. TRUCK - DAY

           Ben pulls onto the main road of a tiny, rural town. Only a 
           few businesses and cars line the street.

           He parks outside a one-room store. MARTIN'S GROCERY.

           INT. MARTIN'S GROCERY - DAY

           DING! Ben enters the tiny establishment. JERRY (60s) sits 
           behind the counter, staring through bifocals at a smartphone.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, Jare.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh. Hey, Ben.

           He shakes his head as he puts the phone down.

                                 JERRY
                        How's it goin'?

           Ben starts to pick out items, only half listening.

                                 BEN
                        You know. Same as always.

                                 JERRY
                        How's Rein?

                                 BEN
                        She's good. Karen?

                                 JERRY
                        She's doin' alright. Garden's doin' 
                        real well, keepin' her busy. Missed 
                        the freeze, so. She had a bad flu 
                        last week -- Oh, I think it was 
                        Thursday she got it. But, hey. It's 
                        been goin' around.
                             (and)
                        Not for you, of course.
                                 BEN
                        Nope, not us.

                                 JERRY
                        Anyhow. You need some help gettin' 
                        everything packed up?

                                 BEN
                        If you don't mind.

                                 JERRY
                        Hey, no problem.
                             (motions to empty store)
                        Today's a slow day, anyhow.

           He laughs at his own joke, moves to help.

           EXT. JIM'S HARDWARE - DAY

           Ben carries some bags out of JIM'S HARDWARE STORE.

           He drops the tailgate, sets the tools next to other supplies.

           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The truck flies back down the highway.

           Inside, Ben drives in silence.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben exits the cabin. He closes the truck bed and gets in.

           He backs it into the shed.

           Ben closes the doors, hiding the truck away.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           CHOP. CHOP. CHOP. A chef's knife dices an onion. Then some 
           garlic. It cubes a potato. Then a hunk of frozen meat.

           The knife is stuck next to its brothers on a magnetic strip 
           above the counter. All of them have a wolf paw insignia on 
           their wooden handle.

           One by one, the vegetables are dropped into a well-oiled cast 
           iron skillet.
           Salt and freshly ground pepper soon added to the mix.

           Into another, the cubed meat is dropped. Steam instantly 
           expels from the pan.

           ECU: Fat drips from the rapidly sizzling meat. It bubbles 
           away as it seeps onto the pan.

           The browned meat is added to the vegetables, soon followed by 
           two freshly cracked eggs.

           It's pushed into a woodfire oven. Bright coals burning in 
           another compartment.

           The finished product is placed on a set table.

           LATER

           Ben and Rein relax in their post-meal fullness. They share a 
           smile.

                                 BEN (PRE-LAP)
                        Are you ready?

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        Open your eyes.

                                                                 OPEN TO:

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAY

           A beautiful wooden easel with a wolf paw insignia stands in 
           the middle of an incredibly messy art studio. Paint covers 
           everything. Cans and tubes of paint litter the tables and 
           shelves.

                                 REIN (O.S.)
                        I love it.

           Ben and Rein stand near the door. She kisses him.

                                 REIN
                        Maybe now I'll actually make 
                        something good.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, please.
                                 REIN
                        What?

                                 BEN
                        Your stuff's great. Don't be so 
                        hard on yourself.

                                 REIN
                        Well, it's not like I have anyone 
                        to judge it.

           Ben starts to protest -- but decides against it.

                                 BEN
                        I'm sorry.

                                 REIN
                        I didn't mean it like that, Ben. I 
                        just meant... you know. I just want 
                        my stuff to be good.

           She kisses him again. Forces him to smile with a silly face.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           CRICK. CRICK. SNAP. CREEEEEK. A tall tree falls onto the 
           forest floor.

           Ben leans on his axe at the tree's base, surrounded by a sea 
           of stumps.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           A hot pepper and some garlic are dropped into a mason jar, 
           soon followed by sliced lengths of cucumber.

           Rein pours hot vinegar into the jar. Canning in the kitchen.

           Lids float in a boiling pot on the stove. Rows and rows of 
           jars housing various vegetables line the counter next to 
           accompanying ingredients.

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           SCHLING. SCHLING. SCHLING. A smoothing plane slides back and 
           forth on a length of wood.

           Ben labors away in his workshop. A multitude of tools and 
           stacks of wood are housed in a very organized fashion.
           Past projects sit on shelves. A wooden vase. A flute. A deer 
           figurine. All of them with a wolf paw insignia.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein sits out back, painting the garden scene on her new 
           easel.

           She looks at her work, sighs. Something catches her eye 
           behind her painting.

           At the treeline, an obviously pregnant doe stares at her.

           Rein stares back.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein sit in the living room, reading. The fireplace 
           ablaze. Ben snacks on some jerky. 

           He offers Rein some. She shakes her head.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Trees stand in silence amidst now well-grown vegetation. Only 
           a few flowers.

           SUPER: Summer

           The sound of footsteps. Soon, Ben appears with his rifle. On 
           the hunt.

           He stops, looks up.

           The trees stand tall, stabbing up into the sky. Their tips 
           blow in the breeze, leaves rustling.

           LATER

           Still moving through the woods. Less brush here. Ben climbs 
           over a log.

           There's... something in the background. Hidden between the 
           trees. Ben doesn't notice. For only a moment, we can make out 
           what looks like a deer, standing tall on its hind legs.

           Watching him.
           He hears something, looks back.

           Nothing. Just the forest.

           A beat. He moves along.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Ben scales a hilly area covered in tall grass. The woods 
           break around the heightened plain.

           Reaching the top, he scans the treelines of the valleys 
           surrounding the --

           A buck plucks leaves and fruit off a buffalo berry tree on 
           the side of one of the hills.

           Ben kneels. Readies his shot.

           The buck pulls on a branch. Strips its leaves off.

           Ben's finger on the trigger.

           All of a sudden the buck becomes alert, looking around -- A 
           mountain lion shoots into frame, pouncing on the buck's back. 
           It tries to pull away to no avail, soon being brought to the 
           ground.

           Ben takes his eye off the scope. Watches from afar. Then, 
           gets up and leaves.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein sit at dinner in silence. It's meatloaf night, 
           and raining outside. Fresh baked bread and peas on the side.

           Ben watches as Rein pushes her uneaten food around her plate.

                                 BEN
                        Is something wrong?

           Nothing.

                                 BEN
                        Rein?

                                 BEN
                        Is something wrong?

                                 REIN
                        Huh? -- Oh. No... I'm just not 
                        feeling well.

                                 BEN
                        Okay.
                             (beat)
                        I saw a mountain lion today.

           Rein's eyes come alive.

                                 REIN
                        Really?

                                 BEN
                        Mhmm. Got a buck right before me.

                                 REIN
                        You always see the cool stuff.

                                 BEN
                        You know you can come.

                                 REIN
                        I know... you know I don't like it.

                                 BEN
                        I know. I was just saying.

                                 REIN
                        Yea.

                        So, how far away was it?

                                 BEN
                        Not that far.

                                 REIN
                        I didn't think they came down here.

           Ben shrugs.

                                 BEN
                        They go where they please. Same 
                        with all the others.
                                 REIN
                        I used to love watching those 
                        videos of bears and mountain lions 
                        in people's backyards. I always 
                        wished it'd happen to me.

                                 BEN
                        You probably would've needed a 
                        yard, first.

           Rein smirks. Remembers something.

                                 REIN
                        Oh! Remember when that tiger got 
                        out of Central Park?

           Ben takes a moment to recall.

                                 BEN
                        Oh my god, yea! That was crazy. 
                        They couldn't find it for like a 
                        week.

                                 REIN
                        Yea, and they evacuated that school 
                        because they somehow thought it got 
                        inside...

           Rein's joy fades to sorrow. Losing herself in the past.

                                 REIN (CONT'D)
                        And then they ended up shooting it. 
                        One of the nurses and I watched it 
                        on the news.

           She shakes her head. Wipes away a tear.

                                 REIN (CONT'D)
                        So stupid.

                        Yea... Let's not think about it, 
                        Rein. We're here now.

           She nods. Tries to force a smile.

           A long beat.

                                 BEN
                        Hey. So, I've been thinking... I 
                        think we should cut out town.
           Rein looks surprised. A little worried.

                                 REIN
                        Really?

                        well. I was thinking do the third 
                        trip this year and then cut it off.

                        pick up a bunch in the fall and 
                        just wait until you run out. Then 
                        get more. Make an exception.

                        hard. I mean, why not? It's why we 
                        came here.

                        Rein, come on. It's just a couple 
                        things. We probably should've done 
                        it last year.

           Rein shakes her head.

                        Look, I'll make the normal fall

                        one and see how it goes. If it 
                        doesn't work out we'll start going

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein lie asleep in bed. Cowboy at the foot.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The cabin sits silently in the dark. The sky completely 
           filled with stars. A deer pokes out of the woods, stares at 
           the house.
           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAWN

           Ben sits in the kitchen, again going over the list. Coffee 
           brews on the stove. Rein walks in and pours a cup. She looks 
           tired, pale.

                                 REIN
                        Yea, I'm okay.

           Ben thinks. Holds back his protests.

                                 BEN
                        Okay. I'll be downstairs.

           He moves to leave --

                                 REIN
                        Aren't you going to town?

                                 BEN
                        Well, I'm not gonna leave you like 
                        this, Rein.

                                 REIN
                        Ben, really. I'm --

                                 BEN
                        I'll be downstairs.

           He shuts the door on his way out.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben reads in the living room. A book about Montana birds. 
           Rein comes downstairs.

                                 BEN
                        What're you doing? You should be 
                        resting.

                                 REIN
                        I feel fine.

                                 BEN
                        You just puked on the floor.
                                 REIN
                        I know, Ben. But, I think I'm okay. 
                        I think it made me feel better.

           She puts on her shoes.

                                 BEN
                        I still think you should take the 
                        day off.

                                 REIN
                        I'm okay. Really.

           She smiles. Heads out the back door.

           Ben shakes his head. Puts his book down.

           INT. CABIN, BASEMENT - DAY

           A door opens. Ben flicks a LIGHT SWITCH as he heads down a 
           set of stairs.

           The basement is the complete opposite of the rest of the 
           cabin. Bulbs hang from the ceiling, shining onto a white, 
           straight-lined room housing a chest freezer, a sterile-
           looking metal work station, an industrial metal door, and a 
           huge cutting board with various tools and knives hanging 
           above it. All of them with Ben's insignia.

           It's basically a kill room.

           Ben opens the metal door. Moves into the --

           INT. CABIN, HANGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- hanging room. A skinned and dressed deer corpse hangs on 
           one side, a multitude of canned food stacked on shelves 
           opposite it.

           Ben starts to inspect everything, marking his list as he 
           goes.

           INT. CABIN, BASEMENT - DAY

           The door to the chest freezer opens. It's half-filled with 
           vacuum sealed packages of meat.

           Ben shuffles the packs around, marks off the list.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben opens the doors of the shed -- He stops, something off to 
           the side.

           A ten point buck stands at the treeline. It glances at him, 
           then hops away into the woods.

           INT. CABIN, OFFICE - DAY

           The door to the gun case opens.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben heads into the woods...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben makes his way through the trees, scanning for signs of 
           the buck.

           SHUFFLE SHUFFLE.

           He catches a glimpse as it runs up a nearby hill.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein picks green beans in the garden. When she moves down the 
           line, she notices some hoof marks in the dirt. Her eyes 
           follow the tracks through the garden...

           ...all the way to the edge of the clearing, where a doe 
           stands with two fawns at the treeline. Staring at her.

           A beat, just Rein and the doe. 

           She stands. Steps toward it...

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Ben walks along a flower-peppered hill. Sees the buck just as 
           it disappears down the other side.
           REIN'S POV - EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Slowly moving through the forest, the doe leading ahead. Her 
           two fawns happily hopping around.

           The mother quiets her kids as they stop on the edge of a 
           treeline near some hills.

           A herd of deer slowly comes into view at the bottom. The big 
           buck heads down the hill, joins them.

           Ben appears in the distance, rifle in tow. A GASP from Rein.

           The doe looks back at her before --

           Unleashing a HORRIFYING SQUEAL.

           The deer scatter --

           BOOM!

           ON THE HILL

           Ben's gun recoils with the sound. He watches as the herd 
           dissipates into the trees.

           IN THE WOODS

           The doe takes another look before leading her kids away, 
           leaving Rein in awe...

           ON THE HILL

           Ben sighs. Gets up.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben pushes through the treeline. Makes his way toward the 
           cabin.

           He stops. Across the yard, Rein appears out of the woods. She 
           heads into the garden to continue her work.

           A moment, and Ben continues.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben pulls the truck out of the shed. Drives into the woods.
           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The truck rolls onto the gravel road.

           LATER

           Ben pulls onto the highway.

           LATER

           The truck flies down the road. The trees now fully filled 
           with their summer leaves.

           Inside, Ben turns on the radio.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...met today, and we wonder -- will 
                        this be the next pres--

           He changes the channel. A folk song comes on.

           Ben whistles along as he continues down the roa--

           SCREECH. The brakes squeal as Ben whips the truck to the 
           side, just missing a deer as it bounces across the highway.

           He regains his composure. Looks out the window. The deer 
           stands at the treeline, staring at him. A moment, and it hops 
           away into the woods.

           Ben stares after it. Pulls the truck back onto the road.

           As he rolls away, he takes a look in the rearview.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein pulls weeds in the garden. But, she seems distraught. 
           Bothered.

           She shakes her head. Looks to the treeline.

           Rein pulls off her gloves and heads inside.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Ben parks outside Martin's Grocery.
           INT. MARTIN'S GROCERY - DAY

           Ben enters. Jerry sits behind the counter, again staring at 
           his cell phone. Perplexed.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, Jare.

           Ben heads for the shelves.

                                 JERRY
                        This goddamn thing...
                             (puts phone down)
                        Hey, Ben. How's it goin'?

                                 BEN
                        You know. I'll live.

                                 JERRY
                        Well, let's hope. Rein's doin' 
                        alright?

           Ben starts to pick out groceries, mostly ignoring Jerry yet 
           again.

                                 BEN
                        Yup. Karen?

                                 JERRY
                        Well, she went and got a broken hip 
                        -- Oh, I think it was the 15th? 
                        Fell down the patio stairs.

                                 BEN
                        She okay?

                                 JERRY
                        Yea, she's alright. Just gotta stay 
                        in bed for a while. It's me you 
                        gotta worry about.

                                 BEN
                        Why's that?

                                 JERRY
                        Well, she got it in her head that 
                        it's my fault she fell. Says I 
                        should've fixed the steps years 
                        ago.

                                 BEN
                        They broken?
                                 JERRY
                        Well... I wouldn't say broken. I 
                        mean, they seen better days. But, 
                        they're still solid. Ain't nothin' 
                        you'd trip over or anything like 
                        that.

           Nothing from Ben. He just grabs another pack of flour.

                                 JERRY
                        Anyway, I'm just ramblin'. Let's 
                        get your stuff.

           Jerry moves to help.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DUSK

           Ben rolls up to the house. The sun near the horizon.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Rein and Ben at dinner. Steak again.

           And again, Rein has barely touched her food. Ben watches with 
           concern.

                                 BEN
                        Rei--

                                 REIN
                        I don't want to eat meat anymore.

           Ben looks confused.

                                 BEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 REIN
                        I don't want to eat it anymore.

                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 REIN
                        I don't know... I just -- I just 
                        don't want it.

                                 BEN
                        But -- Rein, I mean... I love 
                        cooking for you.
                                 REIN
                        I know, Ben...

                                 BEN
                        How will you make it through the 
                        winter?

                                 REIN
                        The garden's doing really well. I 
                        think I could do it.

                                 BEN
                        Do you really think it's the best 
                        idea? It's a pretty big change.

                                 REIN
                        I think so.

           Ben nods. They "eat" for a time.

           He puts his fork down.

                                 BEN
                        You have to give me a reason. 
                        People don't just do that for no 
                        reason.

                                 REIN
                        I told you, I just don't want to 
                        eat it anymore.

                                 BEN
                        But, why? That's not a reason.

                                 REIN
                        It just grosses me out. I think 
                        that's why I got sick the other 
                        day.

                                 BEN
                        It grosses you out? You've been 
                        eating meat your whole life.

                                 REIN
                        People change!

           Ben reels back, a little shocked. A moment, and Rein leaves.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - NIGHT

           The cabin sits in dark silence. Ben on the porch.
           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben splashes water on his face at a washbasin. Looks at 
           himself in the mirror.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ben brushes his teeth, ready for bed. Rein enters.

           They share a look. It's obvious that everything's okay 
           between them.

           Ben lets the foamy toothpaste flow down his chin. Rein 
           laughs.

                                 BEN
                             (mouth full)
                        What?

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies awake in bed, Rein fast asleep. 

           He turns over, closes his eyes. Tries to get to sleep.

           It doesn't work.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - NIGHT

           Ben walks along the treeline surrounding the cabin, running 
           his hand along the tree trunks. The area completely silent.

           He stops, something catching his eye.

           Footsteps and deer tracks dried in the mud lead into the 
           woods...

           Ben peers into the dark forest, then back at the cabin.

           He follows the trail back toward the cabin, leading him to 
           and through the garden. The footsteps disappear as he reaches 
           the opposite edge, but the deer tracks continue all the way 
           to the back porch.

           Ben looks around his lonely property, confused.
           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           Ben works a carving tool on a rounded piece of wood, thinning 
           the end.

           He grabs a slightly different blade. Makes intricate cuts 
           along a protruding knob at the end.

           He stops. Troubled. Looks out a window.

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAY

           Rein paints in her studio. A picture of a beach sunset. She 
           dabs her brush in red, but it's all out.

           She searches through a packed corner of the floor, looking 
           for a paint tube. Suddenly SCREAMS --

           LATER

           Ben looks in the corner.

                                 REIN
                        They're right there.

           REVEAL: A nest of baby mice blindly crawling over each other.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        You really need to clean in here.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben exits the cabin with a small sack.

                                 BEN
                        What else am I supposed to do?

           Rein follows behind, stops in the doorway.

                                 REIN
                        Ben, please.

           He stops. Gives her a look, like: What? Then heads toward the 
           shed.

           Rein watches as he sets the sack on his chopping stump. Grabs 
           a piece of wood and raises it over his head --

           She flinches with the sound of it slamming down. Goes inside.
           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies asleep in bed.

           He turns over, opens his eyes. The other side of the bed 
           empty.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben heads downstairs to the main room.

           No Rein here. Just the smoldered fire lighting the empty 
           cabin.

           He goes to a window. A view of the barn across the yard, one 
           of its doors open. Rein exits and closes it up.

           Ben quickly moves over to and up the stairs, but stops at the 
           top. He watches the front door, hidden in darkness.

           Rein enters and heads into the kitchen. She grabs a bulb off 
           of a bunch of hanging garlic. Peels the husk off, eats it 
           raw.

           Ben watches with confusion.

           Rein grabs a nearby brush, sits on a chair near the door. 
           Proceeds to brush her hair while staring at it --

           A sound alerts her. She quickly looks around the room.

           Rein gets up and heads for the stairs. Ben silently creeps 
           away.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben lies "asleep" in bed. Rein crawls in, facing away from 
           him.

           A beat.

           Ben opens his eyes, stares at his wife.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           Ben opens the the barn doors, on his way to do his daily --
           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           -- he stops.

           Inside, the pigs separate like they were in the middle of a 
           private conversation.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        What're you guys doing out of your 
                        pen?

           Ben shuffles them in and closes the gate.

           He watches as they mumble about their pen, eventually moving 
           to their trough, snorting for their food.

           A moment, and Ben moves to feed them.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           The sun, high in the middle of the sky.

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           Ben carefully whittles down the end of a rounded piece of 
           wood about 18 inches long.

           He shoves it into a slot bored in a larger piece. The 
           beginning of what looks like a cage coming together.

           Ben takes a break, relaxes. Looks at the shelf housing his 
           early creations.

           He picks them up and inspects their workmanship, amused at 
           how bad some of them are. 

           He picks up the deer figurine. Stares more intently. His 
           stomach growls.

           INT. CABIN, HANGING ROOM - DAY

           Ben enters, grabs a jar of peaches. Moves to leave --

           He stops. Stares at the two small deer that now hang from the 
           ceiling.

           Ben runs his hand along the cleaned, aged flesh of one of 
           them. Lost in the look and feel of it.
           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Rein mixes together some cucumber salad in the kitchen.

           Finished, she heads toward the --

           She stops. Frozen in place.

           An engorged black widow stands on the floor near the door, 
           facing her.

           Rein looks around for a solution.

           MOMENTS LATER

           CLAMP. Rein slams an open paint can over the spider, slides 
           it onto a lid.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein carries the can away from the cabin.

           At the treeline, she carefully opens it with a stick. The 
           widow soon crawls out and creeps away.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Rein enters. Ben sits in the kitchen, waiting to eat.

                                 BEN
                        What were you doing?

                                 REIN
                        Nothing.

           She goes into another room. He stares after her.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Orange and yellow leaves blow in a breeze. Some are pulled 
           off, too weak to hold on.

           SUPER: Fall

           Boots crunch a leaf-covered forest floor.

           Ben heads through the woods in a jacket.
           He moves into a small clearing, the tall grass now growing 
           tan as its life fades away.

           SHUFFLE SHUFFLE. Ben turns to the side. Just catches the rear 
           of a huge moose as it disappears into the brush.

           He follows after it.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Ben heads up a grassy steep.

           He reaches the top. Gets a view of the increasingly dark sky 
           as it towers over a sea of multicolored trees, green pines 
           peppered throughout.

           LATER

           Ben reaches a rocky cliff that overlooks a small canyon with 
           a creek running through it. A small herd of deer rest and 
           drink on its bank.

           He settles down with his rifle.

           Sliding along the creek, looking for the best choice... what 
           was that? He pulls back to a deer, standing up tall on its 
           hind legs, watching the others.

           Ben's confused face.

           The deer, still just standing there. Occasionally it moves 
           its "arms" at the other deer.

           Ben looks away from the scope. Just watches as the standing 
           deer disappears into the woods.

           He regains his composure, returns to his scope. 

           BOOM! He fires a shot.

           LATER

           Down by the creek, Ben uses a buck knife to open a doe's 
           torso.

           He pulls out the intestines and stomach, being careful not to 
           cut them open. Then he moves to the heart and liver, sets 
           them aside.
           He wipes his bloody hands on a cloth.

           Ben holds the deer's legs together and hoists it onto his 
           shoulders. Heads into the forest.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Ben carries the deer along a dirt road, heavy treelines on 
           both sides.

           A house comes into view through the trees, a short distance 
           from the road. Ben glances at it.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           The deer's now cleaned heart is dropped onto a cutting board. 
           A chef's knife slides through it.

           The heart pieces are dropped into a hot pan. A few tosses, 
           and they're slid onto a plate next to a salad.

           Ben joins Rein at dinner. She's got her eyes on his plate.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 REIN
                        Nothing.

                                 BEN
                        What is it, Rein?

                                 REIN
                        Well... don't you think it's, like, 
                        I don't know. Bad. To do that?

                                 BEN
                        What? The heart?

           Rein nods.

                                 BEN
                        It's good meat, Rein. I'm not gonna 
                        waste it.

           Rein concedes, focuses on her salad. Ben does the same, but 
           takes some glances.
                                 BEN
                        You're making me worried, Rein.
                             (and)
                        I don't think it's good, not eating 
                        meat. It can't be healthy.

           She doesn't even look up.

                                 REIN
                        People have been vegetarians for 
                        thousands of years.

           Ben nods. Surrenders.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           CHOP. CHOP. CHOP. An axehead cuts a notch in a tree.

           Ben chops down another tree near the sea of stumps. It's 
           menial and grueling work.

           He stops, breathing heavy. Wipes his face. Looks up at a 
           tree, where an owl watches him from a branch.

           He returns to work. Chopping away.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           A crowbar forces its way between two slats of wood, snapping 
           them apart.

           Ben pulls a broken piece of siding off the shed. Nails a 
           replacement into place.

           LATER

           He pushes a manual lawn mower through the yard. The insane 
           amount of time this would take is evident by the size of 
           their property.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DUSK

           Ben finally finishes mowing the lawn. He's now drenched in 
           sweat.

           He puts the mower away and heads for the cabin.
           Just before he goes inside, he stops. Stares. Rein stands at 
           the treeline, facing the woods.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ben walks up next to her. She doesn't even notice, lost in 
           her own world.

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                        Something out there?

                                 REIN
                             (coming to)
                        Huh?

                                 BEN
                        Is something out there?

                                 REIN
                        Oh. No.

                                 BEN
                        So... what're you doing?

                                 REIN
                        I'm just looking.

           Ben stares at her, still just staring into the woods.

                                 BEN
                        Well, okay. I only got a couple 
                        things left. Then I'll be in.
                             (beat)
                        Okay?

                                 REIN
                        Okay.

           A beat. Ben leaves.

           INT. BARN - DUSK

           Ben does his nightly chores. Feeding and watering, etc.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DUSK

           Ben closes the doors on his way out of the barn. Notices 
           something above him.

           He sighs... god damn it.

           Ben brings a long pole out of the shed, heads over to the 
           barn.

           Up on a corner, a wasp nest clings to the side of the barn. 
           Little demons buzz around it.

           The pole pokes at the nest. It soon lands a hit.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Shit!

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben sits in the kitchen, his bearded face red and swollen. It 
           looks really bad. Also ridiculous. Rein applies aloe as 
           gingerly as she can.

                                 REIN
                        It's so weird. They usually don't 
                        affect you at all.

                                 BEN
                        Yea, I don't know.
                             (Rein leaves)
                        Actually I think I read that the 
                        venom can stay in your system for 
                        years. Maybe I'm allergic now.

           Rein comes back. Hands him a wet rag.

                                 REIN
                        Hold this to it.
                             (he does)
                        Is that really true?

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 REIN
                        The venom thing.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, yea. I think so.
           A beat. Rein thinks.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 REIN
                        I don't know. It's just 
                        interesting. Like, you're exposed 
                        to it so much that your body can't 
                        take it anymore.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies awake in bed, unable to get comfortable due to his 
           puffy face. Rein fast asleep.

           He sits up, lets out a frustrated sigh.

                                 REIN
                        You okay?

                                 BEN
                        Yea. It's just gonna suck going 
                        into town, tomorrow.

                                 REIN
                        You're not going anywhere like 
                        this. You can't even see.

                                 BEN
                        I'll be okay.

                                 REIN
                        I'll go. You can stay here and 
                        rest.

                                 BEN
                        Really, Rein, it's o--

                                 REIN
                        You're staying in bed. I'll do the 
                        chores.

                                 BEN
                             (beat)
                        Fine.

                                 REIN
                        Good.

           A beat.
           Ben tries to get comfortable again. It doesn't work.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Ben walks up the side of a hill covered in a thin layer of 
           snow. The moon's light illuminates the area.

           As he reaches the top, he stops and stares.

           An innumerable amount of deer cover the area in front of him. 
           Bucks, does, and fawns all slowly make their way across the 
           snow-covered field.

           Ben stares as one walks right in front of him.

           Ben’s face, full of wonder.

           BOOM! The sound of rifle shot. His expression changes to 
           confusion and horror.

           All the deer have been shot, their lifeless bodies litter the 
           entirety of the field.

           He walks across the hill, staring at the bloody bodies as he 
           passes.

           Ben now in the middle of the field, surrounded by nothing but 
           empty space and corpses.

           He looks to the side. About fifty feet away, a moose stands 
           amidst the bodies, staring at him. It starts to slowly head 
           toward him.

           Ben is suddenly holding a rifle. He looks at it with 
           confusion.

           The moose is getting closer. Ben lifts the rifle and --

           BOOM! Takes a shot.

           But the moose is unfazed, as if the gun shoots blanks.

           BOOM! Click. BOOM! Click. BOOM! Click. BOOM!

           Ben unloads the magazine. The moose just getting closer and 
           closer, calmly walking toward him. Ben getting more and more 
           frightened as it nears.

           Click. Click. Out of bullets.
           Ben drops the rifle, tries to run away. But, he can’t move. 
           Like his feet are nailed to the ground.

           He frantically tries to pull them with his hands. Looks with 
           horror as the moose stops a few feet away.

           Compete silence. Ben just stares at the moose.

           He turns his head as --

           -- A HIDEOUS, REVOLTING ROAR comes from a different, BLOODIED 
           and DISFIGURED MOOSE standing above him --

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - DAY

           Ben flinches in his sleep, covered in sweat. The room bright 
           with daylight.

           He jolts out of his nightmare. Looks around. Rein's already 
           gone.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Ben sits on the porch drinking some iced tea. He looks bored, 
           uneasy.

           Cowboy sits nearby, watching him.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben puts his glass in the sink. Heads for the --

                                 BEN
                        Shit!

           He stubs his toe. Hops around.

                                 BEN
                        Fuck...

           He sits down, inspects the damage. His toe's bleeding.

           He frowns, looks at the floor.

           A bent nail sticks out of one of the floorboards.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           A flock of birds watches from above as Ben opens the shed.

           Ben's confused face.

           REVEAL: The truck, still in the shed.

           He looks around.

                                 BEN
                        Rein?
                             (and)
                        Rein!?

           He leaves.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben enters.

                                 BEN
                        Rein?

           He starts to look in all the rooms.

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAY

           Ben appears in the doorway.

           No Rein here. Just the mess of her art supplies.

           He leaves. Comes back.

           Ben walks around Rein's easel. On it sits a painting of a 
           bunch of animals dressed to the nines, sitting around a table 
           at a dinner party. A mountain lion in a suit stands at the 
           head, raising a champagne glass. Making a toast.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben enters from the studio. The sound of brakes squeaking.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Ben exits as an unknown truck pulls up next to the cabin. 
           Rein hops out of the passenger and heads for the back. WILL 
           (40s) gets out of the driver's side and does the same.
                                 BEN
                        Will?

                                 WILL
                        Ben! How's it goin'?

           They start to move stuff out of the truck.

                                 BEN
                        Fine.

                                 WILL
                        Yea, you look it. Rein was tellin' 
                        me about that. Those little 
                        bastards'll getcha.

                                 BEN
                        Yea.
                             (to Rein)
                        What happened?

                                 REIN
                        The truck wouldn't start. I didn't 
                        want to wake you.

                                 BEN
                        I got stung, I'm not dying. Didn't 
                        have to bother Will, here.

                                 WILL
                        It's no big deal. I got nothin' 
                        today, anyway.

                                 BEN
                        I mean, it's not nothing. It's like 
                        an hour and a half each way.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, we may be a couple miles down 
                        the road, but we're still 
                        neighbors.

                                 BEN
                        Well, maybe. But, we still owe you.

                                 WILL
                        Nah, I won't have it. Hannah'd have 
                        my ass if she found out I took 
                        somethin' from you two.

                                 BEN
                        She doing okay?
                                 WILL
                        Yea, good as ever. Garden's doin' 
                        pretty well. Can you believe this 
                        weather? Best in a long time. 
                        Anyway, it's been keepin' her busy.
                             (and)
                        Actually... I think there is 
                        something' you can do for me.

                                 BEN
                        Anything.

                                 WILL
                        Well. You know Hannah's always 
                        wanted to have ya'll over for 
                        dinner.

           Nothing from Ben.

                                 WILL
                        It'd really mean a lot to her.

           Ben and Rein share a look. Neither pleased.

                                 BEN
                        I guess.

           Rein closes the tailgate, carries something inside.

                                 WILL
                        Great! You guys got plans for 
                        Saturday night?

                                 BEN
                        We don't have plans for any night.

                                 WILL
                        Alright then.
                             (beat)
                        Well, I guess I'll go let Hannah 
                        know. She's gonna be real excited.

           He gets in the truck. Ben thinks.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, Will?

           He goes to the window.

                                 WILL
                        Yea?
                                 BEN
                        I figured I should tell you.
                             (and)
                        Rein doesn't eat meat.

                                 WILL
                        What do ya mean?

                                 BEN
                        She's a vegetarian.

           Will thinks it over.

                                 WILL
                        Well, alright. I mean, I don't know 
                        what she's gonna eat, but I'm sure 
                        Hannah'll figure somethin' out.
                             (and)
                        I never understood those vejans or 
                        whatever they're called. If I'd've 
                        tried to pull that my old man 
                        woulda popped me a new one.

                                 BEN
                        Yea, mine too.
                             (beat)
                        Anyway. See you later.

                                 WILL
                        Yup, see ya.

           Ben watches as Will backs the truck out and into the woods.

           He looks to the cabin.

           INT. CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben enters, watches Rein unpack some stuff in the kitchen.

                                 BEN
                        Why didn't you wake me up?

                                 REIN
                        I told you. You needed some rest.

                                 BEN
                        Yea, well, now we've got to have 
                        dinner with them.
                                 REIN
                        You know I don't want to, either, 
                        but it's already happening. So 
                        we're just gonna have to deal with 
                        it.
                             (beat)
                        Did you tell him about...

                                 BEN
                        Yea.

                                 REIN
                        What'd he say?

                                 BEN
                        Nothing.

                                 REIN
                        Mhmm.

           Rein leaves. Ben stares after her.

           INT. SHED - DAY

           Ben clanks about behind the truck. Comes around with a 
           toolbox.

           The hood pops open. Ben lifts it, revealing an extremely 
           clean motor.

           He starts to inspect the machinery, but stops. Looks 
           confused.

           A cable is disconnected from a small component on the top of 
           the motor.

           Ben simply plugs it back in. Looks to the cabin.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben closes up the shed --

                                 REIN (O.S.)
                        Ben! BEN!

           Ben starts toward the cabin, confused. Slowly picks up his 
           pace. Rein's screams continue from behind the cabin.

           He rushes around the cabin to see Rein freaking out at the 
           edge of the garden.
                                 BEN
                        What is it!? Are you okay?

                                 REIN
                        Look!

           Most of the garden is filled with disease. The plants covered 
           in brown spots. The vegetables shriveled up and split. 
           Bleeding their contents.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Rein in the kitchen. Ben comes up from the basement, 
           discouraged.

                                 REIN
                        So?

                                 BEN
                        It's not good.

                                 REIN
                        What're we gonna do, Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Well... I think if I pick up the 
                        hunting we might be okay. But, 
                        you'd have to...

           Rein's confused. She gets it.

                                 REIN
                        No.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, if you ju--

                                 REIN
                        I'm not doing that, Ben!
                             (beat)
                        We'll just have to get more from 
                        Jerry.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, this is our chance! We're 
                        finally making some headway.

                                 REIN
                        I can't believe this. What the fuck 
                        even...
           A metaphorical light bulb switches on. Rein stares at him.

                                 REIN
                        You just couldn't let me, could 
                        you?

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 REIN
                        You're so selfish. Why is it such a 
                        big deal?

                                 BEN
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 REIN
                        You want me to eat meat so bad that 
                        you poison our own food, Ben? How 
                        could you?

           Ben's absolutely insulted.

                                 BEN
                        Are you fucking kidding me? You 
                        really think I'd do that?

           Rein shakes her head.

                                 REIN
                        I don't even know you.

           She leaves. Ben stands in shock.

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           Ben sets up two tall, rounded lengths of wood against a wall. 
           He pushes slightly thinner pieces into slats in their sides. 
           The beginnings of a headboard starting to appear.

           When he tries to put the last piece into place, it won't fit. 
           The hole's too small. Ben lets out an annoyed sigh.

           He chips the end by hitting a small blade with a hammer. But, 
           he's not being careful and hits his finger.

                                 BEN
                        Fuck!
           He throws the hammer against a wall. Runs a hand over his 
           face.

           EXT. WILL & HANNAH'S - NIGHT

           The house Ben passed on the road. It's a normal, modern home.

           INT. WILL & HANNAH'S, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A table filled with food. A roast, baked vegetables, mashed 
           potatoes, salad, and bread.

                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        ...tried to get you some of that 
                        tofu stuff, but Jerry didn't have 
                        any.

           Ben, Rein, Will, and HANNAH (40s) have just sat down to 
           dinner. The room looks like any other modern dining room, 
           albeit somewhat country. Rein and Ben look uncomfortable.

                                 REIN
                        It's okay, Hannah. This is fine.

           Will pours himself and Hannah some wine.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, potatoes and salad ain't no 
                        diet.

                                 REIN
                        It's fine, really.

                                 WILL
                        Can I get your glasses?

           Under the table, Ben tries to hold Rein's hand. She pulls 
           away.

                                 BEN
                        What? -- Oh... I should've told 
                        you. We don't drink.

                                 WILL
                        What? Why?

           Ben just shrugs.
                                 WILL
                        Well, you can not drink and still 
                        have a glass.
                             (off their look)
                        Come on, it's a party. We've never 
                        had you guys over.

           Ben and Rein share a look.

                                 BEN
                        I guess.

                                 WILL
                        Alright! Let's have some fun!

           Will starts to pour them a glass.

           LATER

           Everyone's more comfortable, almost finished with their food.

                                 WILL
                        ...shot off that thing like a 
                        rocket! Never seen nothin' like it 
                        in my life.

                                 BEN
                        Was he okay?

                                 WILL
                        Yea, he's alright. One of his arm's 
                        a little numb, but hey. He's lucky 
                        to be alive. Coulda been a lot 
                        worse.

                                 REIN
                        Wasn't it scary?

                                 WILL
                        On the poles? Nah. I mean, at first 
                        maybe a little. But, you got your 
                        strap on there. Long as you're 
                        careful everything goes fine.

                                 HANNAH
                        He was gettin' tired of it by the 
                        end.

                                 WILL
                        Yea, maybe. But, twenty years of 
                        anything'll do that to someone.
                        That's why we came up here.
                             (to explain)
                        My dad died a few years back. Had a 
                        bunch of money hidden away no one 
                        knew about. So, we figured why not 
                        come up here and relax a little.
                             (and)
                        Anyway. What about you two?

                                 REIN
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        What do you do?

                                 HANNAH
                        We've been wonderin' since ya'll 
                        got here. Never see you drive past 
                        during the day.

                                 BEN
                        We don't have jobs. Just try to do 
                        everything ourselves.

                                 REIN
                        I do the gardening and inside the 
                        house, and Ben does all the hunting 
                        and outside stuff. And cooking.

                                 WILL
                        Well, we gathered that much. We 
                        meant what're you guys about? Where 
                        ya from? How'd ya end up here? 
                        People don't just come up here for 
                        no reason.

           They look hesitant.

                                 WILL
                        You guys in some kinda trouble or 
                        somethin'? If ya are, we don't got 
                        no one to tell.

           Will and Hannah wait for their answer.

                                 BEN
                        Well, we lived in New York. Rein 
                        ran a daycare for the gifted, and I 
                        was a chief operations officer at 
                        JPMorgan.

           A beat.
                                 WILL
                        Okay... So, what're ya'll doin' out 
                        here?

           INT. WILL & HANNAH'S, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Rein helps Hannah wash pans and load the dishwasher.

                                 REIN
                        Ugh, I miss my dishwasher so much.

                                 HANNAH
                        Yea, it's sure handy. Can't you 
                        guys fit one?

                                 REIN
                        We don't have electricity in the 
                        main floor.

                                 HANNAH
                        Really?

                                 REIN
                        Yea, plumbing either. We got rid of 
                        it our second year.

                                 HANNAH
                        If you don't have plumbing, how do 
                        you...?

                                 REIN
                        Outhouse.

           Hannah looks horrified.

                                 WILL (PRE-LAP)
                        I just don't get why in hell you'd 
                        do that.

           INTERCUT - LIVING ROOM

           Ben and Will smoke a cigar by the fire.

                                 BEN
                        I mean, it's why we moved up here.

                                 WILL
                        To not have a shower?

           Ben shrugs.
                                 BEN
                        Kind of.

           KITCHEN

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, I don't get it. Why would you 
                        do that to yourselves?

                                 REIN
                        We were just tired of it.

                                 HANNAH
                        Of what?

           LIVING ROOM

                                 BEN
                        Just... everything. Everybody. 
                        Everybody just being the same. 
                        Saying all the same things. Doing 
                        all the same things. My job was 
                        just full of people lying.

           KITCHEN

                                 REIN
                        ...you know? I was so tired of the 
                        women at work just in each other's 
                        business. No respect for privacy. I 
                        mean, you don't know people's 
                        situation.

                             (beat)
                        I worked hard my whole life to get 
                        a good job. No one I knew ever had 
                        anything. The kind of people whose 
                        parents don't care if they get to 
                        seventh grade. The kind of people 
                        who name their kid Bentley when 
                        they'd never seen one. You know?

                                 WILL
                        So, ya'll just left it all behind?
           KITCHEN

                                 HANNAH
                        What about your family?

                                 REIN
                        Well, my parents have passed, but I 
                        miss the others sometimes. But, 
                        this is the choice we made. You 
                        know? To try to escape it. All of 
                        it. Make our own little society.

           LIVING ROOM

                                 BEN
                        So we just left. No pictures. No 
                        furniture. We left it all.

                                 WILL
                        Everything?

                        Everything.

                                 HANNAH
                        So, what's next?

                                 REIN
                        Well, I guess we're cutting out 
                        town.

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh. That's a big deal.

           Rein nods.

           LIVING ROOM

                                 WILL
                        Huh.
                             (beat)
                        Well, I don't really understand.

                        trouble we'll be here.

           The flames crackle in the fireplace.
                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Thanks.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           SHWING! A machete cuts through thick vegetation.

           Ben clears brush at the treeline, the thorn-covered plants 
           having encroached onto the lawn. Trying to take back their 
           land.

           He drops the blade. Throws a bunch of weeds into the woods.

           Ben takes his glove off. Pulls a sticker out of his thumb.

           A drop of blood pools from the tiny wound. He sucks on it. 
           Looks to the house.

           LATER

           Ben comes around the cabin and calls to Rein, working in the 
           garden.

                                 BEN
                        You hungry yet!?

           She doesn't even look at him. He moves inside.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben stares at the kitchen. He seems conflicted, like he's 
           thinking something over.

           INT. CABIN, HANGING ROOM - DAY

           Ben enters. Stares at a fresh hanging deer.

           He cuts a piece off its inner hindquarter.

           He grabs a jar of capers and anchovies off the shelf.

           INT. CABIN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

           The steak is dropped on a cutting board.

           Ben rubs his hand over his mouth. Begins to cut.
           The anchovies are finely diced and dropped into a bowl, 
           followed by the capers and mustard.

           Two eggs are cracked, the yolks separated.

           Ben mashes the ingredients together, whipping them into a 
           congruent sauce.

           He adds some olive oil, chopped parsley, and red onion. Then 
           some chili.

           Ben stares at the hunks of raw steak on the cutting board.

           He adds them to the bowl.

           Ben sits down with a garnished bowl of steak tartare. Some 
           bread on the side.

           A long beat. Ben just staring at the meal.

           He puts some of it on a piece of bread...

           ...and brings it to his mouth. Chews through it.

           Ben swallows. Runs his finger over his lips... and starts to 
           wolf it down. Taking big spoonfuls into his mouth, engulfing 
           the cubes of raw meat.

           LATER

           Happy and full, he sets his dishes in the sink. Starts to 
           clean up.

           He starts to wipe the cutting board, but stops. Remnants of 
           the steak still apparent. He slowly comes backs to reality. 
           Becomes distressed.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben joins Rein at dinner, only a salad on his plate.

                                 REIN
                        Just salad?

                                 BEN
                        Huh? Oh, yea.
                             (and)
                        I'm all meated out today.

           It's only for a moment, but a grin sneaks onto Rein's face.
                                 BEN
                        I know I asked before, but... why  
                        did you stop?

           Rein takes a while.

                                 REIN
                        I don't know, I guess. It just felt 
                        kind of wrong, you know? We came 
                        here, and kind of just... invaded. 
                        We just take anything we want. We 
                        don't ask anybody if it's okay.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, there's nobody here.

                                 REIN
                        ...I know.
                             (and)
                        You asked.

                                 BEN
                        I'm sorry.
                             (and)
                        So that's it then? That's 
                        everything?

                                 REIN
                        I mean, mostly.
                             (beat)
                        It also just... I don't know.

                                 BEN
                        It's okay. We don't need to talk 
                        about it anymore.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben stares at the ceiling in bed, Rein asleep. Cowboy at 
           their feet.

           He turns and looks at her. Smiles.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Rein in the garden, searching for raspberries. A beekeeper 
           mask over her head. There's an insane amount of bees buzzing 
           around the berry patch, one of the few crops not completely 
           destroyed.
           She notices something to the side.

           Near the edge of the garden, a bunny nibbles on some grass. 
           Hopping along.

           Rein takes off the mask and watches happily.

           Her joy disappears as she notices Ben coming onto the back 
           porch with a rifle.

           They lock eyes as Ben kneels down. Rein makes a "no" motion 
           with her hands, her eyes worried. But, it's too late. Ben's 
           already looking down the --

           BOOM!

           Rein watches in horror as the rabbit twitches and hops, 
           spontaneous movements taking over as its life ends.

           Soon, it lies on the ground, a leg still twitching.

           Rein watches as Ben walks over and picks it up. Brings it 
           into the house.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben trudges through two-foot deep snow amidst now bare trees.

           SUPER: Winter

           He takes off his gloves, revealing beet red hands.

           He brings them to his mouth, tries to heat them up.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DUSK

           A too-skinny Rein reads by the fire. Ben enters from the 
           cold, sheds his layers.

           He joins her by the fire, heats his hands and face. The frost 
           melts off his beard, dripping onto the floor.

                                 BEN
                        It's getting colder.

           Rein doesn't even hear him, just keeps reading. Ben 
           acknowledges her rejection.
           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies alone in bed. No Rein or Cowboy. He turns over and 
           opens his eyes.

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAY

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Ben opens the door to the studio, Rein 
           paints in a jacket inside.

                                 BEN
                        Rein?

           She mildly acknowledges his presence, but keeps painting. He 
           tries to look at the canvas.

                                 BEN
                        What you working o--

                                 REIN
                        It's nothing.

           He stops.

                                 BEN
                        I just wanted to see.

                                 REIN
                        It's not finished yet.

           Ben nods. She just keeps painting. He leaves.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben shocks awake.

           He looks around the room. Again, no Rein or Cowboy.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben looks down from the top of the stairs. Rein and Cowboy 
           are curled up on the floor in front of the fire.

           A beat. He goes back upstairs.
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben pushes through the snow-filled forest, looking for non-
           existent game in the white wilderness.

           LATER

           Still moving through the snow, getting tired.

           Ben stops. Turns around to go back --

           He freezes. Movement to the side.

           Out from behind the snow covered branches, a wolf appears. 
           It's beautiful. Ben watches as the majestic creature makes 
           its way through the forest.

           The wolf continues along, dancing on top of the --

           BOOM!

           It falls the ground. Blood seeps from its head.

           Ben swings his rifle on and heads over.

           He stares down at the wolf's corpse. Kneels down and starts 
           to dress it. Steam drifts up as he cuts the belly open and 
           pulls organs out.

           He stops. Stares into the wolf's bloody cavity.

           Ben cuts the heart out and holds it in his hands. He brings 
           it to his lips and takes a bite. Blood drips down his face as 
           he chews on the raw flesh.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Rein at dinner. A meager portion of boiled carrots 
           and fried potatoes on Rein's plate. A big steak on Ben's.

                                 BEN
                        Are you sure you don't want more?

           Nothing.

                                 BEN
                        Rein. Are you sure you don't want 
                        more?

           She shakes her head no. He sighs.
                                 BEN
                        What's going on, Rein? You won't 
                        even talk to me anymore.

                                 REIN
                        I'm just tired.

                                 BEN
                        You're just tired? Tired. That's 
                        what you are?

                                 REIN
                        Yea.

                                 BEN
                        And why are you tired, Rein? Huh? 
                        Maybe its cuz you're not eating 
                        anything. You're not doing 
                        anything.

                                 REIN
                        I'm fine.

                                 BEN
                        You're fine? Really? How the fuck 
                        are you fine? I mean, what're you 
                        even doing anymore? Look at 
                        yourself! You just sit inside all 
                        day getting skinnier and skinnier. 
                        You look like a corpse!

           Rein just stares at the table. Ben looks from her to his 
           plate and back.

           A fork stabs a piece of steak. Red liquid seeps out onto the 
           plate.

           Ben walks over, puts it in her face.

                                 BEN
                        Eat it.
                             (beat)
                        Eat it.

                                 REIN
                        No.

                                 BEN
                        Eat it!

           Ben tries to shove the steak into her mouth, but she turns 
           her head.
           He grabs her face and tries again, but she pushes his arm and 
           jolts away.

           Ben catches her and brings her to the floor, holds her with 
           his arm as he pushes the meat into her closed lips. She 
           screams through them and flails at him.

           He moves his elbow to her throat. Her mouth instinctively 
           opens, allowing him to shove the flesh inside.

           Ben takes his arm off and covers Rein's mouth as she squeals 
           and tries to pull away. Kicking and swatting at his face.

           He watches until she swallows, then lets go. She instantly 
           rushes away.

           Ben watches as Rein kneels by the fire and vomits...

           ANIMAL'S POV - OUTSIDE

           Peeking through the treeline. A view of the window-lit cabin.

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           Ben looks through a window at pure darkness. Rein dry heaves 
           in the background. He focuses back on her.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           A sunrise peeks through snowy trees.

           The cabin feels the new day's sun on its cold skin.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAWN

           Ben heads downstairs. No Rein.

           LATER

           Ben boils some snow for coffee.

           INT. BARN - DAWN

           Ben does his chores. The pigs and chickens watch with 
           suspicion.
           He tries to milk the cow, but nothing comes out.

           INT. CABIN, BASEMENT - DAY

           The door to the hanging room is open.

           INT. CABIN, HANGING ROOM - DAY

           Ben checks over the supplies, the list in hand. A fresh deer 
           carcass hangs from the ceiling.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben comes up from the basement. Rein sits in the kitchen, 
           reading. But, she's not wearing her glasses.

                                 BEN
                        Hey.

           Nothing.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, I'm sorry. I don't know what 
                        to say... I feel like an animal.

                                 REIN
                             (still reading)
                        It's okay.

                                 BEN
                        No, it isn't. It's not okay.
                             (beat)
                        I'll never do anything like that 
                        again. I promise.

           Rein nods, like: I'm sure. She turns a page.

           A moment, and Ben leaves.

           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Ben stomps up the side of a hill, the snow even higher than 
           before.

           He reaches the top, looks out over the sea of white.

           Moving across the hill, he suddenly stops.
           About fifty feet away, a moose stands in the snow, staring at 
           him. It's just like the dream, minus all the dead deer of 
           course.

           A long beat. Just stares.

           Ben backs away. Leaves the way he came.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           A steak burns in a skillet.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Shit!

           Ben grabs it and drops it in the sink, burning his hand. He 
           waves it around in pain.

           He calms down, inspects the damage.

           His hand, already blistering.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies in bed, alone. A noise from downstairs.

           He looks out the window as a jacketless Rein heads toward and 
           enters the barn.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Rein enters. Takes of her boots. Heads for the fi--

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Where were you?

           Ben sits in the dark kitchen.

                                 REIN
                        I was just checking the animals.

           She sits by the fire.

                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 REIN
                        They were whining so I went out to 
                        see.
                                 BEN
                        And?

                                 REIN
                        Bert and Ernie were out of their 
                        pen, so I got them back in.

           Ben doesn't know what to think. He watches his wife as she 
           warms her hands.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAWN

           Ben heads downstairs. No Rein, again.

           INT. BARN - DAWN

           Ben feeds the pigs, watches them as they mumble about their 
           pen.

           INT. CABIN, BASEMENT - DAY

           Ben flips the light on as he heads down the stairs. When he 
           gets to the bottom, he stops.

           The door to the hanging room is open.

                                 BEN
                        No, no, no.

           He heads inside --

           INT. HANGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- to see maggots crawling on the deer.

                                 BEN
                        No. No!

           He shakingly tries to wipe the worms off, but more and more 
           keep appearing.

                                 BEN
                        FUCK!

           He rips open the corpse. Maggots spill out like water onto 
           the floor.

           Ben backs away, horrified.
           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben sits in the kitchen, his head in his hands. Rein comes 
           down the stairs.

                                 BEN
                             (through his hands)
                        Did you go downstairs, yesterday?

                                 REIN
                        No.

           A beat.

                                 REIN
                        What is it?

                                 BEN
                        I must've forgot to close the door.

                                 REIN
                        Oh.

                                 BEN
                        I can't believe this winter.
                             (and)
                        I think I'm gonna have to slaughter 
                        one of the pigs.

           A blank stare from Rein.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, we can't both live on pickles 
                        and carrots. The meat's almost out.
                             (and)
                        Do you remember? Is Bert older than 
                        Ernie?

           She leaves. Ben stares after her. Returns to his hands.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Bert and Ernie snort around their pen in ignorance. Ben 
           stands nearby, watching with hesitance.

           A leash is put around Ernie's neck. He snorts with happy 
           interest.

           Ben leads him out of the pen, blocks Bert when he tries to 
           follow for the family walk.
           Bert waddles over to a crack in the wall as Ben leads Ernie 
           outside.

           THROUGH THE CRACK

           Bert watches Ben lead his friend over to the shed, tying him 
           to a post. Ernie happily snorts as Ben disappears...

           ...then returns with a pistol behind his back. Bert goes 
           silent. Ben kneels, rubs Ernie's belly and ears. He stands 
           up, puts the gun to his head, and pulls the -- 

           BOOM!

           Bert lets out horrified squeals as Ernie drops to the ground, 
           blood reddening the snow around him. Bert tries to ram 
           through the crack, desperate to come to his friend's aid.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben stares at Rein, staring into the fire.

                                 BEN
                        I had to, Rein.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           A knife cuts through a pork chop.

           Ben sits at dinner, alone.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies in bed, alone. Unable to sleep.

           INT. BARN - DAWN

           Light floods in as Ben opens the doors to the barn.

           He enters. Stops. Stares.

           The pig pen is empty.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAWN

           Ben follows Bert's tracks in the snow.
           Soon, he heads into the woods.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben continues amongst the snow-covered trees.

           He looks confused as the hoofprints slowly start to lengthen 
           in distance from each other. After a while, they change from 
           four prints to only two.

           Ben follows them to the base of a tree. Looks up at the empty 
           trunk, then around it. But, there's nothing there.

           He scans the nearby area. Just trees and empty space, totally 
           devoid of life.

           It starts to make him anxious. He heads back.

           LATER

           Ben almost home. The cabin visible through the trees. He 
           stops.

           A short distance away, two foxes move over and under the snow 
           as they play. Their orange fur pops in the midst of the cold 
           and desolate forest.

           Ben watches as they tumble away, out of view.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben sits in the kitchen, staring out a window.

           He moves some hair out of his eyes. Pulls it down, sees how 
           long its gotten.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - DAY

           Ben sits at Rein's vanity. He picks up a scissors and cuts 
           his hair in the mirror.

           It falls to the floor in bunches.

           Ben stares at his reflection. Without his mangled locks, he 
           looks like a completely different person. He moves to leave, 
           but stops.

           In the reflection, he moves a hand over his beard.
           LATER

           A straight razor runs over Ben's now hairless neck.

           He wipes his face with a towel. Looks at his clean cut hair 
           and face.

           A new man.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben sits by the fire. Rein enters from her studio, paint on 
           her clothes.

                                 BEN
                        What do you think?

           Rein stops, stares.

                                 REIN
                        Why did you do that?

                                 BEN
                        I just figured it was time. Don't 
                        you like it?

                                 REIN
                             (beat)
                        No, I don't.

           She moves to leave, but Ben finally can't take it --

                                 BEN
                        What the FUCK is your problem?

           Rein jumps. Legitimately scared. She regains composure.

                                 REIN
                        What the fuck is my problem? You 
                        really think this is my fault? 
                        After everything you've done?

                                 BEN
                        What have I done, Rein? What have I 
                        done? Besides that one night -- 
                        What have I really done?

                        Yea. What did I do? Oh my god, I 
                        killed a few of your precious 
                        little animals. Boo hoo. What did 
                        you think would happen moving out 
                        here?

                                 REIN
                        Don't act like you just "killed a 
                        few animals," Ben. After what you 
                        did to Ernie?

                                 BEN
                        What? I did it in the best way 
                        possible.

                                 REIN
                        The best way possible? Shooting him 
                        in the fucking head! That's the 
                        best way possible? How do you think 
                        Bert feels?

                                 BEN
                        He's a pig!

                        You're not who you say you are.

           Rein breathes like a bull about to charge.

                                 REIN (CONT'D)
                        I know what you are.

           Ben's confused.

                                 BEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 REIN
                        I know what the fuck you've been 
                        doing, Ben!
                             (condescending)
                        What happened out in the snow the 
                        other day? There was a really big 
                        stain.

           Ben thinks. Figures it out, a little scared.

                                 BEN
                        I don't -- How did you...?
                                 REIN
                        It doesn't matter! All that matters 
                        is that I know. I know what kind 
                        of... "person" you are. You really 
                        think I'd want to be with a monster 
                        like you!?

                                 BEN
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 REIN
                        You know exactly what it means.

           Ben can tell this is real. Tries to reason.

                                 BEN
                        You can't actually mean that...

                        feel bad. That has nothing to do 
                        with this.

                                 BEN
                        You're just going to forget 
                        everything because I made some

                        not the same people, anymore. It's 
                        not working.

           She heads into the studio.

                                 BEN
                        Rein...

           And closes the door.

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAY

           Ben enters, dejected. Rein already at her easel.
                                 BEN
                        Don't leave me like that...

                        We need to talk about this, Rein.

                                 REIN
                        I don't want to talk, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        What's going on? What's happened? I 
                        know I've done some bad things,

                        I'm done helping you.

           Rein stands up, moves to leave.

                                 BEN
                        Rein, please...

           He blocks, but doesn't touch her.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        I need to know that I'm not gonna 
                        wake up and find you gone.

                        Please. Can you just promise you'll 
                        tell me if you're gonna go?

           Rein stares at him.

                                 REIN
                        Fine.

           She pushes past him. He stares at the floor.

           He looks at the canvas, moves around to the front. The first 
           few strokes of a landscape painted on.

           Ben starts to leave, but stops as he sees a stack of unpinned 
           canvas on a workbench.

           He flips through them. Landscape. Landscape. Another 
           landscape. Just all landscapes. Some of them even the same 
           picture.

           Ben shakes his head...
           ...but stops. Moves all the landscapes to the side, revealing 
           paintings of animals dressed like humans doing everyday 
           activities. A beaver in a suit waving to a lion police 
           officer. An alligator sitting in a little boat in the middle 
           of a lake, fishing. An old-timey version of a group of birds 
           standing at a 1920s bar, drinking beers.

           He starts to flip through them faster, finally stops on one 
           of a doe sitting at an easel behind the cabin, painting a 
           picture of their garden in springtime. A buck chops wood in 
           the background near the shed.

                                                                 FADE TO:

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           A still skinny Rein sits at her easel behind the cabin, 
           painting a picture of their garden in springtime. Ben chops 
           wood in the background by the shed.

           SUPER: Spring

           ACROSS THE YARD

           Ben chops a log.

           He wipes his sweaty face. Looks across the yard at Rein.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben comes down the stairs, a bunch of rounded wood pieces 
           lean against the wall at the bottom. He grabs some and heads 
           back up.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - DUSK

           A beautiful wooden bed frame now inhabits the bedroom. Each 
           smooth log has thin spiral cuts on its surface. The headboard 
           has deer antlers woven between its slats, as well as a small 
           wolf paw insignia in the middle.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        What do you think?

           Ben and Rein stand by the foot. Rein seems pleased, until she 
           looks at the antlers.

           Ben notices, looks discouraged.
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The breath of spring has once again brought the forest to 
           life. Little buds and tender leaves sprout from branches. 
           Grass pokes its way up through the earth. Fresh foliage 
           pushes amongst itself to get a little more sunlight.

           Ben pushes through the woods, moving branches and brush out 
           of his way.

           He notices something on the ground.

           A pair of rusty glasses lies hidden amongst the dead leaves 
           and fresh grass. He picks them up.

           Ben inspects them. Then continues on.

           LATER

           Ben comes upon a thick patch of vegetation. A small spot in 
           the side looks like it's been worn down.

           EXT. THE CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben pushes into a little clearing, hidden away in the brush. 
           It's about twenty feet in diameter. The grass is noticeably 
           worn down. 

           Ben inspects the ground, finds a few tracks of different 
           sizes.

           In the middle of the area, Ben moves some dirt aside with his 
           boot, uncovering some ashes. He looks around, confused.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben sits by the fire, holding the glasses. Rein enters from 
           outside. She heads --

                                 BEN
                        Rein.

           She stops. A beat.

                                 BEN
                        Where have you been?

                                 REIN
                        What do you care?
           Ben grimaces, shakes his head.

                                 BEN
                        What's happened to us?

                                 REIN
                        You know exactly what.

                                 BEN
                        Where have you been going?

                                 REIN
                        It's none of your business.

           She moves to leave --

                                 BEN
                        I found your glasses.
                             (and)

                        No.

                        I go for walks.

                        Yea? You go for walks? What about 
                        sleeping downstairs every night? 
                        What about going to the barn in the 
                        middle of the night?

                        What the fuck is going on, Rein? 
                        What is happening?

           Just a blank stare.

                                 BEN
                        Ever since you stopped... it's like 
                        you're not even you anymore. Just

           A beat. Rein suddenly bursts into tears.

                        I'm sorry, Ben. I'm sorry.

           She goes into his confused arms and cries her eyes out.

           As Ben tries to comfort her, he looks out a window. A deer 
           watches from the treeline.

           He looks back to his wife.

                                 REIN
                        Are we gonna be okay, Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Yea. Yea, Rein. Of course.

           She hugs him tighter. He looks back out the window.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - LATER

           Ben comes down from upstairs, ready for bed. He goes to the 
           studio --

           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           -- and pokes his head in. Rein sits on the floor with all of 
           her supplies spread around her.

                                 BEN
                        What're you doing?

           She smiles when she sees him.

                                 REIN
                        I know you hate that it's so messy 
                        in here, so I thought I'd organize 
                        it.

                                 BEN
                        Thats nice. Don't you think that 
                        it's a little late, though?
                                 REIN
                        Oh. Yea, I guess I lost track of 
                        time.

           Ben nods. Leaves.

           He pokes his head back around, watches Rein as she ROYGBIV's 
           tubes of paint.

           INT. CABIN, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben lies awake in bed, Rein fast asleep. Cowboy at the foot.

           He turns and looks at her.

           EXT. CABIN - DAWN

           SHUCK. SHUCK. SHUCK. The well pump moves up and down. Water 
           shoots into a pale.

           Ben carries it to the cabin.

           He reaches the porch, where Cowboy sits by his chair. The 
           huge dog looks like he's in pain.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, buddy. You alright?

           Ben scratches the rot's head, notices he's protecting his 
           hind legs.

                                 BEN
                        It's okay boy, let me see.

           He starts to lift his leg, but Cowboy bares his teeth and 
           growls ferociously.

           Ben backs away, shocked.

           INT. CABIN - DAWN

           Ben distractedly scans this year's list with a shaky hand, 
           coffee brewing.

           The pencil he's using is down to a nub, and when he makes a 
           mark it slips out of his grasp.

           He sighs, stares at the table.
           INT. CABIN, STUDIO - DAWN

           Ben looks through drawers for a pencil. All of Rein's paints 
           are still on the floor from last night. All the shelves and 
           tables still empty.

           He finds one. Starts to leave... 

           ...but stops. Looks up at a shelf high on the wall, where one 
           lone paint can sits in the corner. He takes it down.

           Ben tries to open the can, but it's on really tight. Almost 
           dented into place. He looks around for something to help.

           He grabs a screwdriver.

           Ben forces it under the lid and pries up, popping it off.

           He looks down at a stash of mementos. A stack of pictures, an 
           Ipod Classic with headphones and a charger, and a gold 
           necklace.

           Ben takes the ipod and sets it aside. Then pulls out the 
           pictures.

           They're all of Ben and Rein from before they moved. All dated 
           between 2007-2011. There's one of them and some friends at a 
           bar, having a good time. Another of them in an empty 
           apartment on their move-in day. A smiling Ben doing 
           woodworking. Rein in an art gallery. More and more happy 
           memories flash in front of Ben's face as he looks through the 
           photos. Until finally, he reaches the last one. On it, Ben 
           stands with an obviously pregnant Rein, the Statue of Liberty 
           in the background. It's dated 4/25/2011.

           He sets the photos aside and pulls out the necklace. Its gold 
           chain leads to a small pendent of a person with angel wings, 
           an emerald as its body.

           Ben stares at the fallen angel --

           A noise from upstairs. He quickly returns the items to the 
           paint can.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben inconspicuously pours coffee into two mugs. Rein walks 
           in, still half-asleep.

                                 REIN
                        Morning.
           A good morning kiss, Ben hesitant.

           He hands her a mug, and for the first time a thick scar is 
           visible across her wrist.

                                 BEN
                        Morning.

           Ben watches as she stares out the window. The sun peeking 
           through the trees.

                                 REIN
                        It looks like it's gonna be nice 
                        today.

           Ben nods, forces a smile.

                                 BEN
                        I think I'm gonna head to town a 
                        little later.

           Rein looks surprised.

                                 BEN
                        What? I said if it didn't go well 
                        we'd start again.

           A grin crawls onto Rein's face.

           She pounces on him, gives him a tight hug. Ben looks 
           surprised, but happy.

           EXT. CABIN - DAWN

           Ben sits on the porch, drinking his coffee. No Cowboy.

           INT. SHED - DAY

           VROOOM. The truck comes to life.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben pulls the truck out of the shed.

           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The truck rolls onto the highway.
           LATER

           It flies down the highway, the surrounding trees full of 
           spring.

           Inside, Ben drives in silence.

           He sighs. Turns on the radio. A folk song plays.

           Ben listens to it for a long time...

           LATER

           Ben pulls onto the main road of the tiny town. It's just as 
           "busy" as last year.

           Ben smiles, Martin's Grocery coming into view. His joy fades 
           to worry.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Ben gets out of the truck. Heads up to the door.

           He shakes his head in denial.

           REVEAL: A piece of paper with Jerry's picture is taped to the 
           store door. It reads:

                        Jerry Martin Brooks was a son of 
                        two, a father of three, and a 
                        grandfather of six. But, to this 
                        town he was all of that and more. 
                        Not just a part of the community, 
                        but a friend. Thank you, Jerry. For 
                        everything.

                                      - The town of Sawyer.

                            03/12/1952 - 05/25/2017
                                     R.I.P.

           Ben wipes away a tear. An OLD MAN walks past, nods knowingly.

           He takes another moment, then leaves.

           Jerry's memory lightly flaps with a passing breeze.
           EXT./INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The truck rolls down the highway.

           Ben sits inside, still shaken.

           He reaches over and opens the glove box. Feels around inside. 
           Pulls something out.

           Ben stares down at a tiny toy car. A vintage 1955 model 
           Bentley.

           He squeezes it in his hand. A sad smile creeping onto his 
           face. It fades as he notices something ahead.

           The truck slows to a crawl as it reaches a deer, standing in 
           the ditch.

           They lock eyes as Ben rolls past.

           He takes a look in the rearview as he speeds away. The deer's 
           gaze following him.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Ben closes the shed. Takes a moment. Heads for the cabin.

                                 REIN (PRE-LAP)
                        I'm so sorry, Ben.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Ben and Rein at the window.

                                 REIN
                        I know you liked him.

           Ben shakes his head.

                                 REIN
                        What?

           He tries to find the words.

                                 BEN
                        I don't know. I just... I just wish 
                        I would've talked to him more. 
                        Spent more time.

           Rein puts a hand on his arm.
                                 REIN
                        I know.

           Ben splashes some water on his face. Dries off.

                                 BEN
                        Anyway.

           He heads for the door.

                                 REIN
                        Where're you going?

                                 BEN
                        I'm gonna go up on the barn. Get my 
                        mind off it.

                                 REIN
                        It's okay to be sad, Ben. Dr. 
                        Larson said it was good to let 
                        yourself feel it.

           Ben makes a weak smile.

                                 BEN
                        I'll be okay.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           A sweat-covered Ben kneels on top of the barn, fixing a hole 
           in the roof. Lost in thought.

           He takes a break. Wipes his face. Looks out at the area.

           From up here you can see the whole homestead, as well as some  
           hills in the distance. A herd of deer walk along the top of 
           one of them.

           Ben looks to the side of the cabin, where Rein hangs wet 
           garments on a clothesline.

           INT. CABIN, OFFICE - DAY

           Ben unlocks the gun case and takes out a rifle.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Ben moves through the woods, an incline coming into view.
           EXT. HILLS - DAY

           Ben makes his way across a hill.

           He kneels down, finds some droppings.

           LATER

           Ben walks through a sea of tall grass.

           He comes to the edge of a hill and scans the area below. 
           Spots the group of deer near a treeline, down at the bottom.

           Ben kneels down. Looks through the scope.

           The deer nibble on fresh buds, completely unaware.

           He steadies. Takes a deep breath...

           A BOOM! in the distance. Ben turns to the --

           THWACK! Dirt bursts into the air a few feet from him. He 
           jumps with surprise.

           Ben stares at the indentation, confused. Another BOOM! in the 
           distance. He frantically looks around --

           THWACK! It hits even closer than before. Ben panics, pulls 
           himself up and starts to run.

           Ben runs along the side of the hill, heading for the tree 
           line as another BOOM! echoes through the area.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben pushes into the woods. Keeps running.

           LATER

           Ben sits hidden in a fallen over hollowed-out trunk.

           EXT. WOODS - DUSK

           Ben, still in the trunk. The sunlight fading away.

           He cautiously crawl outs, scans the area.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DUSK

           BEN'S POV: Peeking through the treeline. A view of the 
           window-lit cabin.

           Ben crouches at the forest edge, staring at the cabin. He 
           lifts his rifle.

           He scans through the area, finally reaching the cabin. No 
           Cowboy on the porch. A figure is visible through the kitchen 
           window, but steam from the stove hides its face.

           Ben looks away from the scope. Notices something.

           Rein heads away from the cabin, into the garden. She kneels 
           down to pick strawberries. Ben swings back to the kitchen 
           window, but the figure's gone.

           He puts the gun down. Stares across the yard.

           INT. CABIN, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben silently cracks the door from outside. There's a steak 
           and some potatoes frying on the stove.

           Rein enters through the back door, jumps when she notices him 
           in the doorway.

                                 REIN
                        Oh my god, Ben. You scared me.

           Ben cautiously enters as Rein returns to the kitchen.

                                 REIN
                        Didn't get anything?

           Ben just shakes his head.

                                 REIN
                             (regarding the steak)
                        Can you flip that? I think it's 
                        gonna burn.

           A beat.

           He leans the rifle against a wall and does as she said. Never 
           taking his eyes off her.

                                 REIN
                        Is it done?
                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 REIN
                        The steak? We can eat if it's 
                        ready.

           Ben watches her put food on the table, and for the first time 
           since he came home, he notices that while it's set for two, 
           there's a third chair at the table.

                                 REIN
                        Is something wrong? You're acting 
                        weird.

           He just stares at the chair as she gets the steak and sits 
           down.

                                 REIN
                        Ben?

           A moment, and he sits down. She starts to eat.

                                 BEN
                        Rein.
                             (beat)
                        Rein.

                                 REIN
                        Yea?

                                 BEN
                        Why did you make dinner? You hate 
                        cooking.

           She stops chewing.

                                 REIN
                        Um... I don't know. I guess I just 
                        felt like it.

                                 BEN
                        You just felt like it?

                                 REIN
                        Yea.

           She returns to her food. Ben just sits for a while.

                                 REIN
                        It's gonna get cold.
           A beat.

           Ben cuts a piece off the end of his steak. Red liquid comes 
           out of the pink center.

           He brings it to his mouth and chews, his eyes on the chair. 
           His curiosity eventually gets the best of him.

           She stops chewing again. Looks at the chair.

                        steak. Don't you think that's 
                        weird? Why would he do that if he 
                        was so upset about...

           Ben stares down at the piece of meat.

           He reaches the bottom. Stops. Stares at the

           FREEZER

           Ben puts a hand on the door... and lifts it up, revealing --

           Just the normal, vacuum-sealed meat.

           He lets out a sigh of relief, until... he looks at the door 
           to the hanging room.

           Ben walks up and grabs the handle. Works himself up to it.

           He pulls --

           INT. CABIN, HANGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the door open. A look of horror spreads across his face.

           Will and Hannah's bodies hang from the ceiling, their chests 
           spread open. Their guts removed.

           INT. CABIN, BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ben backs out of the hanging room, traumatized. He starts to 
           realize what's happened, and --

           VOMITS violently on the floor. Rein calls from the top of the 
           stairs.

                        Ben? Are you okay?
           He wipes his mouth. Tries to compose himself. Heads up the

           Ben pulls the case open and lifts a slat at the bottom, 
           revealing a hidden compartment. A couple stacks of hundreds, 
           an antique handgun with some shells, and a deconstructed cell 
           phone lie inside.

           Rein enters as he shoves one of the stacks and the handgun in

           The sound of a door closing. Ben moves to a window. Sees Rein 
           running across the yard toward the woods.

                                 BEN
                        Rein!

           He grabs his keys --

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - NIGHT

           Ben bursts out and runs toward the treeline. He notices the 
           doors to the shed have been left open, the truck inside.

           Soon, he heads into the woods...

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Ben pushes wildly through the thick vegetation in the dark, 
           breaking through small trees and bushes. Dodging trees. At 
           some point he falls, crawls on all fours before regaining his 
           footing.

           BEN'S POV: Quickly moving through the dark woods, branches 
           swatting his face. He trips as he climbs over a fallen tree.

           Ben stops. Sees a muffled light hidden amidst the trees.

           He heads for it.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ben reaches the spot where he found Rein's glasses. A subtle 
           glow warms the area.

           He creeps up to the mangled plants and branches that surround 
           the clearing and tries to peer through. But, it's too thick 
           to get a good look.

           He carefully pushes through, trying not to make any noise...

           EXT. THE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           Light spreads onto Ben's face as he peers through the edge of 
           the brush.
           BEN'S POV: In the clearing, Rein sits at a fire with one of 
           each animal of the forest, all sitting like humans. Talking 
           in their own voices. Cowboy and Bert are there too, a rifle 
           held on the pig's knee.

           Ben watches with worry. Flicks out the pistol's cylinder --

           Empty. A twig snaps.

           The group goes silent. They all turn their heads.

           But, Ben doesn't notice. Too focused on getting the bullets 
           out of his pocket.

           Ben shakingly loads his pistol, the firelight dancing onto 
           his -- He stops. Looks up, and stares right at us...

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

                                          THE END
