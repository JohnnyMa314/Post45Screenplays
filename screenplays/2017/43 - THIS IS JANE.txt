           OVER BLACK. 

                Based on true events.

           STILL BLACK. We hear a female voice.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        No little girl in the history of 
                        little girls has ever dreamt about 
                        becoming an abortionist.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Meet JENNY. She sits at a table, looking rough. She’s 29, 
           natural, in a t-shirt and jeans.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        I don’t care about my fifth 
                        amendment rights. I’m not worried 
                        about going to prison.

           Her wrist is cuffed to a metal loop drilled into the table --

           We hear an OFF-SCREEN door shut, and heavy footsteps walk to 
           a chair across the table from her. She reacts to this
           mysterious person cooly -- not nervous in the least.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        You can’t arrest us all, and you
                        can’t arrest us forever.

           This is SOBCHEK. Homicide. Late 40s. Sobchek pulls a chair 
           and sits across from her --

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        You can bring Jane down here and 
                        another Jane will take her place. 
               (then)
                        Jane has no regrets and she won't 
                        go away...

           Jenny -- staring straight down the barrel...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Not until you are strong enough to
                        look her in the eyes.

           SLAM TO BLACK

                 Four years earlier
       This is Jane

           INT. HOSPITAL - RADIATION - DAY

           Jenny -- a little younger, but not much healthier. 

           She’s laying on the cold metal slab, surrounded by 60s era 
           machinery. She wears a paper gown. An X-RAY TARGET is 
           projected onto her neck -- like a sniper scope. 

           The harsh light reveals a marble sized bump on her neck. 

                                 TECH
                        Hold here.

           The tech walks out -- a beat later the machine cranks up -- 
           whirring, clunking, revving. 

           Jenny hates this part. She shuts her eyes tight --

           Suddenly the machinery spoooools down --

                                 JENNY
                        What’s wrong? Why are we stopping?

           The intercom squawks --

                                 TECH (O.C.)
                        The doctor wants to see you, ma’am.

           INT DR. MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

           DR. MURRAY -- a chilly, fifty year-old autocrat in a white 
           coat -- moves to the sink to wash his hands.

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        The pill isn’t a hundred percent, I 
                        told you that --

           Heavy pause. Jenny on an exam table -- paper gown. Dazed.

                                 JENNY
                        Dr. Murray, I can’t have a baby --

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        Well, you really should have 
                        thought about that eight weeks ago.

           Another pause -- Murray wielding guilt like a club.

                                 JENNY
                        I asked you to tie my tubes -- 
                        after Audrey. You said no because I 
                        was too young...
       This is Jane

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        I may have advised against it, but 
                        the choice is always yours --

                                 JENNY
                        So what happens now? 

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        You carry on with the pregnancy, 
                        just like you did with Audrey.

           Audrey. That memory hits Jenny like a truck.

                                 JENNY
                        Do you -- do you think it’s safe 
                        for me to give birth?

           A cryptic shrug from Murray --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, is there another way?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        That way will require approval.

                                 JENNY
                        Okay, who’s approval do I need?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        For one, your husband’s -- to make 
                        sure it’s right for both of you.

                                 JENNY
                        Just Glen? Is that it?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        Then there’s the hospital board --

                                 JENNY
                        Do you think it’ll be a problem?

           Murray stands. Silent. Noncommittal. 

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           Jenny is dialing a number -- it rings and rings. 

                                 JENNY
                        Come on, Glen... pick up.

                                 GLEN
                        Hello, this is Glen -- 

           Jenny. Suddenly self-conscious. She doesn’t speak.
       This is Jane

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Is someone there?

           She hangs up. Jenny exits, hurries off.

           We hear CROWD NOISE fade up in the background -- accompanied 
           by a MALE PROTESTER, screaming into a bullhorn.

                                 PROTESTER (O.S.)
                        If a law is unjust, it’s our 
                        obligation to break it!

           INT. PUBLIC RESTROOM - DAY

           Jenny vomits into a commode. She’s ghost white. 

                                 PROTESTER (O.S.)
                        Are we just gonna sit by and let 
                        them dictate the terms of our 
                        freedom?!

           Boos erupt from the off-screen crowd. 

           Now we see Jenny in front of a mirror -- plucking at her 
           hair, fixing her make-up -- readying for public consumption.

           EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

           The PROTESTER screams into a bullhorn!

                                 PROTESTER
                        Last I heard this was the land of 
                        the free and home of the brave!

           We find Jenny, lost in the sea of protesters -- she yells 
           with the Angry crowd around her -- YEAH!

           EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

           The march. It’s swift and strong. We see crowds of protesters 
           outside of the Chicago convention hall -- they carry signs: 
           END THE WAR BEFORE IT ENDS YOU. JOHNSON IS A WAR CRIMINAL. 
           MAKE LOVE NOT WAR. HEIL NIXON.

           In the fray is Jenny -- chanting, but her mind is elsewhere.

           -- Marijuana smoke wafts her way -- she waves it off.

           -- She pushes against others, careful to protect her belly.

           -- She feels her stomach, wishing she was elsewhere.

           -- She gazes into the distance, a row of MOUNTED POLICEMAN 
           preside over the scene, menacing...
       This is Jane

           CRACK-CRACK-CRACK! Gunshots echo through the city. 

           All eyes move to the sky -- arching contrails of TEAR GAS 
           GRENADES descend on them... The shells explode in the air.

           Chaos erupts and a strange ringing sound fades in...

           WHAM! Jenny is knocked around -- disoriented, blinded, 
           coughing -- she falls hard -- people close in on her -- 

           Then -- hands pull her up. It’s a young woman, CLAIRE. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you okay!? Come on --

           We can't hear her, only this strange ringing.

           The two women run as the eerie ghost-like ambiance overtakes 
           the scene -- they cough and retch, swallowed by tear gas -- 

           Jenny focuses on -- a line of riot police -- helmets and 
           nightsticks -- emerging from the cloud. Then -- she doubles 
           over and collapses -- WHAP! Onto the pavement.

           A police horse screeches and stands on it’s hind legs.

           SLAM TO BLACK. 

                   THIS IS JANE

           A rush of sound brings us to -- 

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           More chaos. Yelling, beeping, coughing. The ER has become a 
           makeshift trauma ward. Cots everywhere, jammed between beds.

           Jenny comes-to. Her image is shocking to us -- she’s 
           completely bald -- a bloody bandage on her forehead. 

           She looks around, sees students bleeding, hacking, holding 
           broken arms. She sits up and --

                                 ER NURSE
                        Ma’am, stay right where you are.

           An ER NURSE approaches her.

                                 JENNY
                        I’m fine, I really am.

                                 ER NURSE
                        Oh, yeah? Take a deep breath.
       This is Jane

           Jenny sucks back air and coughs violently.

                                 ER NURSE (CONT’D)
                        That’s tear gas -- name, please?

           The nurse pulls out paper and pen. Jenny can barely speak --

                                 JENNY
                        Jenny Patterson.

                                 ER NURSE
                        And a number, Miss Patterson?

                                 JENNY
                        770-0439. My husband is Glen.

           The nurse hands the card to a clerk standing by -- then 
           shines a pen-light into Jenny’s eye.

                                 ER NURSE
                        Tell me about your head?

           Jenny feels her scalp and is instantly mortified -- she looks 
           for her wig -- it’s on a side table... 

                                 ER NURSE (CONT’D)
                        It’s cancer?

           Jenny nods -- so embarrassed -- she puts it on...

                                 ER NURSE (CONT’D)
                        And those scrapes on your stomach -- 
                        what are they from?

           There’s a strangely accusatory tone in her voice --

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t know. A baton? A hoof? I 
                        was at a rally today -- and I 
                        honestly don’t even know how I got 
                        here -- what are you getting at?

           The nurse takes it down a notch -- 

                                 ER NURSE
                        See those two gentlemen behind me?

           Jenny’s eyes shift to the CHICAGO POLICEMAN and DOCTOR (both 
           40s) standing at the other side of the room. 

                                 ER NURSE (CONT’D)
                        They’re here to make sure you 
                        weren’t trying to abort that baby.
       This is Jane

           Whoa. That hits Jenny hard --

                                 JENNY
                        Why would they think that?

                                 ER NURSE
                        It’s just how they are. We have to 
                        tell the police or we could be 
                        charged for helping you do it -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Is that really at the top of their 
                        minds?

           The nurse nods -- more than a little annoyed by it.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Do you see a lot of that here?

                                 ER NURSE
                        More than I’d like -- had a Jane 
                        Doe last week who went into septic 
                        shock --
               (then)
                        Still haven’t ID’d her body.

           Then -- from off-camera...

                                 CASEY (O.C.)
                        Mommy!

           A small child runs in -- CASEY, 3 -- Jenny’s daughter. 

                                 JENNY
                        Oooo... I’m so happy to see you.

           Jenny scoops her up as GLEN, her husband, walks in holding a 
           baby, AUDREY (6 mos). He’s barely keeping it together --

                                 GLEN
                        Hey -- are you okay?

           Glen. Loving. Worried. He frames her face with his hands --

                                 JENNY
                        I think so, I just woke up --

           Jenny is distracted by the Nurse -- who slips over to the cop 
           and Doctor -- Jenny watches them speak.

                                 GLEN
                        Who’re those guys?

           Jenny shrugs it off -- no idea. 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Can we get outta here?

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s a modest, two-bedroom apartment in Hyde Park. The 
           kitchen connects to the living room. Small, clean, efficient. 

           Jenny watches a small B&W television set -- David Brinkley is 
           on-screen, speaking from the Chicago Convention center.

                                 BRINKLEY
                        ...the tape you’re about to see was 
                        made thirty to forty minutes ago...

           We see Chicago Riot Police brutally beat down protesters --

           Jenny watches in disgust. She wears a comfy robe, slippers. 
           She switches it off and walks into the --

           KITCHEN

                                 JENNY
                        Daley can’t issue a permit to let 
                        us demonstrate and then lob tear 
                        gas at us...

           Glen is washing dishes, cleaning up after dinner. He’s that 
           kinda guy -- better than me.

                                 GLEN
                        On the upside, you made the news --

                                 JENNY
                        My Mother would be so proud.

           Jenny sits down, slow.

                                 GLEN
                        How’re you feeling?

                                 JENNY
                        Okay -- I think.
               (then)
                        I just never thought I’d be 
                        explaining the concept of civil 
                        disobedience to a toddler.

           He grabs a beer from the fridge, pops it open, offers her a 
           swig. She considers -- Nah, better not.

                                 GLEN
                        So, you wanna talk about it?
       This is Jane

           Jenny locks eyes with him -- does he know?

                                 JENNY
                        Talk about what?

                                 GLEN
                        About our agreement that you not go 
                        to Grant Park today --

                                 JENNY
                        Come on, it was supposed to be a 
                        peace protest, it was the cops’ 
                        fault -- 

                                 GLEN
                        We all knew that wasn’t going to be 
                        peaceful 

           Jenny sighs -- rolls her eyes...

                                 JENNY
                        You can’t expect me to miss out on 
                        life just because I have cancer --

                                 GLEN
                        I’m just saying this isn’t college 
                        anymore. We’re in real life, now -- 
                        and me and Casey and Audrey would 
                        like to have you around for the 
                        next seventy or so years.

           Jenny smiles -- his sweetness isn’t lost on her.

                                 JENNY
                        Casey told me you guys ate donuts 
                        for breakfast and lunch --

                                 GLEN
                        Precisely what I’m talking about --
               (then)
                        So, maybe take it easy on the 
                        nightstick activities? 

           She picks up a dirty glass and clinks it on his bottle --

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of police, who were those 
                        guys at the hospital?

           Jenny hesitates a beat -- not sure she wants to go there yet.

                                 JENNY
                        You mean the St. Vincent’s Gestapo?
               (then)
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        I think they were taking statements 
                        so they can sue us later --

                                 GLEN
                        Sue us for what?

                                 CASEY (O.C.)
                        Mommy?

           Casey is at the kitchen door -- rubbing her eyes.

                                 JENNY
                        For breaking their nightsticks.

           Jenny scoops Casey up -- walks out.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Did you have a bad dream, munchkin?

           BEDROOM

           Jenny walks in with Casey, puts her back in bed -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Can you tell me about it?

           Casey shakes her head, no -- too scared.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Does it have something to do with 
                        today? Seeing me in a hospital?

           Casey nods -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Well, can I tell you how brave you 
                        were today and how much you helped 
                        Audrey and Daddy to find mommy.

                                 CASEY
                        No leave.

           Jenny takes her daughter’s words in --

                                 JENNY
                        Casey, I want you to know that I’m 
                        not going to leave you. Ever. 
                        Mommy’s going to take very good 
                        care of herself from now on.
               (then)
                        Wanna snuggle?

           Jenny crawls under the covers with Casey --
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Do you need anything from me to 
                        help you sleep better tonight?

           Casey looks up at her mama --

                                 CASEY
                        Donuts.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Jenny sits at a long table. A panel of men sit across from 
           her -- Dr. Murray, DR. EMBRY and an ADMINISTRATOR.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We’ve reviewed your case and with the 
                        evidence on hand we cannot approve 
                        the termination of your pregnancy.
               (then)
                        This hearing is closed --

           The three men in the room all stand to leave -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Umm, wait a second, wait, wait -- I 
                        was under the impression that this 
                        would be a discussion.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        There’s no discussion necessary, 
                        the law requires that a mother’s 
                        life be in imminent danger and we 
                        don’t have that evidence --

                                 JENNY
                        I have cancer. Non-Hodgkins 
                        lymphoma -- are you sure you’re 
                        looking at the right chart?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We’re well aware of your condition, 
                        ma’am -- and also that you have a 
                        long way to go before you’re in 
                        imminent danger --

                                 JENNY
                        Will you be stopping my radiation? 

           The Administrator looks to Embry, 50s, white coat --

                                 DR. EMBRY
                        We’ll be putting your treatments on 
                        hold while you carry the child -- 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Doesn’t that put my life in 
                        imminent danger? Or can we put the 
                        cancer on hold, too?

                                 DR. EMBRY
                        We don’t know what the cancer will 
                        do -- it might advance, yes, or it 
                        might not.

                                 JENNY
                        So, I’m not gonna die tomorrow -- 
                        but in seven months when I have to 
                        give birth, things could get a 
                        little rough, right?

           She’s looking at Murray -- who’s eyes won’t meet hers.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Your chart says that you’ve already 
                        had a child while you were fighting 
                        this cancer --

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, and Dr. Murray remembers that 
                        I nearly died in the process...

           Again -- Murray isn’t there for her. Stone cold.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        And is that child healthy, are you 
                        alive to tell us about him?

                                 JENNY
                        Her name is Audrey and I’m happy to 
                        have her in my life -- which is why 
                        I don’t want to risk it again.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Exactly right -- the last thing we 
                        want is to take you from your 
                        family by approving a potentially 
                        dangerous elective surgery.

                                 JENNY
                        Can you tell me what’s more 
                        dangerous than cancer bringing me 
                        to the edge of death?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        The abortion procedure is no cake 
                        walk, Jenny. 
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 DR. MURRAY (CONT'D)
                        Your body is meant to hold that 
                        baby in and protect it -- 
                        everything is going to that child 
                        right now and to remove it just 
                        confuses your body.
               (then)
                        It can lead to depression and 
                        suicide in many cases.

                                 DR. EMBRY
                        Not to mention the link we’ve found 
                        between that procedure and breast 
                        cancer later in life -- 

                                 JENNY
                        I already have cancer -- I’m 
                        already depressed -- can we just 
                        err on the side of caution?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        It’s not this hospital’s policy to 
                        err on the side of taking anyone’s 
                        life...
               (then)
                        One reckless act doesn’t justify 
                        another. This hearing is closed.

           A gavel comes down like a gunshot -- 

           HALLWAY

           Jenny walks out of the boardroom -- silent, numb -- when a 
           woman in the hallway intercepts her --

                                 KAY
                        Hi, Mrs. Patterson?

           This is KAY. A chipper nurse from the natal wing. 

                                 JENNY
                        Umm, hi -- have we met?

                                 KAY
                        No, my name is Kay. I’m a nurse 
                        here at St. Vincent’s. Can we talk?

           NURSE’S STATION

           Kay hands a brochure to Jenny. She speaks low --

                                 KAY
                        I lead a weekly group discussion 
                        where it’s safe to talk about this 
                        very important decision you face.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Okay, who’s gonna be there?

                                 KAY
                        Just some people who can help you.

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Jenny riding. Escaping. She looks at the brochure --

              Abortion. Is it right or wrong?

           Curious, she opens it and we see a flash-frame of --

                 A desiccated fetus.

           TRAIN STATION

           Jenny walks the platform, tosses it into a trash can -- 

           INT. JENNY’S HOME - CASEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny is reading a book to her child -- Goodnight Moon.

                                 JENNY
                        Goodnight comb, goodnight brush --

           We hear the faint ring of a telephone from the other room. 
           Jenny stops -- Glen picks it up. She resumes reading...

           LIVING ROOM

           Jenny walks out from Casey’s room...

                                 GLEN
                        Did you know they’re cancelling 
                        your next radiation appointment?

           Uh-oh. Jenny sits down and wraps her arms around herself.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s great news, right? Are you 
                        getting better? 

           Jenny. Caught. Silent. Ashamed.

                               TIME CUT TO:

           Glen. Livid.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        What about me? 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        What about you?

                                 GLEN
                        Don’t you think I should be in on 
                        this decision?

                                 JENNY
                        I made this decision for you -- for 
                        the family. So I can be your wife 
                        and raise your kids. 
               (then)
                        I might not have any hair, but I’ll 
                        be here when you’re old to bring 
                        you soup with crackers and peanut 
                        butter on top of them.

           Glen processes that --

                                 GLEN
                        So, what happens now?

                                 JENNY
                        Well, nothing -- the doctors won’t 
                        do it until my life is in imminent 
                        danger --

                                 GLEN
                        What does that even mean? 

                                 JENNY
                        It means they let the cancer eat me 
                        away until I’m seconds from death, 
                        then they do the abortion, then I 
                        go back to radiation and 
                        everything’s fine again...

                                 GLEN
                        That’s ridiculous -- that can’t be 
                        right -- I’m gonna talk to Murray.

                                 JENNY
                        Right. The men will talk and make 
                        it all better -- no, I went in 
                        front of the hospital board.
               (then)
                        That’s their decision.

                                 GLEN
                        You’ve already talked to the board?

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, they put the gavel down on me.
       This is Jane

           A paralyzed silence overtakes them -- Glen sits -- Jenny 
           intertwines her limbs into him.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s good to know my little guys 
                        can still swim --

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, your guys are swimming fine.

                                 GLEN
                        So, what do we do?

           Jenny. Lost. Alone.

           INT. DR. MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Jenny is on the table. Fully clothed. The folded robe in her 
           lap. We hear the door -- Jenny straightens up -- 

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        And how are we feeling today?

           He talks like there’s no tension between them --

                                 JENNY
                        Dr. Murray, I need your help.

           A pause. Murray drops the innocent act --

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        We’ve been over this, Jenny --

                                 JENNY
                        I know what the board said and I’m 
                        not trying to disrespect them -- 
                        I’m asking you as a friend. As 
                        someone who’s delivered my two 
                        children and has been on this 
                        journey with me from the start.

           For the first time, we see Murray’s humanity seep through 
           that harsh facade -- it’s tearing him apart, too...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        If it’s a matter of money, I can 
                        pay -- cash, under the table so 
                        nobody has to know.

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        It’s not money -- I just can’t.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t understand why I have to be 
                        on the brink of death before you’ll 
                        help me with this?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        You have to leave now.

                                 JENNY
                        Why?

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        You say you don’t want to lose your 
                        family, I don’t want to lose my 
                        family -- and that’s what I’m 
                        risking when you ask me to do this.

           Silence. Jenny moves to the window. Standing there. Pulling 
           the curtain. Watching life happen on the street.

                                 JENNY
                        Don’t make me go to some stranger, 
                        you know that’s not right.

                                 DR. MURRAY
                        I can lose my license and be 
                        prosecuted for even talking to you 
                        about this.
               (then)
                        I can’t do it.

           Jenny stands. Ashen. Silent.

           RECEPTION

           Jenny walks through, humiliated -- we hear a “psst.”

           She turns to see Murray’s Receptionist -- CATHERINE. She 
           glances down at a SLIP OF PAPER on the corner of her desk.

           Catherine nods -- take it.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           Jenny unfolds the slip of paper to reveal a phone number. 

           She drops a dime --

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Doctor Baldwin’s office.

                                 JENNY
                        Hi, I was given this number by the 
                        receptionist at Dr. Murray’s?
       This is Jane

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Is this Mrs. Patterson?

           She’s speaking very low... secretive.

                                 JENNY
                        Yes...

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Are you available tomorrow night?

                                 JENNY
                        Yes. What time?

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        9pm. Six-hundred, bring cash.

           Click. And she’s gone.

           EXT. BALDWIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jenny pulls up in a cab and takes in the scene. It’s dark. 
           Lit only by street lights. The sidewalk is empty. Not a soul 
           in sight. She pays the cabbie and gets out.

           Late. Cold. Quiet. Jenny wraps her coat tightly.

           INT. BALDWIN’S OFFICE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jenny steps off the elevator. The hallways are dimly lit --
           she comes upon Baldwin’s door. No sign, just a number. 

           She knocks. The door opens and we meet DR. BALDWIN -- one of 
           those guys who looks like he’s been in his late forties 
           forever. Trim, tan and pressed -- solid.

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Hi, how are you? Jenny?

           Jenny nods -- at ease by his friendliness...

                                 DR. BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        Paul Baldwin. Come on in, make 
                        yourself at home.

           And it is homey in there. Artfully lit, welcoming -- 

                                 DR. BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        Catherine over at Murray’s office 
                        sent you over -- how is she?

                                 JENNY
                        She seems fine, I don’t know her 
                        that well, actually --
       This is Jane

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        She’s a great girl -- used to work 
                        in my office once upon a time. You 
                        can set your coat down there -- and 
                        change in there...

           He points to the procedure room. Jenny glances inside -- we 
           see an exam table, a stool. She removes her coat -- and takes 
           her envelope out, hands it over to him --

                                 JENNY
                        Cash, like you wanted.

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Thank you for not making that 
                        awkward -- I always hate to ask.

                                 JENNY
                        Actually, I was wondering if you 
                        wouldn’t mind taking five-fifty? I 
                        had to pawn my mother’s ring.

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        I’m sorry, I can’t. It’s all here?

           She nods -- it’s all there.

           PROCEDURE ROOM

           Jenny’s wearing a skirt-like apron, tied in the back.

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Let me take a look, feet up --

           Baldwin flips down the hard metal stirrups on his table -- 

           Jenny climbs up and lays down, feet into the stirrups -- 

           Baldwin moves into position for a pelvic exam -- Jenny closes 
           her eyes, blocking out this strange man between her legs.

                                 JENNY
                        Is this gonna be painful?

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        You might feel a little pressure, 
                        but no, nothing too bad. It will 
                        all be over soon...

           Then -- we hear the unmistakable sound of trousers being 
           dropped. A belt is unfastened. A zipper is unzipped. 

           We see it register in Jenny -- she opens her eyes, looks to 
           her side to where Baldwin now stands -- 
       This is Jane

           Her eyes dart up to the ceiling... 

                                 JENNY
                        What are you doing?

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Knocking fifty bucks off.

           Baldwin looms over her. Intimidating.

                                 JENNY
                        Um, no thanks, I don’t need the 
                        money that badly.

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        How badly do you need this procedure?

           A threat. Jenny gathers her wits. She calmly, slowly rises 
           from the table and walks to her pile of clothes.

                                 DR. BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 JENNY
                        Would you mind stepping out? I need 
                        to change...

           Baldwin stands indignant. Shrugs. Leaves.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        My money? On the table, please?

           Baldwin pulls out the cash, counts out five bills and pockets 
           the sixth -- Jenny notices.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        And what’s that for?

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Wasting my time.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jenny cries -- face-in-hands-sobbing. She forces herself to 
           stop, wipes her eyes. She moves to the counter to find her 
           tissue box, blows her nose and notices --

           Laundry. Glen’s shirts hanging on a door knob --

           She grabs one, tosses the shirt aside, untwists the hanger 
           and stares at the hooked end -- bent, crooked, evil.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (PRE-LAP)
                        Last night I picked up a kitchen 
                        knife and wondered how it would 
                        feel sliding down my wrist --

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jenny on a couch. A psychiatrist listens -- pen and notepad.

                                 JENNY
                        And the other day I woke up in the 
                        morning and thought about putting 
                        poison in my kid’s cereal -- 

           Jenny watches him -- Is he buying this?

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        And last week I was holding the 
                        bleach and I thought ‘oh it would 
                        be so easy to just --’

           The psychiatrist holds up a hand -- please stop.

                                 PSYCHIATRIST
                        That’s enough -- I got it.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Half-melted candles on the table. Jenny and Glen with an open 
           bottle of wine -- post-dinner aftermath.

           BRRRRNGG. The phone. Glen moves to pick it up...

                                 GLEN
                        ‘Lo.

           He says nothing, just listens and nods. Then -- 

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you very much, Doctor. We 
                        appreciate the call -- bye now.

           He hangs up, walks over to the table -- sits, stares...

                                 JENNY
                        And?

                                 GLEN
                        The psychiatrist thinks you’re nuts 
                        -- Dr. Murray’s gonna do it.
       This is Jane

           INT. DR. MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Jenny walks into Dr. Murray’s reception room. She walks to 
           Catherine, the woman who gave her Baldwin’s number -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Hey, I’m Dr. Murray’s 10am.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m afraid Dr. Murray is out today. 

           There’s a haunted, hollow look in Catherine’s eyes --

                                 JENNY
                        Oh. Okay -- should I reschedule?

                                 CATHERINE
                        That won’t be necessary there’s a 
                        doctor covering for him today --

                                 JENNY
                        But, I want Dr. Murray --

                                 CATHERINE
                        I can only say that the covering 
                        doctor is available for you today --

           PROCEDURE ROOM

           Jenny at the threshold. Hesitating. Listening. Nervous. The 
           door falls open, revealing -- Dr. Baldwin. 

           Waiting. Watching her. Not a happy reunion.

           The door closes behind her.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - DAY

           Glen is on the couch -- feeding Audrey. Casey plays nearby. 

           Jenny walks in, hangs her coat. Glen and the kids watch her.

                                 GLEN
                        Hey --

           Jenny stops him with a look -- let’s not talk about it.

                                 JENNY
                        I’m gonna go lie down.

           She walks silently to their bedroom. 
       This is Jane

           BEDROOM

           Glen and Casey see her on the bed -- they move to her and 
           wordlessly lay next to her, and snuggle.

           INT. HOSPITAL - X-RAY - DAY

           Back in radiation. Jenny lays on the slab -- paper gown. It's 
           dark. The x-ray target is projected on her neck bump...

                                 TECH
                        Hold there.

           The tech walks out of the room. The 60s era technology spools 
           up -- whirring, clunking... very sci-fi, very scary. 

           Jenny closes her eyes -- and BANG!

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           WRRRETCH -- Jenny heaves and heaves, puking her guts out. 

           LIVING ROOM

           Jenny walks in, wrapped in an overcoat -- Glen watching tube.

                                 GLEN
                        You’re going out?

                                 JENNY
                        Yeah, I saw a flyer. This women's 
                        lib thing. I need to get involved 
                        in something new. 

           She kisses him and -- he takes her arm.

                                 GLEN
                        No nightsticks, please?

           A gentle reminder. She nods --

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A woman speaker stands at the podium before the packed room -- 
           who are almost exclusively women.

                                 SPEAKER
                        What have we gotten out of the anti-
                        war movement? Did we stop the war? 
                        Did we stop the draft? Has anything 
                        changed for anyone?

           Jenny walks in -- half-listening, half-trying to find her 
           place. She wanders toward a table lined with LITERATURE. 
       This is Jane

                                 SPEAKER (CONT’D)
                        No -- and none of these questions 
                        really matter, because “did we help 
                        women” is the real question.

           Then -- she hears it...

                                 SPEAKER (CONT’D)
                        Who here has had an abortion?

           Jenny stops -- focuses on the speaker. It’s Claire -- the 
           woman from the riot earlier -- a young polished, go-getter.

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        That’s inappropriate, Claire --

           The CHAIRWOMAN of the group stands to the side -- she’s a 
           student, too -- about Claire’s age.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why? Don’t you realize that almost 
                        one in three women has had one?
               (then)
                        That’s about ten of us in here -- 
                        will anyone speak up?

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        Thank you for pointing that out, 
                        but we’ve talked about abortion 
                        before --

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know and it always gets shut down 
                        -- why are we stigmatizing this 
                        thing when so many women have to 
                        deal with it?

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        No one’s arguing that women aren’t 
                        people -- we’re just saying it’s a 
                        medical issue -- doctors make those 
                        decisions.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh, the men decide -- why aren’t we 
                        taking that back? Women having the 
                        right to control our reproduction 
                        is our ticket to true liberation. 

           We see two women from the crowd quietly get up and walk out -- 
           Claire senses the orchestra playing her off-stage...
       This is Jane

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        Okay, thank you, Claire -- is there 
                        anything else?

                                 CLAIRE
                        This is the 20th century ladies. 
                        Women can vote now -- why are we 
                        tolerating this?

                                 JENNY
                        I’ve had one.

           The whole room turns toward Jenny -- standing in back. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Finally someone speaks. Please go 
                        on.

                                 JENNY
                        With all due respect -- we're not 
                        ready for that fight.

           Claire’s face falls...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        I get it, it’s fun to be a radical, 
                        but it’s not right to challenge a 
                        bunch of women to out themselves.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The more people talk about it, the 
                        easier it will be to fight.

                                 JENNY
                        It’s easy to talk about until it’s 
                        in your own backyard.

           The room stirs -- agreeing with Jenny.

                                 CHAIRWOMAN
                        Okay, let’s move on -- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you realize that women are dying 
                        everyday because their doctors 
                        can’t help them and they have to go 
                        to strangers in alleyways?

                                 JENNY
                        I do realize that, very well -- but 
                        until we get a few more men to 
                        fight this on a legislative level 
                        all you’ll do is alienate us.
               (then)
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Women need a win right now and we 
                        should pick a cause that we can all 
                        fight for. 

           Claire and Jenny stare down --

           EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           Jenny and Claire walk n’ talk...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Way to stick up for me in there.
               (then)
                        Oh, and by the way, you’re welcome 
                        for that free ride to the hospital.

           She’s light-hearted here -- warrior to warrior banter.

                                 JENNY
                        Here we go, the honeymoon phase is 
                        over -- look if you thought Grant 
                        Park was bad, just wait ‘til you 
                        start talking about abortion. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay, okay -- I get it -- you don’t 
                        have to rub it my face.

           Jenny stops Claire -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Thank you for helping me get to the 
                        hospital that day. I was in a bad 
                        place, I shouldn’t have been there 
                        and you saved my ass...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Honestly, it wasn’t me -- two burly 
                        longhairs carried you. I just 
                        yelled for people to clear the way.

                                 JENNY
                        Listen -- I’m done protesting. I 
                        can’t go back there anymore -- but 
                        I’m here to help if you need...
               (then)
                        Do you have a friend that’s 
                        pregnant or something?

                                 CLAIRE
                        How did you know that?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        ‘Cause if it was you, you would 
                        tell me. Does she need someone to 
                        talk to?

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM - NIGHT

           It’s a cramped room. MARIA, Claire’s friend, sits on the bed. 

                                 MARIA
                        I don’t know what to say --

                                 JENNY
                        That’s okay, I don’t either. What 
                        do you want to know?

                                 MARIA
                        Is there anything I can do?

                                 JENNY
                        I’m gonna be honest -- you don’t 
                        have a lot of options. And if you 
                        really want this you’re gonna risk 
                        your life and break the law. And 
                        maybe that’s worth it to you.

                                 MARIA
                        Will anyone find out?

                                 JENNY
                        Probably not -- you’re doing an 
                        illegal thing and no one wants to 
                        talk about it -- but because of 
                        that you’re dealing with people who 
                        can take advantage you.

                                 MARIA
                        How?

                                 JENNY
                        They can extort you for sex, or 
                        more money -- and more often than 
                        not they get it.

                                 MARIA
                        Can I get pregnant again?

                                 JENNY
                        I think so -- but there’s always a 
                        risk.

                                 MARIA
                        How did you do it?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Mine was sanctioned by the hospital 
                        and I went to a doctor.

                                 MARIA
                        Can I get a sanctioned one?

                                 JENNY
                        I was a special situation.

           Maria deflates -- the women sit there, depressed.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I found a guy who will do it...

           She pulls a small note from her cork board.

                  Nick 822-9281

                                 JENNY
                        Nick? That’s it? Who gave you this?

                                 CLAIRE
                        A friend of a friend. Of a friend. 

                                 JENNY
                        Have you called the number?

                                 CLAIRE
               (headshake, no)
                        My friend says he’s good, though.

                                 JENNY
                        Well, that’s something -- 

           The three women sit silent -- afraid.

                                 MARIA
                        Could you call him for me?

           HALLWAY

           Jenny is on Claire’s community phone -- Maria and Claire 
           stand nearby, listening in...

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           We never see Nick here -- only hear his creepy voice.

                                 JENNY
                        Yes. Hi. I’m looking for Nick?
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        Who gave you this number?

           Claire whispers to Jenny -- “Celia”

                                 JENNY
                        Um, Celia? Celia gave it to me...
               (then)
                        Am I speaking with Nick?

                                 NICK
                        Yeah?

                                 JENNY
                        Um, sorry it’s so late. I just -- 
                        I’m not really -- I don’t know how 
                        this works so --

                                 NICK
                        The price is six hundred -- if you 
                        don’t have it, we can hang up now.

                                 JENNY
                        She has it...

                                 NICK
                        She? This isn’t for you?

                                 JENNY
                        No, I’m calling for a friend --

                                 NICK
                        Okay, why does she need it?

                                 JENNY
                        Why do you need to know?

                                 NICK
                        It’s to let me know that you’re 
                        someone I can trust and not a cop.

                                 JENNY
                        What if I just want to work with 
                        someone who doesn’t need to know 
                        why she needs an abortion.

                                 NICK
                        Are you a cop?

                                 JENNY
                        No. Can we meet, I have questions?

                                 NICK
                        Just ask me right now.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Are you the doctor?

                                 NICK
                        No, I just work with one.

                                 JENNY
                        For six hundred he better be a real 
                        doctor. What’s his name?

                                 NICK
                        All you need to know is that he’s 
                        very real --

                                 JENNY
                        Is he a decent human being -- does he 
                        expect something on the side? 

                                 NICK
                        This doctor isn’t like that. 

                                 JENNY
                        He better not be ‘cause we’re not 
                        paying until I hear it was a clean 
                        procedure --

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Fine. Saturday, 8am. 52nd and 
                        Dorchester. Beige Cutlass.

           Click. And he’s gone. Jenny hangs up -- 

                                 JENNY
                        There you go, still wanna do this?

           A beat between Claire and Maria -- yes.

           EXT. L-TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Maria steps off the train and walks down to street level 
           where Jenny await...

                                 JENNY
                        How are you feeling? 

                                 MARIA
                        I’m good.

           Maria pulls out a wad of cash -- random bills.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m short.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        How much?

                                 MARIA
                        One-fifty.

           Jenny takes it from her -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Maybe he won't count it -- okay, 
                        there he is... 

           The Beige Cutlass is parked on the street. A hairy arm rests 
           on the window, a cigarette burns between his fingers.

           Maria is visibly nervous... 

                                 MARIA
                        So, what’s the deal, he takes me to 
                        the doctor -- and brings me back?

           Jenny nods -- I guess so.

                                 JENNY
                        Remember, you can and will pull the 
                        plug if things aren’t right. 
                        Especially if that doctor tries 
                        anything, you walk out, hear me?

           Maria nods. Deep breath. And she walks off. 

           Jenny watches, then quickly enters the --

           CORNER STORE

           Where she has a view of Maria through a window...

           Jenny notices a SUNGLASSES RACK nearby. She pulls the first 
           pair, plops them on her face -- oversized, ornate, opaque.

           She watches through dark lenses as --

           NICK’S CAR

           Maria opens the creaky door, sits -- and we meet NICK. He’s 
           mid-30s -- kind eyes surrounded by mercenary attitude --

           He tosses a SLEEPING MASK in Maria’s lap.

                                 MARIA
                        I put this on?
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        Please -- I have to protect my 
                        doctor.

           Going with it, Maria slips the mask on --

                                 JENNY (O.C.)
                        What are you doing? 

           BAM! Jenny is at Nick’s window -- he startles.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        You never said anything about a 
                        mask -- what’s that for?

                                 NICK
                        How much do you trust this woman?

                                 JENNY
                        I trust her with my life.

                                 NICK
                        That’s good -- it could cost you 
                        that. Ten years, conspiracy to 
                        commit abortion. For my doctor it’s 
                        a murder charge.

                                 JENNY
                        What about her? Like she’s not 
                        scared enough --

           Maria puts the mask on --

                                 MARIA
                        It’s okay. I’m fine. Can we just 
                        get this over with?

           Nick and Jenny eye-fuck for a beat -- and she backs off. 

           Nick pulls the car away -- Jenny watches them. Then -- 

           She hails a waiting TAXI CAB. It pulls up to her -- 

           TAXI

           She hops inside -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Follow that Cutlass --

           NICK'S CAR (INTERCUT)

           Maria in Nick’s car -- just kinda going along with it.
       This is Jane

           Nick’s eyes are constantly moving, always on the lookout. He 
           adjusts his rear-view mirror and notices the taxi...

           TAXI

           Back in her taxi -- Jenny is hunkered down low...

           Nick’s eyes narrow -- stares at the taxi in the mirror. He 
           spots an opening in traffic, and cuts a hard left turn -- 

           Tires squeal. Maria grips her door --

                                 MARIA
                        What’s happening?

           Nick looks back to the taxi -- it’s gone.

                                 NICK
                        Nothing, just can’t be too careful.

           EXT. MOTEL - DAY

           Nick’s car parks in front of a room, first level. He exits, 
           walks to Maria’s door and helps her out -- guides her to the 
           room -- keys it open...

                                 NICK
                        Just wait inside, the doctor will 
                        be with you shortly.

           Maria nods, still blindfolded and enters -- 

           Click -- the door shuts behind her...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Maria waits alone -- senses alive.

           The room is dim. Sunlight creeps in around the blinds. We 
           hear traffic from outside. The window unit rattles --

           It’s a long wait -- yet Maria stands there, solid. Then --

           We reveal a MAN standing behind her. 

           He wears a white coat and a bright pink balaclava over his 
           head -- like a deranged bank robber.

           Maria doesn’t notice him -- he just stands there, staring at 
           her back for a good long serial killer beat and --

                                 PINK MASK
                        Hello.
       This is Jane

           Maria startles --

                                 MARIA
                        Oh. You scared me.

           TAXI

           The Taxi moves along, lost -- Jenny sees the Cutlass in the 
           hotel parking lot...

                                 JENNY
                        There it is -- Pull over here...

           She gets out, hands cash to the driver -- he pulls away -- 
           leaving her standing at the curb, staring at the motel...

           It’s one of those pay-by-the-hour joints -- unclean.

           She checks her watch and -- Fuck! 

           There’s a POLICE CAR, moving toward her on the street.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
               (quiet, to herself)
                        No reason to panic.

           Then -- the COP makes eye contact with her. Panic! No. Jenny 
           doesn’t panic -- she just nods and smiles.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Just nod and smile -- If they knew 
                        what you were up to, they would be 
                        the scared ones...

           The cop breaks character -- smiles back and waves.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s do this...

           Deep breath -- she crosses the street to investigate.

           MOTEL ROOM

           Inside it’s the opposite of what you might be imagining. 
           There's a radio playing soothing music. The doctor hums along 
           -- making nice conversation with Maria...

           Maria lays on the bed, legs up --

                                 PINK MASK
                        How are we doing, miss? Feeling 
                        anything? Any pain or anxiety?
       This is Jane

                                 MARIA
                        Nope, I’m fine, thank you.

                                 PINK MASK
                        That’s good, we’re almost done... 

           OUTSIDE

           Click. The door opens and we see Maria -- blindfolded.

                                 JENNY (O.C.)
                        Hey guys --

           Pink Mask sees Jenny standing outside, staring at him --

                                 PINK MASK
                        What the fuck?

           He shoves Maria out the door -- and slams it behind her.

                                 JENNY
                        I know it’s you, Nick! Come on out!

           She’s banging on the door -- it opens again --

                                 PINK MASK
                        Get in here.

           MOTEL ROOM

           Now we’re inside -- Maria still blindfolded.

                                 PINK MASK
                        What are you -- did you follow me?

                                 JENNY
                        Yes I followed you -- 

                                 PINK MASK
                        Why?

                                 JENNY
                        Because I don’t trust you -- and it 
                        looks like I was right.
               (then)
                        There’s no doctor is there -- 

                                 PINK MASK
                        You don’t know that.

                                 JENNY
                        Then why do you have a lab coat and 
                        a pink mask on?
       This is Jane

                                 MARIA
                        Can I take this off now?

                                 PINK MASK
                        No!

                                 JENNY
                        Maria -- has there been another man 
                        in here with you? Or just this guy?

                                 MARIA
                        I think just this guy -- what’s 
                        happening?

           Nick’s cover is blown -- he pulls his mask off.

                                 JENNY
                        I knew you were full of shit -- 
                        what doctor would work with a low-
                        life like you?

                                 NICK
                        Don’t get all high n’ mighty on me. 
                        Just because someone has an MD 
                        doesn’t make them Jesus.

           Jenny can’t disagree with that -- 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        And how am I a low-life? Did I not 
                        take good care of her?

           Jenny looks to Maria -- calming down...

                                 JENNY
                        Take the mask off, Maria --
               (she does)
                        How was he? And I want you to tell 
                        me honestly -- forget that he’s 
                        even here...

           Maria shrugs, almost hating to say it --

                                 MARIA
                        I thought he was good.

                                 JENNY
                        Good? Just good?

                                 MARIA
                        He was nice and gentle and a lot 
                        more talky than I thought he’d be.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Talky how? Like rude stuff? What 
                        did he say?

                                 MARIA
                        No, he was funny. The whole thing 
                        was so easy -- 

           Jenny is taken aback -- easy?

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You’re freaking me out way more 
                        than he did.

           EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY

           The three ride in Nick’s car -- Maria in the back, Jenny 
           riding shotgun -- all three in sunglasses. Gangster.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Back at the station. Jenny and Maria hop out --

                                 JENNY
                        I’ll follow up with you later...

           Maria nods -- the two hug -- then Maria walks off. 

           Jenny turns to the car. Nick’s arm dangles limply from the 
           window -- cigarette between his fingers. He wants his money.

           Jenny moves to him -- hands him the cash. 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        We’re one-fifty short --

           Nick registers that with a sideways glance -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’m good for it. I’ll 
                        get it to you next week.
               (then)
                        And I was wrong to call you a 
                        lowlife -- I’m sorry about that...

                                 NICK
                        It’s fine, I’m used to it -- just 
                        get me that one-fifty.

                                 JENNY
                        I’ll call you --
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        And keep your mouth shut about what 
                        happened today.

           They lock eyes for a serious beat -- and he rolls away.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           After hours. Desolate. The community phone on the wall 
           rings... and rings... and rings. Then -- 

           Claire pokes her head out the door -- what the hell?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hello?
               (then)
                        Yes, this is Claire --

           It hits Claire -- this person wants an abortion.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Who gave you this number?

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jenny folding clothes. RING! The phone -- she answers.

                                 JENNY
                        ‘Lo?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey, it’s me -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Hey -- just a second...

           Jenny checks over her shoulder -- sees Glen in the living 
           room, watching tube. She pulls the phone wire as far as it 
           goes into the kitchen --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t talk right now -- and 
                        shouldn’t, not from here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Can you get away?

                                 JENNY
                        I think so. Later. Where do you 
                        want to meet?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know, where do people go to 
                        talk about this kind of thing?
       This is Jane

           Jenny looks at the laundry on her table --

           INT. JENNY’S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           Loud machines. Claire watches Jenny -- who is looking at a 
           few INDEX CARDS.

                                 JENNY
               (reading the cards)
                        Gayla, 30 weeks, has ten dollars 
                        and gonorrhea -- 
               (flips to the next)
                        Sherrie. 28 years old. 10 weeks. 
                        Has a kid -- 
               (then)
                        Where’d you get these?

                                 CLAIRE
                        They called my dorm phone --

           WHAM! A man carrying a laundry basket walks in. The girls nod 
           at him, awkward --

                                 JENNY
                        Let’s go to the stairwell.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jenny and Claire -- huddled by the door.

                                 JENNY
                        This is illegal, Claire. Nick told 
                        us yesterday -- ten years...

                                 CLAIRE
                        We broke the law for men with their 
                        draft card bullshit. How is this 
                        any different? 

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t know -- it’s different. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s Nick like? Think he’ll go 
                        for it?

                                 JENNY
                        He’ll go for it all right --

                                 CLAIRE
                        How about the doc, did you see him?

           A hesitation here...
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        No, but he seems on the level...
               (then)
                        Maria was one thing, but this is a 
                        lot -- what if someone talks?

                                 CLAIRE
                        We won’t hear a peep -- you can 
                        hear it in their voices -- there’s 
                        this frightened little hesitation.
               (then, scared)
                        Hi - pause - I’m looking for 
                        Claire?

                                 JENNY
                        See? That's not good -- they know 
                        your name...

                                 CLAIRE
                        So, pick another one --

                                 JENNY
                        How about something sweet -- like 
                        fluffy... or Jane?

           A criminal grin creeps up on Claire’s mouth --

                                 CLAIRE
                        We’re outlaws now, Jane -- 
                        fugitives of the law.

           Unmoved. Jenny holds up the cards -- 

                                 JENNY
                        These four. That’s it.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny walks into her room -- opens a drawer -- pulls out her 
           envelope from the Baldwin procedure. There’s five hundred in 
           there -- she counts out a few bills and --

                                 NICK (PRE-LAP)
                        First things first.

           INT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Jenny’s kids are on the playground. Jenny sits on a bench 
           with Nick. Jenny slides an envelope to him -- cash.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t ever stiff me again.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        She was short -- she’s a college 
                        kid -- what do you want?

                                 NICK
                        You know, abortions are like mink 
                        coats. Lots of women want one, not 
                        everyone can afford one.

                                 JENNY
                        That’s disgusting what you just 
                        said. I want you to know that.

                                 NICK
                        Why am I here? To be insulted over 
                        a fair price that you agreed to?

                                 JENNY
                        Okay, let’s talk fair money -- I’ve 
                        got four more. I want you to do 
                        them for five hundred each.

                                 NICK
                        Your friend over there -- did you 
                        tell her about the doctor?

           He’s looking at Claire on a nearby bench -- 

                                 JENNY
                        That’s between you and me.

                                 NICK
                        What is she? Nineteen? I bet she 
                        knows a few women who need my 
                        services -- bring me ten and I’ll 
                        go down to five hundred.

                                 JENNY
                        You can do that many in a day?

                                 NICK
                        A good abortionist needs fifteen 
                        minutes, tops. 

                                 JENNY
                        So, how long does it take you?

           Nick glares at her -- funny.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we’ll bring you ten at five 
                        hundred -- plus another one with no 
                        money who you need to help out.
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        You’re smart girls -- you see the 
                        same opportunity I do. Why are you 
                        in the charity business? 
               (then)
                        We could be charging them more...

                                 JENNY
                        There’s a lot of women out there 
                        who can’t pay north-side prices.
               (then)
                        It’s ten for five with a freebie or 
                        we find someone else...

           Nick stews on that --

                        Saturday. Same time, same place.

           He rises and stalks away. Claire walks up to her --

                                 JENNY
                        He won’t do five hundred unless we 
                        can bring him ten women.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where are we gonna find that?

                        who calls --

           INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

           Claire walks a desolate hallway -- stops at a cork-board, 
           littered with flyers. She pulls out her own and staples it --

                 Pregnant? Need Help?
                 Call Jane 643-3844

           Our VOICE OVER MONTAGE ramps up...

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Claire is camped out, studying under her community phone -- 
           blankets, pillows -- The phone RINGS! She reaches up --

                        Usually from a single woman...

                        But sometimes it was a Mother, or 
                        even a husband...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes, it is -- do you know the date 
                        of your wife’s last period, sir?

           Claire starts writing on a 3x5 card...

           FRANKLIN PARK

           Again, Jenny watches her kids at the park -- 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Claire gave me a schedule with the 
                        ten women to talk to --
               (then)
                        I counseled them on what to expect 
                        from the doctor-- their questions 
                        were usually the same.

           Now we see a run of women -- meet KATE, a teenager.

                                 KATE
                        Will it hurt?

           Jump cut -- and another woman...

                                 WOMAN
                        Will I live through it?

           Jump cut -- and another woman...

                                 WOMAN #3
                        Will I be able to have children?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        You will absolutely be able to have 
                        children, ma’am...

           Jenny crosses off the first three names on her LIST...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        The ones who could pay full price 
                        got priority for Saturday.

                                  CUT TO:

           Now she’s talking to GLADYS, 40s, a woman in a mink coat --

                                 JENNY
                        Can you handle a thousand?

                                 GLADYS
                        Will you take a check?

           A headshake from Jenny -- no way.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        I tried to get extra from women who 
                        could afford it, so I could pass it 
                        down to ones who couldn’t.

                                  CUT TO:

           Now we see ABIGAIL -- a scared 15-year-old, all alone.

                                 ABIGAIL
                        I think I can get nine dollars. 
                        You’re not gonna tell my parents 
                        are you?

                                 JENNY
                        They can put a gun to my head -- I 
                        won’t tell them a thing.

           Jenny is dead serious here --

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        I was amazed by who came out when 
                        they heard about us.

                                  CUT TO:

           Next up, meet DEB and her husband, ED...

                                 DEB
                        This is my husband, Ed. 

           Ed issues a tacit nod to Jenny. She nods back...
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        A man supporting his wife’s 
                        abortion -- that was impressive...

                                  CUT TO:

           Now alone -- Jenny looks at her stack of cards.

                Sarah, 28, 8 weeks, $600

           Jenny looks up, notices a FEMALE POLICE OFFICER approaching! 

           She seizes up -- “oh no I’m caught.” 

                                 SARAH
                        Jane?

           Jenny remains stoic, hard... 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Um, don’t worry, I’m not here to 
                        bust you. I’m Sarah...

           Jenny peers over her sunglass -- you’ve got to be kidding me.

                                  CUT TO:

           Meet RICKY. 30. A proud black woman, close-cropped afro --

                                 RICKY
                        Listen, I should tell you, I got 
                        ties to the Black Panthers and the 
                        Weather Underground -- 
               (then)
                        You know what you’re doing here is 
                        crazy, right? I love it -- but this 
                        is some illegal activity...

           Jenny listens, wide-eyed, a little scared -- 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        When we got ten together we lined 
                        ‘em up for Nick on Saturday.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Jenny getting ready for her day --

                                 CASEY
                        No leave!

           Casey attacks her leg -- 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Saturday is daddy day, honey! Time 
                        to get jacked up on donuts!
               (then, to Glen)
                        Feed Audrey what I left you in the 
                        fridge -- Casey can eat the 
                        sandwich I made -- drop her off at 
                        Carol’s house at noon -- she lives 
                        on 56th, right past where the 
                        Hugheses used to live --

           Glen is confused, overwhelmed -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Casey knows where to go --

                                 GLEN
                        When are you coming home?

                                 JENNY
                        Don’t do this to me Glen -- it’s 
                        one day a weekend -- you get to 
                        chase your dreams all week -- 

           Kiss and she’s out the door...

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Same routine as before -- Ricky walks up to Jenny --

                                 JENNY
                        Good to go?

           Yup. Jenny points to Nick’s car -- cigarette dangling.

           INT. MOTEL - DAY

           Now we’re with Nick -- white coat, pink mask. He’s like a 
           different person in the mask -- humming a nice little tune.

           Ricky has her legs up while he works -- humming along.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Soon we we’re working Sundays -- 
                        and every weekend was a new hotel.

           TIME PASSES and we flash by a number of different hotel rooms 
           -- Nick and each woman are in the same position, but their 
           surroundings change from week to week.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        After a while, I got curious about 
                        how Nick did his thing -- I had to 
                        work him over a little bit, but 
                        eventually he let me in the room.

           Now we see Jenny sitting bedside, holding a woman’s hand --

                                 NICK
                        Hand me the curette, will ya?

           Jenny reaches in and holds a curette for the first time. She 
           gazes at it for a beat -- and hands it over to him...

           HOTEL BALCONY

           A cigarette dangles from Nick’s lip. FLICK! Jenny lights it --

                                 NICK
                        I need to find a source for drugs -- 

           Jenny pulls a 3x5 card and starts writing...

                                 JENNY
                        What do you need?

                                 NICK
                        Ergotrate, both pill and liquid, 
                        and Xylocaine -- see if you can 
                        find a friendly pharmacist...

           He sets his cigarette on the rail -- blood stains.

           INT. PHARMACY - STOCK ROOM - DAY

           Jenny and Ed, Deb’s husband. He’s a pharmacist. 

                                 ED
                        Soak the labels off so they can’t 
                        be traced back to me...

           He holds a bag -- Jenny peeks inside -- it’s loaded with 
           boxes of syringes and a bunch of small bottles...

                                 JENNY (PRE-LAP)
                        How come you don’t have a 
                        girlfriend, doc?

           HOTEL ROOM

           A masked WOMAN is on the bed, legs up. Jenny holds her hand.
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        Who says I don’t have a girlfriend? 
                        I have plenty of girlfriends -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Who? What are their names?

                                 NICK
                        Tiffany, Candice, Cinnamon...

                                 WOMAN
                        Those are stripper names --

                                 JENNY
                        Do you really date strippers?
               (then)
                        Come on, doc, you can do better --

           Nick fires an angry glare at Jenny -- he mouths, quiet.

                                 NICK
                        Come over here --

           Jenny cocks her head, huh? -- Nick insists.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        If you’re gonna be in here, you 
                        have to make yourself useful.
               (then)
                        Now what’s this?

           Nick holds up a curette -- a long, spoon-looking instrument.

                                 JENNY
                        It’s a medical thingy --

                                 NICK
                        It’s a curette -- can I borrow your 
                        hand for a second?

           Jenny reluctantly offers her hand up -- he takes it and runs 
           the metal blade against her palm. Jenny cringes, thinking 
           it’s going to hurt -- but it doesn’t...

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        See? Not sharp at all. Now, feel 
                        around her uterus, make sure it’s 
                        clean --

           All below frame -- Jenny takes the curette and moves it 
           around inside the woman. It’s easy until it hits something...

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Harder, pull toward you.
       This is Jane

           Jenny shakes her head -- 

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t want to hurt her.

           Nick rises and pushes her outta the way -- ticked off.

                                 NICK
                        Harder than it looks isn’t it?

           Jenny nods -- shamed, but also inspired.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        And when it was all done, Nick 
                        drove them back in his Cutlass.

           INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY

           Nick drives -- sunglasses, cigarette hanging out the window. 
           A WOMAN rides with a nice smile on her face. 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        The girls always appreciated how 
                        smooth that car was...

           CLOSE ON the car’s wheel absorbing bumps, potholes.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Claire and Jenny pow-wow...

                                 JENNY
                        Glen is starting to freak out -- I 
                        can’t stick him with the kids every 
                        weekend, we need help...

           Claire nods, okay...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Claire got Miriam to watch the 
                        train station while I helped Nick --

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Nick drops a woman off. She walks to Miriam -- 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        I did some research on infections 
                        and started giving out antibiotics.

           Miriam gives the woman a pill bottle, no label --

                                 MIRIAM
                        Take one a day until they’re gone. 
       This is Jane

           They hug -- the woman walks up the stairs to the train...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        And at the end of the day, Nick got 
                        his money...

           NICK'S CAR

           Jenny drops a brown package in Nick’s lap -- he motors off...

           INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT

           It’s poker night at the station. A dollar bill is thrown onto 
           a pile of money -- pull out to reveal a gaggle of cops 
           sitting around a desk... 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Come on, this isn’t the sandbox, 
                        O’Mally, minimum is five...

                                 COP
                        Did ya hear they’re straight-up 
                        advertising for abortions at the 
                        colleges now?

           A crumpled JANE FLYER is thrown on the pile --

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        What does that fall under, Sobchek? 
                        Vice or Homicide?

           Sobchek picks it up -- studies the flyer -- 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Where’d you get this?

           SOBCHEK’S DESK

           Later. Sobcheck picks up his phone -- dials the number.

           INT. CLAIRE'S DORM - HALLWAY - DAY (INTERCUT)

           RING! Claire’s dorm phone. A HALLMATE picks it up.

                                 HALLMATE
                        Hello?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        This is Detective Sobchek, Chicago 
                        PD -- is Jane there?

           The hallmate seizes up -- Slam! Hangs up on him.
       This is Jane

           CLAIRE'S DORM - HALLWAY

           Claire walks out of the stairwell to find Sobchek standing by 
           the phone with her RA -- she stops, startled.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Jane?

           He’s talking to Claire, but she doesn't react -- she just 
           walks on by, maybe a friendly nod, keys her door.

                                 SOBCHEK (CONT’D)
                        Jane? Is that your name?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you talking to me?

           Claire is keeping herself very together here -- 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Yes, are you Jane?

                                 RA
                        I told you, there’s no Jane here.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Do you know anyone named Jane?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. Don’t think so.

           Claire keys her door and walks inside -- 

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jenny and Claire with Sarah -- the cop from earlier...

                                 SARAH
                        Your phone is tapped.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I told you!

                                 JENNY
                        Stop it, you’re the one who wanted 
                        to be an outlaw -- act like one.
               (then)
                        How do we shake him?

                                 SARAH
                        First thing, that phone is burned. 
                        After that, you need help from 
                        someone in the underground.
       This is Jane

           Jenny lifts an eyebrow -- underground, huh?

           INT. THE FRONT - DAY

           Jenny, Claire and Ricky walk an empty apartment -- you can 
           almost smell the latex and bleach...

                                 GLADYS (O.C.)
                        All new paint, new carpet, new 
                        appliances. Ready to move in --

           We reveal the landlord -- it’s Gladys, the mink coat lady.

                                 RICKY
                        This is where you set your office, 
                        take calls, counsel, make a waiting 
                        room for runs to the doc.

           We see Ricky peer out the window -- a nice secluded street.

                                 RICKY (CONT’D)
                        This is perfect -- off the beaten 
                        path, so the driver can get in and 
                        out without people noticing --

           The three women nod -- this is good.

                                 JENNY
                        This is amazing, Gladys, but we 
                        can’t afford a place like this --

                                 GLADYS
                        Just pay what you can --

           CLOSE ON -- Jenny signs the lease...

                  Susan B. Anthony

           INT. THE FRONT - DAY

           We see WOMEN carrying mismatched furniture into the room --

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Miriam rounded up every radical 
                        woman she knew and stocked the 
                        joint with second-hand furniture, 
                        telephones, curtains. 

           KITCHEN

           Miriam walks the kitchen -- surveys the landscape. 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        She even got the kitchen up and 
                        running to cook for us on Saturday.

           She stocks the place with utensils and cookware --

           OFFICE

           A pink princess phone RINGS. Kate picks it up -- 

                                 KATE
                        Hello? This is Jane -- 

           Miriam slides 3x5 CARDS to her. She begins writing --

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Kate joined up when her boyfriend 
                        told the kids at school her secret.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           A laughing Kate is lead by her boyfriend and a group of guys 
           to a bathroom stall -- it opens to reveal -- 

           A rancid piece of meat dangling from a coat hanger. 

           Her face falls...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        She didn’t go back for weeks --

           Kate rushes out the bathroom door -- crying...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Kate’s Mom kicked her out of the 
                        house when she found out. 

           OFFICE - NIGHT

           We see Kate in her floor space living area -- a sleeping bag, 
           flashlight, backpack with clothes, books...

           OFFICE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: The lonely phone rings at night -- then it stops.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        When I told Nick we were missing 
                        calls at night, he lost his mind -- 

           OFFICE - DAY

           Nick waddles in carrying a massive 1960s answering machine. 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        We needed to fill Nick’s weekly 
                        quota -- and not with every poor 
                        lamb off the street. Nick wanted 
                        paying customers --

           Kate pushes the button -- tape reels spin...

                                 WOMAN
               (answering machine)
                        Hi Jane -- I need help -- I’m six 
                        weeks along -- age 26 -- 

           Kate writes the info down -- makes a bigger stack of cards...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        With that many women coming in I 
                        had to recruit more counsellors...

           LIVING ROOM

           A meeting, 10-15 women, sitting on the floor arguing. 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        There was Miriam and Ruth -- 
               (then)
                        And Sarah the cop -- 
               (then)
                        And Deb whose pharmacist husband 
                        had a car -- 
               (then)
                        Maria had such a good experience 
                        with Nick she joined up, too --
               (then)
                        And then there was Karen -- we 
                        called her ‘Fertile Myrtle’ because 
                        of all the times she got pregnant --

                                 KAREN
                        I told her ‘Infection? That's not 
                        an infection. That's nothing, I've 
                        had that before, it's nothing.

           We see a massive stack of reject cards -- 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        The freebie was always a fight. It 
                        was always ‘this girl has no 
                        money,’ ‘this girl is abused,’ 
                        there were a million sob stories --
               (then)
                        It always hurt to turn them away.
       This is Jane

                                 MIRIAM
                        Okay, that’s it!

           Miriam sets the eleventh card down -- and the montage ends...

                                 CLAIRE (PRE-LAP)
                        I can’t do this anymore.

           EXT. THE FRONT - DAY

           Jenny and Claire -- this is awkward...

                                 JENNY
                        What? What do you mean? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m pregnant, Jenny --

           Oh. Jenny stops herself --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Me and Phil are getting hitched 
                        next week-- and then we’re moving 
                        to New York.

                                 JENNY
                        Congratulations, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re gonna have to step away, too 
                        -- you can’t do this forever...

           Jenny nods, noncommittal. The co-conspirators embrace --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go to a movie sometime -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Butch and Sundance is playing at 
                        the Music Box -- 

           Claire smiles, perfect -- and leaves Jenny alone.

           INT. CLAIRE'S DORM - NIGHT

           Claire is at home, studying. The phone rings!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hello?

           We hear Jenny on the other end --

                                 JENNY (O.S.)
                        There’s an emergency at the Front.
       This is Jane

           EXT. THE FRONT - NIGHT

           Claire runs up to the door -- it opens before she can knock.

                                 JANES
                        SURPRISE!

           Claire’s face twists with horror and confusion, shocked by 
           what she sees -- a dozen women, some familiar, some strange --

           Claire lists backward -- women grab her arms!

                                  CUT TO:

           Wine glasses, highballs and club soda for Claire -- the Janes 
           throw a tasteful little cocktail party.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Eventually, Maria went off to 
                        medical school and Kate went back 
                        home to her Mother -- 

           Then -- from the exterior we look through the window at the 
           silhouette of dancing, drinking and hugging... good times.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        But there was never a shortage of 
                        volunteers. Women who went through 
                        Jane were inspired to help...

           INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Glen is at work, hacking away at his calculator -- old school 
           accountant decor. His phone rings.

                                 GLEN
                        Patterson.

           Now we cut to the other side of this conversation. 

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - DAY (INTERCUT)

           It’s the babysitter -- KELLY.

                                 KELLY
                        Hi, Mr. Patterson? This is Kelly.

           Glen takes a second -- why is Kelly calling me? 

                                 GLEN
                        Hi, Kelly. What’s up?
       This is Jane

                                 KELLY
                        Can you come home? I gotta go and I 
                        can’t reach Mrs. Patterson --

                                 GLEN
                        Wait a second, are you at my place?

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - DAY

           Glen has Casey in his arms, closing the door on Kelly -- 

                                 GLEN
                        Thank you for calling -- I’m sorry 
                        about this...

           Now he’s with Casey -- one on one.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s mommy, honey? Do you know 
                        where she went?

                                 CASEY
                        Mommy’s at the Front!

           INT. THE FRONT - DAY

           It’s fucking bananas. The waiting room is packed. Children, 
           women and men are there. Lots of loud conversation.

           KITCHEN

           Where Miriam is pulling a big pot roast from the oven. She’s 
           got her daughter Ruth in there helping -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Tell everyone lunch is ready.

                                 RUTH
                        A please would be nice...

           DINING ROOM

           Full-on family meal here. There’s 15 people chowing down on 
           Miriam’s roast and fixins. People talking, passing food -- 

           Deb walks in with the WOMAN she just picked up...

                                 DEB
                        That neighbor next door is getting 
                        awfully nosey. She saw us again --

           OFFICE

           RING! The answering machine -- CLICK -- tape reels spin...
       This is Jane

                                 SARAH
               (answering machine)
                        Janes! It's your friend downtown -- 
                        Code blue!! Code blue!!!

           DINING ROOM

           Miriam barely hears from the dining room -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Wait, wait -- shut up everyone!

           The room quiets -- we hear Sarah faintly in the background.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Code fucking blue! Everyone out!

           The whole apartment immediately goes into shut-down mode. 
           Everyone drops what they’re doing and evacuates, rounds up 
           the reception area and clearing it out.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           And we catch up with Jenny... she’s in the middle of a 
           procedure -- she’s moving the curette around.

                                 NICK
                        Harder, you’re still too gentle.

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t want to hurt her -- 

                                 NICK
                        You can’t be afraid to cause pain, 
                        or you won’t do the job right.

           RING! The phone rings. Nick picks it up --

                                 MIRIAM (O.S.)
                        Code blue.

                                 NICK
                        Code blue. She’s on her way.

           Jenny snaps her gloves off --

           INT. THE FRONT - DAY

           Jenny keys the door -- the Front has been evacuated -- we see 
           Miriam and Ruth who are putting on their coats --
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
               (sarcastic)
                        No, no guys take your time -- it’s 
                        only the police.

           Jenny walks to the ANSWERING MACHINE, takes the tape reels -- 

           Then -- POLICE SIRENS in the distance -- time to go.

           She opens the front door and gets the shock of her life -- 
           it’s Glen and the kids. Fuck!

                                 GLEN
                        What are you doing here? You were 
                        supposed to watch the kids today.

                                 JENNY
                        I’ll explain later, walk --

           EXT. THE FRONT - DAY

           Jenny and Glen walk with the children as a massive fleet of 
           police cars passes them -- Glen watches them, worried...

           Jenny doesn’t react -- she’s cool. 

           INT. THE FRONT - DAY

           A couple of cops escort Gladys to Sobchek -- 

                                 GLADYS
                        You have the wrong address. There 
                        are no abortions happening here.

           She carries the LEASE with her. Sobchek takes it...

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Susan B. Anthony. Run it, see if 
                        anything comes up...

           Gladys stifles a laugh -- 

           EXT. THE FRONT - DAY

           Later -- things have calmed down. Jenny and Sarah -- on a 
           park bench -- sunglasses and kerchiefs -- unrecognizable.

                                 JENNY
                        Do you know who made the call?

                                 SARAH
                        Angry boyfriend -- said his child 
                        was being murdered -- gave us the 
                        address and everything. 
       This is Jane

           Jenny’s eyes narrow, watching Sobchek walk out of the front -- 
           pissed off, barking orders. 

                                 JENNY
                        Who’s that guy? He in charge?

                                 SARAH
                        That’s Sobcheck -- works homicide.

           Jenny watches him carefully -- her new nemesis...

                                 JENNY
                        How’s your cover downtown?

                                 SARAH
                        Not good. There’s gonna be a mole 
                        hunt and I need to lay low --

           Jenny nods -- extends a hand. Sarah slaps it -- solid.

           Then -- from high up from a nearby rooftop we see a TELEPHOTO 
           SHOT of Jenny and Sarah as they split up. Reveal -- 

           A PHOTOGRAPHER is snapping away -- click-whir-click-click...

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Jenny and Glen face off...

                                 JENNY
                        I know you’re angry, but let me 
                        just say this -- I am so relieved 
                        that this is out in the open.

                                 GLEN
                        Oh, good, great -- 

                                 JENNY
                        You don’t understand because you 
                        don’t see their faces when they 
                        come out --
               (then)
                        They don’t know what they’re in 
                        for, they don’t know if they’ll 
                        survive. And when they see just how 
                        simple it is, it changes their 
                        lives.

                                 GLEN
                        Do you really think the police are 
                        just gonna let you break the law 
                        because these women are smiling? 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Yes. They should. Imagine life 
                        without me, Glen. What would that 
                        be like? It would be this all day -- 
                        everyday. You and the kids and a 
                        nanny and no me...
               (then)
                        That’s what you were facing if I 
                        played by the rules.

           Glen starts to talk --

                                 GLEN
                        I know what you went through. 

                                 JENNY
                        No you don’t, not everything. 

                                 GLEN
                        What are you saying?

                                 JENNY
                        I’m saying I need help --

           Jenny grabs her bag and pulls out a big roll of cash --

                                 GLEN
                        What is this?

                                 JENNY
                        It’s money for antibiotics, and 
                        rent, and gas, hotels, train fare -- 
                        all this stuff I had no idea I’d be 
                        paying for --

                                 GLEN
                        Wait a second -- are you asking me 
                        to become Al Capone’s accountant?

                                 JENNY
                        Yes -- please?

                                 GLEN
                        Jenny. Can we just stop this right 
                        now and go back to nightsticks and 
                        tear gas?

                                 JENNY
                        You think I don’t want my life 
                        back? I do, but I can’t leave these 
                        women to the underground. They need 
                        a place to go or the bad guys win.
       This is Jane

                                 GLEN
                        Who are the bad guys in this story?

                                 JENNY
                        Well, you if you don’t help out.

                                 GLEN
                        With your illegal abortion service.

                                 JENNY
                        Civil disobedient abortion service.

           Jenny moves slowly toward Glen --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s kinda sexy, actually -- Al 
                        Capone’s accountant. I like that.

           Glen does a little freak out dance... 

                                 GLEN
                        Drop out now or your daughters will 
                        grow up without their mother --

                                 JENNY
                        We’re gonna do this, you’re gonna 
                        help me pull it off and none of us 
                        are going to jail. I promise.

           KITCHEN

           The money has been sorted into a cash-drawer, receipts are 
           rubber-banded and Glen is punching on his adding machine.

                                 GLEN
                        Drugs are logged in the “produce” 
                        column, that’s a business expense.

           Jenny writes on the LEDGER -- ‘produce.’ Big smile.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

           Kids in tow, Jenny walks up granite stairs into the --

           INT. CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Jenny hits the newspaper archives -- flipping past articles --

           We land on a photo -- taken at a ceremony that honored 
           Sobchek. We see Sobchek and family -- and focus in on his 
           daughter. The caption below reads... 

                  ABIGAIL SOBCHEK
       This is Jane

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - DAY

           Jenny digs through her old cards and pulls one out -- 

               Abigail, 16, 8 weeks, $50

           Sobchek’s daughter has been through Jane...

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s clean-up-after-dinner time -- Jenny works alone -- 
           scrubbing dishes in the sink. RING! It’s the phone...

           Jenny pulls off rubber gloves, pushes a stray hair back --

                                 JENNY
                        Hello?

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT (INTERCUT)

           Nick on the phone, talking to Jenny --

                                 NICK
                        I got a house call tonight -- can 
                        you come assist?

                                 JENNY
                        Are you admitting I’m useful?

                                 NICK
                        I’m admitting that you have another 
                        opportunity to learn from the best.
               (then)
                        Do you want to come or not?

           Jenny looks at the pile of dishes -- should I?

           LIVING ROOM

           Jenny walks out, overcoat wrapped tight -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Can you do me a favor and finish in 
                        the kitchen, I have to make a run.

           She sees Glen -- he’s smoking a joint by the window...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Really? With the kids sleeping in 
                        the next room?

           Glen deadpans her -- yeah whatever -- 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Just -- put that away and wash the 
                        dishes, will you?
               (then)
                        I’ll be back in an hour.

           INT. CICERO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           There's a radio playing soothing music -- Nick works on a 
           woman, let’s call her VANESSA. Jenny holds her hand --

                                 NICK
                        So, you’re gonna be proud of me.

                                 JENNY
                        God help us all -- what is it?

                                 NICK
                        I have a real date tomorrow night.

                                 JENNY
                        Well, well -- that’s incredible, 
                        Nick. Is she a stripper?

           Nick nods -- Jenny sighs.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        You know you’re being played right?

                                 NICK
                        No, Jenny -- this is real.

                                 JENNY
                        That’s the stripper’s game -- they 
                        appeal to your sexist nature and 
                        then prey upon your emotions.

                                 NICK
                        I think that might be the most 
                        sexist thing I’ve ever heard -- 

           Then, our patient Vanessa pipes up --

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s right -- you’re wrong about 
                        strippers -- we’re humans, too.

           Whoops. Nick just shakes his head --

                                 NICK
                        Feel around make sure she’s clean.

           Nick tosses a cigarette in his mouth -- Jenny lights it, he 
           walks outside. Jenny takes his seat and confidently resumes --
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Sorry about that, Vanessa --

           Jenny and Nick -- post-work drink...

                        I’m just trying to look out for 
                        you, you know, ‘cause you’re 
                        actually not that bad a guy --

                                 NICK
                        Oh, yeah -- how’s that?

                                 JENNY
                        I mean, look at you -- underneath 
                        that pink mask you’re a mess.

                                 NICK
                        Okay, Henry Higgins, I’m calling 
                        your bluff, we’re going shopping --

                                 JENNY
                        It’s gonna take more that a trip to 
                        Marshall Fields to fix you -- 

                                 NICK
                        Come on -- I don’t have to date 
                        strippers, you know -- I just don’t 
                        meet any other women.

                        Outside of work, that is...

                                 JENNY
                        Well, if you try anything on any of 
                        my girls, I’ll cut you --

           Jenny finishes her drink -- then notices something strange. 
           Nick is looking at her... strangely. They lock eyes --

                                 NICK
                        What do you think?

                                 JENNY
                        About what?

           His non-response says it all. Jenny looks into his eyes and 
           we see a change in her. She becomes transfixed -- and for a 
           beat we think -- whoa, are these two about to kiss?

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Not only no. Hell no. Not in your 
                        wildest dreams are we going there.
       This is Jane

           Nick slinks inside his shirt -- so embarrassed...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you would even --

                                 NICK
                        Okay, okay -- I get it, I’m sorry --
               (then)
                        So, are we done with this?

                                 JENNY
                        What do you mean?

                                 NICK
                        You know, working together --

                                 JENNY
                        Hell, no -- I’m just drawing the 
                        line right here, right now -- 

           Then -- she defiantly downs the rest of his drink. Yuck.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s gross, Nick. Really.

           And she walks out. Nick looks to the bartender -- 

                                 NICK
                        Another, please.

           Let’s kick in some soothing montage tunes and -- 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Jenny and Nick walk an aisle stacked with medical books...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        He decided to bring me on more 
                        house calls since our Jane 
                        Saturdays were packed -- 

           He pulls down a copy of ESSENTIALS OF GENERAL SURGERY...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        The more house calls we did, the 
                        more responsibility he gave me --

           Jenny drops a stack of thick medical books on the counter --

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        The first thing he taught me was 
                        simple -- knock on the door...

                                  CUT TO:
       This is Jane

           EXT. WOMAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jenny knocks on a door. The woman answers. Jenny smiles, 
           introduces herself, settles her nerves...

           INT. WOMAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           She walks the apartment -- checks rooms, closets, beds...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        I got the cash up front -- and 
                        prepped the bedroom for Nick.

           The woman hands a thick envelope to Jenny...

           BEDROOM

           Jenny spreads a heavy plastic sheet over the bed...

           The patient lays down on top of it...

           Jenny helps her adjust the sleeping mask...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Once everything was set-up -- I 
                        called him inside.

           LIVING ROOM

           Jenny goes to the window -- and waves to Nick outside.

           BEDROOM

           Jenny holds the woman’s hand while she watches him as he 
           charms his way through the procedure.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        Nick was fast and sure-handed -- 
                        exactly the way I wanted to be...

           INT. WOMAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Now we’re in a new woman’s house -- Jenny and Nick have 
           swapped seats... he holds the patient’s hand...

                                 JENNY
                        What am I looking at?

                                 NICK
                        You know this from your reading --
               (then)
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        That’s the speculum, that’s the 
                        curette, you’re inside the 
                        uterus... See what it looks like in 
                        the picture?

           He’s pointing to a nearby open medical book -- 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        That’s what it feels like in there.

           Then we see her using the tool -- all below frame. Then -- 

           The woman winces and seizes up.

                                 JENNY
                        I’m hurting her -- I can’t do this.

                                 NICK
                        No, you can’t be afraid to cause 
                        pain or you won’t do the job right.
               (then, to the girl)
                        Love the pain, eat through the pain 
                        -- think about what you’re gonna do 
                        with your life after today.

                                 WOMAN
                        My mother is going to be so mad --

                                 NICK
                        Your mother is not here right now --

           He nods for Jenny to continue -- and she does, looking way 
           more confident. Nick nods at Jenny, a flicker of admiration. 

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        All I could think was this is the 
                        way it should be. Someone who 
                        cares, who knows what they’re doing 
                        -- working in warm friendly place.

           All done. Nick collects the instruments...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        No more no-tell-motels -- 

           Nick walks into the bathroom and runs the water...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        No more apartments where mothers 
                        and fathers and husbands could 
                        spring out from under the bed.

           And then he walks out with a nod to Jenny...
       This is Jane

           Jenny helps the woman up, removes the mask...

           Escorts her to the bathroom, leaves her in there...

           Removes the plastic sheet and remakes the bed...

           Hugs -- and Jenny’s gone, too.

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        These women needed a trusted place 
                        where other women control who comes 
                        in and out.

           EXT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Now we see Jenny walking down the street --

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Hey Jane...

           Jenny whips her head around to see -- a COP! He’s leaning 
           against the wall -- staring straight at her. 

                                 JENNY
                        Are you talking to me?

           Then -- a WOMAN walks in from off-camera -- she hugs the cop 
           and they walk off together...

           Jenny watches them -- ghost white...

                                 JENNY (V.O.)
                        But as long as the police were 
                        after us that dream would have to 
                        wait...

           INT. MARSHALL FIELD - DAY

           Nick walks out of the changing room, near unrecognizable --

           He looks like a 60s radical -- Willy Wonka meets young Allen 
           Ginsberg. Bright colored hippie shirt, tweed jacket, slacks --

                                 NICK
                        Are you kidding me with this?

                                 JENNY
                        Stand up straight, your posture 
                        sucks. And put these on --

           She hands him a pair of Ray Bans -- he puts them on. 

           Then -- from off-camera...
       This is Jane

                                 KATE
                        Jane?

           Jenny turns. Kate is walking toward them.

                                 JENNY
                        Oh, hey Kate! What’s up?

           Jenny turns to Nick --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
               (whispering)
                        You’re Glen, okay?

           Okay. Jenny turns back -- and the two women hug.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        So, how have you been? 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, I’ve been good -- you know, 
                        back to school. Well, new school.

           Yeah -- Jenny remembers...

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t think you’ve met my husband 
                        Glen, have you?

                                 KATE
                        Hey.

                                 JENNY
                        Kate and I used to work together.

                                 NICK
                        Hey. Nice to meet you --

                                 KATE’S MOM (O.C.)
                        Kate?

           Kate seizes up. A woman walks to them -- cautious.

                                 KATE
                        I gotta go --

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        Who’s this?

                                 KATE
                        It’s nothing Mom -- let’s go, I 
                        just met these people...
       This is Jane

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        How do you know my daughter?

           Jenny and Nick -- uncomfortable glance.

                                 JENNY
                        Um, like she said, we just met. 
               (then, to Nick)
                        Let’s go, honey...

           Her Mom sizes them up -- parental intuition kicking in.

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        You’re those people, aren’t you? 
                        You’re Jane --

           Jenny’s looks says it all -- she’s caught. 

                                 KATE
                        Mom, no don’t do this --

           Kate’s mom lifts Kate’s arm up and pulls down her sleeve --

           Kate’s arm is bandaged, wrist to elbow -- heavily.

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        Do you realize you did this to her?

           The image is shocking. Jenny and Kate lock eyes -- all 
           pretenses gone. Jenny doesn’t know what to say --

                                 KATE’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        This is what happens when you give 
                        young girls abortions -- they get 
                        depressed and kill themselves.

                                 KATE
                        Mom, I told you, it’s not them -- 

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        I know when you’re lying, Kate --
               (then)
                        Tell me, how far along was she? 
                        Eight weeks? Twenty four? Nine 
                        months? Is that what you do? Tear 
                        whole babies out of wombs?

                                 NICK
                        You’re out of line, ma’am.

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        I’m out of line? She’s the one --
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        No, she didn’t do anything -- I’m 
                        the one that did her abortion.

                                 JENNY
                        No, Nick -- please stop...

                                 NICK
                        No, if she wants to make a scene, 
                        let’s make a scene! Let’s tell the 
                        whole world about Kate’s secret!

           His tone and volume alert the passersby -- Nick goes on...

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        She was very confident in her 
                        decision -- I know ‘cause I asked.

                                 KATE’S MOM
                        What are you talking about --

                                 NICK
                        Did you hear what her boyfriend did 
                        to her? How he humiliated her at 
                        school?

           No one’s ever spoken to her like this before.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        That’s not a man any girl needs to 
                        be intertwining their genes with.

           Kate’s Mom pushes her to the exit -- 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Be a mother! Support your daughter 
                        instead of shaming her!

           Kate breaks away for a moment and glances back at Nick and 
           Jenny. There’s an unsaid connection between them -- 

           Then she turns and follows her Mother out -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Nice work, buddy --

           INT. MOTEL - DAY

           It’s another Saturday -- Nick is counting money...

                                 NICK
                        Jenny, you can’t keep taking these 
                        girls with no money. This isn’t 
                        half of what you owe me for today --
       This is Jane

           His tone is softer now -- more forgiving.

                                 JENNY
                        The girls don’t have it -- New York 
                        just legalized, the price there is 
                        a hundred for a medical abortion. 
               (then)
                        Add a hundred for a bus ticket and 
                        you’ve been undercut by four bills.

           Nick looks at the blindfolded girl on the bed...

                                 NICK
                        And she’s your free one?

           Jenny nods -- feeling really bad about all this...

                               TIME CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL - DAY

           Pink Mask Nick working on the woman -- Jenny holds her hand. 
           Things are oddly quiet between -- strained.

           Then -- we hear a BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Pounding at the door.

              NICK
                               JENNY
           Oh, shit...
                        Oh, shit...

           The two partners eye-fuck -- who the hell is that? 

           WHAM! The door flies open and MEN flood the room -- but it’s 
           not the cops like we might expect... It’s the mafia.

           The woman they’re working on -- she’s young, very frightened 
           and very vulnerable. She backs herself to the headboard...

                                 MAFIA THUG
                        Hey! Nice mask, buddy -- 

           The men grab Nick’s arms and pin them behind his back. One of 
           them rips his pink balaclava off -- 

                                 MAFIA THUG (CONT’D)
                        Hiya Nick, good to see you again.

           Jenny locks eyes with Nick -- 

                                 JENNY
                        What the hell is this? You know 
                        these guys?
       This is Jane

                                 MAFIA THUG
                        Oh yeah, we’re old friends -- he 
                        thought he could do his little 
                        thing out here without us knowing --
               (then)
                        I hope you brought money, Nick.

           Nick seethes -- so pissed at himself...

                                 MAFIA THUG (CONT’D)
                        No? Well that’s just a shame -- 

           The thug rubs his hand along the girl’s thigh. She recoils...

                                 MAFIA THUG (CONT’D)
                        I feel for you, I really do. You 
                        seem like you’re in a really tricky 
                        position right now.
               (then)
                        Look, I don’t wanna ruin your day, 
                        but this is gonna take a lotta work 
                        to make go away.

           Jenny tosses the cash envelope on the bed. The thug sees it -- 
           opens and peeks inside. Thumbs through the cash --

                                 MAFIA THUG (CONT’D)
                        This is a good start, miss, but 
                        Nicky here owes us a lot more, 
                        don’t you buddy?
               (then)
                        How many of these little operations 
                        you think you’ve done this year?
               (then)
                        A hundred? A thousand?

           The thug nods to his boys, who twist Nick’s arm and force his 
           hand to the floor.

                                 MAFIA THUG (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t we take a down payment --

           Then -- he stomps his boot on Nick’s hand. 

           CRACK! Nick howls in pain -- 

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Ice -- lots of it -- wrapped around Nick’s hand. 

                                 JENNY
                        Let me see it...

           Jenny unwraps the bandage -- it’s swollen and red.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        This is broken. You have to go to 
                        the hospital.

           Flick! Glen lights up a joint, passes it to Nick -- 

                                 NICK
                        Gracias mi amigo. Not a chance, I’m 
                        catching a flight outta here. 

                                 JENNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 NICK
                        That’s how the underground works -- 
                        you wanna do something illegal, you 
                        gotta pay tribute. If you don’t pay 
                        and get caught? You skip town.

                                 JENNY
                        Why don’t you just pay them?

                                 NICK
                        ‘Cause it’s a lot. It’s more and 
                        more all the time and I don’t want 
                        to raise the price on your little 
                        feminist crusade, okay?

           Jenny takes the joint from Glen and gives it to Nick.

                                 JENNY
               (to Glen)
                        Can’t you see the man’s in pain?

           Nick puffs, exhales a huge cloud -- licks his fingers, 
           extinguishes the joint, pockets it...

                                 NICK
                        See you around kid.

                                 JENNY
                        No, no, no -- you can’t leave -- 
                        what about the stripper?

                                 NICK
                        She’ll probably come with me. She’s 
                        tired of Chicago anyway -- wants to 
                        move to LA.

                                 JENNY
                        You can’t start a new life now -- 
                        we have too many cases lined up!
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        Well, tell it to Joe Campisi ‘cause 
                        he’s got other ideas that involve 
                        murdering me...
               (then)
                        Adios, Glen! Thanks for the MJ.

           A nod from Glen. Nick picks up his bag -- and leaves.

                                 GLEN
                        Did he just take my last joint?

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jenny and Miriam on the stairs -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        What do we tell the group?

                                 JENNY
                        I say we tell them nothing. This 
                        isn’t about being an MD, it’s about 
                        being safe and secret --
               (then)
                        If we get busted it’s not like they 
                        tack on less years because he’s an 
                        MD. It’s the same sentence.

                                 MIRIAM
                        They deserve to know -- we’ve been 
                        telling people he’s a doctor.

                                 JENNY
                        What it says to me is the medical 
                        community is a fallacy -- if a con-
                        man can do this many this safely? 
                        Anyone can --
               (then)
                        Even me.

           Jenny is searching Miriam’s eyes -- testing her.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Are you really thinking about --

                                 JENNY
                        What if I am? Wouldn’t it be 
                        amazing? If one of us could do it? 
                        We could charge whatever we want 
                        and cut men out altogether --

                                 MIRIAM
                        Do you even know how to do it?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Nick has been showing me --

                                 MIRIAM
                        Jenny, that’s crazy talk -- 

                                 JENNY
                        How many do we have backed up?

           Miriam holds her thumb and forefinger about an inch apart -- 
           about a hundred index cards worth...

           Jenny struggles -- wondering if she can do them herself...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        We should think about it -- unless 
                        you have any leads on a new Nick?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Does the mafia tax French doctors?

           EXT. SOUTHSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Jenny walks the street with a young woman -- let’s call her 
           DELORES. They come upon a brownstone -- she checks the 
           address against what she has written down.

                                 JENNY
                        This is it --

           The two exchange an ominous glance -- 

           INT. BROWNSTONE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jenny knocks on a door -- it opens and there he is, FRENCHIE. 
           Late 50s. Brilliance and grace amidst the shambles of his 
           surroundings. He smiles big and friendly.

                                 FRENCHIE
                        Hello, are you Jane?

           And speaks with a French accent. Jenny nods, feeling better.

           INT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frenchie’s hands caress a small tea kettle. We follow it as 
           he pours a cup for Delores. The place is warm, cozy.

                                 FRENCHIE
                        Drink that when you’re ready --

           Delores reaches for the cup, sniffs it -- bitter.
       This is Jane

                                 DELORES
                        What is this?

                                 FRENCHIE
                        Cohosh tea. Makes things easier.

           Delores nods, grits through it and drinks.

                                 FRENCHIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, sit tight. Let that work it’s 
                        way through your system.
               (then)
                        I’ll prepare the room...

           Frenchie walks off.

           Jenny casts a side-eye glance to a boiling pot nearby. 

           Inside are long scary needles. 

           BEDROOM

           Now we’re in Frenchie’s procedure room. It’s a far cry from 
           the way Nick works. No masks, no blindfolds, everything is 
           out in the open... and silent. Mostly.

           Jenny watches from the door as Frenchie draws a long needle 
           from his bag -- she cringes at the sight.

                                 JENNY
                        What are you gonna do with that?

           He ignores her. Frenchie wipes the needle down with a cloth 
           and moves it into position -- and inserts carefully.

                                 DELORES
                        Oww, oww, oww, oww... What are you 
                        doing down there?

           Frenchie’s face falls -- something’s not right -- he pulls 
           the needle out -- blood streaks...

           He gathers his tools, stands and tries to leave --

                                 JENNY
                        Wait, why are you leaving -- what 
                        did you do to her?

           Jenny blocks his way -- he panics! 

           Sees the window and fire escape, runs to it and dives out! 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        You fucking coward?!
       This is Jane

           INT. TAXI CAB - DAY

           Reckless driving through Chicago in a Taxi. 

                                 JENNY
                        Delores, wake up, wake up!

           She’s passed out in the backseat. Her skirt is soaked in 
           blood -- it’s on Jenny’s hands, it’s everywhere...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Drive faster, she’s dying!

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           The cab pulls up, skids to a stop -- Jenny pulls the woman 
           out of the car, throws cash at the driver... he speeds off.

           Jenny shoulders Delores into the ER -- a DOCTOR runs to her. 

                                 JENNY
                        It was a bad abortion. You have to 
                        treat her -- don’t let her die! 

           The orderlies push her aside and lift Delores on to the 
           stretcher. The Doc looks at her injuries -- 

           Jenny backs away -- the doctor notices her bloody hands.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Stay right where you are... 

           The ER Doctor gestures to a nearby POLICE OFFICER -- he 
           approaches Delores...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Do you have a name?! Who did this?!

                                 JENNY
                        She doesn’t know his name! They 
                        don’t give out their real names!

           The girl is listless, barely conscious. Jenny hesitates, 
           watching the doctors just stand there -- 

           Jenny goes to a nearby nurse -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Will you please say something?!

           No way. The nurse knows better than that. Then --

           Delores’s body convulses violently -- the medical team swarms 
           her, unable to do anything. 
       This is Jane

           The cop stares Jenny down...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        It was a guy named Nick! Nick 
                        Venturini! Just save her!

           The cop writes the name down and nods for the doctors to 
           wheel Delores into the back of the ER...

           More than anything Jenny wants to stay and make sure she 
           lives, but she can’t. She backs away slowly -- 

                                 COP
                        Stay right where you are!

           Jenny turns and runs out the door -- gone.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - DAY

           Jenny slams the door open -- hot off the ER -- harried, 
           breathing heavy, flushed with adrenaline -- to see --

           Glen in the dining room -- eating his meal alone -- candles, 
           a bottle of wine -- a cold, untouched plate for Jenny...

                                 GLEN
                        You said you’d be home tonight.

                               TIME CUT TO:

           Moments later. Jenny paces the floor...

                                 JENNY
                        Look, I can’t do this -- not right 
                        now...

                                 GLEN
                        I cleaned the whole house for you 
                        and set up this dinner --
               (then)
                        I mean I thought you’d at least 
                        give me a call --

                                 JENNY
                        I was in the ER, a girl was dying --

                                 GLEN
                        So that means you can’t call me?

           Jenny stands there -- not sure how to answer that.

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Why are you so obsessed with this? 
                        Can you just let it go? 
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 GLEN (CONT’D)
                        Girls get pregnant, it’s illegal to 
                        get un-pregnant and that’s just the 
                        way things are.

                                 JENNY
                        Why am I obsessed? ‘Cause I don’t 
                        want one more woman to have to suck 
                        a dick to get an abortion --

                                 GLEN
                        What are you even talking about? 

                                 JENNY
                        Let’s not do this now --

                                 GLEN
                        No, let’s.

                                 JENNY
                        There you go again, making it all 
                        about you. You have to know what I 
                        have to do to get what I need done.

                                 GLEN
                        Jenny, if Murray did something...

                                 JENNY
                        It wasn’t Murray -- 

           Then -- the phone rings. It’s the scariest sound ever. Jenny 
           moves -- picks it up...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (INTERCUT)

           Sarah, talking quietly on a public phone...

                                 SARAH
                        She’s gone.

           And that’s the end of Jenny’s world. All sound fades giving 
           way to the ambient noise -- her children playing in the next 
           room. Street sounds from outside...

                                 JENNY
                        No, she’s not. She can’t be.

           Jenny withers in her skin and sinks to the floor. A deep soul 
           crushing sadness -- no no no...
       This is Jane

                                 SARAH
                        There’s something else --
               (then)
                        Ricky’s in custody.

           INT. PRISON VISITATION BOOTH - DAY

           Jenny and Ricky talking -- glass between them.

                                 RICKY
                        I heard the sirens, I got everyone 
                        out, but I forgot to grab the tapes 
                        -- I went back and they got me...

                                 JENNY
                        I’m turning myself in. I’m the one 
                        that started it, it’s me they want.

                                 RICKY
                        You are gonna do no such thing.

                                 JENNY
                        There is no way I’m going to let 
                        you sit here while --

                                 RICKY
                        I can do my work from prison.
               (then)
                        You can’t. 

           Jenny stops, processes that -- 

                                 RICKY (CONT’D)
                        You have to keep going or more 
                        women will die -- just find a 
                        better doctor. And soon.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Small funeral for Delores. Her folks are there. A preacher. A 
           few of her friends. Jenny watches with Miriam from far away --

                                 JENNY
                        I should have stayed with her -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        You didn’t know, Jenny.

                                 JENNY
                        I knew she would die if I ran. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        She died because they let her die.
               (then)
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 MIRIAM (CONT'D)
                        I know this is hard for you to 
                        accept, but you did the absolute 
                        best you could for her.

                                 JENNY
                        You’re right. I’m not accepting 
                        that anytime soon.

                                 MIRIAM
                        She should have been able to see a 
                        doctor to begin with, but you know 
                        what? That’s impossible.
               (then)
                        That's how important our bodies are 
                        to them. They’ll let us die trying 
                        to protect them.
               (then)
                        But we are not our bodies -- we are 
                        somebodies.

           Jenny sets her jaw -- so pissed off...

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Jenny walks into the lobby, still dressed in her black 
           funeral clothes. Her eyes scan the dining room...

                                 MAITRE D
                        Can I help you?

                                 JENNY
                        Joe Campisi. Where is he?

           Then, she sees him. Across the room at a corner table.

                                 MAITRE D
                        I’m sorry, but do you have...

           She walks right past him -- he grabs her shoulder.

                                 JENNY
                        Get your fucking hands off me!

           She’s loud here -- the whole lobby quiets down. The Maitre D 
           waves to his security detail to deal with her.

           Jenny gets to Campisi’s table.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Are you Joe Campisi?

           Everyone looks at the dude at the head. Must be him. 

           Then -- large hands grab Jenny and drag her out... 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        No! Let go of me you pricks!

           Jenny twists and turns and finally escapes, leaving them 
           holding her coat. She lunges for Campisi -- 

           And throws a fat stack of INDEX CARDS at him -- they flutter 
           all over the table...

                                 CAMPISI
                        What is this?

                                 JENNY
                        This is how many girls I have 
                        backed up after you sent your --

           Goons drag her away again -- she kicks and screams --

                                 CAMPISI’S WIFE
                        Stop! Let her speak.

           The goons stop, check with their boss. He rolls his eyes, 
           “fine, let her go.” Jenny shakes them off...

                                 JENNY
                        Thank you.

                                 CAMPISI’S WIFE
                        What’s wrong, honey?

                                 JENNY
                        Do you know how hard it is to get a 
                        clean abortion in this town -- 

           Whoa. She wasn’t expecting this...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        You know, the kind where you don’t 
                        have to give head to a doctor or 
                        risk death in the ER?
               (then)
                        It’s impossible and you know why?

           The wife is listening...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause your husband extorts the 
                        hell out of everyone who does it!

           This is all news to Campisi’s wife...

                                 CAMPISI’S WIFE
                        What is she talking about?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        He sent two goons to break my guy’s 
                        hand and now he’s skipped town.

           Jenny throws a newspaper clipping on the table -- it’s 
           Delores’s obituary...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Her blood is on his hands.

           Campisi’s wife looks at the clipping -- then to her husband. 

                                 CAMPISI
                        I’m not gonna do shit --

           His wife lays on the serious eye-fuck -- and he shuts up...

                                 CAMPISI’S WIFE
                        We’re gonna talk about this.

           Jenny straightens herself out and nods to Mrs. Campisi --

                                 JENNY
                        Thank you.

           Jenny turns, shoves the two goons away --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Outta my way, mook --

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Jenny is talking to Nick --

                                 JENNY
                        You’re clear with Campisi --

           INT. NICK’S CALIFORNIA HOME - NIGHT (INTERCUT)

           Nick on the phone with Jenny -- 

                                 NICK
                        What are you talking about? Did you 
                        pay them off?

                                 JENNY
                        No -- but you shouldn’t have any 
                        more problems with them -- 
               (then)
                        But before you get too comfortable, 
                        you should know I gave your name to 
                        the police in the ER. I panicked. 
                        Sorry.
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        That’s okay -- I don’t think they 
                        can get to me out here.
               (then)
                        What happened?

                                 JENNY
                        I took a girl to the wrong guy.

                                 NICK
                        Is she okay?

           Silence -- just thinking about it destroys her.

                                 JENNY
                        I went to her funeral today.

                                 NICK
                        I’m sorry, Jenny --

           She nods -- repressing the emotion.

                                 JENNY
                        So I guess you’re working on big 
                        time Hollywood actresses now --

                                 NICK
                        Abortion is legal in California, 
                        they don’t need me for that. I 
                        started a business with Candy.
               (then)
                        We got married, by the way.

                                 JENNY
                        Congratulations.

                                 NICK
                        She likes the way I dress -- 

           Jenny smiles at that -- first time in a while.

                                 JENNY
                        What’s this business, a nudie mag?

                                 NICK
                        Yeah, how did you guess?

           Jenny deflates -- of course...

                                 JENNY
                        You’re really doing a porno mag? 
                        Have you learned nothing from me?
       This is Jane

                                 NICK
                        It was Candy’s idea. She says it’s 
                        feminist for women to own their 
                        exploitation.

                                 JENNY
                        That makes some kind of weird 
                        sense, I suppose -- 

                                 NICK
                        What can I tell you? Don’t marry a 
                        motivated stripper. 

                                 JENNY
                        So, uh, I guess you won’t be able 
                        to come back now, huh?

                                 NICK
                        Actually, I brought up Jane with 
                        her the other day and she says it’s 
                        okay if I fly in on Saturdays.
               (then)
                        I want to finish teaching you so 
                        you can train the other Janes -- 

                                 JENNY
                        You would really do that?

                                 NICK
                        I would do anything for you.

                                 JENNY
                        Every time I start to hate you, you 
                        go and say something like this --

                                 NICK
                        I know, I’m the worst, aren’t I?

                                 JENNY
                        No, you’re the absolute best.

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Jenny comes home to a dark house -- exhausted. She removes 
           her coat, flips on the kitchen light and sees -- 

           A disaster zone. The whole apartment has been ransacked -- 
           every drawer open, furniture flipped, clothes everywhere.

           She stares at the abject devastation -- a broken woman.

           She sees a NOTE taped to the phone --

                At my folks. Call me.
       This is Jane

           She picks up the receiver and notices -- the phone line has 
           been ripped from the wall... a tangle of wires in her hand.

                                 GLEN (PRE-LAP)
                        I ripped it out of the wall -- you 
                        need to stay off that phone.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           It’s late. Jenny talks from a scary phone booth --

                                 JENNY
                        Why? What happened?

           INT. GLEN’S PARENT’S HOME - NIGHT (INTERCUT)

           Glen on his parent’s phone -- 

                                 GLEN
                        Well, what do you think? Some cop 
                        named Sobchek came to the door, 
                        showed me a warrant and had his 
                        goon squad turn the place upside 
                        down.
               (then)
                        They got your index cards.

           Jenny’s face falls -- Abigail’s card was in there...

                                 JENNY
                        What about your books?

                                 GLEN
                        I took those to work, which is the 
                        next warrant he’ll get and won’t 
                        that be fun... cops crawling all 
                        over my office?

                                 JENNY
                        Please just burn them --

                                 GLEN
                        Do you know how illegal that is? 
                        Destroying evidence?

                                 JENNY
                        Evidence of how many lives I’ve 
                        saved? Yeah -- there’s nothing 
                        incriminating in any of that -- 
                        they have to catch me in the act.
       This is Jane

                                 GLEN
                        Or find someone to testify -- you 
                        don’t think they can find someone 
                        in that stack of cards?

                                 JENNY
                        No. I don’t.

                                 GLEN
                        Um, okay. Are you even aware of 
                        what you’ve done to this family?
               (then)
                        Casey is not going to recover from 
                        seeing those guys rip apart her 
                        room.

                                 JENNY
                        I’ll be right over -- I can make 
                        everything better...

                                 GLEN
                        No, that’s not a good idea --

                                 JENNY
                        Why not?

                                 GLEN
                        We need a safe place right now -- 

                                 JENNY
                        I will step away --

                                 GLEN
                        That’s a good start --

                                 JENNY
                        I just won’t be able to live with 
                        myself until Jane can run on it’s 
                        own --

                                 GLEN
                        Then we won’t be able to live with 
                        you either. 

           A deathly silence falls between the spouses -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Do you still love me?

                                 GLEN
                        If I didn't, this wouldn't hurt 
                        like it does -- 

           Click. He’s gone.
       This is Jane

           INT. JENNY'S HOME - KIDS ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny walks in, turns on the light. The room is destroyed -- 
           mattress on the floor. Drawers pulled out, clothes scattered.

           Jenny grabs a stuffed animal and hugs it -- then lays herself 
           down on Casey’s mattress, pulls a blanket over herself.

                                 JENNY (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m ready...

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jenny and Miriam -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Are you serious? You’re really 
                        gonna try this --

                                 JENNY
                        Yes. Saturday night. Someone who 
                        lives alone -- her place.

           An outlaw grin creeps up on Miriam’s face...

                                 JENNY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Hi Terri, I’m Jenny -- how are you 
                        feeling?

           INT. TERRI’S HOME - NIGHT

           TERRI, a young woman. She’s laying down, legs up...

                                 TERRI
                        I’m fine, thank you.

                                 JENNY
                        Good, good. This is Maria, and 
                        she’s here to answer questions.

                                 MARIA
                        Hi, Terri -- is it okay if I hold 
                        your hand?

           Terri takes Maria’s hand and squeezes it -- a connection.

           Jenny lifts the sheet from Terri’s knees -- 

                                 JENNY
                        It’s a safe procedure the way we do 
                        it, but there can be complications. 
                        That’s why you have to stay in 
                        touch with us afterward, okay?
       This is Jane

           Jenny reaches for a speculum, shiny and clean. We hear the 
           sounds of clanking metal as she sets it in place...

           Next, Jenny picks up a syringe and bottle -- She draws liquid 
           into the syringe. 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Terri, you might feel a 
                        little pressure here -- 
               (then)
                        Just a little shot of Ergo to 
                        control the bleeding -- 

                                 TERRI
                        Umm, ma’am? 

                                 JENNY
               (she stops)
                        Yes?

                                 TERRI
                        You don’t have to talk me through 
                        it -- I trust you.

           A smile from Jenny --

                                 JENNY
                        I read your file this morning, it 
                        says you’re about to graduate.
               (then)
                        Any thoughts on what’s next?

           CLOSE-ON. Jenny’s hands on forceps handles, working between 
           Terri’s legs. Twisting, straining. 

                                 TERRI
                        I was thinking nursing school -- 

           Terri feels the tugging -- she looks up to Maria, who is 
           strong, loving -- caressing her hand.

                                 JENNY
                        Ever thought of going to med-
                        school? Becoming a doctor?

                                 TERRI
                        Yeah, right -- 

           We watch Jenny’s face as she feels inside the woman for loose 
           material, twist ever so gently and pulls her instrument out -- 

           We hear the gentle clanking of a METAL DISH off to the side -- 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        No reason you can’t -- 

                                 TERRI
                        Did you go to medical school?

           Jenny sets the forceps down, picks up the CURETTE.

                                 JENNY
                        I did not -- but Maria here is in 
                        med school right now.

           The two exchange a smile --

                                 TERRI
                        You’re in med school and you’re 
                        here doing this?

           Maria can’t help but laugh at that --

                                 MARIA
                        I sure am -- I want to learn from 
                        the best, don’t I?

           Jenny sets the curette down. Back to the FORCEPS -- 

                                 TERRI
                        But you’re not a doctor?

                                 JENNY
                        Nope, just a normal person who 
                        knows how to do a clean abortion.
               (then)
                        Still want to go through with this?

                                 TERRI
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Again, we’re on Jenny’s face as she feels, grabs hold, grips 
           the forceps tight and squeezes -- gritting her teeth -- 

           Then, breathes a sigh -- nearly emotional -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Once more around with the curette 
                        to make sure we’re clean -- 

           She does another sweep. She sets the curette down -- 

           We hear the metal screws of the speculum. It collapses into 
           her hands, she sets it down, leans back -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        And it’s all over.
       This is Jane

           The room erupts into bedlam -- and we reveal --

                                 KATE
                        We can fucking do it!

           Kate has rejoined Jane -- looking healthy and strong.

           All of the main Janes are there, too -- Miriam, Kate, Deb, 
           Karen -- everyone is ecstatic! Jumping, hugging, yelling...

                                 JENNY
                        Ladies! Ladies! A little respect.

           She’s referring to Terri on the bed, who’s wiping tears.

           The Janes quiet down... 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        You okay, sweetie?

                                 TERRI
                        I'm just happy I'm here with you 
                        guys and not somewhere else.

           Jenny takes that in -- exchanges a glance with the rest of 
           the Janes. A reverent moment.

           Crowd noise fades up and we hear a loud voice --

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        What do you mean he’s not a doctor!

           INT. MIRIAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Secret meeting. The dining room is packed with women -- 

                                 JENNY
                        I mean doctors aren’t the only 
                        people qualified to do this. Nick 
                        is a con man, yes, but a con man 
                        who does a very safe abortion.
               (then)
                        Now, I know a lot of you have 
                        personal experience with Nick and 
                        it might not bother you -- but if 
                        it does, please feel free to leave.

           The group watches as a few women stand and leave.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so the rest of us are 
                        basically cool with Nick.

           No reaction...
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Given that Nick has been operating 
                        without a license and we’re cool 
                        with that, I propose that rather 
                        than deal with another expensive, 
                        mob controlled doctor -- 
               (then)
                        We do the abortions ourselves.

           A wave of reaction from the group --

                                 VOICES
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JENNY
                        I’m saying our abortions will be 
                        performed by women from now on, and 
                        women only -- starting with me.
               (then)
                        I’ve been moonlighting with Nick 
                        for the past few months and he has 
                        trained me how to do it -- 
               (then)
                        I’ve already done one with the 
                        assistance of Miriam, Kate and 
                        Maria -- all of whom will be 
                        training over the next few months.

           More outcry.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        It's the skill that has the value! 
                        The skill in the hands of women who 
                        understand it!

                                 MIRIAM
                        We’re simply returning abortion to 
                        the people it belongs to!
               (then)
                        Before doctors took over, midwives 
                        cared for women -- and that's what 
                        we have here. 
               (then)
                        All of us Janes. Just a bunch of 
                        wives and mothers and daughters 
                        taking care of each other.

                                 JENNY
                        If you believe in a woman's right 
                        to choose, it’s the choice you make 
                        right now. 
               (then)
                        You're Jane or you're not.
       This is Jane

           The group processes that. Then -- a mass exodus from the room 
           leaves only the main Janes (Miriam, Kate, Maria, Deb, Karen, 
           Ruth) and a few others...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Anyone else who wants to train is 
                        welcome to. Any volunteers? 

           All hands shoots up -- 

           And we launch into a new montage -- peak Jane.

           EXT. THE PLACE - DAY

           Jenny and Miriam walk up to a twelve story building -- they 
           look up... it towers above them...

           INT. THE PLACE - OFFICE - DAY

           Now we see Miriam speaking with two people in an office...

           Miriam slides a STACK OF CASH across the desk. The man takes 
           it, splits it and hands half back to Miriam -- along with a 
           set of keys for apartment #1138.

           Miriam nods respect to him...

           THE PLACE

           Miriam walks the apartment -- it’s empty, but warm and big.

           We see the future waiting room, offices and bathroom...

           THE PLACE - APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY

           Miriam knocks on a series of doors. Behind each door is a 
           woman, sometimes with a man.

           Miriam sits on a few couches, explains herself. Always, the 
           woman nods, accepting...

           EXT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

           Miriam walks inside -- 

           LINGERIE SHOP

           Now she’s talking to the CLERK behind the desk -- 

           The CLERK escorts her through the stockroom, out the back 
           door and into the --
       This is Jane

           ALLEY WAY

           They walk across the alley to another building -- 

           Miriam opens the service door with her own key --

           SERVICE ELEVATOR

           Miriam rides up -- numbers climb to the 11th floor -- 

           HALLWAY

           She emerges from the elevator, walks the hall to apartment 
           #1138 and KNOCKS... The door opens to reveal -- 

           INT. THE PLACE - DAY

           A warm homey environment. A bunch of Janes (Jenny, Miriam, 
           Kate, Maria, Deb, Karen, Ruth) are cleaning, painting, moving 
           furniture, etc. 

           We land on a piece of art hanging on the wall -- it’s an 
           abstract flower design that surrounds the message -- 

                Sisterhood is Blooming.
             Springtime will never be the same.

                               TIME CUT TO:

           PROCEDURE ROOM 

           We see Mrs. Campisi. She sits bedside, watching her daughter -
           - who is on the bed, legs up. Then we reveal Kate is holding 
           the daughter’s hand. Camera pans over to reveal... 

           Maria doing the procedure. 

           Jenny leans in, whispers into Maria’s ear...

                                 JENNY
                        Feel around and make sure it’s 
                        clean...

           Maria begins to move around. She’s gentle, too gentle --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Harder, pull toward you.

                                 MARIA
                        I don’t want to hurt her -- 

                                 JENNY
                        You can’t be afraid to cause pain, 
                        or you won’t do the job right.
       This is Jane

           Now we cut to a series of vignettes -- blurry & rapid --

           -- Women are coming in and out of The Place...

           -- Maria demonstrates to Kate... 

           -- Kate demonstrates to Karen...

           -- Karen to Deb...

           -- Focus on: hands being held, instruments being sterilized. 

           -- Women with clean linens changing sheets. 

           -- Happy women in the recovery room, comfy chairs...

           -- Children running around the waiting room while...

           -- Nick’s NUDE MAGAZINE lays on the waiting room table...

           -- Female hands toss it into the garbage bin...

           -- Miriam cooking meals. 

           -- Women eating together, laughing like family...

           A massive group belly laugh rings out and fades...

           INT. THE PLACE - NIGHT

           It’s late. Jenny is alone wrapping up -- the phone rings.

                                 JENNY
                        Hello?

           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOME - NIGHT (INTERCUT)

           It’s Abigail, on her folks’ phone --

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Hi, is this Jane?

                                 JENNY
                        Yes, can I help you?

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Hi, umm, my name is Abigail -- and 
                        I saw you a long time ago.

                                 JENNY
                        Hi, Abigail, how can I help you?
       This is Jane

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Well, I kinda want to maybe help 
                        you... do you know that the police 
                        are trying to find you?

           About now we notice a family photo hanging nearby -- a subtle 
           reminder that her father is Det. Sobchek...

                                 JENNY
                        We’re aware -- is there something 
                        we should know?

                                 ABIGAIL
                        He asked me about you -- 

                                 JENNY
                        What did you tell him?

                                 ABIGAIL
                        I told him what he wanted to hear --

                                 JENNY
                        And what’s that?

                                 ABIGAIL
                        That it was some other Abigail. 
                        That my daddy raised me right and 
                        provided me everything I need.
               (then)
                        I lied, basically.

                                 JENNY
                        I’m sorry -- I hate that we put you 
                        in that position. 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        You didn’t put me in any position -- 
                        I put myself there.
               (then)
                        If he catches you, though, things 
                        could get kinda sticky for me --

                                 JENNY
                        Do you remember what I told you 
                        back at the park?

                                 ABIGAIL
                        He can put a gun to your head --

                                 JENNY
                        He’ll never know.

           A long silent beat --
       This is Jane

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Thank you.

           Click. She’s gone...

           BLACK.

                   May 3, 1972

           A cacophony of honking, driving, pedestrians yelling -- 

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           A woman walks down from the train platform -- MISSY -- hold 
           her handbag just-so, protecting her belly.

                                 DEB
                        Yo!

           Missy startles -- sees Deb in her whopper of a 70s car. She’s 
           yelling at her from the open passenger window.

                                 DEB (CONT’D)
                        You waiting for someone?!

                                 MISSY
                        Jane?

                                 DEB
               (waves her over)
                        Let’s roll!

           Missy steps into the car. Then -- we reveal -- across the 
           street -- a man is sitting in a generic looking car. 

           It’s Sobchek -- watching them. Sobchek picks up his mic --

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Tango on the move -- 

           He sets the mic back. We notice a red cherry police light on 
           the floorboard, along with a shotgun. 

           DEB'S CAR

           Missy rides up front -- no seat belt.

           Deb adjusts her rear-view mirror and notices something -- 
           it’s Sobchek, but she doesn’t know him.

           Deb’s eyes narrow -- stares him down through the mirror. She 
           spots an opening in traffic, and cuts a hard left turn -- 

           Tires squeal. Missy grips her door wide-eyed.
       This is Jane

                                 MISSY
                        What’s happening?

           Deb looks back to the car behind -- it’s gone.

                                 DEB
                        Nothing, just can’t be too careful.

           SOBCHEK’S CAR

           Sobchek waits at the intersection -- grabs mic.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Lost them, corner of -- 

           INT. THE PLACE - LOBBY - DAY

           Now we’re in the lobby of a high-rise apartment building. 
           Another undercover cop sits in a chair. 

                                 SOBCHEK (O.C.)
                        Lake Park and East 55th -- 

           We notice a tiny earpiece in his ear.

           EXT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

           Deb’s car parks out front. The two hop out and we see --

           A streak of blood on the front seat. Then --

           Sobchek pulls up in his car, real slow -- 

           EXT. THE PLACE - DAY

           Inside, Missy and Deb hop on the service elevator. A man 
           standing in front of the elevator, watches them and then 
           casually saunters on with them -- 

           INT. THE PLACE - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Deb and Missy ride the elevator with this strange man. Deb is 
           sizing him up -- who is this guy? He nods back at her --

           DING. Eleventh floor. They walk off -- Deb double checks to 
           see if the man follows her. He stays behind.

           HALLWAY

           Deb leads Missy to a DOOR -- #1138. And knocks -- 

           The door opens a crack -- and we see Miriam!

           A smile, the door closes, unlocks, opens. And -- 
       This is Jane

           Missy gets her first taste of family planning paradise.

           It’s warm. Warm colors, warm temperature, warm homey 
           furniture, warm music playing. It’s a safe place.

           The waiting room, comprised of comfy chairs, is populated 
           with a few women (ages vary, 20s and 30s).

           They look up from reading and acknowledge Missy -- 

                                 DEB
                        This is Miriam. You’re in good 
                        hands with her.

           Missy nods polite as Miriam leads her away...

           Then, Deb makes eye contact with one of the waiting women.

                                 DEB (CONT’D)
                        Ready to go?

           A woman picks up her things and walks out with Deb.

                                 DEB (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in an hour to take you 
                        to the station, okay?

           She’s talking to a still skittish Missy. Missy nods back, 
           easing into this process. Deb leaves...

           Miriam closes the door, locks and slides the door chain -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        You look a little peaked, darling -- 
                        how are you feeling?

           Then -- Missy’s knees buckle, she collapses. Miriam acts 
           fast, helps her to the floor.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, honey, what’s wrong.

           Miriam sees blood on her own hands.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Go get Jenny.

           HALLWAY

           Deb walks down the hallway -- looks up to see Sobchek in her 
           path. She startles -- thinks about screaming but WHAM! 

           The woman with Deb startles. 
       This is Jane

           Sobcheck shoves Deb against the wall and muzzles her mouth --

           Deb’s eyes shoot wide.

           WAITING ROOM

           Missy lays on the sofa -- moaning with pain. 

                                 JENNY
                        What happened?

                                 KAREN
                        She came to us like this -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Honey, did you go to someone who 
                        did this to you?

           Missy nods... yes. Jenny lifts her skirt. Her face falls.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        She needs a hospital, right now.

           HALLWAY

           Back outside. Sobchek still has Deb against the wall -- 

           Except now there’s half-a-dozen cops with him... 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        It’s over, now. Do you understand?
               (she nods)
                        Good. I want you to go knock on 
                        that door, so the doctor can’t run.

           Deb is like -- “doctor?”

           WAITING ROOM

           Back inside...

                                 MIRIAM
                        If she goes to the hospital, 
                        they’ll ask questions -- 

                                 JENNY
                        It’s okay, I’ll take her --

                                 KAREN
                        No, let me. I can do the time, we 
                        need you here.

           Then -- a KNOCK on the door. 
       This is Jane

           Maria makes for the front door. She opens it and her face 
           falls. We get a glimpse of a Sobchek -- 

           Deb screams from behind him -- 

                                 DEB
                        It’s the cops! Get the hell out!

           Maria slams the door on them -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Get away from the door!

           WHAM! The door flies open! Sobchek enters, badge out -- 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Chicago PD! Stay where you are!

           A flood of policemen follow him and swarm the joint.

           PROCEDURE ROOM

           THOK! Kate locks the door. 

                                 KATE
                        It’s the cops. Don’t worry, you’ve 
                        done nothing wrong. Get yourself 
                        dressed and out that window, now.

           WAITING ROOM

           All of the women in comfy chairs look scared.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Tell us where he is -- 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Where who is?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        The doctor. Is he back here?

           He motions toward Maria’s door and another cop opens it -- 

           PROCEDURE ROOM

           It’s just Maria, sitting pretty on the bed -- alone.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        He’s not in here.

           Sobchek looks to Jenny --
       This is Jane

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Where is he?

                                 JENNY
                        There’s no man, here.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Cuff her, she’s under arrest.

           Sobchek gestures to the cop. He takes out his cuffs and grabs 
           Jenny by the arm. Jenny bucks against him -- 

                                 JENNY
                        No! I’m going to the hospital, you 
                        can arrest me later.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Call an ambulance and cuff her.

           The cop grabs Jenny -- shoves her to the floor. WHUD! Her 
           head slams carpet -- and we hear that strange ringing again.

                                 SOBCHEK (CONT’D)
                        Tell me where he is, right now -- 

           We barely hear him -- something got knocked loose in Jenny...

                                 JENNY
                        He who? Who are you looking for?

           She’s straining to talk...

                                 SOBCHEK
                        The doctor -- we know what you’re 
                        doing in here, so where is he?

                                 JENNY
                        There’s no guy here -- 
               (then)
                        It’s just us Janes.

           INT. PADDY WAGON - DAY

           A slamming door brings us into the PADDY WAGON. It’s Jenny, 
           Miriam, Kate, Maria, Deb, Karen, Ruth -- the Abortion Seven.

           Jenny is woozy, dazed -- but driven...

                                 JENNY
                        Okay, they’re gonna strip search 
                        us. Deb, you drove today, right? 
               (Deb nods)
                        You still got the money?
               (nods again)
                                 (MORE)
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Take it out and split it up. When 
                        they put us in the cell -- we're 
                        going to rip it up and flush it. 

           The girls start doing that. 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Karen -- the 3x5 cards?
               (nod)
                        Same thing, split 'em up.

           Karen breaks off the cards into chunks -- Jenny is already 
           tearing one into bits, shoving it in her mouth.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Tear up and swallow! Now!

           The girls follow her lead -- tearing and chewing.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Now we get the MUGSHOT. They each flash by individually -- 

           Jenny, Miriam, Kate, Maria, Deb, Karen, Ruth -- 

           And then a group shot. The seven Janes stand in a row, arms 
           linked like a chorus line. The FLASH takes us to -- 

           LOCKUP

           All seven women behind bars. There are others in with them -- 
           vagrants, prostitutes, drunks... 

                                 MIRIAM
                        So, are they just gonna let us stew 
                        here all night?

                                 JENNY
                        Or until they figure out where that 
                        man doctor escaped to.

                                 DEB
                        If all they want is the doctor, why 
                        are they keeping us here?

                                 JENNY
                        They think that by putting us on 
                        ice they’re putting an end to 
                        abortion in Chicago.

           A slow, ironic chuckle from the group...
       This is Jane

           INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Glen is at work, hacking away at his calculator -- he looks 
           up, sees a bedraggled Jenny in his doorway. 

                                 JENNY
                        Hey.

                                 GLEN
                        Hey. Where’d you get that hat?

           She has a woolen skull cap on --

                                 JENNY
                        Lost and found down at the station.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s nice.

           Jenny takes it off --

                                 JENNY
                        Just your standard felon hat...
               (then)
                        Can I stay with you guys tonight?

           INT. GLEN’S PARENTS HOME - KIDS ROOM - NIGHT

           Glen and Jenny walk into a nice house. His Mother is there 
           with Casey, reading a book.

                                 CASEY
                        Mommy!

           Casey runs to Jenny -- and they hug. Hard.

                                 JENNY
                        I missed you so much...

           Then -- Jenny looks up to Glen’s mother. A stare down.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

           Glen’s Mother stands and walks out, judgmental. 

           Jenny and Glen locks eyes -- “what are you gonna do?”

           KIDS ROOM

           Later. Jenny reads to Casey and Audrey. She finishes up --
       This is Jane

                                 CASEY
                        Grammy says you worry about other 
                        people’s babies more than yours -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Grammy might have a point there.

                                 CASEY
                        What do you do with other babies?

                                 JENNY
                        I just want to make sure all babies 
                        are as loved as much as I love you.

           A smile from Casey...

           LIVING ROOM

                                 JENNY
                        They set us up with a criminal 
                        attorney --

                                 GLEN
                        Not a civil rights attorney?

                                 JENNY
                        She thinks it’s stupid to fight 
                        abortion illegality -- she wants to 
                        keep us out of jail --

                                 GLEN
                        That’s good advice. I'm teaching 
                        Casey to read and I suck at it. She 
                        needs you to not be in jail.

                                 JENNY
                        You’re right, I made you part of 
                        this and I shouldn’t have --
               (then)
                        She also says abortion might be 
                        legal soon anyway --

                                 GLEN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JENNY
                        It’s a supreme court case --
               (then)
                        Promise me you’ll wait for this to 
                        be over...
       This is Jane

                                 GLEN
                        Of course I’ll wait. I just don’t 
                        want to wait outside a prison a 
                        hundred years from now.

           INT. THE PLACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jenny pushes through the service door to apartment #1138 -- 
           cuts through a seal on the door and enters --

           THE PLACE

           She enters and is in the process of saying goodbye when she 
           sees a STACK OF INDEX CARDS. She picks it up, flips through -- 
           there's at least 250 -- all waiting to be called back...

           She shuts down for a beat. Thinks about where these women 
           could possibly go. What they could do to themselves.

           How exhausted and sick she is. 

           Then -- that strange ringing gently fades in... 

                                 JENNY (PRE-LAP)
                        I know many of you have questions 
                        about how we got busted and why. Is 
                        there an informant in the group? 
                        Are the phones tapped?

           INT. MIRIAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Another meeting -- the turnout is enormous, a hundred women 
           spilling out of the living room into the rest of the house. 

           Jenny, Miriam, Kate, Maria, Deb, Karen, Ruth all sit at the 
           head of the room -- facing the crowd...

                                 JENNY
                        The answer is yes all of those 
                        things are probably true.
               (then)
                        That’s why we have to keep going.

           An uproar erupts -- a cacophony of dissent. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Don’t even start, Jenny -- the 
                        police are all over us -- 

           Jenny holds up the THICK STACK of cards --
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        In January, the supreme court is 
                        going to be make abortion legal all 
                        over the country -- and all of this 
                        nonsense will be over. 
               (then)
                        There will be no need for Jane --

           The crowd quiets down...

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        But until then what are these women 
                        going to do? We have to take care 
                        of them...

                                 MIRIAM
                        Jenny, we can’t pull this off 
                        anymore -- it is over...

                                 JENNY
                        I understand how you feel, Miriam, 
                        but I'm going to keep working -- 

           A stare-down between Jenny and the six other Janes --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Anybody who's not going to join me 
                        can leave right now.
               (then)
                        You’re Jane or you’re not.

           Miriam stands to leave and the others follow -- 

           Except Kate. Kate stays by Jenny -- stoic.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Anyone else?

           Then -- slowly, 99% of the room files out. 

           Jenny watches until everyone is gone. Then -- 

           She looks over to Kate -- Kate stands up and this is hard. 
           The two have a moment. Jenny nods, telling her it’s okay --

           Kate nods back and follows the rest -- 

           Jenny -- alone in the empty room... except for one person.

           Claire, her old pal, is sitting in the back all by herself. 

           She walks to Jenny...
       This is Jane

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey Jane.

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t guess you’re here to join 
                        back up, are you?

           A headshake from Claire -- no. She pulls Jenny up for a hug.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You did your best, honey -- now 
                        let’s keep you out of prison.

           Jenny pulls away. Looks Claire right in her eyes --

                                 JENNY
                        No one’s going to prison, Claire.

           Claire is slow to take Jenny’s meaning. She watches as Jenny 
           picks up her bag -- shoves the 250 cards inside... 

           And walks out. Leaving Claire alone.

           EXT. MOTEL - DAY

           Jenny steps out of the managers office -- walks the sidewalk 
           to her room -- same room where she confronted Nick years ago. 

           INT. MOTEL - DAY

           Jenny sits at the small table -- staring at the stack of 250 
           index cards. Specifically this one -- 

               Delores. 19. 8 weeks. $50.

           An emotional reminder of why she’s doing this. She flips that 
           one back and reveals a new name --

               Barbara. 19. 8 weeks. $50.

           She picks up the phone and dials -- 

                                 JENNY
                        Hello, I’m looking for Barbara -- 
               (then)
                        This is Jane.

                               TIME CUT TO:

           Later. We hear a KNOCK on the door. Jenny has remade the room 
           into a makeshift clinic, just like the old days with Nick. 
           Plastic sheets, etc. She has her tools laid out --

           Jenny opens the door and we meet BARBARA, a young woman.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Barbara?

           Barbara nods -- like a teen trying to buy weed.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Come on in, make yourself at home.

           Barbara enters, looks around the room -- not very homey.

                               TIME CUT TO:

           Barbara on the bed, legs up. Jenny on her chair, working.

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a safe procedure the way I do 
                        it, but there can be complications. 
                        That’s why you have to stay in 
                        touch with me afterward, okay?

                                 BARBARA
                        Yes, ma’am --

                                 JENNY
                        You can call me Jenny.

           Jenny reaches for a speculum, shiny and clean. We hear the 
           sounds of clanking metal -- and get a look at her HANDS.

           We notice something troubling. They tremble. 

           Jenny stalls, willing her hands to stop -- but they won’t. 
           She sets the speculum down -- collects herself.

                                 BARBARA
                        Is everything okay?

                                 JENNY
                        Everything’s great.

           Jenny goes for the syringe and bottle -- we get a good, solid 
           look at her hands now -- more shaking. 

           She struggles to insert the syringe into the bottle -- but 
           finally hits it. Draws the liquid out -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Barbara, you might feel a 
                        little pressure here -- 

           Then -- we hear it. The strange ringing we’ve heard 
           throughout the movie. We’re cringing -- can she do this? 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Maria will you take over, please?

           She’s delirious, talking to no one -- Barbara sits up just in 
           time to see Jenny slump over and fall to the floor -- 

           INT. HOSPITAL - JENNY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny stirs awake -- and finds herself in a hospital bed. 
           Paper gown, IV tubes, the works.

           She looks over to the couch and sees Glen, fast asleep.

                                 JENNY
                        Glen -- 

           He doesn’t hear her -- 

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        Glen!

           Glen’s eyes pop open -- he’s alert instantly.

                                 GLEN
                        Hey, you. How are you feeling?

                                 JENNY
                        Like I got hit by a truck -- how 
                        did I get here...

                                 GLEN
                        You passed out in some motel room -- 
                        the girl you were working on called 
                        an ambulance.
               (then)
                        That was two days ago.

           That sinks in on Jenny. 

                                 JENNY
                        It’s back, isn’t it?

                                 GLEN
                        Don’t jump to conclusions.

           A nod -- she’s got other things on her mind.

                                 JENNY
                        What happened to the girl?

                                 GLEN
                        She’s back home, I think -- 
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        Did she talk?

           Glen nods, she did --

                                 GLEN
                        That cop is out in the hallway.

                                 JENNY
                        Sobchek? He’s out there now?

                                 GLEN
                        Has been all night.

                                 JENNY
                        What does he want?

                                 GLEN
                        He wants to take you downtown.

                                 JENNY
                        Come on -- he’s not that big an 
                        asshole is he?

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           POP! Flash bulbs go off -- freezing Jenny in a mugshot.

           Fingers jammed into an ink blotter -- pressed onto a card.

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           And we’ve come full-circle -- right back where we started.

           Jenny sits, cuffed to the table -- looking rough.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Here I am. Looking you right in the 
                        eye --

           And he is. The two stare down for a beat --

                                 JENNY
                        How can I help you --

           She says it flat -- she could less about this guy.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        You can start by telling me if you 
                        killed that girl and her baby last 
                        year.
               (then)
                        I believe that was you who brought 
                        her to the ER, right?
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        That’s a pretty serious charge 
                        you’re leveling.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        It’s a serious crime.

                                 JENNY
                        Before I answer any questions I 
                        need to know what you have --

           Sobchek plops a file on the table -- 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Sure, take a look --

           Jenny notices -- clipped to the front is Delores’s 3x5 
           card... the one she had in the hotel room.

           She plays it cool, opens the file, peruses for a beat -- 

                                 JENNY
                        It says here they knew she was 
                        pregnant and she had been behaving 
                        abnormally for a few weeks -- 
               (then)
                        It also says her infections were 
                        weeks old -- what does that sound 
                        like to you?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        It sounds painful.

                                 JENNY
                        And why do you think she would hide 
                        that pain?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        She’s young, unmarried, pregnant --

                                 JENNY
                        Not the best situation to be in.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        No -- but an avoidable one.

                                 JENNY
                        But it’s possible she could have 
                        been distressed by the pregnancy 
                        and everything that comes with it?
               (then)
                        Or perhaps concerned about the 
                        child’s parentage?
       This is Jane

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Doesn’t change the fact that it’s 
                        illegal to take a life...

                                 JENNY
                        Does it not even occur to you that 
                        an organization like the one you 
                        busted might be in the business of 
                        saving lives from situations like 
                        this -- not taking them?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        How many lives do you think they’ve 
                        saved against all they’ve taken?

                                 JENNY
                        However many they’re asked to...
               (then)
                        I would imagine.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Asked by who?

                                 JENNY
                        Your wives. Your sisters. Your 
                        daughters. Any and every woman who 
                        came to them. Probably.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        Did they ask the man if they could 
                        kill his baby?
               (then)
                        It takes two to tango -- 

                                 JENNY
                        And one to give birth, raise the 
                        child, love the child, spend the 
                        rest of her life caring for the 
                        child.

                                 SOBCHEK
                        The women in my life honor their 
                        commitments -- they don’t have any 
                        need for someone like you.

                                 JENNY
                        You don’t think they can make up 
                        their own minds about what happens 
                        inside their bodies?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        They’re strong enough not to get in 
                        that situation to begin with.
       This is Jane

                                 JENNY
                        What would you do if they did? 
                        Would you even know about it?

                                 SOBCHEK
                        God would know.

           The answer to all arguments --

                                 JENNY
                        You’ve heard of Roe V Wade, right?

           A shrug from Sobchek --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        All you need to know is it’s gonna 
                        pass -- and when it does there will 
                        be no need for people like me.
               (then)
                        So when you get your precious day 
                        in court, TV cameras are gonna 
                        swarm the courthouse and I'm going 
                        to take the stand as a woman who 
                        fought for freedom, not murder.
               (then)
                        You'll get your bust, but you'll 
                        make me a martyr to women who don’t 
                        need your justice or your judgment. 

                                 SOBCHEK
                        They don’t need anything from me.

                                 JENNY
                        They need you to relate...

           Another stare down between the two --

                                 JENNY (CONT’D)
                        So either charge me and make me a 
                        legend -- or let me the fuck out.

           BLACK.

                  January 22, 1973

           STILL BLACK. We hear a male voice.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        From CBS news headquarters in New 
                        York, this is the CBS evening news 
                        with Walter Cronkite.

           We fade up the old opening titles to the CBS evening news -- 
       This is Jane

                                 WALTER CRONKITE
                        Good evening. In a landmark ruling, 
                        the supreme court today legalized 
                        abortion -- 
               (then)
                        The majority in cases from Texas 
                        and Georgia said that the decision 
                        to end a pregnancy during the first 
                        three months belongs to the woman 
                        and her doctor. Not the government.
               (then)
                        Thus the anti-abortion laws of 
                        forty-six states are rendered 
                        unconstitutional.

           SLAM TO BLACK.

           We hear a female voice --

                                 RECRUITER (PRE-LAP)
                        With the recent decision, the 
                        climate has become more friendly to 
                        professionals such as yourself -- 

           INT. CLINIC - DAY

           Jenny looks good, healthy -- short hair growing back.

                                 RECRUITER
                        People whose priority is caring for 
                        women above all...

           A RECRUITER walks with her through a new abortion facility --

                                 RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        And we can finally do it at a fair 
                        price to our physicians who, as you 
                        know, had been forced underground.

           Jenny nods -- she’s aware.

                                 RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        This is our consultation room.

           The recruiter opens a door -- hard chairs, a metal table, 
           fluorescent lighting. It has a cold, institutional feel.

                                 RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, everything is state 
                        of the art, built above and beyond 
                        government specification -- 

           Jenny gazes at the room and nods -- unimpressed.
       This is Jane

                                 RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to see recovery?

           She opens another door -- same coldness. Rows and rows of 
           industrial looking chairs. 

                                 RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        We want our patients to feel as 
                        comfortable as possible after their 
                        procedures...

           Jenny is unmoved by the room -- 

                                 JENNY
                        How about procedures? Where do 
                        those take place --

           Our recruiter guides Jenny down a long hallway --

                                 RECRUITER
                        With your experience. Your 
                        connection to women. Your 
                        reputation. We see you as a 
                        valuable part of our operation.

                                 JENNY
                        Thank you.

           The Recruiter leads Jenny to another door -- opens...

                                 RECRUITER
                        Doctor? There’s someone I’d like 
                        you to meet -- 

           The Doctor turns around and we see Jenny’s old nemesis --

                                 DR. BALDWIN
                        Hey there -- it’s good to see you.

           Baldwin extends a hand -- Jenny stands there, frozen stiff. 

                                 RECRUITER
                        Oh. Do you two know each other?

                                 JENNY
                        We met a couple times, long ago. 
                        Keep an eye on him. His dick has a 
                        tendency to fall out of his pants.

           EXT. CLINIC - DAY

           Jenny pushes through the door, puts on her sunglasses and 
           walks on down the crowded street.
       This is Jane

           As she disappears into the foot traffic we roll titles --

           The case against the seven Janes who were 
            arrested was dismissed in March, 1973.

            Jenny’s lymphoma caught up with her in 

           She spent her life after Jane raising her 
            children and working with animals as a 
                   dog groomer.

           SLAM TO BLACK.

             More than 40 years after the Supreme 
            Court's landmark ruling in Roe v Wade, 
            abortion remains a controversial topic.

           Since 1991, more than 80% of all abortion 
            clinics have been shut down -- leaving 
              women more vulnerable than ever.

            The Chicago Women’s Abortion Counseling 
           Collective (aka Jane) helped 12,000 women 
              take control of their futures.

            And inspired a new generation of rogue 
           midwives who operate underground wherever 
               abortion is inaccessible.

           STILL BLACK. 

                  The near future.

                Somewhere in America.

           EXT. DOG GROOMERS - DAY

           We’re looking at the storefront of --

              Jenny’s Jet Clean Dog Groomers

           INT. DOG GROOMERS - DAY

           The first thing that hits us is the sound -- a hundred dogs 
           barking. There’s music playing. Soft, soulful music.

           We see a man, arms-deep in a soapy tub, shampooing a corgi. 
           This is James.

           There are kids there, too -- helping, playing.

           Pictures line the wall. We see old faded photos of Jenny, 
           Glen and a few Janes -- Miriam, Kate, Deb, Maria.
       This is Jane

           It’s a very homey atmosphere -- nostalgic for The Place.

                                 TRUDY
                        I’m back!

           A WOMAN comes in through the back door -- someone we’ve never 
           met, but there’s a familiar “Jane” vibe to her... 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, you.

           Trudy walks up -- they kiss. Then -- Trudy removes her jacket 
           to reveal a BULLET PROOF VEST. She casually unfastens the 
           velcro, removes it and sets on the table...

                                 GLEN
                        How did it go?

                                 TRUDY
                        Easy. Come on, pooch.

           She pops open a cage and begins work on a Pomeranian.

           Then — BRRRRING. The phone rings.

           Trudy stops, wipes her hands and walks over to pick it up --

                                 TRUDY (CONT’D)
                        Jenny’s Jet Clean, can I help you?

           Trudy reacts calmly to the voice on the other end. Then --

           Boom. Index card. Pen. And she says...

                                 TRUDY (CONT’D)
                        This is Jane...

                    THE END
