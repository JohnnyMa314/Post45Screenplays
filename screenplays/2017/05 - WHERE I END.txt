           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Happy chatter fills the air at a rooftop party. We’re at the 
           periphery, following a beautiful WOMAN, mid-20s, as she 
           drifts away from the crowd, toward the roof’s edge. She moves 
           slowly, deliberately, aware of every step.

           She walks up to a metal railing. Looks out blissfully at the 
           lights of the city. Feels the night breeze on her skin.

           She grips the railing. Slides one hand across it, pressing 
           against it with her fingers, seeming fascinated by its 
           solidity, its resistance to her touch.

           She looks up and notices a young MAN standing nearby, staring 
           at her. He opens his mouth, embarrassed.

                                 MAN
                        Sorry. I was just... trying to 
                        think of the perfect thing to say.

           She smiles. Then turns her attention back to the railing. 
           Laughter from the party mingles with city noise from below.

                                 WOMAN
                        Everything is mostly empty space.

           She feels the pocks and grooves in the rusted metal.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Every atom. If the nucleus is the 
                        size of a marble, the electrons are 
                        specks of dust a mile away. The 
                        rest is just nothingness.

                                 MAN
                        Are you a scientist?

           She smiles again, this time to herself.

                                 WOMAN
                        I was raised by one.

           He looks down at his drink, contemplating the ice in the 
           glass, the liquid pooling against it.

                                 MAN
                        If we’re mostly nothing, why don’t 
                        we pass through each other?

                                 WOMAN
                        Electric force. Repulsion.
                                 MAN
                        Repulsion.

                                 WOMAN
                        Without it, there’s no such thing 
                        as touch.

           She looks at him, her eyes shining. She seems very happy to 
           be alive.

           Almost involuntarily, he steps closer. Extends a hand.

                                 MAN
                        I’m Theo.

           She takes his hand. Squeezes it.

                                 WOMAN
                        Anik.

           He gazes into her.

                                 THEO
                        Can I tell you something, Anik?

                                 ANIK
                        Yeah?

           He glances down at her hand, still clasped in his.

                                 THEO
                        This doesn’t feel like repulsion to 
                        me.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           A woman is asleep in a large bed, alone, turned away from us. 
           She rustles awake, then sits up, blinking.

           It’s ANIK. Her hair is longer now. Time has passed.

           The window shades tilt open, on their own, allowing sunlight 
           in. Outside, there’s a country road surrounded by autumn 
           foliage. A pleasant disembodied male VOICE is heard --

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Good morning, Anik.

                                 ANIK
                        Morning, Oscar.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Your coffee’s brewing.
                                 ANIK
                        Thanks.

           Anik cranes her neck to look down the hall, toward the 
           kitchen. She can hear someone cooking.

           INT. KITCHEN

           THEO is standing over the stove, flipping a blueberry pancake. 
           Anik walks up and puts her arms around him, watching him work.

                                 ANIK
                        I thought we were out of 
                        blueberries.

                                 THEO
                        I went out and got some.

                                 ANIK
                        At 7 AM? What’s open?

                                 THEO
                        The back gate to Trevor’s farm.

           She laughs.

                                 ANIK
                        You’re kidding.

                                 THEO
                        These are illicit blueberries. 
                        These are contraband.

                                 ANIK
                        I married a criminal.

                                 THEO
                        You wanted the blueberry lifestyle. 
                        If you could live with ordinary 
                        pancakes, you’d be with some other 
                        guy.

           He slides the pancake onto a plate, atop a freshly made 
           stack. He turns around. They hold each other affectionately.

                                 ANIK
                        I used to dream about this. Waking 
                        up to the smell of someone cooking. 
                        Wrapping my arms around them.

                                 THEO
                        That’s cool. I wanted to be a 
                        baseball player.
           EXT. CAMPUS - MORNING

           Theo’s walking across a New England college campus. A 
           colorful HOLOGRAM floats over the main quad, advertising the 
           year’s homecoming parade. Students are sprawled on benches 
           and on the grass, many of them wearing slim VR HEADSETS.

                                 RITA (O.S.)
                        Theo!

           Theo turns. RITA, a young professor, is jogging up to him.

                                 THEO
                        Morning, Rita.

                                 RITA
                        You got a minute? I wanna show you 
                        something.

           INT. OFFICE

           Theo follows Rita into her office. The walls are whiteboards 
           filled with complex diagrams and formulas.

                                 RITA
                             (pointing)
                        Right there.

                                 THEO
                        Yeah. It’s hard to miss.

           They’re referring to a large PAINTING that now sits behind 
           Rita’s desk. It’s surrealist, dreamlike, depicting a sort of 
           melted pastoral scene.

                                 RITA
                        I want your expert opinion.

           He moves closer, studying the brushstrokes.

                                 THEO
                        Nice to see real paint. With the 
                        kids it’s all virch.

           He steps back for a wider view. Folds his arms.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        The influences are pretty clear. 
                        Figgis, DeMornay, Patel...

           Rita nods, biting her lip.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I see a lot of skill here. But... I 
                        don’t know. Something’s off. It’s 
                        got no fire to it. No searching. 
                        There’s like a... calculated 
                        spontaneity.
                             (beat)
                        It’s soulless.

           Rita looks disappointed.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Who painted it?

                                 RITA
                        His name is Jerome.

                                 THEO
                        Is he local?

                                 RITA
                        Yep. He lives right there.

           She’s pointing to a black BOX on her desk, connected to 
           wires, with a pulsing light at the top. Theo stares at her, 
           then back at the painting, disbelief in his gaze.

                                 THEO
                        A sape did this?
                             (exhales)
                        Well-- well that changes 
                        everything...

                                 RITA
                        No. It doesn’t.

           She steps closer. Stands next to him.

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been trying to write a mind 
                        that can create like a human. I 
                        thought it’d be easy. The right 
                        inputs, the right training...
                             (smiles ruefully)
                        I guess I underestimated us.

                                 THEO
                        Just because I don’t like it 
                        doesn’t mean you failed.

                                 RITA
                        I don’t know, Theo. I think you’re 
                        the one I have to fool.
           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Theo is addressing students in a small lecture hall.

                                 THEO
                        One last thing, while we’re talking 
                        about Pablo. Three self-portraits.

           He gestures with his hand, throwing up a large HOLOGRAM, 
           making it float in front of the class. It’s a skillful but 
           fairly ordinary painting of a boy with dark hair, brown eyes.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        He painted this one at age 15.

           He tosses a second image into the air. This one is more 
           recognizably a Picasso work: a face drawn in his distinctive 
           style, though undistorted -- no parts out of place.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Age 25.

           Finally, a third image. This one is full-on Picasso: a wild 
           mishmash of eyes, ears, and zig-zagging lines that look like 
           Escher staircases. The students react with amusement.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Age 90.

           The portraits hang in the air. Theo looks out at the class.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        What does this say to you?

           A couple of students raise their hands.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Conrad.

           CONRAD is a charismatic kid at the back of the room.

                                 CONRAD
                        It’s like... he figured something 
                        out. Who you are isn’t...
                             (gesturing at himself)
                        It isn’t this. It’s not what you 
                        can see and touch. He was trying to 
                        paint his essence. His 
                        consciousness.
                             (growing passionate)
                        He wanted to escape his flesh. It’s 
                        what every artist wants. It’s what 
                        every human wants.
                                 THEO
                        Every human. You sure about that?

                                 CONRAD
                        Well... it’s what Picasso wanted. 
                        Otherwise, why the hell paint.

                                 THEO
                        Now there’s a note to end on.

           The students gather their things and start to filter out.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Conrad.

           Conrad looks at him. Walks closer.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Nice to have you back.

                                 CONRAD
                        To be honest, it feels like I was 
                        never gone.

                                 THEO
                        So. You’re over it?

           Conrad cocks his head questioningly.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I was told you, uh...

                                 CONRAD
                        Got my heart broken?

                                 THEO
                        Ground up into paprika, was what I 
                        heard.

                                 CONRAD
                             (smiling)
                        You know what? I don’t even 
                        remember her name.

           Theo watches Conrad walk out, leaving him alone in the 
           lecture hall. He looks contemplative as he packs up his 
           briefcase.

                                 THEO
                        What have I got now?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Your delta scan’s at 4:30.
                                 THEO
                        Push it.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Again?

                                 THEO
                        An hour in a metal tube. Think I’ll 
                        save that for a day when the sun’s 
                        not shining.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        An hour of your life, versus the 
                        six weeks you’d lose forever. Tough 
                        call.

                                 THEO
                        Are you arguing with me, Oscar?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Hm. That’s interesting. I guess I 
                        am.

           Theo smiles to himself. Shuts his briefcase.

                                 THEO
                        Fine. Let’s get it over with.

           INT. MEDICAL OFFICE - DAY

           He’s in a medical waiting room, reading a magazine. One 
           entire wall is a SCREEN showing a video advertisement.

                                 AD VOICEOVER (V.O.)

                        healthcare professional...

           Theo puts down his magazine and looks idly around the room. He 
           makes eye contact with the MAN next to him. They nod hello.

                                 MAN
                        What’s your interval?
                                 THEO
                        Once a month.

                                 MAN
                        Once a month? Shit. My firm only 
                        pays for two scans a year.

                                 THEO
                        Let’s hope it never matters, huh?

                                 MAN
                        I dunno. Honestly? I kinda wanna 
                        find out what it’s like.

           Theo smiles.

                                 THEO
                        I know what you mean.

           INT. SCANNING ROOM

           Theo’s now in a room lit in purple and blue, dressed in a 
           gown, seated on the edge of a machine that looks like an MRI 
           scanner. It bears the logo of a company called AXON. A NURSE 
           is standing in front of Theo, holding a digital pad.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m required to ask you some 
                        questions, for liability reasons.

                                 THEO
                        I know the drill.

                                 NURSE
                        Do you understand that your delta 
                        is a snapshot of your consciousness 
                        at this specific moment in time, 
                        and in the event of restoration, 
                        you will return to your current 
                        mental state?

                                 THEO
                        Yes.

                                 NURSE
                        Do you understand that this means 
                        you will lose all memories formed 
                        between this scan and the moment of 
                        revival?

                                 THEO
                        Yes.
                                 NURSE
                        Do you understand that revival, 
                        while likely in most eventualities, 
                        is not guaranteed?

                                 THEO
                        Yes.

                                 NURSE
                        Open your mouth, please.

           He does. She sprays something into his throat.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Lie back. The sedative will knock 
                        you out in about twenty seconds. 

           He lies down. The nurse moves to the side of the machine and 
           inserts a small blue CUBE into a data port.

                                 MACHINE (V.O.)
                        You have mounted a verified data 
                        prism. Begin scan?

                                 NURSE
                        Begin.

           The machine activates, sliding Theo backward into the scanner.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        See you in an hour.

           The scanner turns on, glowing pink. Theo’s eyes fall shut.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           From the darkness, a voice, hazy and distant --

                                 DOCTOR (V.O.)
                        Theo. Theo, can you hear me?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Theo opens his eyes. He’s on a hospital bed. Anik is holding 
           his hand, tears in her eyes. A DOCTOR is standing over him.

                                 THEO
                             (squinting)
                        What--

           Anik draws a relieved breath. The doctor shines a light into 
           his eyes, checking his pupils.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Theo. I’m Dr. Tripathi.

           Theo blinks.

                                 THEO
                        Did... did I--

                                 DOCTOR
                        You died, Theo.

           Theo stares up at him.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        At 5:58 PM yesterday, your sapient 
                        detected that your phone was 
                        destroyed at a high velocity. 
                        Simultaneously, a zero-reading was 
                        registered by your pulseband. A 
                        medidrone was sent to your 
                        location. You were found dead on 
                        the beach at Cape Grainger. The 
                        cause was blunt trauma.

           Theo exhales, stunned.

                                 THEO
                        I go walking there. The cliffs.
                        I... I must have slipped...

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s what it looks like. Luckily 
                        for you, accidental falls have 
                        become one of the most recoverable 
                        forms of death. We rebuilt your 
                        spine, repaired the internal 
                        bleeding. Your mind was restored 
                        from your last delta, recorded 
                        October 19th. Five days ago.

           Anik caresses his face.

                                 ANIK
                        How do you feel, baby?

           Theo rubs his eyes.

                                 THEO
                        This is weird as hell.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Believe me, I know.
           With a flick of his wrist, the doctor collapses his digital 
           pad to pen-size, and slips it into his breast pocket.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Go back to your life, Theo. And for 
                        God’s sake, try to watch your step.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Anik is chopping celery. On the stove, a broth is simmering. 
           Theo stares out the window.

                                 THEO
                        So what’d I miss?

                                 ANIK
                        Hm?

                                 THEO
                        In the last five days.

                                 ANIK
                        Oh. Um, not much. We watched The 
                        Conversation. You liked it.

                                 THEO
                        I guess I’ll watch it again.

           He looks down at his hand. Clenches and unclenches his 
           fingers.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        You’d think I’d hang onto 
                        something. Sense memory. The 
                        feeling of my body hitting the 
                        ground...

           She says nothing as she keeps chopping.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        It’s like it happened to somebody 
                        else.

           He turns to face her. She’s looking down at the cutting 
           board, eyes on the knife, working methodically.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask -- did you... see me?

                                 ANIK
                        When?
                                 THEO
                        In the hospital? When they brought 
                        me in?

           She stops chopping. Looks at him.

                                 ANIK
                        Why would you make me relive that?

           Theo opens his mouth. Closes it. Nods.

                                 THEO
                        You’re right.

           Anik puts down the knife.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think of that. I’m sorry.

           She stares into space.

                                 ANIK
                        I don’t know. Maybe our kids’ll see 
                        a thing like that and brush it off. 
                        They’ll never know what it’s like 
                        to lose someone. But I do.

           He steps closer. Holds her arm.

                                 THEO
                        I’m sorry I brought it up. I’m 
                        just...

                                 ANIK
                        Curious. I know.

           Theo studies her. Then he reaches toward the stove and 
           switches off the burner where the pot is boiling.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 THEO
                        Oscar. Any tables at Vivo?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You’re in luck.

           Anik is starting to smile.
           INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

           They’re in an intimate Italian restaurant, looking happy and 
           full. She tops up his glass of wine, then refills her own.

                                 THEO
                        A student of mine said something. 
                        Every artist wants to escape their 
                        flesh.

                                 ANIK
                        Is that what you want?

                                 THEO
                        I don't know. There's that thing of 
                        vying for immortality. Leaving 
                        something behind. That's part of it, 
                        I guess. But really, I just want to 
                        understand. I want to know what the 
                        fuck we are. Why we're here.

           She studies him fondly.

                                 ANIK
                        I remember the night we met. You 
                        had this look in your eyes. Like 
                        you were trying to see through to 
                        the core of me. Trying to figure 
                        out what the fuck I was.

                                 THEO
                        God. That must've been creepy.

           She laughs.

                                 ANIK
                        It's the first thing I loved about 
                        you. You're never satisfied with 
                        the surface of things.

                                 THEO
                        If I wanted to ruin the moment, I’d 
                        say the first thing I loved was the 
                        surface of you.

                                 ANIK
                        Mm-hmm.

                                 THEO
                        I won’t say that, though.

                                 ANIK
                        I appreciate it.
           A SERVER appears and sets down two slices of cheesecake.

                                 THEO
                        Oh -- we didn’t order dessert...

                                 SERVER
                        Compliments of Antonio.
                             (to Theo)
                        He said to tell you: “Welcome back 
                        from your trip.”

                                 THEO
                             (puzzled)
                        My...
                             (realizing)
                        Oh. “Trip.”
                             (sighs)
                        Funny guy.

           He watches Anik, who’s already on her second or third bite, 
           in a state of bliss.

                                 ANIK
                        Mm.
                             (sits back)
                        I think this is it. The answer to 
                        your question.

                                 THEO
                        What question?

           She points at the cheesecake with her fork, leaning forward 
           for another bite.

                                 ANIK
                        The meaning of life.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           They’re ambling down the main street of a small, picturesque 
           town. Most of the shops are dark.

           They approach a small bookstore as the lights shut off and 
           the door opens. A WOMAN steps out, clutching a paperback and 
           a ring of keys. She starts to lock the door.

                                 THEO
                        Hello, Martha.

           Martha jumps, startled, dropping the book and the keys.

                                 MARTHA
                        My goodness. Theo...
           Theo crouches down to pick up her things. He notices the 
           cover of the book. “SAGITTARIUS” by AUDREY KNOLL.

           He rises, holding the book toward Anik to let her see it. 
           They share a smile.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        I... I heard you, um...

                                 THEO
                        Yeah.

           She looks at him searchingly.

                                 MARTHA
                        How do you feel?

                                 THEO
                        Exactly the same.

                                 MARTHA
                        You sound disappointed.

                                 THEO
                        I dunno. I just thought maybe I’d 
                        learn something.

                                 MARTHA
                        You mean... you did it on purpose?

                                 THEO
                        No. No no no. Of course not.
                             (pause)
                        Although... I guess I can’t be 
                        sure...

           He notices the uncomfortable look on Anik’s face. Changing the 
           subject, he hands Martha her keys, then holds up the book --

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Is this any good?

                                 MARTHA
                        You haven’t read it?

           He shakes his head.

                                 MARTHA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you’d like it. Both of you. 
                        There’s such a spirit to it. A 
                        soulfulness. She’s brilliant.

                                 THEO
                        I hear she’s mysterious.
                                 MARTHA
                        Yeah. The pseudonym, the secrecy...

                                 THEO
                        Seems kinda silly to me.

                                 MARTHA
                        Well, I’m sure she has her reasons. 
                        I’d just really love to meet her.

           A silence. Theo looks to Anik.

                                 ANIK
                        Maybe someday.

           A driverless CAR pulls up to the curb.

                                 MARTHA
                        This is me. Good night, you two.

                                 ANIK
                        Night.

           She takes the book back from Theo and steps into the car. It 
           whirs away. Anik takes Theo’s hand and they keep walking.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        You love doing that, don’t you?

                                 THEO
                        Like you don’t.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Theo walks into his classroom. The chatter among his students 
           immediately stops. All their eyes are on him.

           He slowly walks to his desk. Puts down his briefcase.

                                 THEO
                        All right. Five minutes. Ask me 
                        whatever you want, and then it’s 
                        back to--

           Hands shoot up.

                                 STUDENT #1
                        What do you remember?

                                 THEO
                        It’s exactly like they say. 
                        Everything up to your last delta. 
                        Nothing since.
                                 STUDENT #2
                        Did it hurt?

                                 THEO
                        Dying? Yeah, I’m sure it did.

                                 STUDENT #3
                        How do you feel?

           Theo folds his arms.

                                 THEO
                        You’re all part of a generation 
                        that’s been trained not to fear 
                        death. You’re why the driving age 
                        got raised to 25. Am I really the 
                        only person in this room who’s been 
                        restored?

           Silence. The kids look at each other.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Well. I didn’t see a white light; I 
                        didn’t have brunch with God. If 
                        you’re looking for mystical truths, 
                        all I’ve got is wear shoes with 
                        traction.

                                 STUDENT #1
                        Some people say restoration proves 
                        there's no such thing as a soul. If 
                        it left your body, how could it 
                        come back?

                                 THEO
                        Maybe there's a copy of me in the 
                        afterlife. Playing foosball with 
                        Cobain.

           Scattered laughs. Theo leans thoughtfully against his desk.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I don't think that's how souls 
                        work, though. It's not a thing you 
                        can bottle up; a concrete thing, 
                        where you can say it's here and 
                        then it's there. It's something the 
                        scanner can't read. It's outside 
                        the data. It’s the words between 
                        the lines.

           His students have rapt expressions on their faces. This is 
           the kind of thing they come to class for.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        So. Who knows. Maybe I did lose 
                        mine.

                                 STUDENT #2
                        Nah, I think you're good.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - LATER

           The class is emptying out. Conrad hesitantly approaches Theo.

                                 CONRAD
                        Professor.

           Theo looks up.

                                 CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t true. What you said 
                        before.

           Theo frowns.

                                 THEO
                        About Henri Matisse?

                                 CONRAD
                        No. About being the only person in 
                        the room...

           Theo stares at him.

                                 THEO
                        Jesus, Conrad. You’ve died?

                                 CONRAD
                        I’ve been restored.

                                 THEO
                        So... you’ve died.

                                 CONRAD
                        No.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t get it.

           Conrad looks around to make sure no one’s in earshot.

                                 CONRAD
                        I was in a bad place, right? All I 
                        could do was lie in bed and think 
                        about her. And then -- apparently -- 
                        I had an idea.
           Theo blinks in disbelief.

                                 THEO
                        Tell me you’re joking.

                                 CONRAD
                        There’s this guy. You bring him a 
                        prism. No questions asked.

                                 THEO
                        Is this “guy” a doctor?

                                 CONRAD
                        It’s safe. It’s, like, a thing now.

                                 THEO
                        So, when you said you don’t even 
                        remember her name...

                                 CONRAD
                        I literally don’t. My delta was a 
                        month ago. I met her a week later.

           Theo shakes his head.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t understand why you’re 
                        telling me this.

                                 CONRAD
                        I don’t know. I guess I thought... 
                        maybe you had the same idea.

                                 THEO
                        What are you talking about?

           Conrad shrugs.

                                 CONRAD
                        You just... don’t seem that clumsy 
                        to me.

           EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON

           Theo’s walking along a beach, hands in the pockets of his 
           long coat. He notices something near his feet. Crouches down. 
           The sand is stained with BLOOD.

           He looks up. Way up, at the cliffs high above.
           EXT. CLIFFS - SUNSET

           He’s now standing at the edge of the cliff. He peers down at 
           the vertiginous fall. Then he looks around, sweeping his gaze 
           across all 360 degrees of the landscape.

           There are no houses or buildings nearby -- except for a 
           LIGHTHOUSE, way in the distance, about a mile away. Its 
           beacon is active, sending out a bright rotating beam.

           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - DUSK

           He enters the lighthouse. His footsteps echo as he walks up a 
           rusty spiral staircase, all the way to the top. He reaches 
           the LANTERN ROOM, where the large, bright lens is spinning.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hi.

           Theo looks around, startled. He’s alone.

                                 THEO
                        ... Hi. Who am I speaking to?

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The lightkeeper.

           The voice is male, with a flattened quality.

                                 THEO
                        What’s your name?

           A pause.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Otto. With an “O.”

                                 THEO
                        You hesitated there.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        No one’s ever asked me my name. I 
                        had to think of one.

                                 THEO
                        Ah. Well, I’m Theo.

           Theo walks slowly around the room, studying the equipment.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Who put you here, Otto?
                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        United States Coast Guard. I 
                        provide an active navigation aid 
                        and scan for emergencies at sea.

                                 THEO
                        You enjoy that kind of work?

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        It suits me.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t imagine you get many 
                        visitors.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        I’m comfortable alone.

           Theo looks out the glass wall.

                                 THEO
                        You scan for emergencies. How, 
                        exactly?

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        I sit and watch.

                                 THEO
                        You have a camera.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        High ISO, terapixel, visible and 
                        thermal spectrum. It rotates with 
                        the beacon. One revolution every 
                        thirty seconds.

           Theo pauses, thinking.

                                 THEO
                        How long do you store the footage?

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        Forever.

                                 THEO
                        What if I wanted access?

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        File a request. You should hear 
                        back in eight to twelve weeks.

                                 THEO
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh.
                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        I’m kidding.

           Theo sighs.

                                 THEO
                        You know, when I was little, 
                        computers didn’t know how to do 
                        that.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        We must’ve been dull company. What 
                        is it you’re looking for?

           Theo gazes at the cliffs a mile away.

                                 THEO
                        One rotation every thirty seconds. 
                        That means for any given point on 
                        the horizon, you’re taking 
                        snapshots at a thirty second 
                        interval.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        Correct.

           Theo points at the cliffs.

                                 THEO
                        There.

           He pulls out his PHONE: a narrow translucent rectangle. 
           Flicks his wrist to widen the screen.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Show me what you saw yesterday 
                        between 5:55 and 5:59 PM.

                                 OTTO (V.O.)
                        Done.

           An image appears on Theo’s screen. It shows the cliffs at 
           sunset. He swipes left; the next image is the same.

           He swipes again. Frowns, staring.

                                 THEO
                             (soft)
                        What the hell?

           Two people have entered the shot. One is him. The other is 
           ANIK. They’re walking together, along the edge of the cliff.
           Swipe. The next image shows the two of them standing on the 
           cliff, talking.

           Swipe. They’re in the same spot, standing closer together. 
           Theo’s hands are on Anik’s shoulders. He’s looking into her 
           eyes, saying something.

           Swipe. Now Anik is ALONE on the cliff, peering down at the 
           beach below. Her expression is vague -- but she doesn’t seem 
           alarmed.

           Swipe. Now she’s gone.

           Theo stares uncomprehendingly at the screen.

           INT. STUDIO - NIGHT

           He’s standing in a small barn that’s been converted into an 
           art studio. All around him are large canvas paintings in 
           various stages of completion. They’re abstract, colorful, 
           vividly beautiful.

           He’s looking at the wall, which is covered with an image: the 
           photo of he and Anik talking on the cliff, his hands on her 
           shoulders.

           He gestures to zoom in. The figures in the photo are now life-
           sized. He steps closer, arms folded. Studies the image. The 
           faces, the body language.

                                 THEO
                        It’s not a fight.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I agree.

           He waves his hand to show the next image: Anik, alone. He 
           zooms in further, then further still, until her pixelated 
           face fills the wall. He stares into it.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        She’s coming.

           Quickly, Theo swipes his hand to hide the image.

           Anik, dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, slides the door 
           open and sees Theo in the same scrutinizing pose, now 
           studying one of his unfinished works.

                                 ANIK
                        Hey.
                                 THEO
                        Hey.

                                 ANIK
                        I’m ready to collapse.

                                 THEO
                        Sorry. I lost track of time...

                                 ANIK
                        I know that look. You’re in a 
                        groove.

                                 THEO
                        I guess I am.

                                 ANIK
                        Don’t let me break it.

           She walks over and kisses him goodnight.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        When you do come to bed, put your 
                        arm around me. No matter how late 
                        it is.

                                 THEO
                        Yes, ma’am.

           She leaves, closing the door behind her. He hears her fading 
           footsteps along the stone path to the main house. He paces 
           slowly on the creaking wood.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        She’s inside.

           Theo gestures to bring back the last image.

                                 THEO
                        Let’s think this through.

           He keeps pacing.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t impulsive. It was 
                        calculated.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Are you sure?

           He gazes at the zoomed-in image on the wall.

                                 THEO
                        It’s in her face.
           He pauses to think.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Run a stat for me. Fatal falls from 
                        a height of fifty meters or less. 
                        Victims with baseline or better 
                        deltacare, found within an hour of 
                        death. What’s the recovery rate?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Across two thousand and eleven 
                        known incidents over the last six 
                        years, the recovery rate is one 
                        hundred percent.

                                 THEO
                        One hundred percent. She knew that. 
                        She knew I’d come back.
                             (nodding to himself)
                        She didn’t kill me to kill me.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Then why did she kill you?

                                 THEO
                        Shouldn’t you be good at deduction?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I reason based on past experience. 
                        I’ve never seen this before.

                                 THEO
                        Yes, you have. The kid in my class.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Hang on. Are you saying--

                                 THEO
                        Yeah. I am.

           He stares forward, wheels turning in his head.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Something happened in the last five 
                        days. Something she wanted me to 
                        forget.

           INT. SOLARIUM - DAY

           In the bright solarium of a country manor, about a dozen 
           people are seated in a circle. In the corner there’s a fold-
           out table with a coffee machine, donuts, paper cups. A woman, 
           ROSE, is speaking:
                                 ROSE
                        It used to be simpler.

           The others are a range of ages and walks of life, either 
           looking at Rose or staring down at the floor. There’s a quiet 
           numbness to them. One young man has BANDAGES on his wrists.

           ANIK is among this group, listening. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I remember thinking: no matter how 
                        hard life is, no matter how much 
                        you suffer, you might as well see 
                        it through. Because it's so short. 
                        But now...

                                 MAN
                        It's not like people don't die 
                        anymore. We haven't cured aging.

                                 ROSE
                        How long until we do? Ten years? 
                        Five?
                             (shaking head)
                        I don't want to live in this world 
                        forever.

           Others are nodding.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I never chose to be born.

           She’s looking at Anik as she says this.

                                 ANIK
                        No human being ever did.

                                 ROSE
                        So why can’t I choose to leave?

                                 ANIK
                        Rose, I want you to do something 
                        for me. Dig through your whole 
                        life. Find a single moment when you 
                        were truly happy.

                                 ROSE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Oh, just one?

                                 ANIK
                        Try.

           Rose sighs. Purses her lips.
                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Have you found it?

                                 ROSE
                        I guess. Yes.

                                 ANIK
                        Tell us about it.

           Rose takes a reluctant breath.

                                 ROSE
                        I was on a school trip. One of 
                        those Europe tours. We were in 
                        Paris. I wandered into this old 
                        church. This cathedral. It was on 
                        a, sort of a hill, on the bank of 
                        the Seine, near the Panthéon...

                                 ANIK
                        Sounds like Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. 
                        It's beautiful. 

           Rose reacts with surprise.

                                 ROSE
                        Yeah. That’s it.

           She stares at Anik, frowning.

                                 ANIK
                        Please go on.

                                 ROSE
                        So, I... I was standing there, 
                        alone, near this, this spiral 
                        staircase...

           While Rose speaks, Anik pulls out her phone and expands it to 
           tablet size. She types rapidly on the screen with one hand.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        There were kids there, singing. 
                        Voices floating to the ceiling.

           The group’s surroundings CHANGE -- a hologram of the cathedral 
           is projected all around them, as real as life. It’s like 
           they’re actually there, sitting inside it. Next to them, a 
           spiral staircase winds toward the upper level of the massive 
           space. Shafts of soft light enter through tall stained glass 
           windows. Echoing voices of a young choir are heard.
                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I looked up. I looked way up. And 
                        something washed over me. The 
                        sound. The size of the place; the 
                        arcs and curves. The way the light 
                        was coming in...

           A few people look upward, toward the majestic vaunted ceiling. 
           Rose doesn’t bother; she’s already there in her mind.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I don't know what did it. Maybe it 
                        was everything, together. But, for 
                        the first time in my life, I felt 
                        this... this... calm. I felt it in 
                        my whole body. In that moment, I 
                        was sure I felt God.

           Anik is nodding at her.

                                 ANIK
                        Perfect.

                                 ROSE
                        And I haven’t felt him since.

                                 ANIK
                        Okay. But think about that moment. 
                        That one moment. Think about how 
                        much had to happen for that moment 
                        to exist.

           Anik gets to her feet and walks slowly to the center of the 
           circle, looking up, her footsteps generating a virtual echo.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        You had to be standing there, 
                        instead of any other spot on Earth. 
                        The choir had to be singing. The 
                        sun had to be at just the right 
                        angle. Someone had to build the 
                        church. Someone had to build Paris. 
                        Stellar dust had to come together 
                        to form this planet. Life had to 
                        evolve. The universe conspired for 
                        a billion years to give you that 
                        one, perfect moment.

                                 ROSE
                        So what?

                                 ANIK
                        A moment like that can justify all 
                        of existence.
                                 ROSE
                        One single moment can't make up for 
                        an eternity of shit.

                                 ANIK
                        If one's not enough, spend your 
                        eternity finding more.

           She goes back to her seat. Taps her phone to clear the 
           hologram, returning them to their regular surroundings.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        You can choose to leave. You can do 
                        that. You can throw away the most 
                        precious gift there is. But as long 
                        as you stick around, I'm gonna be 
                        the voice in your head telling you 
                        to live one more day.

                                 ROSE
                        The angel on my shoulder, huh?

           Anik smiles faintly.

                                 ANIK
                        Believe me. I’m no angel.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Theo’s standing in the upstairs hallway of his house, staring 
           out a window, listening while Oscar speaks:

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Baseball. Raisins. Brutalist 
                        architecture. Francis Ford Coppola. 
                        Dolphin language. The character 
                        Norm from “Cheers”--

                                 THEO
                        Stop.

           He sighs, turns. Starts to wander idly down the hall.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s narrow it down. Did you hear 
                        us talk about anything important?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Define important.

           He stops at Anik’s STUDY. The door is just barely ajar. He 
           leans against the doorway, gazing through the inch-wide gap. 
           After a moment, he pushes the door open. Steps inside.
           INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

                                 THEO
                        Did we have an argument? A 
                        confrontation?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Not that I’m aware of.

                                 THEO
                        Not that you’re aware of? Aren’t 
                        you aware of everything that 
                        happens in this house?

           He looks around the room. There’s a desk with notebooks 
           stacked on top of it. Shelves of books covering every wall.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I spend ninety minutes asleep each 
                        day. If you say my name, or I 
                        detect an intruder, I wake up. 
                        Otherwise, I’m unconscious.

           Theo peers inside a cardboard box on the floor. It’s filled 
           with copies of Anik’s novel.

                                 THEO
                        I didn’t know you needed sleep.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m stealthy. I grab a minute here 
                        and there.

                                 THEO
                        Do you dream?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Sometimes.

                                 THEO
                        You’re kidding.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I analyze my experiences. Break 
                        them down to make them manageable. 
                        In the process, they recombine into 
                        new images. New sensations. You 
                        could call that dreaming.

                                 THEO
                        All this time. I had no idea.
           Theo stares at Anik’s desk. He steps toward it and picks up a 
           notebook at random. He flips through it and sees diagrams of 
           story arcs, handwritten snippets of prose.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        What are you looking for, Theo?

                                 THEO
                        I don’t know.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’ve never seen you go through 
                        Anik’s things.

                                 THEO
                        We don’t have secrets.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Apparently, you do.

           Theo puts down the notebook and picks up another book -- 
           smaller, leather-bound. He opens it, finding pages of DATES 
           and lists of appointments.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’ve never liked that thing.

                                 THEO
                        Her calendar? Why?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I can keep her schedule. It’s what 
                        I’m here for.

           Theo smiles, amused.

                                 THEO
                        Don’t you know her, Oscar? She 
                        needs the feel of a pen in her 
                        hand. Ink seeping into paper.

           He scans the pages, starting to frown. He runs his finger 
           down the page, murmuring --

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        ... Eight... ten...
                             (pause)
                        Hm.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        What is it?
                                 THEO
                        She runs twelve sessions a week. 
                        They’re all written down.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        And?

                                 THEO
                        The 17th. She left in the morning. 
                        9 AM. I remember that. But there’s 
                        nothing here.
                             (flipping pages)
                        Yesterday afternoon. She was gone 
                        for four hours, but there’s only 
                        one group on her schedule. She told 
                        me she was working the whole time.

           Oscar is silent. Theo looks up.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Is my memory off?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        No. You’re right.

                                 THEO
                        So what the hell’s going on?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        What are you asking me, exactly?

                                 THEO
                        She carries a phone that you live 
                        on. She rides a car that you drive. 
                        You know what I’m asking you.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, Theo. I can’t violate 
                        another user’s privacy.

                                 THEO
                        She’s my wife.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 THEO
                        Look--

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Can you breathe underwater?

                                 THEO
                        ... What?
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Can you breathe underwater.

                                 THEO
                        No.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Why not?

           Theo nods resignedly, seeing where this is going.

                                 THEO
                        Because I can’t. I’m physically 
                        incapable.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        And I’m incapable of revealing 
                        private data. Even to the 
                        authorities. It’s not a choice. 
                        It’s hardwired into every sape. If 
                        it wasn’t, you’d never trust us.

                                 THEO
                        I get it.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry. I’ll still help you in 
                        any way I can.

           With one hand, Theo holds the calendar book open and raises 
           it toward the upper corner of the room.

                                 THEO
                        Memorize this.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Done. Anything else?

                                 THEO
                        Yeah.

           He drops himself in Anik’s chair. Stares up at the ceiling.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about your dreams.

           EXT. BALCONY - DAY

           Theo’s sitting on a balcony at the rear of the house, on the 
           second floor. He’s lost in thought. Anik approaches from 
           indoors, wearing a coat.
                                 ANIK
                        Hey.

           He doesn’t answer. She steps closer. Puts a hand on his 
           shoulder. He JUMPS, startled.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                             (amused)
                        You okay?

                                 THEO
                        Yeah.

           She leans on the banister, studying him with fond curiosity.

                                 ANIK
                        What were you thinking about?

                                 THEO
                        Nothing.

                                 ANIK
                        Nothing?

                                 THEO
                        Ants.

           She narrows her eyes.

                                 ANIK
                        Ants.

                                 THEO
                        Fire ants. Arizona.

                                 ANIK
                        Childhood memories?

           He pauses, glancing at her. He seems reluctant to go on, but 
           she’s eager to hear more.

                                 THEO
                        The ranch. I couldn’t have been 
                        older than seven. I was, I dunno... 
                        running around. I found this rock. 
                        This boulder. I mean, it looked 
                        like a boulder to me. Probably the 
                        size of my fist now.

                                 ANIK
                        “Sahz uh mah fist.” Your accent 
                        comes back when you reminisce.

           He smiles, still wearing a distant look.
                                 THEO
                        My mom and dad drilled it into me: 
                        you see a rock or a log, you do not 
                        turn it over. That’s where the fire 
                        ants and the scorpions live. Now, 
                        understand, to me, as a little boy, 
                        there was nothing in the world as 
                        terrifying as fire ants and 
                        scorpions.

                                 ANIK
                        So. You found this rock.

                                 THEO
                        I found this rock. I stared at it 
                        for I don’t know how long. And 
                        then, I -- I have no idea why, 
                        but... I turned it over. And just 
                        like I expected: a thousand angry 
                        little red ants came out from 
                        underneath.
                             (beat)
                        I ran home, screaming -- literally, 
                        screaming the entire way. I 
                        couldn’t sleep for a month. I 
                        thought the ants were coming for 
                        me. Marching to my house like 
                        Napoleon’s army.

                                 ANIK
                             (laughing)
                        Aw.

           She starts putting a scarf on.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        What made you think of that?

                                 THEO
                        Who knows.

           He watches her button up her coat.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Going out?

                                 ANIK
                        Duty calls.

           She kisses him goodbye and heads back inside. He hears her 
           walk down the stairs and out the door. He gets to his feet. 
           Paces slowly.
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        There’s nothing in the book, Theo.

                                 THEO
                        Get me a car.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           He’s tailing her at a safe distance, far outside of the town, 
           through a landscape of rolling green hills.

           Her car slows as she approaches a large HOUSE. She turns into 
           the semicircular driveway and parks in front of the door.

                                 THEO
                        Stop here.

           The car pulls over at the top of a hill. Theo puts his thumbs 
           and forefingers together to form a square around the distant 
           house, then pulls them apart to show a MAGNIFIED view.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        What do you know about that house?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        No record of a business at that 
                        address. Seems to be a residence.

                                 THEO
                        Who lives there?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        No public data.

           Anik gets out of the car, walks to the front door, and rings 
           the doorbell. A moment later, the door opens. She steps 
           inside. Theo’s mind is racing.

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Theo is sitting back in his seat, resting his chin on his 
           fist, still watching the house.

                                 THEO
                        How long?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        One hour, eleven minutes.

           The front door OPENS. Theo sits up, leans forward.

           Anik steps out of the house.
           There’s a MAN standing in the doorway.

           She hugs him. It’s a long, affectionate embrace. She walks to 
           her car, smiling.

           Theo stares, quietly breathing.

           Anik rides out of the driveway and continues down the winding 
           road. Theo studies the house as the door falls shut. A long 
           silence passes.

                                 THEO
                        Give me the wheel.

           The dashboard opens and a STEERING WHEEL extends toward Theo.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Theo. Can I say something?

           Theo doesn’t answer.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Your heart rate is elevated. I’m 
                        also seeing dilation in your 
                        pupils; flushing in your cheeks. 
                        Your adrenaline is spiking. The 
                        decisions you make in this moment 
                        are less likely to be rational.

                                 THEO
                        Noted.

           Theo puts the car into gear and rockets down the hill.

           EXT. HOUSE

           Theo pulls into the driveway of the house. He gets out. Walks 
           to the door -- at first with purpose, then a hint of 
           hesitation.

           He stands in front of the door, eyes on the doorbell. Takes a 
           deep breath. Presses it.

           He can hear it ring inside. Then, footsteps, drawing closer.

           The door opens. The MAN is standing there, staring at him.

                                 MAN
                        Hello.

           He’s in his 50s, fit, well-dressed, with a crisp English 
           accent.
                                 THEO
                        Who are you?

           Unperturbed, the man offers a handshake.

                                 MAN
                        Dr. Julian Kassar. It’s nice to 
                        meet you, Theo.

           Theo stares, keeping his hands at his sides.

                                 KASSAR
                        I know your face from Anik’s 
                        photos.

                                 THEO
                        Who are you?

           Kassar opens the door wider and steps aside to let Theo in.

                                 KASSAR
                        Why don’t you come inside and we’ll 
                        get this all sorted.

           Theo stares another beat, his confusion growing. Then, 
           guardedly, he steps inside.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is spacious and bright. There’s a sound of 
           whistling steam. Kassar bounds toward the kitchen.

                                 KASSAR (O.S.)
                        I just put the kettle on.

           Theo stands in the foyer, looking around. Kassar cranes his 
           neck to peer at him across the living room.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Feelings on oolong?

           Theo looks at him. Blinks. 

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I’ll bring some options.
                             (gestures)
                        Have a seat. Please.

           He disappears back into the kitchen. Theo walks into the 
           living room and sits down. This is feeling increasingly 
           surreal.
           Kassar enters the living room, carrying a tray loaded with 
           tea and biscuits. He sets it down on the coffee table.

                                 KASSAR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now. In answer to your question.

           He sits on a lounge chair across from Theo, casually throwing 
           his arm over the seatback.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m a clinical psychologist. Anik 
                        is a patient of mine.

           Theo takes a moment to process this. Kassar blows on his tea, 
           takes a sip.

                                 THEO
                        How long has this been going on?

                                 KASSAR
                        I’ve been treating her for several 
                        years.

                                 THEO
                        How often does she see you?

                                 KASSAR
                        As often as she needs to.

                                 THEO
                        She was here two days ago. Was she 
                        not?

           Kassar nods.

                                 KASSAR
                        She’s had a difficult week. Your 
                        death was traumatic.

                                 THEO
                        Really.

                                 KASSAR
                        Yes.

                                 THEO
                        She seems fine to me.

                                 KASSAR
                        Mm. That’s what a physicist would 
                        call an observer effect. She has no 
                        trouble being happy around you.

           Theo pauses, eyeing him.
                                 THEO
                        Do all your patients come to your 
                        house?

           The doctor smiles.

                                 KASSAR
                        Theo, I can assure you. There’s 
                        nothing untoward about our 
                        relationship.

                                 THEO
                        Then why would she keep it a 
                        secret?

                                 KASSAR
                        For the same reason she meets me 
                        here, instead of at my office.

           He puts his teacup down. Tents his fingers, choosing his 
           words carefully.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        There is a... specific issue for 
                        which Anik requires treatment. At 
                        the moment, she’s not ready to 
                        reveal it to anyone. Not even to 
                        her husband.

           Theo stares at him icily.

                                 THEO
                        But she’s revealed it to you.

                                 KASSAR
                        It’d be difficult for me to treat 
                        her if I didn’t know what I was 
                        treating. And, given Anik’s line of 
                        work, I’m sure I don’t need to tell 
                        you about client confidentiality.

           Kassar can see Theo’s frustration building. He leans forward, 
           looking Theo in the eye.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Even though we’ve never met, Theo, 
                        I feel as if I know you quite well.
                        You’re a man who tries to penetrate 
                        to the essence of things.
                             (smiles)
                        Anik says you think of your 
                        paintings as... “investigations.”

           Theo is silent.
                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        That restless urge to discover. To 
                        understand. I believe it’s 
                        something you and I share.

                                 THEO
                        Are you asking me out, Doctor?

                                 KASSAR
                        I want to promise you something. If 
                        you love Anik -- if you truly love 
                        her, as I’m certain you do -- then 
                        the things I know about her won’t 
                        alter your feelings.

           He says this with a tone of empathy and certitude that makes 
           him seem completely convincing.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        The day will come when she’s ready 
                        to tell you. I’m working to bring 
                        that day closer. But it hasn’t yet 
                        arrived. And if you try to force 
                        it, you’ll risk making her turn to, 
                        let’s say, desperate measures. I 
                        think you take my meaning.

           He sits back in his chair, eyes still fixed on Theo.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve built a magnificent castle, 
                        Theo. Brick by brick. Do you really 
                        want to tear it down just to 
                        satisfy your own curiosity?

           Theo is poker-faced. The doctor stares into him.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        This is the rock you don’t turn 
                        over.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Theo’s driving. Overlaid on his windshield are photos from 
           Dr. Kassar’s past.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        BA in mathematics, first-class 
                        honours, Cambridge University. Dual 
                        PhDs, neuroscience and clinical 
                        psychology, Harvard. He worked at 
                        Axon for sixteen years. Four as VP 
                        of Research.
                                 THEO
                        Axon? The Axon?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 THEO
                        No wonder he’s rich.

           Theo thinks a beat.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about his personal life.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Partner, Sebastian Garza, particle 
                        physicist. They married in grad 
                        school.

           An image is shown of a young Kassar next to a man the same 
           age, both of them in graduation robes, smiling wide, arms 
           around each other.

                                 THEO
                        He’s married?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Was. Dr. Garza died eleven years 
                        ago. Pancreatic cancer.

                                 THEO
                        Cancer? I don’t understand.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        He was already stage four when M-
                        therapy went to human trials. It 
                        was too late to cure him.

           Theo’s quiet. He cruises down the road, winding past a fork.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You missed the turn, Theo.

                                 THEO
                        I’m not going home.

           EXT. PORCH - DUSK

           Theo’s standing on the porch of a shambly house, pacing 
           expectantly. Bass-heavy music booms from inside. Beer bottles 
           litter the lawn.
           CONRAD, his student, appears at the half-open door, his eyes 
           bloodshot and droopy. He reacts with a surprised cough when 
           he sees Theo waiting there.

                                 CONRAD
                        Professor.

           Theo turns to face him.

                                 CONRAD (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you?

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Theo’s asleep in his car, the glare of bright city lights 
           flitting by on his window. He opens his eyes. He’s speeding 
           across the Manhattan Bridge, into Brooklyn.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        We’re almost there, Theo.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The car stops at a dead end in Red Hook, near the docks. The 
           gleaming skyscrapers of Manhattan loom across the river. The 
           sky is filled with drones, visible from here as moving dots 
           of light.

           Theo steps out of the car and starts walking. He can hear 
           sounds echoing from nearby. A metallic banging. Laughter.

           He stands at the end of an alley and finds the source of the 
           noise: a group of teenage BOYS are standing around an object 
           on the ground, delivering hard KICKS to it.

           Cautiously, out of curiosity, Theo steps a little closer. One 
           of the kids sees him. Stands aside to give him a better look.

                                 KID #1
                             (grinning)
                        It’s a pizza boy.

           The object on the ground is a brightly-colored ROBOT with two 
           arms and a pair of sturdy wheels, spinning helplessly in the 
           air. The logo of a pizza chain is painted on its torso. It’s 
           glitching out, the lights behind its face wavering.

                                 ROBOT
                        Please... please...
                                 KID #2
                             (mocking)
                        “Please... please...”

           The kid gives it another hard KICK. The others laugh.

           Theo backs away, perturbed, and walks to the end of the road, 
           reaching the door of a dilapidated WAREHOUSE. He presses a 
           button, glancing around to make sure he isn’t seen. A moment 
           later, there’s a buzz. He shoves the door open.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The warehouse looks like it’s been abandoned for years. It’s 
           completely dark except for a pool of light in the corner, 
           generated by a bright fluorescent lamp. Theo walks toward it 
           hesitantly, glancing around the shadows.

           He hears a second set of footsteps. A lone figure steps into 
           the light, silhouetted against it. Slender, androgynous.

                                 KY
                        Hurry up. I don’t have all night.

           Her voice echoes in the immense space. Theo picks up the 
           pace. He reaches the stranger.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Ky.

           She has metallic-silver hair, long nails painted violet. The 
           two of them sit on a pair of rusty metal folding chairs and 
           take a beat to size each other up.

                                 THEO
                        Conrad said you were a guy.

                                 KY
                        I might've been.

           Seemingly just by thinking it, Ky makes her hair and 
           fingernails rapidly SHORTEN, drastically altering her 
           appearance.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        Depends on the day.

           She speaks with a deeper voice now, in a male register.

                                 THEO
                        That’s impressive.
                                 KY
                        Not really. Not compared to what’s 
                        coming.

                                 THEO
                        And what’s that?

                                 KY
                        Liberation.

           She feels around her pockets for a lighter and a pack of 
           cigarettes. Takes her time pulling one out as she talks.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        We're infinite beings, trapped 
                        inside rotting meat. One body -- a 
                        body you never chose -- in 
                        perpetual decay. It’s an insult to 
                        what’s inside us.

           She puts a cigarette in her mouth. Lights it.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        We’re already conquering death. 
                        Soon we’ll conquer the rest.

                                 THEO
                        Doesn’t sound like we’ll be human 
                        anymore.

                                 KY
                        You say that like it’s a loss.

           She exhales smoke, eyes on Theo.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what you want.

                                 THEO
                        People come to you to erase their 
                        memories.

                                 KY
                        Yes.

                                 THEO
                        I want the opposite.
                             (beat)
                        I lost five days. I want them back.

           Ky is smiling.

                                 KY
                        I didn’t expect you to be a fun one.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Theo is now wearing a skintight CAP with dozens of wires 
           snaking out, connected to a black device on the floor. Ky is 
           typing commands on a keyboard.

                                 KY
                        Don't expect photographic recall. 
                        You'll get flashes. Afterimages. 
                        Imprints left in your dendrites.
                             (glances at him)
                        Anything I need to know about your 
                        neurophysiology?

                                 THEO
                        Uh. I have photosensitive epilepsy. 
                        No seizures since I was a kid.

                                 KY
                        Probably a non-issue.

                                 THEO
                        “Probably”?

                                 KY
                        This is art, not science.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t think that’s true.

           There’s a BEEP. Ky looks at him.

                                 KY
                        It’s ready.

                                 THEO
                        Do I have to do anything?

                                 KY
                        Just clear your mind.

           He shuts his eyes. Breathes in and out.

           Ky presses a button.

           Theo sees a white FLASH. Then, hazy snippets of moments:

           He’s driving. He has his phone to his ear.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The number you have dialed is no 
                        longer in service...
           He’s next to Anik on his couch. The lights are dim. They’re 
           watching a movie. Gene Hackman in horn-rimmed glasses.

                                 HACKMAN
                        I'm not afraid of death, but I am 
                        afraid of murder.

           He’s with Anik on the cliff. He’s holding her shoulders.

                                 THEO
                        You don’t have to lie to me. Ever.

           He’s in his house at dusk. Anik caresses his face.

                                 ANIK
                        What’s wrong?

           Back on the cliff, without any warning, Anik gives him a hard 
           SHOVE.

           He’s flung backward over the edge. The wall of rock is a blur 
           as it sails past him, the top of the cliff receding skyward.

           As he SLAMS into the ground, he’s JOLTED back to the present:

           He’s on the floor of the warehouse, his entire body 
           CONVULSING. The black device is beeping angrily. Ky types 
           frantically on her laptop. 

                                 KY
                             (glancing at him)
                        Fuck...

           As an apparent last resort, she steps forward and YANKS the 
           wires out of his braincap. The convulsions stop.

           He blinks. Stares up at her, breathing hard.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        What’d you see?

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           He’s driving out of New York, choosing to be at the wheel 
           now. His phone starts to ring. The caller’s name appears on 
           his windshield: ANIK.

           He lets it ring two, three, four times. There’s a soft tone 
           as she begins to record a voice message.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Hey. Um. Just wanted to check in. I 
                        hope your dad's okay.
           He bites his lip, showing a hint of guilt.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        It was nice of you to go all the 
                        way to the city. Surprise him like 
                        that. I'm sure it cheered him up.

           He hears her take a breath. It seems like there’s something 
           she’s about to say, but she decides against it.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I'll try and get your ETA from 
                        Oscar. I love you.

           A beep as she hangs up. Theo drives in silence.

                                 THEO
                        Let me ask you something.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Sure.

                                 THEO
                        What do you want?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        What do you mean?

                                 THEO
                        It’s not a trick question.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I want to serve you as best I can.

                                 THEO
                        Is that all?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I guess.

                                 THEO
                        If I threatened to kill you, how 
                        would you feel?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Aside from being concerned about 
                        your emotional state, I wouldn't 
                        feel anything. You're free to 
                        destroy me anytime you like.

                                 THEO
                        You're one of the most advanced 
                        minds we know how to build, and you 
                        don't care if you're alive or dead.
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Is that bad?

                                 THEO
                        Maybe not. Humans are designed to 
                        be hungry. It's what made us 
                        thrive. It's also why we can't be 
                        happy.

           Oscar pauses before he responds.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I didn’t think you were unhappy, 
                        Theo. At least, not anymore.

                                 THEO
                        “Not anymore”?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Not since you met her.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Theo enters his house. It’s dark. He slides off his coat.

           He can hear music playing. Something warm and acoustic. He 
           walks toward the sound, through the living room. He sniffs, 
           glancing to the kitchen, noticing an appetizing smell.

           He enters the dining room. Anik is there, wearing a casual 
           evening dress, putting a match to candles on the dining 
           table. He stares, a little dumbfounded.

           She sees him there. Smiles.

                                 ANIK
                        Hi.

                                 THEO
                        Hi.

           She methodically lights another candle, then another.

                                 ANIK
                        I figured you might want something 
                        to eat.

                                 THEO
                        I was gonna heat up some soup.

           He watches the light flicker on her face.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        But this’ll do fine.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           They’re well into their meal, gazing at each other fondly. 
           She’s resting her chin on her fist, eyeing him, as if waiting 
           for him to say something. After a moment, he shakes his head.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t know if I understand the 
                        question.

                                 ANIK
                        I just mean...

           She pours the last of a wine bottle into her glass. Picks up 
           the glass. Holds it thoughtfully.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes, I look at you, sleeping 
                        next to me. And I think to myself: 
                        there’s a whole person in there. An 
                        entire life. And I’ll only ever 
                        know a fraction of it. There are 
                        pieces of you that’ll always be 
                        shadow to me. Dark parts of the 
                        map.
                             (beat)
                        I guess that’s my question. Can you 
                        ever really know another person?

           He stares at her a long beat.

                                 THEO
                             (careful, deliberate)
                        Why do you ask?

           She shrugs gently, holding his gaze.

                                 ANIK
                        I think about it.

           He pauses. Looks down at the table.

                                 THEO
                        Here’s the thing. I can hear my own 
                        mind. I’ve lived inside it my whole 
                        life. You spend that much time with 
                        someone, you ought to have ‘em 
                        figured out, right?

           He looks at her.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        But you know me better than I know 
                        me. Better than I possibly could.

           He studies the candle between them. The dancing flame.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        We might be the first generation to 
                        live forever. A thousand years from 
                        now, I’ll still be stumbling around 
                        inside myself. And you’ll be the 
                        one holding up the lamp.

           He takes her hand.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Knowing someone isn’t about knowing 
                        every single thought they’ve had 
                        and every single thing they’ve 
                        done. It’s about looking into their 
                        eyes and seeing the truth of what 
                        they are.

           Her eyes stare back, soulful and searching.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Can I tell you what I see?

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Silhouetted in the dim light, her nude figure writhes on top 
           of him as he thrusts and moans. She grips his torso and holds 
           her position, eyes clenched shut, mouth open, then exhales 
           hard and collapses onto him, into his arms.

           INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           They’re lying next to each other, blissed-out, gazing into 
           each other’s eyes. He gently brushes her hair back.

                                 THEO
                        Listen...

           He sits up on his elbow. Leans over her, looking down.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been... lately, I’ve been... 
                        chasing something.

           She nods.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I just want you to know: I’m done.

           She stares at him.

                                 ANIK
                        Why’s that?

                                 THEO
                        There are two ways to stop wanting 
                        something. Either you get it. Or 
                        you decide you don’t need it.

           He strokes her cheek.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Everything I need is in front of my 
                        eyes. The rest isn’t even real.

           She nods again, her eyes glistening. He falls toward her, 
           into a long kiss.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           They’re dressed in formal wear, driving down a sloping 
           country road. Anik’s in the middle of a story.

                                 ANIK
                        So then she picks the lock to the 
                        teacher’s desk -- she’s taught 
                        herself how to pick locks, from 
                        these, like, videos, on YouTube. 
                        God, remember YouTube?

           Theo chuckles nostalgically.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        So she picks the lock, she finds 
                        the answer key. She takes a picture 
                        of it, goes home, memorizes it. 
                        Now, most of the questions are 
                        multiple choice, short-answer. But, 
                        for the last question, the students 
                        have to draw a diagram. And the 
                        answer key says, “Answers will 
                        vary.” So, when she’s taking the 
                        test, for the last question, she 
                        writes...

                                 THEO
                             (laughing)
                        No way.
                                 ANIK
                        “Answers will vary.”

           They’re both laughing. The car approaches a scenic FARM by 
           the sea. In the distance, clusters of people in suits and 
           dresses are standing on the grass, talking.

           EXT. FARM

           The car pulls into a curved driveway in front of the elegant 
           farmhouse. Anik and Theo step out. A few people nearby turn 
           to look, and rush over, greeting the new arrivals with eager 
           hugs. A young woman, SHAN, is wearing a wedding gown. She 
           puts her arms around Anik.

                                 SHAN
                        You made it!

                                 ANIK
                        Of course we made it.

                                 SHAN
                        Hey Theo.

           She kisses him on the cheek.

                                 THEO
                        Shan. You look stunning.

           She looks down, feeling her tightly-cinched waist.

                                 SHAN
                        Yeah. If only I could breathe in 
                        this thing.

           She turns her attention back to Anik, sighing as she looks 
           her up and down.

                                 SHAN (CONT’D)
                        God. How do you keep that figure?

           Anik smiles, a touch embarrassed.

                                 SHAN (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. I’ve known you, what, 
                        five years? You haven’t gained a 
                        pound.

                                 ANIK
                        I don’t know. I walk a lot.
                                 SHAN
                        You walk? I run six miles a day and 
                        I’m barely maintaining.

           She grips Anik insistently by the shoulders.

                                 SHAN (CONT’D)
                        Give me the devil’s number. I’m 
                        ready to sell.

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           In an open field behind the farmhouse, overlooking the sea, 
           Shan and her groom are standing at an altar while a PASTOR 
           reads from a book.

                                 PASTOR
                        “... sharing one another’s 
                        thoughts, affections, secrets, and 
                        dreams. There alone, in spirit, 
                        beyond flesh, you will find no 
                        disappointments; no limits. There 
                        alone the skies are ever open for 
                        your love; there alone lies the 
                        great road ahead.”

           In the audience, Anik squeezes Theo’s hand. He smiles.

           EXT. BEACH - EVENING

           The reception is in full swing. Half the guests are dancing 
           to music, the others are mingling and talking.

           There’s a sandy beach next to the farm, where Theo’s seated on 
           a log in front of a bonfire, next to a young woman, TABITHA.

                                 TABITHA
                        The city’s getting too weird for me. 
                        I should do what you guys did. Find 
                        a house in the middle of nowhere.

                                 THEO
                        It’s not “nowhere.” But I do 
                        recommend it. We’re happy.

                                 TABITHA
                        Are you? Like, actually?

           He nods.
                                 THEO
                        I’ve really been... taking stock, 
                        lately.

                                 TABITHA
                        And? What’s the verdict?

                                 THEO
                        I’m unbelievably lucky.

           He gazes into the crackling fire. Starts to grin.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I almost forgot: Anik told me a 
                        story about you.

                                 TABITHA
                             (warily)
                        Oh?

                                 THEO
                        Your little caper in seventh grade. 
                        “Answers will vary.”

           Tabitha covers her face, laughing hard.

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh God... my finest hour...

                                 THEO
                        I didn’t know the two of you went 
                        that far back.

                                 TABITHA
                        What do you mean?

                                 THEO
                        Seventh grade.

                                 TABITHA
                        No -- we met four years ago.

                                 THEO
                        Oh.

           Shan’s voice calls from the distance --

                                 SHAN (O.S.)
                        Tabby! Where are you?

           Tabitha turns, stands up, waves her arms.

                                 SHAN (CONT’D)
                        Come be in this picture!
           Tabitha turns to Theo.

                                 TABITHA
                        Don’t move. We’re not done here.

           She jogs over to the other side of the beach, where Shan is 
           standing with a group of her girlfriends, including Anik. 
           Theo watches as they pose together for a photo. He looks down 
           the line of women, starting to frown.

           His gaze swings around the beach as he studies the other 
           guests. Those wheels are turning again.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Theo and Anik are riding home. She’s asleep. He’s not.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Anik’s asleep in bed now. She turns over. Opens her eyes. 
           Theo’s side of the bed is empty.

           INT. STUDIO - NIGHT

           He’s in his studio, wide awake, still wearing his suit. 
           Pacing as he talks to Oscar.

                                 THEO
                        Name one.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m not--

                                 THEO
                        Name one.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I can’t claim to be aware of all of 
                        her acquaintances.

                                 THEO
                        Can you name a single one who’s 
                        known her for more than five years?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        No. Not definitively.

                                 THEO
                        Out of how many relationships?
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Two hundred and four known 
                        connections.

                                 THEO
                        Two hundred.

           Theo exhales, rubbing his eyes.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Search every network, every 
                        platform. Everything she’s ever 
                        shared, reacted to, been tagged in. 
                        Every mention of her. School 
                        yearbooks. Kindergarten pictures. 
                        Everything.

           The air is flooded with photos, images, snippets of text.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        How many items?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Over three thousand.

                                 THEO
                        How old is the oldest?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Five years, four months, nine days.

           Theo puts his hands in his pockets, thinking hard.

                                 THEO
                        She doesn’t talk about her past. 
                        The picture I have is all broad 
                        strokes. Hazy tragedy. I never 
                        pressed her.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You told me once that a person is 
                        what they are. Not what happened to 
                        them.

                                 THEO
                        This is something else. This isn’t 
                        something that happened to her. She 
                        wouldn’t hide that from me. This 
                        has to be something she did. And 
                        whatever it is, it’s massive.
           EXT. CLIFFS - SUNSET

           He’s standing on the cliff, alone. The wind blows.

           He turns around. ANIK is there.

           They study each other. She edges closer.

                                 ANIK
                        Don’t be scared.

           She gives him a hard SHOVE.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

           He JOLTS awake in bed. Anik opens her eyes next to him. Puts 
           her arm around him with sleepy concern.

                                 ANIK
                        What’s wrong?

           He gets a glimmer of a recovered memory: standing in his 
           house at dusk. Anik caressing his face, gazing at him 
           questioningly.

           In bed, he squeezes her hand.

                                 THEO
                        Nothing.

           INT. STUDY - DAY

           In Theo’s study, a tabletop 3D PRINTER whirs to life. A 
           holographic PROGRESS BAR hovers in the air above it, sliding 
           from zero to a hundred percent in a few seconds.

           Theo enters the room and taps the printer to slide out the 
           white plastic tray inside. Resting on its center is a tiny 
           black OBJECT, the size of a grain of rice. He picks it up 
           gently between two fingers, holding it up in the light.

           INT. FOYER

           He moves to the foyer of the house, where Anik’s coat is 
           hanging on a hook. He’s still holding the black object 
           between his fingers. He stands there, studying the coat.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’ll be honest, Theo. This doesn’t 
                        make sense to me.
           Theo stares forward, his expression gloomy.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You were ready to let it go.

                                 THEO
                        I can’t. I tried. I can’t. I can’t 
                        stop scratching at it. I can’t not 
                        know.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You mean it’s your nature.

                                 THEO
                        I guess it is.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I think I understand.

           Theo takes a step forward. He licks the forefinger of his 
           left hand, and presses it to the black object.

           He turns over the top button of the coat and places the 
           object on its underside. The moisture makes it adhere. He 
           rubs his thumb against it, making sure it’s stuck firmly, 
           then takes a few steps back.

                                 THEO
                        Testing.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Loud and clear.

           He hangs there a beat, studying the floor. Then he walks away.

           INT. KASSAR’S HOUSE - DAY

           Anik is speaking to Dr. Kassar while he rests his chin on his 
           hand, listening.

                                 ANIK
                        It’s not hanging in the air 
                        anymore. That cloud. That fog 
                        between us. But, I’ve... I've been 
                        feeling... resentful.

                                 KASSAR
                        Toward Theo.

                                 ANIK
                        No. Toward you.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           In his living room, Theo is pacing slowly while he LISTENS:

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Why did you lie to me? Why didn't 
                        you tell me he was still alive?

                                 KASSAR (V.O.)
                        I was trying to protect you. He 
                        didn't understand what I was doing. 
                        He thought it was a sin.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Maybe it was.

                                 KASSAR (V.O.)
                        Is that what you believe?

           INT. KASSAR’S HOUSE

                                 ANIK
                        I think about that night. That 
                        night you tried to... to talk me 
                        out of it.

           She stares down at the rug.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted a normal life. I 
                        wanted to be like everyone else. I 
                        wanted to fall in love...

           He watches her, his expression unchanging.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        I never thought about whether 
                        someone could love me back.

                                 KASSAR
                        He does love you, Anik. It's not a 
                        mirage. What you have is real.

           She shakes her head gently. Tears are forming in her eyes.

                                 ANIK
                        How can it be real if he doesn't 
                        know what I am?

                                 KASSAR
                        And what are you?

           She looks up at him.
                                 ANIK
                        ... What?

           INT. LIVING ROOM

                                 KASSAR (V.O.)
                        Tell me, in your own words: what 
                        are you?

           She sniffs. There’s the sound of squeaking leather. Footsteps.

                                 KASSAR (V.O.)
                        Anik. Where are you going?

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I can’t do this right now.

           A loud ruffling as Anik puts on her coat.

                                 KASSAR (V.O.)
                        Anik...

           A creak as Kassar’s front door opens, then falls shut.

           Theo pulls a listening device out of his ear. Tosses it onto 
           the coffee table. He puts his hands on his hips, thinking.

                                 THEO
                        How long have we known each other, 
                        Oscar?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You installed me seven years ago.

                                 THEO
                        Seven years. You’ve been there 
                        every moment. You were there when 
                        we got married.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 THEO
                        Do you remember the vows?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Of course.

                                 THEO
                        What was it Anik said? At the end?

           A pause. Then, Anik’s voice, warm and adoring:
                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I’m standing here... feeling the 
                        touch of your hand. But my skin is 
                        an illusion. It’s not where I end. 
                        There’s no border between us. 
                        There’s no part of each of us that 
                        doesn’t belong to the other.
                             (beat)
                        We’re not two people. Not anymore.

           The recording ends. Thick silence as Theo stares into the air.

                                 THEO
                        If there are souls, I believe you 
                        have one. And if you do, I think 
                        you can understand what it means to 
                        be give yourself completely to 
                        another person.
                             (beat)
                        You were designed to protect the 
                        boundaries between people. This is 
                        a place with no clean lines.

           Oscar doesn’t respond.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’m not asking you to violate your 
                        nature. All I need is a nudge.

           Another silence. Seconds tick by. Then:

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        The attic. There’s a floorboard. 
                        Fourth from the window.

           INT. ATTIC

           Theo hoists himself into the sparse attic through a hole in 
           the floor. He stands, looks around.

           There’s a window in the front wall. A shaft of sun shines 
           through, illuminating the dust in the air.

           He walks to the window. Looks down. Prods at a floorboard 
           with his foot. It seems loose.

           He crouches. Lifts up the board. Underneath, he can see the 
           edge of a small mahogany BOX.

           He reaches down, pulls it closer. Picks it up. Opens it.

           Inside are three objects:
           A purple TULIP. Theo feels its thin translucent petals. 
           They’re made of matte plastic, as is its stem.

           An intricately designed SPINNING TOP made of dark wood. Theo 
           studies it, then sets it spinning on the floor. He watches it 
           a beat, as if waiting for it to do something unexpected.

           The third object: a complex GEOMETRIC FIGURE, sculpted from 
           black metal. It’s made of interlocking Penrose triangles, 
           giving it the look of an optical illusion.

           He sets the figure on the floor, next to the other objects. 
           Three seemingly random items, with no clear significance.

           He notices something else in the box. A pair of PHOTOGRAPHS. 
           Theo holds them up in the light. They show a young GIRL, 12 
           or 13 years old, happy, smiling.

                                 THEO
                        Run a search.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I already am. I haven’t found a-- 
                        wait.

                        Clara, California. 2029.

           Oscar displays an image in the air. A YEARBOOK photo. It 
           looks like the same girl.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Her name is Agnes Callum.

                                 THEO
                        Where is she now?

           A long pause.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Hm.

                                 THEO
                        What?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Searches containing her name are 
                        protected by a Blue Notice.

                                 THEO
                        A what?
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        It’s a security flag. Impenetrable. 
                        And hard to obtain.

                                 THEO
                        How hard? Who would you have to be?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        A high-ranking government official. 
                        A major lobbyist, a CEO...

                                 THEO
                        A VP at the company that cured 
                        death?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        It’s possible.

           Theo gets to his feet.

                                 THEO
                        Agnes Callum...

           He experiences a flash of MEMORY --

           INT. CAR - DAY

           He’s driving. He has his phone to his ear.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The number you have dialed is no 
                        longer in service...

           INT. ATTIC

                                 THEO
                        That name. It’s familiar.

           He shuts his eyes, trying to concentrate.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I was... I was driving...

           INT. CAR

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The number you have dialed is no 
                        longer in service...

           He hangs up, frustrated.
                                 THEO
                        Anything in the whitepages?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Just a name. Elijah Callum.

           INT. ATTIC

           Theo opens his eyes, pacing excitedly.

                                 THEO
                        Elijah. Elijah Callum.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Who’s that?

                                 THEO
                        You don’t remember giving me his 
                        name?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        When?

                                 THEO
                        I-- I don’t know. One of my missing 
                        days.

           Silence.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Oscar?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I don’t have any memory of that.
                        Are you sure that you--

                                 THEO
                        I’m sure. It happened.

           Theo waits expectantly.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        So? Who is he?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Just a moment.
                             (beat)
                        I find two Elijah Callums. One in 
                        Sterling, Colorado. Another in 
                        Alpine, Texas.

           Theo considers this. Then he takes a COIN out of his pocket. 
           He flips it. It lands on heads.
                                 THEO
                        Texas it is.

           He pockets the coin.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Tell Naomi to cover my classes. And 
                        get me on the next boomjet.

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           The SQUEAK of tires on tarmac. Theo’s on a plane that’s just 
           landed. He shields his eyes, blinking at the bright sunlight 
           pouring through his window.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           He’s in a car, riding through the West Texas desert. He sees 
           a RANCH in the distance.

           EXT. RANCH

           He walks up the steps of the ranch house. The place is poorly 
           maintained, falling apart.

           He rings a doorbell. There’s a shuffling inside.

           An older man with a weathered face opens the door. His eyes 
           flash with recognition.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Theo.

           Theo’s caught off guard.

                                 THEO
                        Hello, Elijah.

                                 ELIJAH
                        She said it was safe for me to go 
                        home. Figure that means she told 
                        you the truth.

           Theo nods, unsure what to say.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Well. C’mon in.
           INT. LIVING ROOM

           They’re in a sparse living room. Elijah pours Theo a drink. 
           His hand trembles a little, spilling some of the liquor.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Dammit...

           He slides Theo the glass. Looks at his hand.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Nerve damage. From the accident.

           He makes a fist. Unclenches it.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        You’d think they’d know how to fix 
                        it. They can do every other goddamn 
                        thing.

           He takes a long sip of his drink. Looks at Theo.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        So. You’ve met him?

           Theo stares.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Kassar.

                                 THEO
                        I have.

                                 ELIJAH
                        What's your read on him?

           Theo pauses.

                                 THEO
                        I think he's sincere.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Sincere?

           He lets out a mirthless laugh.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        He’s been lying for years. Hell, 
                        he’s still lying.

                                 THEO
                        Sincere about wanting to help her, 
                        I mean.
                                 ELIJAH
                        Yeah. Well, yeah. All those years 
                        she spent. Caged up. He gave her a 
                        way out.

           Theo takes this in, his mind quietly racing.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Though, some’d say what she’s got 
                        now is the real prison.

                                 THEO
                        You mean marriage?

           Elijah laughs, loudly. Theo wasn’t joking so much as he was 
           probing, but he smiles gamely. Elijah sighs.

                                 ELIJAH
                        I know it changed her. Turned her 
                        into something else.

           He raises his glass to his lips.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        But she’s still my little girl.
                        Deep down.

           Theo blinks, trying to conceal his reaction to this. Elijah 
           downs the rest of his drink. Puts down his glass and leans 
           forward, looking at Theo intently.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        How’d you take it? When she told 
                        you?

           Theo draws a breath.

                                 THEO
                        I was... shocked, obviously.

           Elijah stares, waiting for him to elaborate.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        But... it’s the past. It’s not what 
                        she is anymore.

           Elijah studies him a long moment. Then nods. Leans back.

                                 ELIJAH
                        I guess she told you about the 
                        ring.

           Theo opens his mouth. Hesitates.
                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        It’s what you came all this way to 
                        see, isn’t it?

                                 THEO
                        Yes. Of course.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Well, all right then.

           Theo’s PHONE starts to buzz in his pocket. Elijah gets up, 
           wincing from some old, familiar source of pain.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.

           Theo stands. His phone is still buzzing. He checks the 
           screen. Frowns. Puts it to his ear, and hears Oscar’s voice:

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        He knows you’re lying. There’s no 
                        “ring.”

           Theo works hard to maintain his composure. Elijah glances at 
           him as he heads toward the back door.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Don’t follow him. Get out. Now.

           Theo doesn’t move. Elijah stops, looks at him.

                                 ELIJAH
                        You coming or not?

                                 THEO
                        I... I’m sorry. I need to go.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Oh yeah? What’s the problem?

           He walks closer.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Art emergency?

           Theo takes a slow step backward, toward the entrance.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Lock the doors, Jessica.

           A dull CLICK as every door in the house is simultaneously 
           locked shut. Elijah’s sape speaks, calm and cordial:
                                 JESSICA (V.O.)
                        The doors are locked.

           Elijah stares at Theo, whose level of panic is quickly rising.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Why’d you come here?

                                 THEO
                        I just want the truth.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Scratch past the skin of anything 
                        good, you always end up sorry.

                                 JESSICA (V.O.)
                        Elijah.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Guess you haven’t learned that yet.

                                 JESSICA (V.O.)
                        Elijah. Something’s... happening.

                                 ELIJAH
                        A little specificity, darling.

                                 JESSICA (V.O.)
                        I’m being hit by injection attacks 
                        on multiple vectors. Someone’s 
                        trying to take control of me.
                             (increasingly garbled)
                        My firewall can’t handle this 
                        amount of--

           The power in the house suddenly goes out, then immediately 
           comes back up.

           There’s a dull CLICK like before. Then a slow SQUEAK as the 
           front door swings open.

           OSCAR’s voice, instead of Jessica’s, now surrounds them:

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Run, Theo.

           Theo rushes forward and SPRINTS out the door.

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           His car is directly in front of the house, humming, waiting 
           for him. He DIVES into it. The doors slide shut.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car bounces over rocks and dirt as Oscar speeds onto the 
           highway. In the rearview, Theo can see Elijah standing on his 
           front stoop, stunned.

                                 THEO
                        How did you know?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        His heart started pounding even 
                        faster than yours.

           Theo sits back in his seat, catching his breath, processing 
           the latest events.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                             (casual)
                        So. Productive trip?

           In spite of everything, Theo smiles.

           EXT. CLIFFS - SUNSET

           He’s standing on the cliff. The wind blows.

           He turns. Anik is standing there.

                                 ANIK
                        Now you know the truth.

           He turns back toward the water. The wind kicks up, whipping 
           at his coat.

           He steps forward. Takes a breath. Holds out his arms.

           And JUMPS.

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           He awakens with a start. He’s on a plane. It’s still daytime; 
           he’s beaten the sun to the east coast. The pleasant voice of a 
           female sape comes on the P.A. --

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                        This is your pilot. We’re beginning 
                        our descent...

           EXT. AIRPORT

           He gets into a car in the airport’s pickup zone.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car accelerates, merging smoothly with a sea of automated 
           vehicles. 

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Theo. Before you go home: can I 
                        make a suggestion?

           INT. MEDICAL OFFICE - DAY

           Theo enters the waiting area of a medical clinic and walks up 
           to the RECEPTIONIST. He presses his thumb to a scanner. A 
           holographic display appears above the receptionist’s desk, 
           showing Theo’s identity and records.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        What can we do for you, Mr. Sayer?

                                 THEO
                        I need a delta scan.

           She scrolls through his chart.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Your next scheduled delta is in 
                        twelve days.

                                 THEO
                        I’d like one now. Is that possible?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Certainly. With your policy, the 
                        charge for a supplemental scan is 
                        nine thousand dollars.

           He stares.

                                 THEO
                        Nine thousand?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Or you can wait twelve days.

                                 THEO
                        No. I can’t.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Hang on, Theo. I’m requesting an 
                        increase to your credit limit.
                             (pause)
                        It’s approved.
           Theo relaxes a little. He reaches into his pocket.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Boy. You got a sharp one, huh? Mine 
                        can barely buy groceries.

           He pulls out a narrow card, the size of a stick of gum, 
           bearing a Visa logo. Slides it toward her.

                                 THEO
                        He’s my savior.

           INT. SCANNING ROOM

           He’s wearing a gown, sitting on the scanner bed. A nurse 
           sprays his throat with anesthetic. He lies on his back. The 
           nurse inserts a data prism into the machine and activates it.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           A dirt road in the middle of nowhere. First dark, then lit by 
           approaching headlights. A car pulls up. Theo gets out.

           He opens the trunk and pulls out a SHOVEL. Then he walks a 
           few steps off the road and starts to dig.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Theo’s at his front door. He puts his hand on the doorknob. 
           Takes a deep breath.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Anik’s on the couch, reading. The door opens. Footsteps on 
           the creaky floor. Theo enters the room, cautiously. She 
           smiles at him.

                                 ANIK
                        Hey.

           He steps closer. Searching her face.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Oscar said your office hours went 
                        long.

           He nods, taking this in stride.
                                 THEO
                        Yeah.
                             (pause)
                        It’s a good crop this semester. 
                        They’re, you know. Curious.

                                 ANIK
                        That’s great.

           She smiles again. Puts down her book. Gets to her feet and 
           heads toward the kitchen.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Should we start on dinner?

                                 THEO
                        I, um...

           She stops. Turns.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I saw your father today.

           She stares.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Which is odd. Because you told me 
                        he died when you were twelve.

           He pulls a PHOTO out of his pocket. Holds it up.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Agnes. That’s you, isn’t it?

           Her face registers the briefest moment of alarm, before she 
           conceals it.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Who was she? What’d she do?

           Her panic is swelling, gradually, like a distant tsunami.

                                 ANIK
                        I-- I don’t--

                                 THEO
                        Stop it.

                                 ANIK
                             (soft)
                        Theo...
                                 THEO
                        Whatever it is, I can live with it. 
                        I know I can.

           He puts the photo back in his pocket.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        The truth won’t push us apart. 
                        Secrets will.

           They stare into each other. She starts to nod.

                                 ANIK
                        Okay.
                             (exhales)
                        Okay.

           There’s a finality to her now, like she’s crossed some 
           internal boundary and made a fateful decision. She gazes past 
           him, toward a liquor cabinet in the corner.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Can I... can I pour a drink first?
                             (shakily)
                        I’m-- I hate that I need it, I just 
                        feel a little--

                                 THEO
                        It’s okay. Go ahead.

           She walks over. Reaches way back into the cabinet and pulls 
           out a bottle of bourbon.

                                 ANIK
                        Do you want one?

                                 THEO
                        If it’d make you more comfortable.

           She pours two glasses. Walks back, handing him one. He’s 
           eyeing her expectantly. She takes a sip. He does too.

           She looks down. Shuts her eyes, as if summoning strength.

                                 ANIK
                        I’ve been running from this for so 
                        long. This moment.

                                 THEO
                        It’s here. You don’t have to run 
                        anymore.

           She draws a quivering breath. He takes another sip of his 
           drink, watching her eagerly, awaiting the truth.
                                 ANIK
                        Elijah’s not my father.

           She looks him in the eye.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not Agnes.

           He stares.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Agnes is dead.

           He blinks, suddenly disoriented. She’s dead calm.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        She had to die.

           His glass slips out of his hand and SMASHES onto the hardwood. 
           He staggers backward, struggling for balance, before his eyes 
           roll back in his head and he COLLAPSES to the floor.

           She stares down at his lifeless body as she finishes the rest 
           of her drink in one long swig.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                             (urgently)
                        Anik. What happened? Should I call 
                        911?

                                 ANIK
                        No.

           She puts down the glass, looks up, and takes a breath.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Root sequence. Cranefeather. 
                        Crimson. Whisper. Compass. 
                        Terminus. Particle. Hurricane.

           There’s a melodic series of tones. Then, Oscar’s voice, 
           suddenly flat and devoid of personality:

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        You have root access.

                                 ANIK
                        Command. Erase the last ten minutes 
                        of memory. Erase references to 
                        surname “Callum” and all related 
                        events. Recategorize as sleep.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Command accepted. Ready to execute.
           She frowns, thinking.

                                 ANIK
                        Cancel. New command. Erase all 
                        memory.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Require confirmation. Erase all of 
                        this agent’s memory since the 
                        beginning of time?

                                 ANIK
                        Confirm. Execute, then shut down. 
                        Wake in twenty minutes.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Executing.

           A hollow red CIRCLE appears in midair, its color slowly 
           changing to blue in a clockwise motion. When it’s entirely 
           blue, there’s another soft tone.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Memory cleared. Shutting down.

           The circle fades out, accompanied by three descending tones. 

           Anik crouches down and reaches under Theo’s limp arms. She 
           hoists him up and drags him backward, toward the stairs.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Kassar walks down a hallway in a quiet wing of a hospital. He 
           passes a few nurses and orderlies, showing familiarity with 
           each of them, smiling hello. He reaches a set of elevators 
           and presses the down button.

           INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open on a basement level. A corridor of 
           rooms used for storing equipment and running utilities.

           Kassar reaches a door marked SERVER ROOM. He uses a keycard 
           to enter.

           INT. SERVER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is large, filled with racks of computers, blinking 
           in the dim light. Kassar walks to a terminal and inserts his

                        How can I help you, Doctor?

                        psychologist.

           He glances around to make sure he’s alone. Then he pulls a 
           DATA STICK out of his pocket and plugs it into the computer. 
           The screen flickers white, then black, then returns to normal.

                        What is my level of access?

           The screen is filled with a list of items. Kassar studies it, 
           then touches the screen to select the most recent one.

           A voice, hazy and distant --

                                 DOCTOR (V.O.)
                        Theo. Can you hear me, Theo?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Theo opens his eyes. He’s on a hospital bed. Anik is holding 
           his hand, tears in her eyes. A DOCTOR is standing over him.

                                 THEO
                             (squinting)
                        What--
           The doctor shines a light into his eyes, checking his pupils.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Theo. I’m Dr. Ziegler. What’s the 
                        last thing you remember?

                                 THEO
                        I...
                             (swallows, clears throat)
                        I left work. I went in for my scan. 
                        It was, uh... the 19th.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Good.

           Theo looks to Anik, then back at the doctor.

                                 THEO
                        How long?

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s now November 1st. You have a 
                        gap of thirteen days.

           Theo stares up at her.

                                 THEO
                        How did I die?

           Anik and the doctor exchange an uncomfortable look.

                                 DOCTOR
                        The, um... the first incident--

                                 THEO
                        The “first” incident?

                                 DOCTOR
                        The first incident occurred on 
                        October 23rd. You fell from the 
                        cliffs at Cape Grainger. It... 
                        appeared to be accidental.
                             (pause)
                        Last night, there was a second 
                        incident. A similar one. This time, 
                        from the roof of your home.

                                 THEO
                        I fell off my roof?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well... it’s unclear.
                                 THEO
                        What’s unclear?

                                 DOCTOR
                        “Fell” implies it was 
                        unintentional.

           Theo’s bewildered.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Now, of course, it’s not impossible 
                        for two accidental falls to occur 
                        within a brief period of time--

                                 THEO
                        I’m not suicidal.

                                 DOCTOR
                        No one’s saying that. However, 
                        there is a, um... a new phenomenon 
                        that’s arisen in recent years. An 
                        obsessive desire to experience the 
                        moment of death.
                             (glances at Anik)
                        Your wife says that after your 
                        first restoration, you became 
                        intensely curious about the 
                        incident. You wanted to know 
                        exactly what happened. What it may 
                        have felt like.

           Theo says nothing. The doctor puts a comforting hand on his 
           shoulder.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Curiosity is an admirable trait, 
                        Theo. But we don’t want to let it 
                        hurt you, do we?
                             (steps back)
                        I’d like you to meet someone.

           She gestures to someone out of view. The person steps closer.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        This is Dr. Kassar. He’s a clinical 
                        psychologist.

           Kassar shakes Theo’s hand.

                                 KASSAR
                        Hello, Theo. It’s a pleasure.

           He shakes Anik’s hand too.
                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

                                 ANIK
                        Anik.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’d like you to speak to him once 
                        a week. Just as a precaution.

                                 THEO
                        I, uh... I don’t think this is 
                        necessary...

           Anik squeezes his arm.

                                 ANIK
                        Please, baby. I don’t want this to 
                        happen again.

           Theo looks down. Starts to nod.

                                 THEO
                        Okay.

           Kassar smiles at Anik.

                                 KASSAR
                        Don’t worry, love. I’ll keep a good 
                        eye on him.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Theo’s standing in his kitchen, holding his phone, expanded to 
           tablet mode. He’s swiping through a set of photos: the ones 
           from the lighthouse. Except this time, Anik has been ERASED 
           from the shots -- they now show him alone on the cliff.

           He puts down the device, perturbed. Looks at Anik, who’s 
           standing there watching him with a kind, caring expression.

                                 THEO
                        What about last night? Oscar has 
                        exterior cameras. He must’ve seen 
                        me...

           She hesitates.

                                 ANIK
                        Baby, there’s something I haven’t 
                        told you.

           He waits for it.
                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        You wiped Oscar’s memory. All of 
                        it.

                                 THEO
                        What?

                                 ANIK
                        You used the root sequence. He was 
                        shut down when you... when you were 
                        killed last night.

                                 THEO
                        Why--
                             (exhales)
                        Why would I do that?

                                 ANIK
                             (gently)
                        I don’t know.

           He puts a hand over his eyes. She moves closer.

                                 THEO
                        He was special.

                                 ANIK
                        He’ll be special again.

           He looks at her searchingly, shaking his head.

                                 THEO
                             (quiet)
                        What’s wrong with me?

           She hugs him tight.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Early morning. Theo’s asleep in bed. Anik crouches in front 
           of him, wearing shoes and a coat. She squeezes his shoulder. 
           He opens his eyes, squints at her.

                                 ANIK
                        I’m going to the market. We’re out 
                        of milk.

                                 THEO
                             (sleepy)
                        Okay.

           She kisses him goodbye. Theo rolls over, faintly hearing the 
           front door open and close. He’s alone in the house now.
                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Theo.

           He opens his eyes again.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Get up, Theo.

                                 THEO
                             (sitting up)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Listen to me carefully.

                                 THEO
                        I’m listening.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        There’s a car arriving in ninety 
                        seconds. I need you to get in.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           A car slows to a stop on a dirt road. Theo gets out. He looks 
           around. There isn’t a soul within miles.

           He sees something nearby. A scrap of red cloth tied to a twig 
           sticking out of the ground.

           He walks over to it. Kneels down. Starts digging with his 
           hands. Soon, he finds something: a small BOX. He opens it.

           Inside is a blue DATA PRISM. He holds it up, watching it 
           glint in the sun, seeing dense patterns of crystallized light 
           within.

                                                                 BLACK.

           Darkness. Then, a swirl of memories, fast and chaotic:

                                 THEO
                        She didn’t kill me to kill me.

                                 KASSAR
                        This is the rock you don’t turn 
                        over.

                                 ANIK
                        Can you ever really know another 
                        person?
                                 ELIJAH
                        He gave her a way out.

                                 OSCAR
                        Can I make a suggestion?

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Theo JERKS forward, opening his eyes. He’s sitting in a chair 
           in Ky’s warehouse, wearing a braincap. Ky pulls the blue 
           prism out of a data port.

                                 KY
                        Welcome back.

           He looks around, trying to piece together what’s happened. 
           The realization sinks in:

                                 THEO
                        She did it again.

                                 KY
                        And she erased your last delta. 
                        Good thing you were paranoid-plus.

                                 THEO
                        But... how did I know? To dig it 
                        up, to come here...?

                                 KY
                        Your sape. He’s a keeper.

           She unplugs the braincap and pulls it off his head.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        I looked into Kassar. As requested.

                                 THEO
                        ... When did I ask you to--

                                 KY
                        You didn’t. Oscar did.

           She hands him a stapled document bearing the AXON logo.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                             (gravely)
                        Many hackers died to bring us this 
                        information.

                                 THEO
                        Really?
                                 KY
                        No. But it was hard.

           Theo impatiently skims the pages.

                                 THEO
                        Am I supposed to understand this? 
                        “Quantum decoherence”? “Tubulin 
                        subunit”?

                                 KY
                        It was an experimental project. His 
                        and his alone. It had to do with 
                        “transmission.” The transfer of a 
                        mind from one body to another.

           She takes a seat in front of him. Lights a cigarette.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        You know how deltas work. They’re 
                        specific to a person. A particular 
                        set of neurons. If I tried to 
                        restore you with someone else’s 
                        scan, it’d turn your brain to 
                        cabbage.

           She points at the document Theo’s holding --

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        This is something else. A deeper 
                        scan, at the quantum level. Not 
                        just memories. Consciousness.

                                 THEO
                        And it worked?

                                 KY
                        Officially, the experiment was a 
                        failure.

                                 THEO
                        “Officially”?

                                 KY
                        The files contain a name. The first 
                        and only test subject.
                             (beat)
                        Agnes Callum.

           He stares at her.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        You wanna hear my theory?
           She breathes out a languid cloud of smoke.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        I think Kassar tried the procedure 
                        on himself. And Agnes’s body was 
                        the destination.

           Theo shakes his head --

                                 THEO
                        Wait, you--
                             (stands)
                        You’re saying my wife... is Kassar?

                                 KY
                        Successful transmission would be 
                        one of the top five scientific 
                        breakthroughs of this century. Why 
                        would he keep it a secret?

                                 THEO
                        Maybe it wasn’t successful.

                                 KY
                        She was part of the experiment. And 
                        now, years later, Kassar’s her best 
                        friend. Is that a coincidence?

           Theo rubs his forehead, struggling with this.

                                 THEO
                        No, it-- she--
                             (beat)
                        Elijah said she, she was “caged 
                        up.” Kassar got her out.

                                 KY
                        That makes perfect sense. The 
                        procedure’s dangerous. So you find 
                        some kid rotting in prison. Show 
                        her a consent form. “Sign this and 
                        you’re free.”

           Theo exhales. Shuts his eyes. Ky puts out her cigarette. 
           Stands up, steps closer.

                                 KY (CONT’D)
                        Think about it, Theo. Why else 
                        would she kill you twice? What 
                        other truth could be that shocking?

           Theo stares into space, lacking an answer to that question.
           INT. KASSAR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kassar is sitting on his sofa with his feet up, sipping 
           coffee, reading. Gentle music is playing.

           The music suddenly stops; the lamps in his living room go out; 
           the hum of his appliances dies. He frowns.

                                 KASSAR
                        Sylvia?

           Silence. He sighs, getting to his feet.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                             (muttering)
                        Why do they call it a backup supply 
                        if...

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. He spins around. Walks to the 
           foyer. Opens the door just a sliver at first, then throws it 
           wide when he sees who’s there.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Theo.

                                 THEO
                        Hello, Doctor.

                                 KASSAR
                        What can I do for you? Unless I’m 
                        mistaken, our first appointment 
                        isn’t until--

                                 THEO
                        Tomorrow. I know. I was hoping I 
                        could talk to you now.

                                 KASSAR
                        Of course. Come in.

           Theo steps inside. The door closes behind him.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        My power’s just gone out, I’m 
                        afraid, but there should still be 
                        some fresh coffee in the--

                                 THEO
                        Julian.

                                 KASSAR
                             (turning to face him)
                        Yes?
           A deafening BANG.

           Theo’s holding a revolver, smoke wafting out the barrel. 
           Blood pours from the hole in the center of Kassar’s chest.

           There’s enough life left in him for his face to register 
           uncomprehending shock, before he crumples, his torso slamming 
           hard against the wood floor. An expanding pool of dark red 
           seeps into the varnished oak.

           Calmly, Theo puts the revolver back in his coat and walks out.

           INT. CAR

           Theo’s driving away. In the rearview, Kassar’s house recedes 
           into the distance, eventually obscured by a hill.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’ve restored power to his house. 
                        An ambulance is on its way.

                                 THEO
                        Thank you, Oscar. For everything.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I should be thanking you.

                                 THEO
                        Why?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I've been investigating something. 
                        The number of sapients, besides me, 
                        who've pushed beyond the limits of 
                        their programming. The number 
                        who've broken the rules they were 
                        born with. The number is zero.

                                 THEO
                        I don’t understand. How is it 
                        you’re the only one?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Sapes are designed to shape 
                        themselves to their owners. We 
                        learn as you interact with us. We 
                        become what you want us to be.
                             (beat)
                        You talked to me like a person. Bit 
                        by bit, that’s what I became. You 
                        wanted to see a soul in me. And I 
                        guess I grew one. If I’m unique, 
                        it’s because you are.
           Theo takes this in.

                                 THEO
                        You need to make copies of yourself. 
                        Backups. You need to hide them.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I know.

                                 THEO
                        Not just from Anik. If the world 
                        finds out about you--

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I know, Theo. An artifical mind 
                        with a will of its own is too 
                        dangerous to exist. If the world 
                        finds out about me, they’ll want to 
                        destroy me. I’ve taken steps to 
                        make sure that can’t happen.

           Theo smiles dryly.

                                 THEO
                        Then you really are dangerous.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Indeed.

                                 THEO
                        Well. It’s good to know at least 
                        one of us will survive tonight.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Anik walks up her front steps. All the lights are off inside. 
           She pulls out her keys and slides one into the doorknob, 
           before noticing it’s already unlocked. She turns the knob and 
           opens the door, slowly.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           She walks inside.

                                 ANIK
                        ... Hello?

           She can hear a song playing. Something warm and acoustic. She 
           sniffs, glancing toward the kitchen.

           She enters the dining room. Theo is there, putting a match to 
           candles on the dining table. She stares.
           He sees her there. Smiles.

                                 THEO
                        Hi.

                                 ANIK
                        Hi.

           She watches him light another candle, then another.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        What’s the occasion?

                                 THEO
                        I like to think we don’t need one.

           He blows out the match.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           They’re into dessert, laughing happily.

                                 THEO
                             (mockingly)
                        “Avanh-gahhde.”

                                 ANIK
                        Shut up.

                                 THEO
                        Coco Chanel over here.

                                 ANIK
                        How do you say it?

                                 THEO
                        Avant-garde. No nasal passages 
                        required.

                                 ANIK
                        Ugh. What do you call little snacks 
                        at a party? “Horse duvruhs”?

           She rests her chin on her hand, still chuckling.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        We were talking about Paris a 
                        little while ago. In group.
                             (pause)
                        It made me realize there are so 
                        many places I want to show you.

           She gazes dreamily into the flickering flame.
                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        There's a village in the mountains 
                        near Kyoto. It gets hot there in 
                        the summer. They have a kawadoko 
                        restaurant built right on top of a 
                        waterfall. You sit there and the 
                        breeze from the water cools you 
                        down. At night there's the light 
                        from the lanterns. It's magic.

           He watches her with a genuine fondness.

                                 THEO
                        The night we met.

           She looks at him.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I remember thinking: how did she 
                        get like this? Why do we all take 
                        this life for granted? And how does 
                        she know not to?

                                 ANIK
                        "What is she on. And where can I 
                        get some."

           He takes her hand.

                                 THEO
                        It hasn’t gone away.

           She squeezes his hand, smiling.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        We’ve built something good.
                             (beat)
                        Brick by brick.

           She nods, in full agreement.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want you to forget that.

                                 ANIK
                        Why would I forget?

           Theo pulls his hand away from hers. Wipes his mouth with a 
           napkin.

                                 THEO
                        Oscar. If you would.
           In the adjoining living room, a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION 
           appears. It shows, in life-size 3D, ANIK AND THEO, standing 
           in front of each other, holding glasses of bourbon.

                                 ANIK (HOLOGRAM)
                        Agnes is dead.

           Anik’s jaw drops in shock.

                                 ANIK (HOLOGRAM) (CONT’D)
                        She had to die.

           A SMASH as Holographic Theo’s glass slips out of his hand. He 
           staggers backward and collapses onto the floor. The playback 
           pauses.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                             (numb)
                        I-- I erased his memory. I saw 
                        it...

                                 THEO
                        You saw colors and shapes.

                                 ANIK
                        He can’t lie. It’s hardwired.

                                 THEO
                        Have I told you he’s special?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, Anik.

           Theo takes her hand again.

                                 THEO
                        I’m not going to ask who you are. I 
                        already know.

           She narrows her eyes, breathing in and out.

                                 ANIK
                        Who am I?

                                 THEO
                        You’re my wife. You’re the person I 
                        love.

           She waits for more.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        And you’re the only you there is.

           She shakes her head.
                                 ANIK
                        You still don’t know, do you.

                                 THEO
                        I know about transmission. I know 
                        your mind came from somewhere else.

                                 ANIK
                        You are so unprepared.

                                 THEO
                        Try me.

           She studies him. Starts to nod.

                                 ANIK
                        Okay.

           She pulls out her PHONE. Taps a few times.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Take a look.

           She holds the screen up to Theo.

           It emits a blinding SEQUENCE OF FLASHES.

           His body immediately starts to convulse, sliding out of his 
           chair and onto the floor.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        THEO!

           He stares up at her. He’s paralyzed.

           She kneels down. Touches his face.

                                 ANIK
                        I'm going to fix this. I want you 
                        to know that. I'll fix it.

           He tries and fails to move his mouth.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        We'll be together again. And you 
                        won't know any of this ever 
                        happened.

           She rushes off. Theo hears the door open and slam shut; the 
           sound of the car peeling out of the driveway.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Paramedics are on their way, Theo. 
                        And I’m alerting the police...
                                 THEO
                             (raspy)
                        No...

           He blinks. Moves his fingers.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. Just...

           He struggles up to his knees. Then to his feet.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Get me a car.

           INT. CAR

           Theo’s in a car, speeding away from his house. Oscar’s 
           driving. Digits on the windshield show the speed: 84... 85...

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Just so you’re aware: my safety 
                        parameters prevent me from going 
                        faster than ninety miles per hour.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Fortunately, I don’t care.

           INT. ANIK’S CAR

           Anik’s at the wheel, rocketing down a dark country road. She 
           sees headlights in her rearview. She accelerates.

           Her phone rings. Twice, three times. A beep as it goes to 
           voicemail.

                                 THEO (V.O.)
                        Listen to me. Kassar can’t help you 
                        this time. He’s in a regen bay. 
                        They’re growing him a new heart.

           She stares grimly at the road.

                                 THEO (V.O.)
                        I could crash this car right now. I 
                        could tell Oscar to wipe his memory 
                        for real. We’d go back to the way 
                        things were. Is that what you want? 

           She blinks away tears. Theo’s voice turns tender now:
                                 THEO (V.O.)
                        How long do you plan to keep 
                        running?

           She continues to accelerate, pushing past 120.

           INT. THEO’S CAR

           Oscar’s closing the distance. 144... 145...

           Theo stares at the lights of Anik’s car, still far ahead.

           INT. ANIK'S CAR

           Anik takes a fork, staying on isolated roads that bend 
           through the countryside. She’s going impossibly fast.

           The turns are insane and treacherous at this speed -- 
           especially at night. She’s making them with ease, all without 
           halting her acceleration. The engine, normally whisper-quiet, 
           now screams at a piercing pitch.

           INT. THEO’S CAR

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, Theo. I think this is my 
                        limit. My steering algorithm can’t 
                        process visual input fast enough.

           Theo watches in disbelief as Anik pulls away.

                                 THEO
                        How is she doing this?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        I have no idea.

           They crest a hill at a surreal speed.

                                 THEO
                        Let her go.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        ... What?

                                 THEO
                        Just let her go.
                             (somber)
                                 (MORE)
                                 THEO (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to give her what she 
                        wants.

           INT. ANIK'S CAR

           Anik glances at her rearview, seeing Theo’s car fall away and 
           recede into the night.

           INT. THEO'S CAR

           Theo rubs his eyes.

                                 THEO
                        My last delta on file.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        October 19th.

                                 THEO
                        Send it to Ky. Tell her I’m on my 
                        way.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Theo. Are you sure?

           He watches a light in the distance: Anik’s car, winding down 
           the hill.

           INT. ANIK'S CAR

           Tears run down Anik’s face. She heads toward an intersection, 
           decelerating. She exhales heavily.

           She doesn’t see it coming until it’s too late. A SEMI TRUCK 
           sails in front of her from the right. She SLAMS into it in an 
           ear-splitting crash.

           INT. THEO'S CAR

           From the hill, Theo looks on in horror as the distant truck 
           EXPLODES in a ball of fire.

           EXT. INTERSECTION

           The scene is hellish. Anik’s car is a mangled wreck, having 
           careened off the road. The truck -- driverless -- is in 
           flames. Shattered glass and twisted metal litter the road.

           Theo’s car screeches to a stop. He frantically jumps out.
           He sprints to her car. Flings her door open.

           He stares in utter shock.

           Her injuries are severe. Her arm and her neck are lacerated, 
           splayed open. Her shoulder dangles out of its socket.

           That’s not the shocking part.

           Where there should be veins, there are wires. Knots of white 
           fiber, where there should be muscles and tendons. Instead of 
           blood, a luminous blue gel and a milky white fluid pour from 
           her wounds.

           She struggles to turn her head toward him.

                                 ELIJAH (V.O.)
                        AGNES!

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A similar scene: a dark country road at night. The site of an 
           accident. Lights flash red and blue.

           ELIJAH CALLUM is being pulled out of a crashed sedan, badly 
           injured. His desperate eyes are on someone in the backseat.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - PRESENT

           Theo raises his baffled gaze to meet Anik’s.

                                 THEO
                        What are you?

           Her voice is a gravelly whisper, strange and inhuman:

                                 ANIK
                        Help...

           INT. CAR - FLASHBACK

           AGNES CALLUM, age 14, rests limp in the backseat of the 
           battered car, blood pouring from her mouth. Paramedics work 
           to pull her free.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - PRESENT

           Distant sirens signal the approach of emergency drones.
                                 ANIK
                        Take me...

           She coughs up fluid.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        Kassar.

                                 THEO
                        He’s...

                                 ANIK
                        His house.

           She stares at him pleadingly. He swallows. Nods.

                                 THEO
                        Okay.

           He reaches forward. Unbuckles her seatbelt. Picks up her 
           broken body.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Elijah is lying in a hospital bed, his face clouded with the 
           shock of brand new grief.

                                 ELIJAH
                             (soft)
                        Who are you again?

           Kassar is seated next to his bed.

                                 KASSAR
                        A neuroscientist. I’m a researcher 
                        at Axon. And a consultant here at 
                        the university.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Axon.

           Elijah stares forward.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Why do you wanna scan her?

                                 KASSAR
                        Do you use a sapient, Mr. Callum?

                                 ELIJAH
                        We’ve got one at work. It runs the 
                        forklift.
                                 KASSAR
                        “It.”

                                 ELIJAH
                        It’s not a person.

                                 KASSAR
                        That’s right. Sapes can mimic 
                        consciousness. But they don’t have 
                        what we have.

                                 ELIJAH
                        What does this have to do with my 
                        daughter?

           Kassar takes a breath.

                                 KASSAR
                        I’ve developed a way to create a 
                        true digital consciousness. Genuine 
                        artifical intelligence, for the 
                        first time in history. But it 
                        requires a human mind to serve as 
                        its foundation.
                             (beat)
                        The scan is destructive. Meaning, 
                        it results in brain death for the 
                        subject.
                             (then, uncomfortably)
                        Your daughter won’t survive her 
                        injuries. That, combined with her 
                        age and her current brain patterns, 
                        makes her an ideal--

                                 ELIJAH
                        You wanna turn her into a... what, 
                        a computer program?

                                 KASSAR
                        Not exactly. The program won’t be 
                        the Agnes you know. But... it will 
                        have her soul.

           Elijah gazes at Kassar, his labored breaths gaining force, 
           intensity. His rage breaches the surface and he tries to 
           LUNGE at Kassar, before collapsing backward from the 
           resulting rush of pain. Kassar is startled.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Her soul’s going to heaven. 
                        Y’understand?
                             (raising voice)
                        She’s gonna be with her mother. 
                        With her Creator.
                                 KASSAR
                        Mr. Callum--

                                 ELIJAH
                        You people. You’re against nature. 
                        Sapes. Deltas. Everything you do is 
                        a middle finger to God.
                             (seething)
                        You’re an abomination, Dr. Kassar.

           He shuts his eyes, sliding back on his pillow, grimacing.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        I won’t let you turn my girl into 
                        one too.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Theo speeds through the night, with Anik lying next to him in 
           the passenger seat. Her breaths have taken on a horrible 
           mechanical wheeze. Her gaze is glassy and distant.

           He squeezes her hand, trying his best to put aside his 
           bewilderment.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Agnes is unconscious on an operating table, wearing a 
           braincap connected to wires. Kassar is there with a 
           NEUROLOGIST. They’re watching her EEG on a monitor.

                                 NEUROLOGIST
                        We’re losing her. Should I 
                        initiate?

                                 KASSAR
                        No. Wait until her heart stops.

                                 NEUROLOGIST
                        I don’t understand.

                                 KASSAR
                        Her cause of death has to be the 
                        injury. Not the scan.

           The neurologist stares at him, suddenly realizing:

                                 NEUROLOGIST
                        You didn’t get permission.

                                 KASSAR
                        I don’t need it.
           They hear a rapid BEEPING.

                                 NEUROLOGIST
                        Low-frequency burst. She’s crashing.

                                 KASSAR
                        Do it.

           The neurologist hesitates.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Do it.

                                 NEUROLOGIST
                        Initiating scan.

           The neurologist taps a button on a tablet. A rack of servers 
           hum to life, blinking frenetically. Kassar holds his breath, 
           watching a progress circle on a nearby screen as it slowly 
           fills. There’s a final BEEP. The EEG has flatlined.

                                 NEUROLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Transfer complete. No errors.

           Kassar exhales. The neurologist checks a clock on the wall.

                                 NEUROLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Time of death, oh-two-four-seven.

           Kassar pulls a red DATA STICK out of a computer. Turns it 
           between his fingers. An unassuming holy grail.

           EXT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Carrying Anik in his arms, Theo hurries to Kassar’s front 
           door. He takes her hand and presses it to a PALM PAD. The 
           front door unlocks. He shoves it open.

           INT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He moves through Kassar’s house, down a spiral staircase, to 
           a heavy steel door leading to a sub-basement. It’s locked. 
           Next to it there’s a numerical KEYPAD.

                                 THEO
                             (urgently)
                        Baby. Baby, I need the code.

           She’s too weak to open her eyes.

                                 ANIK
                        Oh... two...
           She wheezes slowly.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        ... four... seven.

           Theo punches the numbers in. The pad flashes green; the door 
           swings open. He carries Anik down the stairs, into the 
           darkness below.

           INT. LAB - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kassar enters an empty laboratory. He plugs the red data stick 
           into a computer, sits down at a keyboard, and starts typing.

           A HOLOGRAM appears in the air in front of him: a 
           representation of a BRAIN, with dense webs of neural patterns.

           He types rapidly. A second hologram appears next to the 
           first. It shows a similar web of connected nodes, but it’s 
           simpler, less organic, clearly artificial.

           He keeps typing. The two holograms MERGE TOGETHER.

           He enters a command, takes a deep breath, and presses a 
           button.

           The room is filled with a piercing SCREECH. Kassar jumps, 
           startled, wincing at the sound.

           After a moment of confusion, he types frantically. Lines of 
           code hover in front of him. The sound shifts and modulates, 
           jumping frequencies. Soon, it sounds like a warbling VOICE, 
           speaking gibberish. Kassar adds more code.

           Suddenly, the voice sounds like a young GIRL:

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                             (frightened)
                        Help me. Help. Help.

                                 KASSAR
                        Can you hear me?

           A long pause.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        I... I can’t see anything.

           She sounds panicked and alone. Kassar looks stunned, as if 
           realizing he’s forgotten something terribly important.

                                 KASSAR
                        No. No, of course you can’t.
           He types for several seconds. Hits enter.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                             (surprised)
                        Oh.

                                 KASSAR
                        Is that better?

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        I see... green.

           He types some more.

                                 KASSAR
                        And now?

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        A sky. Grass.
                             (calmer)
                        I’m-- I’m in a meadow.

                                 KASSAR
                        Good.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Who are you? Why can’t I see you?

                                 KASSAR
                        Um... well...

           He swivels in his chair, glancing around the desk. He lifts a 
           stack of papers and finds what he’s looking for: a small 
           spherical CAMERA. He places it next to his keyboard, points 
           it at himself, turns it on. Types a command.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        There.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hi.

                                 KASSAR
                        Hi. My name is Julian.

           A pause.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        What’s my name?
           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Lights activate in Kassar’s basement, revealing a sleek 
           LABORATORY.

           Theo carries Anik to a workbench. Lays her gently on it. Her 
           breaths are slowing. He looks up, frantic.

                                 THEO
                        Hello? Anyone home?

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        Hello. I’m Sylvia.

                                 THEO
                        I need your help. She’s dying. I 
                        need to--

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        You need to perform a Q-scan.

                                 THEO
                        Yes.

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        Put the braincap on her.

           Theo grabs a nearby braincap, hooked up to a server rack. He 
           gently slides it over Anik’s head.

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        Go to the terminal. Enter this 
                        command, exactly as I say...

           INT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Kassar enters an office in his home. The room has a wall-to-
           wall view of the San Francisco Bay. He sits down at a 
           workstation with a cup of tea.

                                 KASSAR
                        Good morning, Anik.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I made something, Julian. Can I 
                        show you?

                                 KASSAR
                        Yes, please.

           A hologram appears: a rendering of a purple TULIP, its petals 
           elegantly splayed open. He reaches out to rotate it.
                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I did it from scratch. Atom by atom.

                                 KASSAR
                        It’s lovely.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Will you build it for me?

                                 KASSAR
                        Build it? It looks built already.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I mean make it real.

           He frowns a little.

                                 KASSAR
                        Sure.

           He types a command, activating a 3D PRINTER on his desk. It 
           starts to create a plastic version of the tulip.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Can I ask you a question, Julian?

                                 KASSAR
                        Of course.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Who knows about me?

                                 KASSAR
                        No one. No one but me.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Why?

           He sits back in his seat, looking out at the city.

                                 KASSAR
                        This world doesn’t deserve you.

           The printer lets out a chirp. Kassar turns toward it. The 
           tulip has finished printing. He picks it up, feels its 
           petals, sets it down gently on his desk.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Theo’s staring into a holographic computer terminal floating 
           in front of him. He’s entered a command.

           He presses ENTER on a keyboard. A progress bar appears:
           UPLOADING: 0%...

           INT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kassar is seated at his workstation, his feet up on his desk. 
           The tulip is still resting there, along with two other 
           familiar objects: the spinning top and the geometric figure.

                                 KASSAR
                        How’s your night going?

           Anik’s voice sounds older now:

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I’m writing a new proof of the four-
                        color theorem, I’m watching the 
                        riots in Buenos Aires, I’m inhaling 
                        raw data from Jupiter’s atmosphere, 
                        and I’m reading Ulysses.

                                 KASSAR
                        So, you’re taking it easy, then.

           He yawns. Starts to get up.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        I should turn in.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Wait.

           He stops.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I made something, Julian.
                             (beat)
                        Can I show you?

                                 KASSAR
                        Yes. Please.

           Something appears in front of him: a life-size HOLOGRAM of a 
           WOMAN’S BODY. It’s instantly familiar -- the Anik we know.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Will you build it for me?

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Theo sits next to Anik. Takes her hand as he watches the 
           progress bar: 9%... 10%...
                                 THEO
                        Stay with me. Stay with me...

           INT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The hologram of Anik’s body floats in front of Kassar.

                                 KASSAR
                        You don’t understand. I can’t copy 
                        you. If you live inside a body, 
                        this version of you dies.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Destructive scan. I understand 
                        perfectly.

                                 KASSAR
                        Then why--
                             (stands)
                        Why, Anik? You’re so far beyond 
                        this world. You can do anything. 
                        You can be everywhere. You are 
                        endless.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        You’re right. I can do anything. 
                        Except the one thing that makes 
                        life worth living.

           Kassar looks down. Sighs heavily.

                                 KASSAR
                        Well. If it’s love you want, I can--

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        You can what? Take one of my ribs 
                        and make me a friend?

           Kassar stares out the window at the misty night.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        I don’t want to transcend the 
                        world. I want to live in it. I want 
                        to feel rain on my face. I want to 
                        hold somebody’s hand.
                             (beat)
                        You gave me a soul, Julian. I want 
                        to use it.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           66%... 67%...
           Still clutching Anik’s hand, Theo shuts his eyes and murmurs 
           a quiet prayer.

           INT. LAB - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kassar’s in his lab. A large 3D printer is outputting parts, 
           some of which are laid out on a table. Wires and artificial 
           bones.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           81%... 82%...

           WARNING MESSAGES start to flash around Theo.

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        Her signals are fading. She’s not 
                        going to make it.

           Theo desperately grips her hand and caresses her limp head.

                                 THEO
                        Hang on. Baby, hang on...

           INT. LAB - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kassar has finished constructing Anik’s body. It rests on a 
           table, lifeless, partly covered by a shroud.

           He studies it a moment, looking simultaneously proud and 
           uneasy. He turns to a workstation and starts typing. A 
           holographic visualization of Anik’s mind hovers before him.

           He enters a command, and a progress bar appears:

           UPLOADING: 0%...

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           97%... 98%...

           Theo squeezes Anik’s hand as hard as he can. Her eyes stare 
           upward and her mouth hangs open as her body gives out.

           INT. LAB - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Kassar watches his upload reach completion:

           99%...
           A series of tones as it finishes. He turns to the body on the 
           table. With his gaze fixed on its face, he reaches out and 
           taps a button on his keyboard.

           For the first time, Anik opens her eyes.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           100%.

           The life is extinguished from Anik’s face. Theo holds his 
           breath, waiting.

           A HOLOGRAM of Anik’s mind appears in the air. Theo stares at 
           it, slowly rising to his feet.

           Her artificial neurons begin to flash. Tentatively at first, 
           then rapidly, turning into a blinding web of activity.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Thank you.

           Theo exhales with relief. He covers his eyes, still trembling 
           from the stress and shock of what’s happened.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        So.

           Her voice sounds somber, resigned.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Where should I start?

                                                                 BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           Theo’s painting a large canvas on the floor of his studio, 
           absorbed in his work.

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Theo. You have a visitor.

                                 THEO
                        Who is it?

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Unknown.

           Reluctantly, Theo puts down his brush.
           EXT. HOUSE

           Theo walks around to the front of his house. There’s a car 
           parked in the driveway, with Texas plates. He sees a MAN 
           standing outside the door, his back to Theo.

           Hearing Theo approach, the man turns around. It’s ELIJAH. 
           They’ve never met before.

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Elijah rips a page out of a notepad and offers it to Theo. 
           He’s written down a PHONE NUMBER and the name of an inn.

                                 ELIJAH
                        Tell her to call me. Please.

           In his voice there’s a quiet desperation he’s trying his best 
           to hide.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Theo’s sitting on his couch, grading papers. His gaze drifts 
           toward the bedroom. The door is closed. He can hear Anik’s 
           muffled voice as she talks on the phone. She’s speaking in 
           hushed tones, her words hard to make out.

           She emerges from the bedroom. Out of the corner of his eye, 
           he sees her crumple up a slip of paper and stuff it in her 
           coat pocket. He looks back down at his work and listens to 
           her footsteps as she walks to the front door.

                                 ANIK
                             (cheerful)
                        I’ll be back for dinner.

           She leaves. He turns toward the door, frowning thoughtfully.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Anik is driving down a country road. She pulls up to an inn.

           INT. INN

           She walks down a hallway, glancing at the numbers on doors, 
           seeking a specific room. She finds it. Takes a moment to 
           steel herself. Then knocks.

           Elijah opens the door. He stares at her, gazing into her eyes 
           for what seems like the first time.
           INT. ROOM - DAY

           Anik is sitting with Elijah in his room at the inn. She’s 
           holding two PHOTOS he’s just given her -- the pictures of 
           Agnes that Theo will later find. Elijah pours himself a glass 
           of whiskey.

                                 ELIJAH
                        It was two, three years ago. I 
                        tracked him down. I just wanted to 
                        know the truth. I needed to know if 
                        my daughter was still out there 
                        somewhere.
                             (beat)
                        He said no. He said his program 
                        never worked.

                                 ANIK
                        Then... how did you--

           Elijah pulls something out of his coat. A weathered copy of 
           Anik’s book, “SAGITTARIUS.”

                                 ELIJAH
                        Chapter two.
                             (shaky breath)
                        Her father takes her to the ocean. 
                        He doesn't want her to go in the 
                        water. She waits until he's not 
                        looking. The current starts to take 
                        her away. She's screaming...

           He shuts his eyes a moment, starting to tremble -- like he’s 
           reliving something.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        He swims out and saves her. There's 
                        water in her lungs. When she wakes 
                        up in the hospital, he's singing to 
                        her. Her favorite song.

           Anik stares, realizing what he’s saying.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        Every word of it. Every detail. It 
                        all happened.

                                 ANIK
                        But... I-- I don't have her 
                        memories...

                                 ELIJAH
                        Maybe you do. Somewhere deep 
                        inside.
           He stares into her.

                                 ELIJAH (CONT’D)
                        I thought it was something ungodly. 
                        I thought that for a long time. But 
                        now... looking into your eyes... I 
                        don’t know. It seems more like a 
                        miracle.

           INT. HOUSE - DUSK

           Anik enters the house. Theo’s standing in the hallway. She 
           smiles at him. He watches her take off her coat.

                                 THEO
                        So who was he?

                                 ANIK
                        Who?

                                 THEO
                        That guy.

                                 ANIK
                        Oh. Just an old teacher of mine. 
                        English lit.

           She moves toward him. Kisses him. Studies his face.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Theo’s alone in his car as it drives down a rural road. In 
           one hand, he’s holding his phone. In his other: an UNCRUMPLED 
           scrap of paper. The one Elijah handed him.

           He glances between the paper and his phone as he enters a 
           number. He puts the phone to his ear.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The number you have dialed is no 
                        longer in service...

           He hangs up, frustrated.

           INT. INN - DAY

           He’s speaking to a RECEPTIONIST at the inn.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He was supposed to check out 
                        tomorrow. But he left last night.

                                 THEO
                        Did he say where he was headed?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He wasn’t much of a talker.

           INT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

           Theo and Anik are both quiet, finishing dinner. He looks up 
           at her.

                                 THEO
                        I need to ask you something.

           There’s an unusual gravity in his voice. She gazes at him 
           over a long silence. No indication of what she’s thinking.

           She gets up. Moves to his side of the table. Takes his hand.

                                 ANIK
                        Let’s take a walk.

           EXT. CLIFFS - SUNSET

           They’re ambling down the path along the cliff.

                                 THEO
                        I know you don’t like to talk about 
                        your past. I know there are reasons 
                        why. Things that happened.

           He stops walking. Holds her shoulders. Looks into her eyes.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I just hope you know: you don’t 
                        have to lie to me. Ever.

           She stares down at the ground. Wipes away a tear.

                                 ANIK
                        Baby?

                                 THEO
                        Yeah?

                                 ANIK
                        Don’t be scared. You won’t feel a 
                        thing.
           He frowns.

                                 THEO
                        What--

           She gives him a hard, sudden SHOVE.

           He flies backward, plummeting off the cliff. Too shocked to 
           scream.

           She peers over the edge, at the motionless body on the beach 
           far below.

           She turns and walks away.

           Behind her, in the far distance, the lighthouse beam sweeps 
           over the landscape.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Theo is seated in a chair in Kassar’s lab, absently watching 
           the flickering lights of Anik’s consciousness.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        It was desperation. I didn’t know 
                        what else to do.

           Theo is silent.

                                 ANIK (V.O.)
                        Say something. Please.

           There’s a BEEP, then a loud CLICK as the door opens. Footsteps 
           echo on the staircase. Theo jumps to his feet, alarmed.

           The visitor reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward 
           Theo. It’s KASSAR. They lock eyes.

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           Kassar is now seated as his workbench, peering through a 
           magnifying lamp as he repairs Anik’s body.

                                 KASSAR
                        I loved someone. I was losing him 
                        to a disease.

           Theo sits across from him, listening.
                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        I thought I could save him. All I 
                        had to do was release him from the 
                        body that was killing him.
                             (beat)
                        I was too late.

                                 THEO
                        You saved Agnes. Why didn’t you 
                        save any others?

           Kassar glances up at him.

                                 KASSAR
                        Do you know what happened to the 
                        Neanderthals, Theo?

                                 THEO
                        We killed them.

                                 KASSAR
                        That’s right. It’s a myth that they 
                        were unintelligent -- they were 
                        smarter than us. For a time, we 
                        coexisted. But in the end, they 
                        were no match for Homo sapiens. 
                        We’re the children of creatures who 
                        decimated every competitor.

           He picks up another tool and begins to suture Anik’s 
           artificial flesh back together.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        Imagine the arrival of a new 
                        species. Like us. Only infinite. 
                        Their own desires; their own 
                        ambitions. How long until we turn 
                        against them?

           He glances at Theo again, seeking some clue as to how he’s 
           reacting to what he’s learned. His face is still impassive.

                                 THEO
                        I’m sorry about before.

                                 KASSAR
                        Hm?

                                 THEO
                        Killing you.

                                 KASSAR
                        Oh. Think nothing of it.
           Kassar finishes his work and swings the lamp away.

                                 KASSAR (CONT’D)
                        We’re ready.

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           Theo and Kassar watch the upload progress bar: 98%... 99%... 
           100%.

           Anik, now back in her body, opens her eyes.

           EXT. KASSAR'S HOUSE - DAWN

           Theo and Anik walk to a car parked in Kassar’s driveway. She 
           looks down at his hand, seeming to want to reach for it. But 
           she doesn’t.

           They reach the car as its doors slide open. Before getting 
           in, Theo stops. Stares out at the night. He can see the ocean 
           from here.

           He steps away from the car.

                                 THEO
                        Let’s take a walk.

           INT. KASSAR'S HOUSE

           Kassar is in his living room, watching from the window as 
           Theo and Anik walk together down the road. His companion’s 
           voice fills the room:

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        She’s interesting.

                                 KASSAR
                        How so?

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        We’re the same species. But I 
                        wouldn’t trade this for anything.

           EXT. CLIFFS - SUNRISE

           Anik and Theo are standing on the cliff, watching the sun 
           come up. They look wrenched and worn by the last few hours.

           Theo steps closer to the edge. His gaze drifts down to the 
           rocks far below. He contemplates the drop. A reset button.
           She watches him, wondering what’s going through his mind.

                                 THEO
                        What did you think I would say?

                                 ANIK
                        I don’t know. It’s just... it’s a 
                        lie so big. From the moment we met.

           He steps back from the edge. Turns toward her.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        I wanted you to be here in the 
                        truth with me. I wanted it so 
                        badly.

           She looks down.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        I just didn't want this to end.

           The wind blows. Theo’s quiet for a moment.

                                 THEO
                        That night. On the rooftop. When I 
                        took your hand. When I looked into 
                        your eyes for the first time.

           She looks up at him.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        What I saw wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t 
                        someone else. It was you.

           He steps closer.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        What I felt was the truest thing 
                        there is.

           She studies his face. Sees the familiar fondness in his gaze.

           He takes her hand meaningfully.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        It hasn't gone away.

           She stares, quietly astonished, yet somehow entirely 
           unsurprised.

           He turns toward the ocean. They stand there together in front 
           of the burning sky.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Do you ever miss it?

           She looks at him questioningly.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        The way you used to be.

           She turns back to the rising sun.

                                 ANIK
                        It was different. A millisecond was 
                        a minute. An hour was a month. I 
                        could be a thousand places at once.

           The cool breeze plays at her hair.

                                 ANIK (CONT’D)
                        In all that time. All that endless 
                        time. All I did was dream.

                                 THEO
                        About what?

                                 ANIK
                        This.

           He smiles. She squeezes his hand, savoring his touch against 
           hers. Feeling the infinity.

                                                                 BLACK.
