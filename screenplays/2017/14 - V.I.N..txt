                                      GENERAL NOTES

               This is the true story of two men: Alex Haley and George 
           Lincoln Rockwell. Most of their interactions with one another 
           are taken from recordings, letters, and published material 
           over the course of about two years. 

               The film is framed by news articles that reflect either 
           accurately or inaccurately on the events as we see them 
           unfold. 
           The header of a newspaper serves as a TITLE CARD reading: New 
           York Times, October 2, 1964.

           EXT NEW YORK SUPERIOR COURT, NYC, AFTERNOON. 1964.

           A sunny fall day in New York City. A small crowd has gathered 
           to watch a tall, dark, and handsome man--GEORGE LINCOLN 
           ROCKWELL, 44. He wears a khaki uniform. 

           Rockwell speaks from the steps of the courthouse to a growing 
           number of OBSERVERS--some hostile and some curious. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        We believe in this country! And we 
                        will fight to protect this country, 
                        and white people, no matter how 
                        long it takes! 

           REVEAL: the Swastika armband on Rockwell’s uniform. On either 
           side of him: two young STORMTROOPERS, wearing the same khaki 
           uniform. JOHN PATLER, 26, is one of them.   

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t got the power to compete 
                        with the Washington Post and the 
                        Daily News! I can’t reach the 
                        millions of civilians that the 
                        papers reach, that the television 
                        reaches. I only have one way to 
                        answer the lies and slander they 
                        print about me. And that, ladies 
                        and gentlemen is to become 
                        notorious, to become well known, in 
                        spite of their efforts to silence 
                        us! I’ve been making such a fuss--
                        it’s obvious the newsmen just won’t 
                        print it. People know: somebody is 
                        censoring our news. 

           A few in the crowd CHEER. A few others BOO and look at the 
           supporters with disgust. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Is that how we win a fight in 
                        America? No!!!

           The crowd cheers.
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        In America, if we think a man is 
                        wrong, we have it out with him in 
                        the open and we PROVE that he’s 
                        wrong. We don’t silence him! We 
                        don’t bury him! 

           Several men wearing matching baseball caps--Jewish Veterans 
           of America. Rockwell stares at a YOUNG VETERAN in the crowd. 
           The veteran stares back. 

           PAN TO: a REPORTER, followed by a TV camera.

                                 REPORTER
                             (to camera)
                        George Lincoln Rockwell, head and 
                        founder of the American Nazi Party, 
                        speaks on the steps of the New York 
                        Superior Court. We’re with him now. 

           The reporter finds an older man, shaking.

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Sir, I can see you are disturbed. 
                        Can we get a reaction?

           The man speaks, his voice trembling and small, overwrought. 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        I-I-I-I spent two years in--in a--
                        in a...concentration camp...one 
                        year in Auschwitz. How do I feel? 
                        There’s no way to describe my 
                        feeling. 

           Rockwell continues. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        You can see it now--the cold, 
                        calculating Jew is the most 
                        dangerous. But when you get him 
                        riled up, when you get him 
                        hysterical, he loses control. His 
                        nose starts to wave in the breeze. 

           The Young Veteran’s eyes narrow and he balls his fists. 
           Rockwell notices, and tries to provoke him further. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentleman, one lesson is 
                        learned over and over again for 
                        10,000 years. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Gladiators have risen up out of the 
                        ring and overthrown mighty empires. 
                        Slaves have revolted and dominated 
                        countries! 

           The Young Veteran BREAKS OUT of the crowd and strides toward 
           Rockwell. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Throughout history there is example 
                        after example of men who have come 
                        up from the bottom, and have 
                        changed the world because of the 
                        force of their ideas!! 

           As the Veteran lands in front of Rockwell, Rockwell speaks 
           both to the crowd and to the man directly.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        There is no power on this earth 
                        that can equal a human being who is 
                        ready to die because he believes in 
                        something, and has the brains to 
                        push it forward! 

           With that, Rockwell SMILES a great big smile as he is PUNCHED 
           by the Veteran.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           NEWSPAPER COVERAGE: papers across the U.S. cover the 
           rally. 

           The last paper is the NEW YORK TIMES we opened on: 
           “RIOT ERUPTS AT NYC ROCKWELL RALLY!”

           INT ALEX HALEY’S APARTMENT, GREENWHICH VILLAGE, DAY 

           CLOSE ON: ALEX HALEY, 43, black, bespectacled, a man full of 
           cheery intelligence. 

           On Alex’s desk is a copy of today’s newspaper, which we’ve 
           just seen, including Rockwell’s picture. 

           Alex speaks on the phone with his literary agent, PAUL 
           REYNOLDS. 

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Did you stick to the original 
                        pitch?
                                 ALEX
                        More or less. I think I said 
                        “America’s most dramatic, 
                        successful demagogue--a new breed, 
                        the young, black one--is on stage.” 

           The shabby Greenwich apartment is piled high with paper. 
           Clippings of MALCOLM X, notes, and lots and lots of bills.

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Doubleday is a large house, a 
                        conservative house, a conscientious 
                        house, and publishes quite a lot of 
                        distinguished writers. Convincing 
                        them that this book could be 
                        profitable is truly a feat. This is 
                        incredible for you, Alex. 
                        Congratulations. 

                                 ALEX
                        I couldn’t have done it without 
                        your negotiating for me. Thank you.   

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        I hope the first writing sessions 
                        with Malcolm have been fruitful.   

           Alex’s face tells a different story, but of course Reynolds 
           cannot see him. He changes the subject. 

                                 ALEX
                        That reminds me: I’m thinking I 
                        might not want to be listed as 
                        Malcolm’s coauthor since that 
                        implies I share Malcolm’s views. 
                        What about “The Autobiography of 
                        Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley?”

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Look--your first book being as 
                        splashy as this means you can 
                        credit yourself however the hell 
                        you want. I might suggest, though, 
                        that you get it in somewhere in the 
                        introduction that you’re not a 
                        Black Muslim. I’m just thinking of 
                        your future career.

           Haley nods, mulling that over.

                                 ALEX
                        Incidentally, I bought a car--that 
                        runs! A 1955 Dodge, for $80. Isn’t 
                        that just wild!
                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                             (seeing through it)
                        You need an advance. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah. To keep the phone on. And fix 
                        the typewriter.
                             (while he’s at it)
                        Oh, and Malcolm wants his half of 
                        the advance made payable to 
                        Muhammad’s Mosque No. 2...I’m 
                        pretty sure he believes the 
                        autobiography will demonstrate his 
                        loyalty to the Messenger. 

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Elijah Muhammad? He and Malcolm X 
                        are on the outs?

                                 ALEX
                        That’s the impression I’m getting. 

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Oooh...trouble in paradise. 

                                 ALEX
                        You didn’t hear it from me. Both of 
                        them tolerate negative 
                        interpretations of their movement 
                        for the sake of the publicity, but 
                        when it comes to internal bickering 
                        I think the Nation prefers to 
                        present a unified front.

                                 REYNOLDS (O.S.)
                        Sure. 

                                 ALEX
                        Bye. I’m going to run across the 
                        street and grab a bite.

           Hanging up, Alex opens his apartment door and almost jumps. 

           A stern-faced young GUARD stands at ramrod attention in his 
           hallway, ready to knock. The man’s black pillbox hat is 
           emblazoned with “FOI,” Fruit of Islam, the paramilitary wing 
           of the Nation.

           Alex scans his face--he didn’t hear that last part of the 
           call. Did he?

                                 FOI GUARD
                        Mr. Haley?
                                 ALEX
                        That’s right.

                                 FOI GUARD
                        I’m here on behalf of Minister 
                        Malcolm, who apologizes but must 
                        cancel his appointment with you 
                        this evening. His wife will pick up 
                        the pages tomorrow and he will 
                        review them. 

                                 ALEX
                        All right. Thank you.

                                 FOI GUARD
                        I will return tomorrow with Miss. 
                        Shabazz and wait outside.

                                 ALEX
                        Miss Shabazz? You mean Betty? 
                        Malcolm’s wife?

                                 FOI GUARD
                        His daughter. Miss Attallah 
                        Shabazz. As Mrs. Betty Shabazz will 
                        not be available to pick up the 
                        manuscript until later this 
                        evening, she needs somewhere for 
                        her daughter to wait. 

                                 ALEX
                        ...Uh...yeah I...sure.

           Alex locks his apartment and heads exits the building.

           EXT ANOTHER BUILDING, LARGE MARBLE STEPS, DAY

           Pull out to reveal: MURRAY FISCHER, 31, very hung over. He 
           lies under the bar. 

           Murray rolls over and attempts to stand up--hitting his head 
           on the bar. 

           WIDE of the room: in tatters from the previous night but 
           perfect 60s TIKI decor. Blue light dances across Murray’s 
           face. 
           Its source is a window--into a POOL. A woman’s bathing-suit 
           clad body shoots across it. 

           Murray buttons his shirt and looks around for his jacket. 

           The woman, wearing goggles, returns to the pool window to 
           ogle Murray. She watches him search in vain, then taps on the 
           glass. 

           She points above the bar. The tiki face wears Murray’s jacket 
           around its shoulders, and holds a clock in its hands. As 
           Murray grabs his jacket he sees the clock reads 12:30. 

           He bolts out the door and we move with him through--

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION BREAKFAST ROOM, CHICAGO, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           Two BUNNIES (i.e. two young adult women) finish their 
           breakfast. They are shuttled to the next room by JONI MATHIS, 
           30s, head of Mansion and Hef’s secretary, holding a clip-
           board.

                                 JONI
                             (to a “Bunny”)
                        Have you spoken with Bev, dear? 
                        She’s the photo editor and might be 
                        willing to meet with your sister 
                        about the assistant role. 

           Joni spots Murray.

                                 JONI (CONT’D)
                        You better hurry, Murray. 
                             (pointedly)
                        Hef’s “Dexie” cycle is on the up. 
                        Your pitch window is now. 

           The “Bunnies” look Murray up and down. They poke fun at his 
           appearance.  

                                 BUNNIES
                        Hurry, Murray!

           A third Bunny has been watching the interaction, sipping on 
           grapefruit juice and reading a newspaper--the New York Times.

                                 BUNNY 3
                        You don’t have a pitch, do you?

                                 MURRAY
                             (defensive)
                        Sure I do.
           The Bunny wordlessly folds the newspaper and hands it to 
           Murray. 

           EXT PLAYBOY MANSION, CHICAGO, DAY, CONTINUOUS

           The mansion is a French neoclassical brick and limestone 
           residence in the Gold Coast district of Chicago.

           Through various windows we catch glimpses of Murray, head 
           down, searching the front page of the paper as he strides 
           from room to room. 

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION LIVING ROOM, CHICAGO, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           INSERT: the New York Times story on Rockwell’s rally, A PHOTO 
           of Rockwell’s face with a swollen eye and stitched lip. 

           Murray stares at it as he lands in--

           A huge oak-paneled room with low-lying mid-century furniture 
           semi-circled around a stone fireplace. 

           On every sofa and chair sit men in sharp suits and shiny 
           shoes. The only female is BEV CHAMBERLAIN, late 20s, photo 
           editor, in cat-eye glasses and a sweater. Everyone sips on 
           coffee, whiskey or both. 

           In shirtsleeves, cross-legged below the fireplace: HUGH 
           HEFNER, 38, beautiful but gaunt, hasn’t slept in days. This 
           is normal. 

                                 HEF
                        It’s an interview Spec, we’re not 
                        making him Playmate of the month.

           He speaks to AC SPECTORSKY, 53, editor. Before them Bev has 
           laid out black-and-white photos of Cassius Clay (later 
           Muhammad Ali).

                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        Murray! Glad you could join us. 
                        Spec here was just raising 
                        objection to our Cassius Clay 
                        piece. He wouldn’t be able to see a 
                        draft, by any chance?

           Murray squeezes onto the couch next to Bev. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Not quite yet. Alex is still 
                        working on it. 
                                 SPECTORSKY
                        He’s been working on it for months. 

                                 MURRAY
                        He's got his hands tied with the 
                        Malcolm X Autobiography. He’s 
                        subject to Malcolm’s schedule so 
                        the Clay piece always gets 
                        sidelined. What’s your concern, 
                        Spec?

                                 SPECTORSKY
                        He’s a violent hate-monger.

                                 MURRAY
                        Would you prefer to do your Three 
                        Decades of Shirley Temple story?

           Murray gets a laugh from the group and succeeds in deflecting 
           attention from the late draft. 

                                 HEF
                             (to Murray)
                        Maybe we can do something to offset 
                        it. Who’s next on your interview 
                        list? 

                                 MURRAY
                        George Lincoln Rockwell. 

                                 SPECTORSKY
                        ...Not quite what I had in mind.  

           Hef claps his hands in excitement at the idea. 

           Spec, not so much. 

                                 SPECTORSKY (CONT’D)
                        We could lose subscriptions over 
                        this. We are profiling a Negro 
                        Muslim, and you’re suggesting the 
                        Nazi is an appropriate counter 
                        weight??

           Murray and Spec don’t get along. 

                                 BEV
                        Won’t be pretty. 

                                 MURRAY
                        You don’t think so? I think 
                        Rockwell’s a handsome guy. 

           Bev rolls her eyes. 
           A wide-eyed intern, LOGAN, 22, is passing out coffee and 
           pretending not to listen.

                                 LOGAN
                        I hear he's planning a 
                        governatorial race!

           Bev makes fun of his pronunciation.

                                 BEV
                        Gubernatorial. 

           Hef speaks over his laughter.

                                 HEF
                             (to Murray)
                        You’re leaving for New York 
                        tonight?

           Bev raises an eyebrow at Murray’s unkempt, last-night’s-suit 
           look. Murray ignores her.

                                 MURRAY
                        Yes.

                                 HEF
                        Just make sure Alex turns it in. 
                        He's still on our payroll, even if 
                        he is writing 
                             (with faux gravitas)
                        “the book of a lifetime.” 

           Some nod, others snicker.

                             (to Murray)
                        Get your writer in tow. Otherwise 
                        we’ll have blank fucking pages.

           INT GORGEOUS APARTMENT, NYC, NIGHT

           Alex is at a “swingin” party, full of backless dresses and 
           cocktails. The only commonality among the diverse crowd is 
           success. 

           He looks a little shy as he talks to a group of alluring 
           people.  

                                 ALEX
                        I did have to get in the boxing 
                        ring with him a bit first, though. 
                                 WOMAN
                        I’ve heard Cassius Clay is quite 
                        the boxer. Did he win?

                                 ALEX
                        The match or the interview?

           He gets a laugh. A DRUNK MAN stumbles into their 
           conversation. 

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Susan! There you are.

                                 WOMAN
                        You found us! So sorry we lost you. 
                             (she isn’t)
                        Joe, this is Alex. He’s in 
                        publishing as well...I’m sorry, 
                        what did you say your last name 
                        was? 

                                 ALEX
                        Haley. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh, yes! I know you!...You’re the 
                        Reader’s Digest fellow who flies 
                        around all over the place--but I 
                        can never find anything you’ve 
                        written?

           The cheer drains from Alex’s face. 

           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, NIGHT, LATER

           Alex sits at the threadbare desk, reading and writing 
           furiously. Clippings of Malcolm X have multiplied, along with 
           a stack of paper beginning to look like a MANUSCRIPT.

           A KNOCK at the door. Murray stands in the doorway.

                                 MURRAY
                        Hello my friend!

                                 ALEX
                        Mur! Thought we were having lunch?

                                 MURRAY
                        We are. 
                             (not explaining)
                        So--is Malcolm opening up?
                                 ALEX
                        A bit. But every time he comes in 
                        here he snaps his fingers and yells 
                        “Testing--one, two, three!”

                                 MURRAY
                             (laughing)
                        He thinks the FBI bugged your pad?

                                 ALEX
                        They probably did.

                                 MURRAY
                        Well maybe you oughtta stop calling 
                        him a “black demagogue” and he’d 
                        open up a bit more.

                                 ALEX
                        I stopped calling him that.

                                 MURRAY
                        To his face. Malcolm X is a smart 
                        guy. Not every writer gets to debut 
                        by profiling one of the most 
                        sensational figures of the decade. 
                        He’s using you. And he knows you’re 
                        using him, too. 

           Alex doesn’t seem overly bothered by Murray’s implication 
           that he is capitalizing on Malcolm’s image. 

                                 ALEX
                        ...As you say.

                                 MURRAY
                        All I mean is, given the 
                        circumstances, it might take a 
                        while for him to tell you anything.
                             (switching tones)
                        Which is what I’m here about. I’m 
                        genuinely interested in your 
                        success with this, Alex. But this 
                        Malcolm book does not belong to 
                        Playboy. What does belong to 
                        Playboy, and the 5 million readers 
                        we are allowing you to reach--is 
                        that fucking Cassius Clay 
                        interview. Spec is really crawling 
                        up my ass about it.

                                 ALEX
                        Ok. I’ll get it done.
                                 MURRAY
                        You will bring it to me tomorrow at 
                        lunch. Also, you will report back 
                        to me about your new assignment.

                                 ALEX
                        New assignment?

                                 MURRAY
                        George Lincoln Rockwell.

           Alex’s eyes go wide.

                                 MURRAY (CONT’D)
                        I know. Exciting. Splashy as all 
                        hell, too. It’ll be really good for 
                        you, Alex. But if it’s too much 
                        work...I can always give it to 
                        somebody else.

                                 ALEX
                        Lay off.

                                 MURRAY

                        tomorrow. And call Rockwell.

                                 ALEX
                        And if he agrees?

                                 MURRAY 
                        We’ll get on a plane to Chicago and 
                        spend time getting you briefed and 
                        ready. And maybe get you a bullet-
                        proof vest.

                                 MURRAY 
                        Serious. Bye!

           Murray is out the door. Alex pushes his Malcolm notes to the 
           side of his desk, plucks up his Clay interview and types 
           away. 

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:
           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, NIGHT, LATER

           The Clay piece is in a neat pile on Alex’s desk.

           Alex looks at the number Murray gave him. Slowly, he picks up 
           the phone and dials.

                                 ALEX
                        Good evening Commander Rockwell. 
                        This is Alex Haley, I’m a reporter 
                        with Playboy Magazine. 

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        I’m familiar with your publication. 

                                 ALEX
                        Then you may know our magazine 
                        features a lengthy interview once a 
                        month. We are very interested in 
                        profiling you. 

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        All due respect, sir, I am gearing 
                        up to run for governor in Virginia 
                        and I can’t afford to appear in a 
                        girly magazine. 

                                 ALEX
                        I assure you, our publication is 
                        regularly granted interviews with 
                        men of influence across America. I 
                        recently completed a profile of 
                        Malcolm X. He was so pleased with 
                        it that we are now discussing a 
                        book. 

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        ...I admire Malcolm X. He has a 
                        vision for his people just as I 
                        have for mine. All the same...

                                 ALEX
                        It’s my belief, Commander, that Mr. 
                        X, with Elijah Muhammad’s blessing, 
                        agreed to our story because of our 
                        wide reach. We currently enjoy a 
                        subscription base of 5 million. 

           Silence. 
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        ...I would need a written agreement 
                        stating my right to look it over 
                        before publication, ensuring I 
                        won’t be misquoted or 
                        misrepresented. 

                                 ALEX
                        Many of our subjects request the 
                        same courtesy, that should not be a 
                        problem.

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        I’ll do the piece, then. On one 
                        condition.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes?

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Haley, are you Jewish? 

           Alex looks in the mirror across from his desk. 

                                 ALEX
                        Commander Rockwell, I can assure 
                        you I am not Jewish. 

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        Alright then. We have a deal. I 
                        will see you in Arlington, please 
                        have your people send me a choice 
                        of dates.

                                 ALEX
                        I will. Thank you. 

           Alex hangs up and stares at the phone. 

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, ARLINGTON, NIGHT

           Rockwell’s silhouette, staring off into the Virginia Hills. 
           We see nothing else. There is little light at all save the 
           occasional spark from Rockwell’s corn cob pipe. It’s eerily 
           quiet. 

           Footsteps. Rockwell turns, his handsome face comes into view, 
           still puffy from the beating, dark eyes glinting. 
           John Patler, the young stormtrooper from the rally, 
           approaches. Patler is short, swarthy, with a head of thick, 
           black, curly hair. 

                                 PATLER
                        Commander, the unit in Washington 
                        says the D.C. police will be on 
                        protection for our White House 
                        picket. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Tell them I don’t want police 
                        protection. 
                             (looking up)
                        Settle down, John. At ease.

           Patler drops his stiff shoulders, the military clip leaves 
           his voice and he speaks to Rockwell as if to an older 
           brother. 

                                 PATLER
                        ...Linc, you could be really hurt. 

           Rockwell doesn’t address this concern. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        You got into an argument with 
                        Lieutenant Koehl, John. Why?

           Patler looks ashamed. 

                                 PATLER
                        He...called me an Olive Nigger. 

           Rockwell snorts. Patler is upset, but Rockwell can’t help it.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Not everyone can tell the 
                        difference between a Greek and a 
                        nigger. 
                             (more serious)
                        I need you to stop fighting, John. 
                        I need you to put on a brave face 
                        and I need you to be diplomatic. If 
                        we are to persevere, our ranks must 
                        stay unified. 
                             (patting Patler’s 
                              shoulder)
                        Only when we have a real, unified 
                        front can we can get exposure. We 
                        lose exposure, we lose donations. 
           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, NEXT DAY

           Alex stands in his open kitchenette making a PB+J sandwich. 

           Lanky ATTALLAH SHABAZZ, Malcolm X’s eldest, in a school 
           uniform, red-tinged hair pulled into braids, sits on the 
           couch staring at Alex. 

           There’s nothing “cute” about her. In fact, she’s 
           intimidating, for a six-year-old. 

                                 ALEX
                        You like peanut-butter?

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Sure. My mom say what time she’d be 
                        by?

                                 ALEX
                        Around 4:30. So you’re in the first 
                        grade, huh? You got a favorite 
                        subject?

           Attallah gives him a look that says, “you don’t have anything 
           better than THAT?” 

           It’s so serious that Alex says--

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        ...sorry. 

           He hands her the sandwich, then stuffs pages of a manuscript 
           in a manila envelope. Attallah notices.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        What you gonna write about my 
                        daddy?

           Alex remembers what Murray said about Alex’s use of “fearsome 
           black demagogue.”

                                 ALEX
                        Oh...just his life, you know. How 
                        he grew up, his...background. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Like when he was a pusher?

           Not what Alex was expecting. 

                                 ALEX
                        You know what a pusher is?
           This is a face off. He’s not gonna tell her more than she 
           knows, and she’s not gonna tell him what she doesn’t.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        ...something you get arrested for.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not writing any more or less 
                        than what your daddy tells me. 

           Attallah stares right through Alex. She seems to be 
           evaluating how fair he will be to her dad. 

           She takes a bite of her sandwich, then puts it down and 
           strolls around Alex’s place, looking at his notes. 

           Some napkins with scribbles on them hang out of a set of 
           notebooks. Before Alex can stop her--

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (opening the notebooks)
                        This is dad’s writing.

           She flips through the notebooks--pages and pages of doodled-
           on napkins and accompanying dates. She looks up at Alex 
           suspiciously.

                                 ATTALLAH (CONT’D)
                        This is weird.

           Alex is nervous but her bluntness makes him laugh anyway. 

                                 ALEX
                        I guess it is, yeah. 

           Attallah waits for an explanation. The scrutiny makes Alex 
           almost break a sweat. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Truth be told, I’m having a tough 
                        time getting your dad to open up. 
                        And I noticed that he doodles on 
                        scrap paper...so I started leaving 
                        things out, y’know. For him to 
                        write on. And then I kinda can get 
                        more of a clue of what he’s 
                        thinking. 

           She leafs through the pages. 
                                 ATTALLAH
                             (reading)
                        “Here lies a YM, killed by a BM, 
                        fighting for the WM, who killed all 
                        the RM.”
                             (making sense of it)
                        ...here lies a yellow man, killed 
                        by a black man, fighting for the 
                        white man who killed the red man.

                                 ALEX
                        I figured that one out, yeah.

           She reads some more. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        “Sh--show...”

           Alex looks over her shoulder at the words she struggles with.

                                 ALEX
                        “Shocking”...”Shocking to reveal.”

                                 ATTALLAH
                        “Shocking to reveal the names of 
                        the BM leaders who have secretly 
                        met with THEM.”

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t know who “them” is.

           Attallah thinks it over. Her cageyness drops a little when 
           she gets thoughtful. She clearly enjoys a good puzzle. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Well...if “BM” means black 
                        man...and “WM” means white 
                        man...than “THEM” prolly isn’t the 
                        word. It’s prolly t-h-e-m.

                                 ALEX
                             (dawning on him, to 
                              himself)
                        The honorable Elijah Muhammad...

           Attallah is now more interested in analyzing Alex than her 
           dad’s discarded doodles. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        You a writer, huh? 

                                 ALEX
                        Well...I--I’m a journalist. 
                                 ATTALLAH
                        So you just write about other 
                        people all day?

           He’s not sure if she means to be disparaging...

                                 ALEX
                        Uh, yeah. I have a new interview I 
                        gotta prepare for, which is why I’m 
                        sending your dad this new chapt-

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (struggling with the word)
                        An...interview...like when you ask 
                        questions?

           So begins a rapid-fire exchange: 

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Well why you gotta prepare then if 
                        all you gotta do is ask questions.

                                 ALEX
                        Because I gotta know what questions 
                        to ask! 
                             (pointedly)
                        We can’t all just spin ‘em off the 
                        top of our heads.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        What’s the guy do?

                                 ALEX
                        He’s the head of a political party. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        He like my dad?

                                 ALEX
                        No! Not like your dad. He’s trying 
                        to work against the things your dad 
                        is working for. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Why’s that?

           Alex figures at this point he won’t be saying anything she 
           hasn’t heard. 

                                 ALEX
                        He doesn’t like black folks.
                                 ATTALLAH
                        ...But you’re a Negro.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes little lady, I am. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        So how you gonna get him to talk to 
                        you?

                                 ALEX
                        Now you see why I gotta think up 
                        some good questions, don’t you?

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Yeah.

           Attallah pauses to think. Then suddenly--

                                 ATTALLAH (CONT’D)
                        You think you’re gonna be somebody?

           Alex is again caught off guard but a KNOCK at his front door 
           saves him.

           BETTY SHABAZZ, 28, wife of Malcolm X, arrives. Attallah 
           immediately goes to pack up her bag. 

                                 BETTY
                        Hey baby! Hello, Alex. Thank you 
                        for baby-sitting. I’m sorry it was 
                        so last minute. 
                             (explaining)
                        Malcolm had to take the car. He 
                        wanted to make sure I got--

           Alex hands her the manila envelope.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        These the new pages?

                                 ALEX
                        Yes, sister. 

                                 BETTY
                        And how did my girl behave herself? 

           Attallah watches Alex out of the corner of her eye.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh, she was great. Just as sweet as 
                        your cinnamon sugar pie. 
           The no-nonsense clip of Betty’s voice is tinged with sympathy 
           for Alex.  

                                 BETTY
                             (re the manuscript)
                        I’ll help you with everything 
                        you’ve got so far, as much as I 
                        can. Malcolm is going away for the 
                        next few weeks.

           Attallah looks up.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        But he’s coming home early tonight! 

           A wide grin splits across Attallah’s face. For the first 
           time, she actually looks like a little kid.

           Betty lowers her voice.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Truly, thanks for your help today. 
                        You know, I shared some of 
                        Malcolm’s suspicions of you when 
                        you first came to my house. But you 
                        know what changed my mind?

                                 ALEX
                        My complimenting your cinnamon pie?

                                 BETTY
                        No Alex. Your perspective. After 
                        you left--I thought, ‘God, this is 
                        a man of the world.’ I didn’t say 
                        as much to Malcolm, I wanted to 
                        make sure you could keep coming 
                        around.

           Alex laughs.

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you Sister Betty, I 
                        appreciate it greatly. 

                                 BETTY
                        Good, because I believe it. One 
                        book can change a man’s life, you 
                        know. 

           Alex is not sure if she’s talking about him, Malcolm, the 
           book’s potential reader--but it doesn’t matter. It makes him 
           smile.
                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        And alright, yes I liked what you 
                        said about the pie. Now you get 
                        back to work!

                                 ALEX
                        Yes ma’am.

           Betty and Attallah leave. Over her shoulder on the way out--

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (eyebrow raised)
                        Good luck with that...interview.

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION SPARE ROOM, CHICAGO, DAY

           A lavish room in the mansion. Playboy issues framed on the 
           walls. Alex and Murray prep.

                                 ALEX 
                        His dad was in vaudeville. Did 
                        really well, really well. Parents 
                        got a divorce. But I can’t find 
                        anything major. 

           Alex has brought everything he can find on Rockwell, 
           including a photo of him as a youth. Murray looks over it.

                                 MURRAY
                        What went wrong?

                                 ALEX
                        No idea. His brother is fine. Not a 
                        Nazi, a bright businessman. Works 
                        with their high school friend 
                        Stanley Tupper, who is now a 
                        Republican Rep from Maine in 
                        Congress...

                                 MURRAY
                        Damn.

           Murray has a pin-board of Nazi propaganda, cartoons and 
           paraphernalia.

                        Propaganda Minister. Ironic, 
                        because Patler's not quite your 
                        fierce-Nazi-warrior type. He’s 
                        Greek--real name is Patsalos. 
                        Started out a mentee of Rockwell’s.  

                                 MURRAY
                        You know Rockwell’s planning on 
                        running for governor? 

                                 ALEX
                             (nodding)
                        He wants to be governor of 
                        Virginia, then use that as a 
                        platform to run for president of 
                        the U.S. In 1972. The thing I 
                        haven’t been able to get a read on 
                        from the papers is: how big is his 
                        following really?

           Murray shakes his head and shrugs. 

                                 MURRAY
                        It’s almost certain he won’t give 
                        you an accurate response to that. 
                        See what you can glean when you get   
                        there anyway.

                                 ALEX
                        How much mail, how big a house, how 
                        well monied, how functional--

                                 MURRAY
                        How many jack-booted 
                        assholes...Speaking of which! We’ll 
                        need to arrange for protection. 

                                 ALEX
                        What do you have in mind?

                                 MURRAY
                        We can fly one of Hef’s body guards 
                        down there with you. Plainclothes. 
                        He can be your “assistant.”

                        don’t think so, Murray. 

                                 MURRAY

                                 ALEX
                        I know.

                                 MURRAY
                        Did you give Rockwell that detail?

                                 ALEX
                        No. He only asked if I was Jewish.

                        Oh, alright. You’re just gonna 
                        waltz into the American Nazi Party 
                        barracks with your self-assurance 
                        and your smile?????

                                 ALEX
                        Rockwell has political ambitions. 
                        He’s not going to kill a Playboy 
                        interviewer. Murder won’t look good 
                        on a presidential ticket. 

                                 MURRAY
                        There are a lot of things he could 
                        do to you short of murder. 

           Alex shakes his head. For a moment it looks like he might 
           reject the story. 

                                 ALEX
                        In order to get what you want I 
                        need him to relax. How can I catch 
                        him off guard with “my assistant” 
                        towering over him?

                                 MURRAY
                        I hear he’s actually pretty tall. 
                             (Alex isn’t budging)
                        I should have you sign a release.

           INT AMERICAN NAZI SEDAN, WASHINGTON D.C., NIGHT

           Rockwell, Patler, and several other troopers drive in silence 
           through the capitol. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        They stuck police on us to keep the 
                        news away. 

           Patler speaks quietly, so the other men cannot hear him. 

                                 PATLER
                        Not much the police can do about 
                        Playboy. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Playboy will never print us. Have 
                        you spoken about getting us that 
                        spot on the Today Show?

                                 PATLER
                        Linc...we cannot afford a national 
                        program at the moment. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Fine! The local station then.

           Patler shakes his head. Rockwell looks irate.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        We need a new approach. Something 
                        they really can’t keep out of the 
                        papers. 

           A trooper reads a PAPER with the Voting Rights Act coverage 
           we just saw.

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION SPARE ROOM, CHICAGO, NIGHT

           A small bag is packed in the corner, notes and clippings of 
           Rockwell are spewed across the desk. 

           Alex is losing focus. He paces the room, unable to read 
           anymore. Finally, he sits at the desk to make a final round 
           of notes. New determination in his eyes. He begins to write. 

           A knock at the door. Of course.
                                 ALEX
                        Hello?

           Murray opens it.

                                 MURRAY 
                        He’s going to want a rise out of 
                        you. Stay cool, Alex. The only way 
                        we’re ever gonna find out if this 
                        wacko is a real danger, if he has 
                        any real potential, is if you stay 
                        cool. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks Murray. I’m cool.

                                 MURRAY 
                        Call me if you need anything, of 
                        course. 

           Murray exits. 

                                 ALEX
                        ....I’m cool. 

           EXT WASHINGTON D.C. TRAIN STATION, DAY 

           Alex stands in line with fellow travellers clad in 60’s mod 
           and Washington business casual.

           EXT ARLINGTON VIRGINIA/INT ALEX’S LIMO, DAY

           Alex is driven along the Potomac River. The bright sun glints 
           off the water. Across the bridge he can see the Washington 
           Monument and Lincoln Memorial. 

           JUMP CUTS: 

           Alex’s limo passes the Pentagon. Arlington National Cemetery. 
           American memories carved into stone under a bright blue sky. 

           The car turns, headed off down long wood-lined road. The 
           safety of the national monuments fades into the distance. 
           Alex looks back at them. 

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, ARLINGTON, DAY

           A large white wood-slatted house sits at the end of the 
           peaceful drive. Hanging from all four windows are large 
           SWASTIKA FLAGS, and over the roof a billboard reading “White 
           Man Fight! -- Smash the Black revolution!”
           Birds chirp. Alex’s limo pulls up. 

           Six STORMTROOPERS, from late teens to middle age, stand at 
           attention in a line on the porch. A young trooper, later 
           known as JAKE CAMPBELL, 18, trots down to the limo. He cannot 
           see the passenger through the tinted windows. 

           Campbell opens the passenger door for Alex, and straightens 
           to SALUTE before he makes eye contact. 

           Alex’s legs emerge from the car, then his torso, finally his 
           face. He stands to greet the trooper. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hello. 

           Campbell does not succeed in concealing his surprise. He 
           looks to his friends on the porch, who provide no answers. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Hi there. My name is Alex Haley, I 
                        am here on behalf of Playboy 
                        magazine for our interview with 
                        Commander Rockwell. 

           The limo driver is having none of this.

                                 LIMO DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Haley, I’ll be back at 3. 
                        Alright?

                                 ALEX
                             (not so sure)
                        Alright, thanks.

           The car pulls away. Alex watches his last guarantee of safety 
           drive down the long backwoods road and out of sight.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I...will alert the Commander of 
                        your arrival. Follow me. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. 

           Alex walks up the steps of the house. The stormtroopers stare 
           straight ahead, still at attention. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Hello gentlemen. No need to stand 
                        on ceremony on my account, I hope! 

           Alex’s attempt at levity falls on deaf ears, sending a chill 
           down his spine. 
           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, DAY

           Campbell leads Alex through a dark hallway into a “reception” 
           room. 

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ RECEPTION ROOM, DAY

           The walls are black, the room dimly lit by red candles. Their 
           flames dance across Alex’s glasses as he looks at the decor. 

           On the wall are three portraits: Adolf Hitler, George 
           Washington, and Rockwell himself. A banner reading “America 
           Awake” hangs beside an honorable discharge from the US Navy. 
           Everything is bathed in the candles’ red glow.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wait here. 

                                 ALEX
                        Where am I, exactly?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        The shrine room. 

                                 ALEX
                        Ah! Of course. How big is the 
                        house?

           Per Murray, Alex is trying to assess the real size of the 
           organization without asking flat-out.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        9 rooms. 

                                 ALEX
                        And they contain what else, besides 
                        the shrine?

           Campbell is uncomfortable answering Alex’s questions. He 
           doesn’t know how much information to give. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You sleep here?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes. We have barracks in the 
                        building.

                                 ALEX
                        Mess hall?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes. 
                                 ALEX
                        That’s good. Can’t do anything 
                        without a mess hall. Learned that 
                        in the navy. I was a cook! Not very 
                        good at that job, sorry to say. You 
                        like the food here?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I’ll eat what I’m given, the party 
                        has more important aims than my 
                        stomach. 

                                 ALEX
                        Naturally, sure. All the same, a 
                        warm belly never hurt any cause.

           Campbell is still unsure how to respond. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I’ll go alert the Commander now.

           Alex notices a small table with a stack of crudely bound 
           books. 

                                 ALEX
                        Mind if I take a look while I wait?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        The Shrine Room is open to the 
                        public, and I guess you are the 
                        public. 

           He exits. Alex turns his attention to the books. A stack of 
           pamphlets called “The Rockwell Report” filled with 
           disturbing, vicious cartoons. An autobiography featuring 
           Rockwell’s picture entitled This Time, the World! 

           The candles flicker and Alex looks up. A Doberman stares in 
           at him. Alex doesn’t move. The dog leaves the doorway. 

           Alex breathes a sigh of relief and leafs through the 
           literature. “Was Lincoln a Bigot?” 

           Campbell reappears. 

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        Commander Rockwell has instructed 
                        me to bring you to him. Follow me. 

           He turns on his heel. Alex follows him--
           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ HALLWAY, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           --back down the dark corridor, and up a set of stairs. 

                                 ALEX
                        What’s your name, Private?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        ...Campbell. 

                                 ALEX
                        And your first name?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Jake Campbell.

                                 ALEX
                        Nice to meet you. 

           INT ROCKWELL’S OFFICE, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           Campbell opens the door. Alex enters. 

           WIDE of room: Similar to the shrine room, less ornate. A self-
           portrait of Rockwell hangs above a desk where Rockwell 
           himself sits, waiting. 

           Another trooper stands between Alex and Rockwell, at 
           attention. Rockwell motions to the chair in front of his 
           desk. 

           Alex slowly takes his seat. Rockwell hits a button on a 
           RECORDER. As he does Alex sees a pearl-handled PISTOL sitting 
           next to it. 

           Alex tenses. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Ready when you are. 

           As Alex brings out his own recorder he notices his hand 
           shaking. He hides it back in his pocket. 

                                 ALEX
                        Before we begin, Commander, I 
                        wonder if you'd mind telling me why 
                        you're keeping that pistol there at 
                        your elbow, and this armed 
                        bodyguard between us.
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Just a precaution. You may not be 
                        aware of the fact that I have 
                        received thousands of threats 
                        against my life. If you are who you 
                        claim to be, you have nothing to 
                        fear.

           Alex is not sure of that, but he feigns comfort. 

                                 ALEX
                        I am.

           Rockwell nods. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Good. I'd like to make something 
                        else crystal clear before we begin. 
                        You're here in your professional 
                        capacity; I'm here in my 
                        professional capacity. While here, 
                        you'll be treated well, but I see 
                        you're a black interviewer. It's 
                        nothing personal, but I want you to 
                        understand that I don't mix with 
                        your kind, and we call your race 
                        "niggers."

           Alex takes his hand out of his pocket, it’s steadier. 

                                 ALEX
                        I've been called "nigger" many 
                        times, Commander, but this is the 
                        first time I'm being paid for it. 
                        So you go right ahead. What have 
                        you got against us "niggers?”

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I've got nothing against you. I 
                        just think you people would be 
                        happier going back to Africa where 
                        you came from. I’d have you go on a 
                        Cadillac shaped luxury liner! When 
                        the pilgrims got pushed around in 
                        Europe, they didn't have any sit-
                        ins or crawl-ins; they got out and 
                        went to a wilderness and built a 
                        great civilization.

                                 ALEX
                        It was built with the help of 
                        Negroes.
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Help or no, the white people in 
                        America simply aren't going to 
                        allow you to mix with them.

                                 ALEX
                        The purpose of the Civil Rights 
                        Movement is equality of rights and 
                        opportunity, Commander--not 
                        miscegenation, as you seem to be 
                        implying.

           Rockwell dismisses this out of hand. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Equality may be the stated purpose, 
                        but race mixing is what it boils 
                        down to in practice. That’s what 
                        makes white people mad.

                                 ALEX
                        Do you think you're entitled to 
                        speak for white people?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Malcolm X says the same thing I'm 
                        saying.

                                 ALEX
                        He is certainly in no position to 
                        speak for white people. 

           A trace of amusement graces Rockwell’s face, though he 
           remains unfriendly.  

                                 ROCKWELL
                        The masses of common, ordinary 
                        white people will want a leader 
                        like Malcolm X. No more spineless 
                        jelly fish, no more glamorous 
                        matinee idols. They’ll want a white 
                        leader with the balls to stand up 
                        and say, “I’m going to send the 
                        coons back to Africa, and I’m going 
                        to have the Jew communists gassed 
                        for treason.” And if you don’t like 
                        it, you know what you can do about 
                        it. 

                                 ALEX
                        Do you seriously think you can be 
                        elected on that platform? 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        I know so. In 1972. 

           Alex ever-so-gently raises an eyebrow. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Things are going to be so desperate 
                        that it won’t matter whether I’ve 
                        got two horns and a tail; I’ll be 
                        swept into office. I’ll appoint a 
                        crack cabinet--J. Edgar Hoover, 
                        George Wallace--none of them are 
                        known as anti-Semitic.  

                                 ALEX
                        How about anti-Negro?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I’d prefer to call them pro-white. 

                                 ALEX
                        Would you, as chief executive, 
                        create a dictatorship like 
                        Hitler’s?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        No, I would reinstitute the 
                        American Constitutional Republic 
                        the way it was set up by our 
                        authoritarian forefathers.

                                 ALEX
                        In what way did the founding 
                        fathers abridge “liberty and 
                        justice for all?”

                                 ROCKWELL
                        They created an authoritarian 
                        Republic with a limited electorate. 
                        When these white Christian patriots 
                        sat down to pen the Declaration of 
                        Independence, there were no black 
                        citizens for them to worry about. 
                        All the niggers were slaves; but 
                        today, thanks to several misguided 
                        amendments--

           Alex can’t help but marvel at his phrasing.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        --our Constitution provides even 
                        the blackest of savages with the 
                        same rights and privileges of his 
                        former white masters. 
                                 ALEX
                        Then you advocate the 
                        disenfranchisement of Negroes?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        And the revocation of their 
                        citizenship. I would simply deport 
                        them back to Africa--including you, 
                        by the way. Nothing personal, you 
                        understand. 
                             (pause)
                        Even if I liked you personally; I 
                        couldn’t make any exceptions. 

           Now it’s Alex’s turn to be amused. 

                                 ALEX
                        Think nothing of it. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I'll admit one great failing of my 
                        own people: the white man is 
                        getting too soft. The niggers are 
                        forced to do hard manual labor, and 
                        as a result, most niggers are 
                        healthy animals -- the way nature 
                        intended a male to be. When you 
                        take a look at how the average, 
                        bourgeois white man spends his 
                        time: hunched over a desk, riding 
                        around on his electric lawn mower 
                        or squatting on his fur-lined 
                        toilet seat--they’ve become soft 
                        and squishy. Especially some of the 
                        skinny, pasty-faced white peace 
                        creeps. What normal woman would 
                        want one of these cruds?

           Alex keeps an earnest tone, but toys with him just a bit.

                                 ALEX
                        Are you implying that the Negro 
                        male is sexually superior to the 
                        white male?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Certainly not. The average white 
                        workingman is just as tough and 
                        ballsy as any nigger who ever 
                        lived. It's the white intellectuals 
                        who have allowed themselves to 
                        degenerate physically, mentally and 
                        especially spiritually.
                                 ALEX
                        Do you consider Negroes superior to 
                        white men in any other way?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Look at history; investigate the 
                        different races. The Chinese 
                        perform--they've created a great 
                        civilization. All the white races 
                        certainly perform. But the nigger 
                        race, until very recently, has done 
                        absolutely nothing.

                                 ALEX
                        How recently?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        The past 20 or 30 years.

           Alex grins. 

                                 ALEX
                        Recent archaeological findings have 
                        documented the existence of 
                        advanced black African 
                        civilizations centuries before the 
                        dawn of comparable cultures in 
                        Europe.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        If they were so far ahead of us 
                        then, why are they still shooting 
                        blow darts at each other while 
                        we're launching rockets to the 
                        moon?

                                 ALEX
                        The American space program isn't a 
                        segregated project, Commander. 
                        There are many Negroes working for 
                        NASA and in the space industry.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I'm well aware that there are 
                        exceptions on both sides. All
                        I'm saying is that the average of 
                        your people is below the average of 
                        my people; and the pure-black ones 
                        are even further below us. 

           Rockwell’s professorial response ends abruptly, and his next 
           words are icy. 
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t know why you’re wasting 
                        my time with this conversation. 
                        You’ll never print any of this. Are 
                        you hungry?

           Alex is startled by the question. 

                                 ALEX
                        It does seem close to lunchtime. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        No Nazi eats with blacks, I’m 
                        afraid, but I know a great spot.

           Rockwell barks into the hallway.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Private Campbell. Come drive Mr. 
                        Haley down the road.

           Alex really does not like the sound of that. But not having 
           an option, he gets up and follows Campbell out.

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY SEDAN, DAY

           Campbell and another trooper sit in front, while Alex sits in 
           back. They drive deeper into the Virginia woods down a long, 
           lonely road lined by tall trees. 

           Alex’s eyes scan the landscape. 

                                 ALEX
                        Where are we going, gentlemen?

                                 TROOPER
                        Where your kind go.

           Alex shuts up. Now he’s very scared. 

           EXT DINER, VIRGINIA, DAY

           Alex looks out the window at the diner. Perhaps nice when it 
           was built 30 years ago, now it is a little dilapidated. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We’ll be back for you in a while.
           INT DINER, VIRGINIA, DAY

           Alex opens the diner door to a “ring” from a bell on a 
           string. The clientele turn to look at him.

           Everyone is black, and everyone is on a break from some local 
           job. Gas-station attendants, nurses, and other service 
           uniforms. Alex sticks out like a sore thumb in his well-
           tailored New York suit.

                                 ALEX
                        Afternoon, all. 

           He gets a few smiles and tips of the hat. He walks to the 
           counter and speaks to the young waitress. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Uh...may I have a hamburger, please 
                        ma’am?

                                 WAITRESS
                             (thick Virginia accent)
                        Sure thing. Cheese?

                                 ALEX
                        Yes, please.

                                 WAITRESS
                             (yelling back to kitchen)
                        One hamburger! Cheese. And a nice 
                        side of pickles and fries!

           Alex smiles at her kindness and welcoming attitude.

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. 

           INT ROCKWELL’S OFFICE, AFTERNOON

           Alex re-enters. Rockwell is different, as if he has given 
           himself permission to relax. He’s not cordial, but he’s not 
           combative either. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Have a good lunch?

                                 ALEX
                        I did, thanks. 

           Rockwell pauses, about to give an explanation for his change 
           in demeanor. 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Now, you're an intelligent person; 
                        I enjoy talking to you...But: 
                        you're not pure black. 

           He has been formulating this theory over the lunch break.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        This may insult you, but we're not 
                        here to throw pansies at each 
                        other: there had to be some white 
                        people in your background 
                        somewhere, or you wouldn't be brown 
                        instead of black. Right?

                                 ALEX
                        Right.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Well, I'm saying that your 
                        intelligence comes from the blood 
                        of my people. The fact that you can 
                        show me one very black individual 
                        who is superior to me doesn't 
                        convince me that the average nigger 
                        is superior. 

                                 ALEX
                        The words superior and inferior 
                        have no meaning to geneticists,
                        Commander. Every authority in the 
                        field has attested that the world's 
                        racial groups are genetically 
                        indistinguishable from one another. 
                        All men, including hybrids, in 
                        other words -- are created equal.

           The depth of Alex’s belief in this phrase does not manage to 
           penetrate Rockwell’s wall. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        You're bringing tears to my eyes. 
                        This equality garbage is straight 
                        Soviet biology, preaching that by 
                        changing the environment you could 
                        grow one plant from another plant's 
                        seeds. You can't grow wheat from 
                        corn by changing the environment.

           Alex changes delivery, back to his purely logical tone.

                                 ALEX
                        You can't grow wheat from corn by 
                        changing anything. 
           Rockwell’s response is swift, almost funny.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I don’t feel like quibbling. 
                             (pause)
                        Delude people into believing that 
                        the nigger is only 
                        "underprivileged" rather than 
                        inherently inferior; that he can be 
                        cleaned up and smartened up by 
                        letting him study in our schools 
                        and move into our neighborhoods. 
                        The next inevitable step is to take 
                        him into our beds--and hence the 
                        destruction of the white race.

                                 ALEX
                        You said that the Jews are behind 
                        this plot. Since they're whites 
                        themselves, how would they benefit 
                        from their own destruction?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        They believe they're too pure to 
                        mix; they think they're "the chosen 
                        people"--chosen to rule the world. 
                        When the white man permits himself 
                        to be mixed with black men, then 
                        the Jews can master him. That's 
                        what the so-called Civil Rights 
                        Movement is all about. They're 
                        liable to get away with it if the 
                        good white Christians of this 
                        country don't wake up and get 
                        together before it's too late to 
                        restore the natural order of 
                        things. Chimpanzees do not run with 
                        baboons; they run with chimpanzees. 
                        In thoroughly integrated colleges, 
                        when I visit them, I notice that 
                        niggers usually sit and eat at 
                        tables with other niggers--even 
                        though they don't have to. And the 
                        white people sit with other white 
                        people. I think this is the natural 
                        tendency, and to attempt to pervert 
                        this is to fight nature.

                        between choosing to associate with

                        will mingle and some won't; and 
                        most Americans think this is just 
                        the way it ought to be.

                        don’t feel free to say what they’re

           Trooper 3 walks with Alex and Rockwell as they move to exit 
           the building.

                                 ROCKWELL
                             (to Trooper 3)
                        Yes?

           Trooper 3 whispers in Rockwell’s ear. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        See if Barbara has panty-hose you 
                        can borrow. 

           Trooper 3 whispers again. Alex is intrigued, and tries 
           pretend he’s “not listening.”

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                             (frustration growing)
                        Well I don’t know about opaque vs 
                        not opaque. What kind of a...here. 

           Rockwell takes out his wallet and hands the trooper cash.

                        Commander, I must ask. 

           Rockwell gives an arch smile.

                        It will be clear to you soon 
                        enough.

           Rockwell and Alex descend the front steps. The troopers looks 
           straight ahead. Alex tries to acknowledge them again. 

                                 ALEX
                        Bye gentlemen!

           He gestures to the flag pole and the meeting ground around 
           it.

                        Medals?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        The highest I’ve ever yet given was 
                        Silver--that was to a man who 
                        couldn’t contain himself and he 
                        belted Martin Luther Coon in 
                        Birmingham. 

           Alex flinches at the pun. Rockwell points to Alex’s limo.

                        It’s no Cadillac shaped boat. 

           Rockwell lets out a genuine laugh and extends his hand.

                        will print the piece. 

                                 ALEX

           Murray scans Alex’s notes. Alex and Bev sit sorting the

           Alex shrugs. Both men are stumped on that score.

           Spectorsky walks by and peaks his head in.

           Alex is a little less cavalier than at their previous 
           strategy session.

                                 ALEX
                        Hitler was a half-penny Hitler. 

           Bev notices. Murray does not.

           Spectorsky reads some of the interview transcript over 
           Murray’s shoulder.

                        I can’t believe he looked you in 
                        the face and said this. 

                                 MURRAY
                        I can’t believe he looked Alex--a 
                        reporter--in the face while saying 
                        no one will report on him because 
                        of a Jewish conspiracy. 

                                 SPECTORSKY
                        Well that’s true.

                        I wouldn’t say they won’t let 
                        people report it. Clearly. But a 
                        Rabbi there has been calling 
                        reporters about not reporting on 
                        Rockwell for...years really. Called 
                        me once. 

           Everyone sits in stunned silence.

                        No, he just told me what he thought 
                        about printing Rockwell.

                        Ok...Does he exert any “influence?” 
                        Pressure?...Threats?

                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, Murray. The threat of the 
                        Nazis gaining power in the US. 
                        That’s pretty much all a member of 
                        the free press needs to hear, I 
                        should think. 

           Spectorsky leaves.

           Alex seems confused by the revelation, but intrigued.

                        You wondering if Rockwell’s right 
                        about the rest too?

           Alex gives Murray a “watch yourself” glance, but he’s still 
           thinking about what this means. 

                                 ALEX

           The Rabbi DR. SOLOMON ANDHIL FINEBERG, 40, unassuming but 
           dignified, eats at a restaurant. 

           He sits with a representative of the Jewish War Veterans, 
           LARRY SIMCHOWITZ, 30s, who wears a uniform baseball cap we 
           recognize from the opening scene. It’s the one the young 
           veteran who punched Rockwell wore. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        People picket the White House every 
                        day.
                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                        Nazis don’t! You do appreciate that 
                        the man plans to run for governor 
                        in Virginia?

                                 FINEBERG
                        There is no reason to fear his 
                        success in that endeavor.

           Simchowitz is frustrated by Fineberg’s calm. 

                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                        It took Little Adolf ten years to 
                        come to power, and he was the 
                        laughing stock of Germany for most 
                        of that time.

                                 FINEBERG
                        I understand your frustration. 

                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                        Do you? I live with the memories of 
                        friends--Jewish and otherwise!--
                        whose bodies have faded into 
                        foreign soil so that this ideology 
                        might never come here. You asked 
                        those of us that are left to stand 
                        by and do nothing while a Nazi 
                        walked freely down Pennsylvania 
                        Avenue. And now you tell us to 
                        continue doing nothing. You ask too 
                        much!

           Fineberg sees the pain in Simchowitz’s eyes, but he stays 
           steady.

                                 FINEBERG
                        This, my dear man, is not that kind 
                        of war. It is just as much about 
                        what we do as what we do not 
                        do...Did you see any press coverage 
                        of the event? 

                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                             (admitting it)
                        I didn’t.

                                 FINEBERG
                        Though he held up a sign that 
                        said...what?

                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                        “Who needs niggers,” it said.
                                 FINEBERG
                        Despite that inflammatory language, 
                        there was no coverage. And why? 
                        Because there was no violence. No 
                        doubt, you have been following 
                        Reverend King’s efforts to register 
                        Negro voters?

                                 SIMCHOWITZ
                        With interest and admiration. We 
                        are thinking of joining them in 
                        their marches.

                                 FINEBERG
                        Then I advise you to do so. Support 
                        those who deserve it. That is where 
                        your attention belongs. Dr. King, 
                        and others like him, are angling 
                        for legislation. Major legislation. 
                        They’ll get it. As they do--
                        Rockwell’s potential for gaining 
                        devotees grows. And he knows it.

                                 FINEBERG (CONT’D)
                        So as far as your concern about his 
                        political ambitions--with the 
                        enfranchisement of Negroes, how 
                        likely do you think it is he will 
                        win the governorship? How many 
                        Negroes will vote for a Nazi?

           EXT NYC UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT, DAY

           Dr. Fineberg’s assistant ISAIAH, 25 and fresh out of 
           Brandeis, and another assistant, JEAN, 20, wait outside the 
           restaurant. Fineberg joins them and they walk back to work.

                                 JEAN
                        Rabbi, may I ask you a personal 
                        question? 

           Jean’s face is riddled with concern. Isaiah’s reaction makes 
           it clear that this is a regular occurrence. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Of course.

                        I’ve noticed my brother often 
                        leaves the house without his 
                        yarmulke. 
                                 FINEBERG
                        Dear, there are a myriad of reasons 
                        why a man might venture outside 
                        bare-headed. The requirements of 
                        his work, for one. I would not 
                        allow it to trouble you. 

                                 JEAN
                        And the meeting?

                        The veterans have agreed to stand 
                        down. Rockwell should stay out of 
                        the papers as long as he doesn’t 
                        concoct some other doltish scheme. 

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ HALLWAY, NIGHT

           A dark hallway. Light spills out from an open door. 

           Rockwell’s voice emanates from the room, effecting what he 
           might consider a “sissy” timbre:

                                 ROCKWELL (O.S.)
                        “The Mississippi Freedom Democrat 
                        Party insists that 450,000 Negroes 
                        in Mississippi are systematically 
                        and deliberately prevented from 
                        voting.” 

           INT ROCKWELL’S OFFICE, NIGHT

           John Patler, Trooper ROBERT LLOYD, 20, and Rockwell sit 
           around a table speaking in hushed voices. Shadows fall this 
           way and that. Rockwell holds the newspaper he reads from. 

           INSERT NEWSPAPER: three black women (Mrs. Hamer, Devine, and 
           Gray). The title reads: “MFDP ATTEMPTS TO SEAT THREE NEGRO 
           WOMEN IN HOUSE OF REPS.“

           The men hunch over a MAP which the ominous light makes 
           impossible for us to see.

                                 LLOYD
                        We still need a briefcase big 
                        enough to hide the materials. 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        How much security will you need to 
                        get through?

                                 PATLER
                        We did some recon yesterday. It 
                        seems that there’s none in the 
                        public entrance, but if we want to 
                        get to the floor, there’s a guard 
                        we’ll have to get past. 

           REVEAL MAP: a floor plan of the U.S. CAPITOL. 

           EXT U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING, WASHINGTON D.C., DAY

           Patler and Lloyd enter the Capitol, as senators and tourists 
           mill around. They pause conspicuously to “look at a painting” 
           and attempt to act natural.

           Patler stands under the oil painting of those legendary men 
           sitting around a desk planning his country. For a moment, his 
           face changes to something like wonder.

           He is tugged back to reality as Lloyd pulls him toward the 
           men’s bathroom. 

           INT US CAPITOL BUILDING MEN’S BATHROOM, DAY, CONTINUOUS

           Patler stands by the door, while Lloyd slips into a stall. 

           IN THE STALL: Lloyd unzips his briefcase, taking out black 
           PANTY-HOSE, a long-sleeved black shirt, and a crushed-down 
           stovepipe hat. 

                                 LLOYD
                        I need the mirror. Clear?

           Just as he asks the bathroom door swings open and a 
           CONGRESSMAN enters. Patler clears his throat. 

           LLoyd, now frustrated, opens up a tiny compact filled with 
           BLACK FACE PAINT. He struggles to put it on with no mirror. 

           Outside the stall, the Congressman uses the urinal. He 
           notices Patler standing in the corner. 

                                 CONGRESSMAN
                        Good day. 
                                 PATLER
                        Sir. 
                             (taps foot nervously)
                        Lloyd? Let’s? 

                                 LLOYD (O.S.)
                        One minute!

           Inside the stall, Lloyd’s hands fumble as he ties a LOINCLOTH 
           around his waist. He then stuffs his “plainclothes” back into 
           the briefcase.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Coming. 

           Lloyd, now in minstrel attire, leaves the stall and saunters 
           past the Congressman, just finishing at the urinal. The 
           Congressman does not have time to react. Lloyd gives him a 
           salute as he exits. 

           INT CAPITOL BUILDING HALLWAY, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           Lloyd hands the briefcase to Patler and BOLTS for a side 
           staircase, through which members of Congress file into the 
           House. 

           Long, moving shot up the stairs--

           INT CAPITOL BUILDING LOBBY LEVEL, DAY, CONTINUOUS

           --past two policemen who are barely out of their seats before 
           he’s gone. 

           Nearing the chamber, a DOORMAN makes a final jump in front of 
           him, but Lloyd rams the man sideways and tunnels onto the 
           House floor. 

           INT CAPITOL BUILDING HOUSE FLOOR, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

                                 LLOYD
                        I’se the Mississippi delegation! I 
                        demand to be seated!!!

           The House goes quiet. Lloyd, enjoying the spotlight, hops 
           around on the floor, hooting. 

                                 CONGRESSMAN IN CHAMBER
                        Get him out!!
           The policeman finally run in after Lloyd. One grabs Patler, 
           who looks humiliated at the capture. Lloyd is jubilant till 
           the end as police and several Representatives drag him out. 

                                 LLOYD
                        God bless America! Long live 
                        Rockwell!!!!

           EXT/INT ALEX’S CAR, AFTERNOON

           Alex’s 1955 Dodge idles outside a primary school in Harlem. 
           He reads the New York Times, chuckling at the photos of Lloyd 
           being escorted out of Congress.  

                                 ALEX
                             (sighing to himself)
                        Bless.

                                 ATTALLAH (O.S.)
                        Bless what?

           Attallah has appeared in his window and opens the passenger 
           door of the car, scooting down the long seat. 

                                 ALEX
                        Oh hello young lady! Bless Allah, 
                        it would seem.

           Attallah is followed by her little sister QUBILAH, 4. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (to Alex)
                        You don’t bless Allah, you praise 
                        him! Crazy.

                                 ALEX
                        My mistake.

           Attallah takes her seat and Alex pulls away from the curb. 
           The red in Attallah’s hair shines in the afternoon sunlight. 
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You know how come I call your dad 
                        Big Red?

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (blankly)
                        Cause his hair is red?

           The paper Alex was reading has fallen to the floor, and 
           Qubilah stares at it. 

                                 ALEX
                        Oh don’t pay that no mind, honey, 
                        that’s just a dumb kid. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        It’s in the newspaper ain’t it?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s news. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Well if it’s news how’s she gonna 
                        pay it no mind then?

           Alex tries to play the jovial uncle, laughing it off. 

                                 ALEX
                        She read the news?

           But little Qubilah keeps staring at the picture, face riddled 
           with confusion.

           Lloyd may have been comical in action, but his blackface 
           caught in the black-and-white photograph makes him look 
           eerie. Even grotesque. More so the more the child stares. 

           Attallah takes the paper off the floor and tosses it behind 
           the seat, out of her little sister’s sight.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        You shouldn’t have that stuff 
                        around when there’s kids. 

           Alex chafes at her critique. 

                                 ATTALLAH (CONT’D)
                             (re the paper)

                        because we’re trying to vote.
                                 ALEX
                        Does she? Your mamma is a very 
                        smart lady, I’ll bet there’s truth 
                        in what she says.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        They won’t let you vote but they’ll 
                        let you write a book, huh?

                                 ALEX
                        They let me vote! 
                             (echoing her)
                        Crazy.

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (skeptical)
                        Then what’s all the fuss about?

           Alex is starting to get a feel for what she’ll respect. He 
           gives her a good clean response.

                                 ALEX
                        The fuss is because they don’t let 
                        everybody vote. And it’s not 
                        letting--it’s a right. But 
                        sometimes we gotta...remind people. 
                        Like your daddy does.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Is that what you’re doing? 
                        Reminding people?

           Alex looks to her to try and read her meaning.

                                 ATTALLAH (CONT’D)
                        You’re writing about my daddy ain’t 
                        you? 

                                 ALEX
                        Of course! As you say, Little Red, 
                        that’s all part of the game.

           CLOSE ON Alex. The confidence in his voice is not matched in 
           his eyes. He hopes he’s not lying to her.

           She hurries with him toward the elevator.

                        It’s my roommate. She’s going to 
                        Barnard. She says her course load 
                        is too heavy for her to join Hillel 
                        and it makes me very, very nervous 
                        for her.   
                             (under her breath)
                        She already strays as it is...

                        Jean, dear, your roommate 
                        understands her own schedule better 
                        than anyone. If it does not allow 
                        for Hillel, I am sure she can still 
                        make time for temple and Shabbat. 
                        We live in a modern world! We must 
                        grow accustomed to it.

           Fineberg’s assistant Isaiah rings his hands at his desk. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Don’t worry about food for the 
                        meeting, I stopped on the way. 
                        Calls?

           Isaiah gives him a tortured look.

           Fineberg and Isaiah stress eat mouthfuls of blintzes.

                        On balance, we know he’s getting 
                        desperate. These are the acts of a 
                        desperate pipsqueak gasping for 
                        air.

                        demonstrate.

                        Just because the blackout is 
                        broken, doesn’t mean it’s over. 
                        Clearly it’s working because the 
                        man is relegated to childishness.

           INT F.A.O. SCHWARTZ, FIFTH AVE, NYC, DAY

           Alex is in the doll section. He walks past a display of 
           Madame Alexander dolls--each more white than the last. A 
           cowgirl. A bride. A princess. Scarlet O’Hara. Snow White. 

           A saleswoman walks by. 

                                 ALEX
                        Excuse me?

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        Can I help you?

                                 ALEX
                        I...My friend forgot to buy a 
                        birthday present for his daughter. 
                        I might need some help picking the 
                        right doll?

                                 SALESWOMAN
                             (judgemental)
                        Forgot?

                                 ALEX
                        He’s a very busy man. 

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        You’re a good friend. 

                                 ALEX
                        Believe me, this is the least I can 
                        do. 

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        What does she like?

           Alex looks helplessly at the Snow White doll. 

                                 ALEX
                        ...She thinks her mother Betty is 
                        very pretty. None of these dolls 
                        look quite like her mother. 
                                 SALESWOMAN
                        Ah. Let me check the back. 

           The Saleswoman exits. Snow White stares at Alex. 

           After a moment, the woman returns holding a black doll in a 
           modest white dress. Alex is under-whelmed. He thinks hard. 
           This is not his forte. 

                                 ALEX
                        Do you have...I don’t know...a bow? 

           The woman softens. She reaches into her uniform pocket and 
           takes out a bow for wrapping gifts. She fastens it into a 
           sash around the doll’s dress. 

           She glances around for her supervisor before plucking the 
           bonnet off Scarlet O’Hara. 

                                 SALESWOMAN

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ ROCKWELL’S BEDROOM, MORNING

           Curtains drawn, Rockwell sleeps. His radio alarm clock clicks 
           on. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...third Bond film, Goldfinger, 
                        coming stateside this week. And on 
                        the national stage, the reverend 
                        Martin Luther King Jr. takes his 
                        fight to Selma, Alabama, where he 
                        will be leading a voter-
                        registration drive. 

           Rockwell slowly rises from his bed and puts his feet on the 
           floor. 

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ MESS HALL, MORNING

           Rockwell addresses several of the men over their breakfast 
           (of what looks like slop) in jubilant tones.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Road trip to Alabama, boys! 
                        Agitate, agitate, agitate. We know 
                        the Jews go crazy for Dr. Coon! 
                        They’ll certainly be printing 
                        whatever happens there.

           Rockwell looks at their bowls of slop.  
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        And since we’re strapped, and we’re 
                        all having to make sacrifices, we 
                        can’t afford any more TV time, 
                        we’ll have to earn it. Whaddya say?

           A cheer goes up from the breakfast-eaters, albeit a hungry 
           one. 

                                 PATLER
                        Commander, don’t you think we 
                        oughtta...be a bit more specific in 
                        our approach?

                        What in the hell are you saying?

                                 PATLER
                        I just...I thought we might try 
                        something a little different. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        John before you get any more 
                        brilliant ideas let me see your 
                        sketches for the Coon-Liner. 

           Patler unhappily hands him the file in his hands. 

           It’s a “ticket” for a “Coon-Ard Lines Boat to Africa.” 
           Propaganda material. “This ticket entitles one nigger to...”

           It is illustrated by cartoonish monkeys in suits marching 
           happily towards a ship.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Ha! Alright, I need you to scamper 
                        on down to the printer. And-- 
                             (to the room)
                        What did Koehl say the other day? 
                        We wanted to add something to the 
                        ticket. Chicken coop and water 
                        melon patch on deck and...?

                        of the troops again. You know 
                        better than that, John. 

                                 PATLER
                        You weren’t there in Congress.

           Rockwell doesn’t understand what he means. 

                                 PATLER (CONT’D)
                        It was embarrassing! It got us 
                        nowhere!

           Rockwell is surprised at the outburst. It’s furious, like a 
           son talking to his dad.

                                 PATLER (CONT’D)
                        We can make it into that building 
                        as congressmen. I felt it. But not 
                        if we keep dressing up Lloyd in a 
                        monkey suit and never--

                                 ROCKWELL
                        We will make it there! If we follow 
                        the plan. We need to be in the 
                        public’s eye, really in their eye--
                        before we can deliver the real 
                        message. Otherwise the Jews and the 
                        pinkos will keep undermining us. 
                        They’ll never let us reach anyone 
                        until enough people are clamoring 
                        for what we have to say.

                                 PATLER
                        But when will it be?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Soon dammit! I’m as eager as you! 
                        Now get down there and print those 
                        Coon-Liners. We can’t leave the 
                        niggers standing on the dock!

           Rockwell holds a press conference, while Patler stands by him 
           and an American flag.

                        Alabama any more than we can have 
                        them voting in Virginia! I believe 
                        I can run Mr. Coon out of town. 
                        We’ll have signs in every window of 
                        every shop and restaurant: “Welcome 
                        niggers to coon day in Selma!”

           Some locals boo, some cheer. 

           EXT SELMA STREETS, LATER

           Rockwell and a few troopers stroll down the street singing a 
           “Hate-Nanny” and giving away vinyl records and fliers to 
           passersby.

           THE DAY WEARS ON as Rockwell and troopers hand out fliers and 
           shake hands, asking for support. 

           They pass a group of black students who look at them warily. 
           Some white citizens stop and speak with the ANP, others 
           stare.

           EXT ALBERT HOTEL, SELMA, NIGHT

           Rockwell and company return with smiles on their faces, 
           sorting the small bills they’ve been given. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Goodnight, boys. Be on the porch by 
                        8 tomorrow morning to start 
                        organizing people. 

           EXT ALBERT HOTEL, SELMA, NEXT MORNING

           Rockwell and the troopers wait expectantly on the hotel’s 
           porch. 

           EXT ALBERT HOTEL, SELMA, AFTERNOON

           Rockwell’s face has changed to disgust. He sits and smokes 
           his pipe. 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Well, that’s that. No posters, no 
                        signs, no help. If we want to reach 
                        King, we’ll have to do it in front 
                        of cameras and we’ll have to be 
                        smart.
                             (pointing at a trooper)
                        You, go to King’s hotel and run 
                        back as soon as you see him 
                        leaving. 

           EXT ALBERT HOTEL BACK DOOR/SELMA STREET, AFTERNOON

           The Scout Trooper has returned. Lloyd, in his ape costume, 
           creeps out the back door with the Scout. 

           They are barely around the corner when--

           CU on Lloyd and he is TACKLED to the ground by a cop and 
           handcuffed. 

           CU Rockwell, rubbing his temples. 

           As the cops take Lloyd away, Patler hands Rockwell a big wad 
           of bills from his pocket.

                                 PATLER
                        There goes our collection from 
                        yesterday.

           EXT SELMA COURTHOUSE, AFTERNOON

           Rockwell, un-crinkling and counting the bills goes to bailout 
           Lloyd. 

           As he walks up the steps he sees a PACK OF REPORTERS. They 
           encircle King, trailed by black Selma citizens, about to 
           register to vote. 

           Rockwell’s fury at the coincidence is overpowering. But it 
           changes to the realization that he has an opportunity. He 
           marches towards King.

           INT ALEX’S NEIGHBORHOOD DINER, GREENWICH VILLAGE, AFTERNOON

           A copy of the paper sticks out of Alex’s tattered briefcase. 
           He sits with Attallah, who eats fried fish and a pineapple 
           and cottage cheese salad.

                                 ALEX
                        Your mom let you eat junk food?

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Sure.

           He leaves it. By now he’s comfortable with her running the 
           show.

                                 ATTALLAH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for my doll.

                             (lying badly)
                        What? What doll?

                                 ATTALLAH
                        The one I got for my birthday.

                                 ALEX
                        I didn’t get you that. Your dad 
                        did.

           She doesn’t even pretend to believe him a little. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Ok. But anyway, it’s a nice 
                        doll...How’s your book?

                                 ALEX
                        You know what? I think it’s coming 
                        along.

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (irritated)
                        Sometimes my dad doesn’t come home 
                        from your house till I go to 
                        school.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry to send him back so late. 
                        But you know he’s only got so much 
                        time for talking with me because he 
                        talks to a lot of other important 
                        people during the day. 
           Attallah does not need any explanation about what her dad 
           does. She seems to believe she’s more aware than anyone. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                             (with pride)
                        I know.

                                 ALEX
                        It may surprise you, but I even 
                        have some other work I have to do.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Mhm.

           Alex points to the photo of Rockwell and King in the paper.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You remember that interview I had 
                        with the guy who hates Negroes?

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Sure.

                                 ALEX
                        That’s the guy.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        You ask him good questions?

                                 ALEX
                        We’re not done yet.

                                 ATTALLAH
                        You haven’t asked why he hates 
                        Negroes?

           Now she’s just playing. He seems to have broken her shell, 
           finally. 

           Alex throws one of his french fries at her. She catches it 
           and eats it, then grins. 

           For a minute, the world does not feel like such a hard place.

           EXT GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET, NIGHT

           Alex walks home with a bundle of paperwork and groceries. He 
           passes an Italian restaurant with a small TV. 

           Malcolm is speaking. Alex stops to watch. Something is not 
           right.
           The Italian waiter watching gets up wordlessly and opens the 
           door for Alex to come in. They watch together as Malcolm 
           speaks in front of his burning house. 

           INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT, BACK ROOM, NIGHT

           Alex talks on an old rotary phone.

                        You found me.

                                 ALEX
                        Malcolm! Are the girls ok?

                                 MALCOLM X (O.S.)
                        They’re shook. But they’re ok.

           Alex does not know what to say.

                                 MALCOLM X (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I know we were meant to meet Friday 
                        but can we reschedule? Monday? I 
                        have a few more things to work out 
                        now. 

                                 ALEX
                        Like where to sleep?

                                 MALCOLM X (O.S.)
                        No, I got that covered for now, but 
                        thank you...How is it possible to 
                        write one’s life in a world so fast-
                        changing as this?

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY, CHICAGO, EVENING

           Murray tiptoes out of the living room, clothes from last 
           night, shoes in one hand. 

                                 HEF (O.S.)
                        Murray!

           Murray freezes. Hef, wired, comes at him, holding notes. 

                                 HEF (CONT’D)
                        Why is the guy bothering with this 
                        Nazi shit?
           He has a tendency to start in the middle of a conversation 
           and assume others will catch up. 

                                 MURRAY
                        ...Rockwell?

                                 HEF
                        It doesn’t make sense. If he’s 
                        really trying to get somewhere he’s 
                        gotta know Americans want their 
                        own, home grown bigotry. Not some 
                        German import...He’s gotta be 
                        pathological. 

           Murray has an unspoken “pot calling the kettle” moment.

                                 MURRAY
                        It’s occurred to me. 

                                 HEF
                        You have another interview on the 
                        books with him?

           Murray is tired of making excuses for Alex’s dilatoriness.

                                 MURRAY
                        Alex is working on it...

                                 HEF
                        Well tell him not to ask him about 
                        politics this time.

                        ...what else is there? What’s on 
                        the inside of a guy like that? 

                                 HEF

           NEWSPAPER COVERAGE: Malcolm X Murdered. Papers across 
           the country with various versions of the headline. 
           The New York Times reads: “The Apostle of Hate Is 
           Dead.”

           INT DOUBLEDAY PUBLISHING HOUSE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE, NYC, DAY

           A copy of the New York Times sits on the desk. Alex sits 
           crumpled in a chair before the PRESIDENT of Doubleday. 

                                 DOUBLEDAY PRESIDENT
                        The trouble is, Mr. Haley, we 
                        simply cannot know the consequences 
                        of putting out this material. There 
                        could be reprisals against the 
                        house. Who knows what the reaction 
                        might be. My understanding is, the 
                        police still aren’t even sure who 
                        did it!  

                                 ALEX
                        The people that did it won’t be 
                        coming for your company, or anyone 
                        in it. They got what they wanted.

                                 DOUBLEDAY PRESIDENT
                        I’m afraid I cannot share your 
                        certainty on the matter...We 
                        forfeit the advance, of course. 

           Alex cannot believe what he’s hearing.

                                 DOUBLEDAY PRESIDENT (CONT’D)
                        And we wish you the absolute best 
                        in your endeavors. But it is a risk 
                        the company cannot take. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s a risk you are not willing to 
                        take. 

                                 DOUBLEDAY PRESIDENT
                        ...However you prefer to see it. We 
                        will not be publishing this book. 
                        I’m sorry.
           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, EVENING

           Alex staggers into his apartment, delirious. He can’t quite 
           come to grips with what’s happened. He looks around the place 
           aimlessly at his notes, manuscripts, photos of Malcolm. What 
           to do? Continue writing? Malcolm’s photo stares back at him 
           and he looks away. 

           He decides to check his messages and picks up the phone. 

                                 OPERATOR
                        Sue’s Answerphone.

                                 OPERATOR
                        Yes, sir. A Mr. Fischer called, 
                        asked for a return. A Mr. George 
                        Haley. And a woman who called 
                        herself Betty. I asked for her last 
                        name, but she didn’t leave it. Said 
                        you would know. 

           Alex’s face crumbles. 

                                 ALEX
                        ...What did Betty say?

                                 OPERATOR
                        She said to please call her back at 
                        5-2271. And she asked that you not 
                        share the new number with anyone? I 
                        tried to clarify with her but--

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. You said 5-2271?

                                 OPERATOR
                        That’s right. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. 

           He hangs up. The thought of calling is too painful. He wishes 
           for a way out. He looks toward his door. He lets his head 
           fall back and he looks up past the ceiling. 

           Taking a big breath, he picks up the phone and dials.

                        She asked for me. She left me the 
                        number. Alex Haley. Please ask her.

                        Hello Alex. 

           Her voice is serene. Unsettling. 

                                 ALEX
                        Betty. How--

           But “how are you?” doesn’t seem right.

                        We’re safe, I can’t say where right 
                        now. We probably wouldn’t have 
                        stayed at the house after this 
                        anyway, but the firebomb destroyed 
                        it. I assume you spoke with Malcolm 
                        about the bomb last week---

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah. We were gonna meet Friday, 
                        but he resch...rescheduled to

                        about the auditorium and if I saw 
                        the shooters, if my husband had 
                        ideas about who might want him 
                        dead. Funny, they didn’t wanna ask 
                        him that before...now he’s gone 
                        they’re curious.

                             (confessing)
                        Qubilah keeps asking when daddy’s 
                        coming back. She saw him fall, you 
                        know...When he and the girls 
                        watched Westerns on Sundays on the 
                        TV, he used to tell her not to be 
                        scared because the actors were just 
                        pretending to be shot. Attallah’s 
                        been crying. I wanted to find the 
                        doll he gave her for her birthday 
                        but I think it may have gone with 
                        the fire. 

           This is too much for Alex. Tears roll down his cheeks and he 
           wipes them away, wrestling to keep them out of his voice. 

                                 ALEX
                        Is there anything I can bring? 
                        Anything I can get to you somehow?

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        The thing is Alex, Malcolm used up 
                        his advance. 

                                 ALEX
                        He told me. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        And he’d been funneling all his 
                        money from the road back into the 
                        movement...We didn’t have life 
                        insurance or home insurance. No 
                        house. No savings. Qubilah is 
                        starting school, I gotta feed all 
                        four and Alex...I’m two months 
                        pregnant.   

           He didn’t know. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So my question to you is: do you 
                        think you’ll be finished with this 
                        book soon? I gotta figure something 
                        else out until then, but it will be 
                        a big help to know there is at 
                        least the completion check coming 
                        in before the initial sales. 

                                 ALEX
                        Uhm...

           A calm descends on Alex. He successfully stops crying without 
           Betty hearing.
           For the moment, he’s reassuring and collected. He doesn’t 
           tell her about Doubleday. He lies. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, Betty. Yeah I almost got it 
                        done. My meeting with Malcolm was 
                        gonna be just to go over the 
                        sections..how we were gonna end the 
                        book. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Well, being that it’s a biography, 
                        I guess you know now. 

           Alex grimaces. But his voice stays soothing.

                                 ALEX
                        Yes. I’ll write up what I have and 
                        call you with any questions. It 
                        shouldn’t take too long, sister. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Thank you Alex. 

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sending you all the love I got, 
                        Betty. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        I feel it. Malcolm believed in you. 
                        You’re gonna write a really good 
                        book. 

           He turns back to his piles of papers. Back to the apartment, 
           empty and even more lost than before. 

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ ROCKWELL’S BEDROOM, MORNING

           CLOSE ON: Rockwell sits at a small desk, smoking his corn cob 
           pipe, reading a newspaper that covers the assassination. 

           CAMERA PANS across the desk and wall behind it: floral 
           wallpaper. A globe. A homemade swastika banner with tassels. 
           A wall calendar filled with photos of Hitler and his troops. 

           Rockwell picks up his phone and dials. 

           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, DAY

           Alex looks like he has not slept, and has clearly been 
           crying. His phone rings. Intercut as necessary: 
                                 Alex
                             (hoarse)
                        Hello?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Mr. Haley, this is Lincoln 
                        Rockwell. I was very sorry to hear 
                        about the fall of Malcolm X, 
                        despite the things he’s said about 
                        me. I wanted to send my 
                        condolences, and let you know I 
                        look forward to your book.

           This is about the last person Alex was expecting to hear 
           from.

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you. But the publisher is 
                        dropping it. They think the book is 
                        a danger to their company. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Those pansies think the Commies are 
                        gonna come blow up their little 
                        press? 

           Alex can’t help but laugh.

                                 ALEX
                        Malcolm was murdered by the Nation 
                        of Islam, Commander. As he said he 
                        would be. 

           Alex is so surprised to hear from Rockwell that he speaks 
           candidly. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Whoever else was wanted him dead, 
                        Elijah Muhammad's followers riddled 
                        him with bullets. He was murdered 
                        by his own people because he no 
                        longer believed that the path they 
                        were taking was the right one. 
                             (to himself, more than 
                              Rockwell)
                        I told him to stay in Africa for a 
                        while, to be safe. I told him to 
                        think of the movement, his wife. 
                             (laughing)
                        Hell, I told him to think of 
                        me!...I’ve never had a close friend 
                        die before.

           Silence. 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        You’ll find another publisher. One 
                        that isn’t filled with sissy boys 
                        sitting on fur-lined toilet seats. 
                        Would you still like to schedule 
                        our second interview? 

                                 ALEX
                        Yes.

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, ARLINGTON, DAY

           Alex walks up the steps to the door. 

                                 ALEX
                             (to troopers)
                        Heya boys!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hello Mr. Haley.

           Alex was not expecting that, and smiles in surprise. 

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ ROCKWELL’S BEDROOM, DAY, LATER

           Rockwell sits in a chair near his bed, Alex at the desk. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        If Malcolm had been alive for that 
                        march in Selma, when the state 
                        troopers advanced on the marchers, 
                        I believe that it would have led to 
                        a black revolution. Martin Luther 
                        Coon and his Jewish masters aren’t 
                        doing the niggers any favors. 

           Alex’s next question, though delivered calmly, is icy. 

                                 ALEX
                        Does it bother you that Dr. King, a 
                        “race-mixing” Negro, is widely 
                        respected and admired by the 
                        majority of the American public, 
                        black and white--while you, a 
                        champion of white supremacy, are 
                        contemptuously regarded by most 
                        people as a “butt” and a 
                        “psychotic”?

           Alex has caught Rockwell off guard. The question cuts at him.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        ...Shunned as a pariah, threatened 
                        and beaten and shot at, harassed by 
                        the Internal Revenue Service. 
                        Abominated...by almost everyone? 

           Rockwell clears his throat.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        King may go on pulling the wool 
                        over the public’s eyes for a while 
                        longer, but they’re going to find 
                        him out for what he is--black on 
                        the outside, Red on the inside. An 
                        18-karat fake, a fraud on the Negro 
                        people. As for my being a 
                        nut...that term has been applied to 
                        some of the greatest men the world 
                        has ever known--from Christ to the 
                        Wright brothers. I say it’s 
                        therefore one of the highest 
                        accolades I could be given. 

           Alex is not giving up this line of questioning.

                                 ALEX
                        Your own father rejects you 
                        publicly, he is ashamed that you 
                        are his son. How do you feel, 
                        facing that?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        It’s simply that my 
                        father...doesn’t believe in what I 
                        am doing. My father is in show 
                        business. And has a lot of Jewish 
                        friends--who don’t believe in 
                        anything but cash. This is where 
                        the Jews fail: in their lack of 
                        idealism.

           Rockwell is managing to avoid questions about how he “feels.”

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got an idealogy. I deeply 
                        believe that there is a power 
                        greater than ourselves that’s 
                        helping us in our fight to keep the 
                        world natural and racially pure. 
                        This house is almost like a hate 
                        monastery. That’s why, eventually, 
                        we’re going to prevail. 
                                 ALEX
                        Do you feel, then, that Hitler was 
                        a martyr? Do you consider yourself 
                        a martyr?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        ...Myself, no I’m not yet a martyr. 
                        My battle has lost me a wife and 
                        children, and I’ve suffered a lot. 

                                 ALEX
                        You’d say your wife left you over 
                        this?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Actually, I’ve had two wives. The 
                        first one I lost simply from 
                        marital inexperience and stupidity. 
                        The second...we had a happy family 
                        and home, and this battle just made 
                        going on impossible. 

           Alex watches the flicker of pain across Rockwell’s face.

                                 ALEX
                        What do you believe is the purpose 
                        of life?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        ...The purpose of life is to 
                        struggle as hard as you can for 
                        what you believe in and enjoy the 
                        struggle. Even to stand up is a 
                        struggle against gravity! And I 
                        think that the joy  of life is in 
                        the struggle itself and not the 
                        victory--because we all lose. We’re 
                        all gonna croak. So if you can’t 
                        find fun in the fight to live, and 
                        to live to the fullest, then you’re 
                        a failure already before you even 
                        start. 

           Alex gives that response some thought before his next 
           question.

                                 ALEX
                        The only pleasures are derived from 
                        struggle? There are no pure, 
                        unalloyed joys?

           For a fraction of a second, they are just two boys talking.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        ...Do you believe in love?

           Rockwell gives him a side-eye. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Do you think there can be a 
                        positive relationship between two 
                        human beings called love?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Well certainly, I’ve experienced 
                        it. 

                                 ALEX
                        And you find it a struggle?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Uh...yes. Indeed it is. It’s a 
                        struggle to control yourself 
                        and...your emotions so that you 
                        don’t hurt the person you love, 
                        with things that you can’t help 
                        sometimes doing. 

           Rockwell realizes he’s gone too far, and shifts back to 
           detached profesionalism. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        But I don't consider myself 
                        persecuted. Maturity is to accept 
                        the consequences of your own acts. 
                        I think it's a symptom of paranoia 
                        to feel that it's anyone's fault 
                        but your own if you fail to 
                        accomplish what you set out to.

                                 ALEX
                        ...You claim that you are “gagged 
                        and slandered” by the Jewish press, 
                        sabotaged by a nationwide 
                        conspiracy. You state this 
                        conspiracy of silence and 
                        misrepresentation is preventing you 
                        from getting your revolutionary 
                        message across to the white, 
                        gentile masses. To some people, 
                        Commander, these might sound like 
                        the remarks of someone trying to 
                        blame his failures on someone else. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        You think I’m being paranoid, is 
                        that it?
           Alex now knows there’s some truth to this. But how much? He 
           chooses not to respond.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        I only wish it was my imagination. 
                        But the Jew blackout is as real as 
                        a hand over my mouth. Before we 
                        know it, freedom of speech in 
                        America isn’t going to be any 
                        different than the kind they have 
                        in Russia: you’re free to say 
                        anything you want--just as long as 
                        it rubber-stamps the party line. 
                        Well I’m guilty of disagreeing with 
                        the establishment, so the press has 
                        decided to keep me muzzled. 
                             (gesturing towards Alex)
                        It’s possible this whole thing has 
                        been some perverted practical joke. 

           Alex smiles. 

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, DAY

           The troopers snap to attention as Alex and Rockwell descend 
           the front stairs. 

                                 PATLER
                        Commander, should I call a cab? 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        That’s alright, Patler. I’ll drive 
                        Mr. Haley myself. 

           Patler gapes as Rockwell leads Alex to his Chevy Camper. 

           INT/EXT ROCKWELL’S CHEVY, DAY

           Rockwell and Alex drive together down the wood-lined road, 
           rounding a corner where they pass several of his MEN walking 
           home from town. 

           Their incredulous faces stare in at Haley and Rockwell. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        It’s too late! I’ve joined the 
                        NAACP!

           They glide down Arlington’s main boulevard and stop at a 
           light. A MAN on the street recognizes Rockwell. The light 
           goes GREEN and Rockwell takes off, cackling. 
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        They’ll never believe him, swearing 
                        he saw Rockwell with a nigger! 
                        Hahahahah!

           Alex can’t help but crack a smile watching this man act like 
           a goon. 

           EXT NATIONAL AIRPORT, CURB SIDE, WASHINGTON D.C., DAY

           Rockwell pulls up. Alex opens the door. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks for the lift. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Surely. 
                             (re the article)
                        I’m glad for the opportunity, but I 
                        really don’t know why you are 
                        wasting your time. Your editor is 
                        pulling your leg on this one. 

                                 ALEX
                        Playboy believes in freedom of 
                        speech, and so do I. People will 
                        argue with one another no matter 
                        what. I, personally, would rather 
                        have it done with words than with 
                        blows, or worse, with bullets. So 
                        no, I’m not wasting my time. 

           And then a dig at Rockwell.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        The American people can distinguish 
                        opinion from fact. So we’ll run the 
                        story, don’t you worry. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Here’s hoping.

                                 ALEX
                        ...Do you really believe all this 
                        you preach?

           Rockwell’s mood turns solemn again. He looks Alex dead in the 
           eyes. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        This has cost me the most beautiful 
                        wife in the world. Seven kids. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROCKWELL (CONT'D)
                        I was a commander in the Navy and a 
                        half-year away from my pension. 
                        Certainly I believe all of this. 

                                 ALEX
                        And you think you can win a 
                        campaign with it?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Let me explain something you might 
                        find useful in your own endeavors. 
                        I reject the term “human being” as 
                        an absolute category. I see man as 
                        part of nature, with some types of 
                        man being less human than others. A 
                        natural continuum, in which there 
                        is no sharp line. 

           Rockwell pauses. He wants Alex to hear the following as 
           advice.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Now, many white Americans might not 
                        literally think you, or even your 
                        people, are categorically inferior. 
                        But that won’t stop them from 
                        profiting off the idea that you 
                        are. All I need is a few people who 
                        believe it, and the rest who are 
                        not so eager to contradict them. So 
                        yes, I believe I can win. If not 
                        now, then soon.

                                 ALEX
                        I will watch your campaign with 
                        interest, Mr. Rockwell. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Mr. Haley.

           As Rockwell and a few troopers sweat over the ramshackle 
           construction of Campaign Headquarters, we hear Alex’s V.O. of 
           a letter:

                                  ALEX (V.O.)
                        Dear Commander, I’ve been sitting 
                        here now for three cigarette’s 
                        duration, surveying the comings and 
                        goings of London’s leisure class 
                        tea time. Perhaps it’s my status as 
                        a journalist, but the waiters don’t 
                        seem to have a problem silver-
                        traying me. I thought of you this 
                        afternoon as I hunted through 
                        documents at the National Archives. 
                        I’m researching my ancestors’ 
                        travel across the Atlantic (not the 
                        white ones). This has proven 
                        difficult, as it mainly involves 
                        looking through ship logs--under 
                        cargo. Here’s hoping you’re not 
                        working too hard. Cordially, Alex 
                        Haley.

           The storefront finally becomes--

           “OUR FIGHT IS NO JOKE.”

           Patler stands by the ANP Printing Press as it churns out this 
           latest material. 

           Rockwell enters, disheveled, and takes the newsletter from 
           his hands. Patler eyes him, expectant, nervous, as he looks 
           over the new instructions. Rockwell smiles, hands it back to 
           Patler, and heads outside.

           EXT VIRGINIA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, DAY

           Rockwell, having cleaned himself up and looking dashing, 
           descends the steps to speak to a group of reporters. 
                                 REPORTER 1
                        Mr. Rockwell, how did you file?

           SLAMS on a table in--

           INT AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE HQ, NEXT MORNING

           --where Fineberg stands glowering over it, and at his fellow 
           Rabbis and AJC members, sitting at a round table. 

                                 RABBI 1
                        What a schmuck. 

           The group speaks in a tone that waffles between Yiddish 
           colloquial and highly erudite. 

           JACOB BLAUSTEIN, head of the AJC, responds first.

                                 BLAUSTEIN
                        Well, if it’s that obvious--
                        Americans should be able to tell. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        That’s like asking if the ape in 
                        the freak show is an ape or just 
                        some putz with too much armpit 
                        hair. It doesn’t stop people--it 
                        attracts them. They’ll want to see 
                        for themselves. 

                                 BLAUSTEIN
                        Rockwell isn’t some ape in a freak-
                        show. The national stage isn’t a 
                        circus.

           Uncomfortable pause.

                        Solomon...Rockwell has broken 
                        through the press quarantine. It’s 
                        time for a new strategy.
                                 FINEBERG
                        Rockwell is a professional bigot! 
                        He’s running on a platorm--
                             (emotional)
                        that isn’t designed to reach you, 
                        or the Park Avenue crowd, or the 
                        hippies. He wants to find people in 
                        the dark. You’re unsure? You’re 
                        lost? It’s because of the Jews! 
                        It’s because of the Negroes! All he 
                        needs is the press to help him 
                        reach a base that will hear him. 

           A hush falls over the room. The first Rabbi slowly shakes his 
           head. 

                                 RABBI 1
                        Listen. With this method--here’s my 
                        problem: I have a friend down south 
                        who says there are people down 
                        there trying to keep school 
                        integration out of the papers. They 
                        think it’s bad for their kids.  
                        Now...I’m not saying Rockwell has a 
                        point. Myself--I’d prefer not to be 
                        gassed. But...who’s to decide what 
                        can and can’t be printed in a 
                        paper. You? All of us in this room?

                                 FINEBERG
                        That Rockwell does not have die-
                        hards in every American city is 
                        due, I believe, to the work that 
                        has been done to quarantine him.

                                 RABBI 1
                        Are we willing to compromise the 
                        free-speech principles of this 
                        country, of this room, to stop him 
                        gaining followers?

                                 BLAUSTEIN
                        Those in favor of continuing the 
                        quarantine efforts?

           Fineberg raises his hand. 

                                 BLAUSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        Those in favor of combatting 
                        Rockwell openly in the press?

           All other hands go up. Fineberg is beside himself. 
                                 FINEBERG
                        What does it cost us? Have I asked 
                        for money? 

                                 BLAUSTEIN
                        Your time is valuable too, Solomon. 
                        And I think it’s time you start 
                        spending it developing a new 
                        strategy. 

           Fineberg looks at the stack of newspapers carrying Rockwell’s 
           name. 

           INT AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE HQ ELEVATOR, DAY

           Isaiah and Fineberg ride the elevator. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        So are we stopping?

                                 FINEBERG
                        ...I think we monitor him, make 
                        sure nothing really huge is in the 
                        pipeline. And take it from there.  

           The elevator stops on another floor and Jean enters. 

                                 FINEBERG (CONT’D)
                        Hello Jean. 

                                 JEAN
                        Rabbi, my cousin in Chicago goes to 
                        the same temple as one of the 
                        editors at Playboy.

           Isaiah snorts. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        ...sorry. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Now, now, dear. You cannot judge a 
                        man from afar--it’s quite likely 
                        this editor is a good Jew and a 
                        good man. I’m told they have a 
                        wonderful monthly interview, in 
                        fact. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        It’s quite good. 

           Jean looks misty-eyed from one to the other. 
                                 FINEBERG
                        Jean, my dear, it serves us best to 
                        focus on our own path, our own 
                        relationship to Hasesh. 

                                 JEAN
                        Oh, no, I’m not worried about him. 
                        I just thought you might want to 
                        know that they are doing a profile 
                        on George Lincoln Rockwell next 
                        month. 

           Fineberg and Isaiah look at her with dread. 

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION LOBBY, CHICAGO, NEXT MORNING

           Fineberg sits, uncomfortable, as the milieu of Playboy swirls 
           around him. Logan, the intern, comes to retrieve him. 

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION SPARE ROOM, CHICAGO, DAY

           Murray is once again using a spare room as his office. 
           Fineberg walks in and sees Murray in his shirtsleeves. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Mr. Fineberg, is it? How can I help 
                        you?

                                 FINEBERG 
                        Mr. Fischer, I’m here to talk to 
                        you about your Rockwell piece. If 
                        you run this story, you’ll be 
                        undoing five years of toil on the 
                        part of not only my committee, but 
                        local and national editors across 
                        the country.

           Murray’s face falls. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Oh my God. You’re it. The blackout. 
                        You know, I thought he was insane. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        He is insane.  

                                 MURRAY
                        Mr. Fineberg, the man is making 
                        himself known as a hatemonger 
                        across the country, and people 
                        deserve to understand why. 
                                 FINEBERG
                        So you’re going to help him then?

                                 MURRAY
                        I--you might as well say that every 
                        interview with any public figure is 
                        an ad!

                                 FINEBERG
                        I am here to tell you that it is. 
                        And that if you run this piece, you 
                        will help a deranged man reach--how 
                        many people subscribe to your 
                        magazine?

                                 MURRAY
                             (proudly)
                        5 million.

           Fineberg wasn’t expecting a number that high.

                                 FINEBERG
                        5...million. Can you imagine, sir, 
                        how many people within that base 
                        have anti-Semitic sympathies? 
                        Racist sympathies? Radical 
                        sympathies?

                                 MURRAY
                        When I, as an editor, begin to 
                        screen what my reporters write out 
                        of unease over whether the reader 
                        will react correctly--I cease to be 
                        an editor and they cease to be 
                        reporters. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Are you aware that Rockwell is 
                        running for governor of Virginia?

                                 MURRAY
                        I am. Do you think he has a chance?

                                 FINEBERG
                        I do not. I think that all those 
                        who might vote for him, though they 
                        be few, will vote for him if you 
                        run this piece. And I think that 
                        will keep him going. You cannot 
                        imagine the legitimacy he will feel 
                        as a result of being printed in 
                        your publication. 
                                 MURRAY
                        He will be exposed for what he 
                        really is. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        It’s apparent what he really is!

                                 MURRAY
                        Rockwell has no chance of taking 
                        over this country. But some might 
                        say a voice like his will never be 
                        defeated until it is acknowledged. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Do your fears leave you, Mr. 
                        Fischer? Your insecurities and your 
                        angers--now that you are a grown 
                        man, you must know what they are. 
                        So--have they left? A voice like 
                        Rockwell’s--a noxious, small, 
                        fearful voice-- will always live in 
                        our country just as it will always 
                        live in each of us. The only thing 
                        we can do is choose whether or not 
                        to listen.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m an editor, Mr. Fineberg--not a 
                        rabbi. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        It’s only people like you who think 
                        bigotry and hate need to be 
                        revealed. Their reality is already 
                        obvious to many of us because we 
                        live it. Don’t print that story. 
                        Please. 

           Bev opens the door to Murray’s office with a stack of photos 
           but stops, feeling the tension in the air. 

                                 BEV
                        I can come back. 

                                 MURRAY
                        No need. Mr. Fineberg was just 
                        leaving.

           INT ALEX’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE, NIGHT

           Rockwell’s interview transcript is strewn across the 
           apartment. Every inch of floor is covered. Alex tiptoes 
           across it, eating a bagel and drinking whiskey. 

           He moves the papers here and there--adding notes and bright 
           construction paper tags to various sections. 

           He stares at it. Puts the cold glass to his head. Reads 
           carefully. Stares more. 
           A KNOCK makes him jump.

                        Come si fa a pregare? The pharasees 
                        asked of Jesus--how does one pray? 
                        Jesus answered them: “Your eye is 
                        the lamp of your body. When your 
                        vision is clear, your whole body 
                        also is full of light. But when it 
                        is poor, your body is full of 
                        darkness.” LOOK THEREFORE, that 
                        your vision is clear. That the 
                        light within you is not darkness. 
                        Che cosa intende? What does Jesus 
                        mean by this? He means--when you 
                        are in darkness--there are two 
                        possible reasons why. There may be 
                        no source of light! OR...or...the 
                        darkness may be within yourself.

                                 ALEX
                        Fearsome black demagogue or 
                        philosopher? The story of Malcolm 
                        X’s life is full of drama, of 
                        pride, indeed of....
           Alex trails off. He’s not giving this dumb speech one more 
           time. He’s just going to talk about Malcolm.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        When I first met Malcolm at the 
                        Black Muslim restaurant uptown near 
                        the mosque, a white college girl 
                        had come there. She asked Malcolm, 
                        “What can I do?” Malcolm turned to 
                        her and he said, “Nothing.” She 
                        left in tears. That’s not something 
                        that I would have done. I’ll tell 
                        you what: Malcolm didn’t always 
                        think like me because Malcolm 
                        hadn’t always had the same options 
                        as me. He used to tell me: “you 
                        trust white men and I don’t. You 
                        studied what he wanted you to learn 
                        about him in schools, I studied him 
                        in the streets and in prison, where 
                        you see the truth.”  But not long 
                        after that, I saw Malcolm 
                        exhilarated in lectures with white 
                        student bodies at colleges. At one 
                        of these lectures I reminded him of 
                        that time at the restaurant. He 
                        said, “I did a lot of things that 
                        I’m sorry for now. Well...I guess a 
                        man’s entitled to make a fool of 
                        himself if he’s ready to pay the 
                        cost.” Malcolm was no fool. Because 
                        I read books in school and he read 
                        them in prison, he knew learned 
                        something few people do--to teach 
                        himself. Because he could do that, 
                        he always acted for himself, and he 
                        thought for himself. So when we was 
                        wrong, he was generally on his way 
                        to being right. More right than 
                        most of us. So I hope to God that 
                        all the studying and working and 
                        options I ever had can teach me to 
                        be more like him.

                        Now, I was told recently by a white

                        white people don’t believe my race 
                        is literally inferior, they will 
                        happily profit from the idea that 
                        we are...I don’t believe that.

                        I believe a lot of white Americans,

                        that Malcolm realized he liked so 
                        well, are eager to take a stand. 
                        And that is why I believe that 
                        there is a large audience for this

           it open and reads the contents. 

           INSERT book: “EPILOGUE by ALEX HALEY.”

                        been awarded a prize, although I am 
                        sadly familiar with the fact that 
                        Negroes tend to win prizes all over 
                        the place providing they do not wet 
                        themselves and refrain from gnawing 
                        on the shinbones of the prize 
                        committee etc. You pledged me that 
                        in the autobiography there would be 
                        a clear statement of Malcolm X’s 
                        position on the Jews as I often 
                        heard him put it. Yet a careful 
                        reading of the book and the 
                        Saturday Evening Post condensation 
                        shows the material to be totally 
                        missing...I will always regret that 
                        I did not have more opportunity to 
                        meet Malcolm and talk with him at 
                        some length, rather than the 
                        quickie hand shake and hello we 
                        exchanged...I enjoy hearing from

           EXT ALEX’S WASHINGTON D.C. HOTEL, DAY

           Alex exits his hotel headed for a taxi, but instead he sees:

           Rockwell, looking his best, sunglasses on, leaning against 
           his Chevrolet. Rockwell gives a little wave.

           INT/EXT ROCKWELL’S CHEVY, DAY, LATER

           Rockwell drives Alex. 

                                 ALEX
                        You were right.

                                 ROCKWELL
                             (joking)
                        Oh good! I’m so glad you came 
                        around!
                             (more serious)
                        About what?

                                 ALEX
                        The blackout. You were right that 
                        there are people working to contain 
                        your ideas. But they’re not paying 
                        anyone. And they’re not bribing 
                        anyone. And they’re not 
                        intimidating anyone. 
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Well...explains why it didn’t work 
                        on you. 

           Rockwell is kidding him. Alex can’t help it. He laughs. 

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, ARLINGTON, DAY

           Rockwell and Alex pull up. The troopers, including a scowling 
           Patler, are gathered around the flag pole. 

                                 ALEX
                        What’s all this?

           Rockwell opens the door for Alex, who steps out warily. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        The men and I have a surprise for 
                        you. 

           Rockwell motions for Campbell to join him. Campbell walks 
           with quiet purpose, a small box in his hands. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Alex Haley, for service to the 
                        party and for keeping your word, I 
                        am awarding you the special honor 
                        of V.I.N. 

           The troopers all salute. Rockwell opens the box to reveal a 
           silver lapel-pin, inscribed with the letters V.I.N. 

                                 ALEX
                        Well...gee...thanks Commander. 

           Alex looks at his pin. It glints in the sunlight. 

           EXT ARLINGTON WOODS, NEAR ANP HEADQUARTERS, DAY

           Alex and Rockwell take a stroll. 

                                 ALEX
                        ...I have to ask you something. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Sure. 
                                 ALEX
                        While your political success is not 
                        in my personal interest, I can’t 
                        help but think that you would be 
                        far more successful were you to 
                        abandon this Nazi symbolism all 
                        together. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        ...You can never convert people’s 
                        attitude by lecturing and 
                        reasoning. Attitudes can only be 
                        changed through ‘emotional 
                        engineering.’

           Alex waits for him to elaborate. 

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        This is the key thing. It doesn’t 
                        matter what the emotion is: love, 
                        fear, hatred. As long as there is 
                        an emotion in a person, I can 
                        change him. When I agitate in 
                        uniform, I want people to hate me. 
                        I want them emotionally worked 
                        up...
                             (looks up to see the sun)
                        It’s getting a bit late. I’ve got a 
                        plane to catch too--lecturing at 
                        Stanford! I’ll have one of the boys 
                        take us to the airport.

           EXT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ, DAY, LATER

           Alex waits by the ANP station wagon. Campbell packs a bag 
           into the trunk. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thanks for the presentation, Jake. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Oh, no problem. Just doing my duty. 

           But he gives a sideways smile. 

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Jake, can I ask you a question. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sure. 
                                 ALEX
                        What does this all mean to you? 
                        What’s the goal? I mean...what’s 
                        your perfect world?

           Campbell closes the trunk. His answer is matter-of-fact.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What’s anybody’s? No one would ever 
                        be lonely--right? 

                                 ALEX
                        Right. Sure. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where you headed next?

                                 ALEX
                        Julie Christie. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wow. Well...have a good trip. I 
                        suppose I won’t be seeing you 
                        again. 

                                 ALEX
                        Suppose not. 

           Campbell turns and heads inside. 

           INT ALEX’S LONDON HOTEL, DAY

           Alex fingers the V.I.N. pin in his hand. He talks on the 
           phone.

                                 MURRAY (O.S.)
                        Very Important Nigger?? I can’t 
                        fucking believe it. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah...musta been kinda expensive. 

           Murray catches the emotion in Alex’s voice. 

                                 MURRAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah. Probably. 
           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ ROCKWELL’S BEDROOM, MORNING

           Patler and Rockwell sit on the edge of the bed, sorting an 
           enormous stack of mail. 

                                 PATLER
                             (counting letters)

                        The Ivies pay more. You see, John? 
                        There’s always a way to bounce 
                        back. Don’t you forget it.

                        propaganda to distribute all on my 
                        lonesome. So you better get to 
                        work!

           Patler smiles.

           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ BARRACKS, DAY

           Grubby beds line the room. Several men watch a small 
           television set. Patler and Rockwell enter. 

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        Dr. King leads a housing march 
                        through the outskirts of Chicago in 
                        an effort to protest de jure 
                        segregation, his first efforts in a 
                        northern city. 

           On TV: King and his marchers are pelted by a barrage of 
           bottles and rocks. Each time a rock is thrown, the troopers 
           cheer. 

           A leaderless mob of whites, reacting spontaneously. A huge 
           opportunity and everyone knows it. Rockwell enters, grinning. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Looks like we’re going to Chicago, 
                        boys! Get in touch with 
                        headquarters there. 

           Patler pulls him aside. 
           INT AMERICAN NAZI PARTY HQ HALLWAY, CONTINUOUS

                                 PATLER
                        I want to print something special. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        ...What are you thinking?

           Patler whispers something in Rockwell’s ear. Rockwell laughs.

                                 PATLER
                        You’ve always said you want me to 
                        quit fighting. I think this will 
                        really bring the Greeks and the 
                        Aryans together.

           Rockwell laughs harder. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        It’s good. Print two hundred, at 
                        least. And then try for a big 
                        banner.

                                 PATLER
                        ...I don’t know that we can afford 
                        it. 

           Its against his best instincts, but Rockwell’s approval gives 
           Patler courage. He turns back to the printer and gets to 
           work.

           EXT GAGE PARK, CHICAGO, AFTERNOON

           Troopers hand out SIGNS AND SHIRTS to hundreds of people, who 
           wait to hear Rockwell speak.

           REVEAL: the phrase Patler came up with is on every sign.

           The crowd roars. 
           LONG MOVING SHOT pulling back from Rockwell, through the park 
           and out into the street: 

           Police stand in a line along the park. A group of young white 
           men OVERTURN a car. 

           Several more RUN at the cars carrying black passengers with 
           ice-picks in their hands. 

           T-shirts, signs, chanting: White Power is everywhere.

           CLOSE ON: Rockwell’s face as he watched the bedlam. He’s 
           never experienced success like this before.

           When Rockwell finally looks up, Patler is no longer by his 
           side, but across the yard. 

           Patler slowly shakes his head, then turns his back on 
           Rockwell and walks off the property. He’s leaving for good.

           Isaiah and Jean sit around, at a truce. They wait for 
           Fineberg outside his office with giant smiles on their faces.

           Fineberg enters.

                                 ISAIAH
                        Dr. Fineberg! Did you hear the 
                        news?

                                 ISAIAH (CONT’D)
                        The IRS shut down his headquarters. 

                                 JEAN
                        Lot of good that speaking tour 
                        money has done him! They can’t even 
                        keep their doors open. 

           Fineberg smiles. 

                                 FINEBERG
                        Yes, that’s excellent news. That’s 
                        should gut their proceedings for a 
                        while. 

           With that Fineberg goes into his office. Jean sighs. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        What?

                                 JEAN
                        If you can’t bankrupt an 
                        idea...where does it end?

           Isaiah cracks open a bag of potato chips. Jean takes one.

           INT CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES, WASHINGTON D.C., DAY

           Congressman STANLEY TUPPER, 45, sits at his desk. A female 
           aide, DEBORAH, knocks on the door.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Congressman, a Mr. Hunt is here. He 
                        says you know him from Hebron 
                        Academy. 
           Tupper looks up, alarmed. 

                                 DEBORAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? Isn’t that your high 
                        school?

                                 TUPPER
                        It is. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        But...

                                 TUPPER
                        My friend James Hunt died when I 
                        was in college. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        So...should I show him in?

                                 TUPPER
                        I suppose you should, yes.

           The aide exits and returns with Rockwell.

                                 TUPPER (CONT’D)
                        Linc!

           For a split second, Tupper is frozen, unsure how to respond. 
           Clearly, he is not supportive of his old friend’s politics. 

           But before anyone really notices, he recovers, gets up to 
           shake Rockwell’s hand, then pulls him into a hug instead.

                                 TUPPER (CONT’D)
                             (to Aide)
                        Thank you, Deborah. 
                             (to Rockwell)
                        Sit down!

           Rockwell is beaming at the sight of his friend. It’s 
           infectious. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        I was just in Washington on some 
                        business and I thought I’d drop in 
                        and say hello!

                                 TUPPER
                        What kind of business?

           Rockwell shakes his head.
                                 ROCKWELL
                        Some funding issues. 
                        Organizational. Can’t get people to 
                        communicate with each other, you 
                        know?

                                 TUPPER
                        Certainly do. I heard you got 
                        married again? 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Yes! But she left me.

                                 TUPPER
                        I’m so sorry, Linc.

           Today, Rockwell won’t be disheartened.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        You can’t win ‘em all!

                                 TUPPER
                        Well...I’d have said if anyone 
                        could, it would be you. I was 
                        thinking about you the other day 
                        because my kid brought a ukulele 
                        home. 

           The two of them look at each other and roar with laughter. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        How old were you at that dance?

                                 TUPPER
                        11. So you must have been 15...I 
                        don’t even remember where the hell 
                        I found a ukulele and I certainly 
                        don’t know where I got the violin 
                        bow to play it with. 

           Rockwell waves his hands. He’s almost crying laughing.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        All those dumb kids tried to tell 
                        you that’s not how you play it.

                                 TUPPER
                        And you made them dance to it 
                        anyway. All. Night. All night to 
                        that noise.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Yeah. And I got laid that night 
                        too.
           Tupper almost falls out of his chair. 

                                 TUPPER
                        I can’t. I can’t take this. You 
                        really could get people to do 
                        anything.
                             (catching his breath)
                        Would you like to come by for 
                        dinner? We picked up some great 
                        lamb this weekend.

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Thank you, some other time. Have a 
                        lecture to give at Brown in a few 
                        days that I have to prepare for. 

           Tupper nods, then gets up to walk his friend out.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        Well look at us now, eh, Stan? You 
                        a Congressman, me the head of the 
                        American Nazi Party. 

           Tupper is astonished. He calls out the elephant in the room.

                                 TUPPER
                        Linc...why? 

           Rockwell looks as if he might admit something.

                                 TUPPER (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you just leave?

                                 ROCKWELL
                        ...I’ve got a tiger by the tail. 

           Tupper stands in silence. Before he can respond--

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got to get going. 

           He leaves. Deborah re-enters. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        So...who was he, after all?

                                 TUPPER
                        That was George Lincoln Rockwell. 

           Deborah’s face falls. 
           INT ALEX HALEY’S APARTMENT, GREENWHICH VILLAGE, DAY 

           INSERT: a letter from Rockwell addressed to Alex Haley, 
           V.I.N.

           CLOSE ON: Alex, as he folds up Rockwell’s last letter. His 
           desk is covered with material for a new project:

           A 17th century etching of black bodies crammed together in 
           the hull of a ship.  A 1930s photo of well-dressed, young 
           black couple in a photo booth. Photographs of a smiling 
           family--Alex’s family.

           Alex tucks Rockwell’s letter under his new project and looks 
           up. His gaze is caught by--

           The red glint of Attallah’s hair as she sits in the sun. 

           WIDE of the room: Attallah, older now by several months and 
           several hundred years, sits doing her homework. 

           Alex’s POV. Attallah notices Alex watching her and rolls her 
           eyes. 

                                 ATTALLAH
                        Don’t you have some work to do or 
                        something?

           She does not know that Alex just read Rockwell’s letter, nor 
           that when he looks at her he sees victory embodied. She 
           throws him one of her flippant glances and continues to go 
           about her business. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT STRIP MALL, ARLINGTON, DAY

           Rockwell’s car sits outside a laundromat. 

           INT LAUNDROMAT, ARLINGTON, DAY

           Rockwell struggles to stuff his clothes and sheets into a 
           single dryer. A woman, RUBY PIERCE, 30s, watches him. 
                                 RUBY
                        Here. Take my machine. My clothes 
                        are just about dry. 

           Rockwell gives her a genuine, beautiful smile. 

                                 ROCKWELL
                        Thank you, ma’am. 

           He moves half his clothes to her machine, pours in soap, and 
           fiddles with the coin levers. Counting his change, he 
           realizes he doesn’t have enough coins to run both machines.

                                 ROCKWELL (CONT’D)
                             (to Ruby)

                        minute.

           A party is underway. Alex, glass of wine in hand, moves from 
           room to room. 

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION KITCHEN, CHICAGO, EVENING, CONTINUOUS

           As he enters the kitchen, the TV in the corner catches his 
           eye. It’s the Arlington parking lot. Black and white images 
           of the scene flash across the screen. One includes PATLER IN 
           HANDCUFFS, being led by police. 

           Alex absorbs the photos of Rockwell’s body and the open car 
           door. 

           ON the TV: a reporter’s microphone points toward Ruby, the 
           woman from the laundromat, as she begins to answer his 
           question. 

                                 RUBY
                        I know that Mr. Rockwell is...was a 
                        man that had an opinion. And I know 
                        that we have the greatest country 
                        on earth, and I know that it’s only 
                        great because we have the freedom 
                        of speech.

                        Whether we be Jews, or Catholics, 
                        or Protestants, or Negro...I will 
                        remember Mr. Rockwell as a tall, 
                        handsome, neatly dressed man that 
                        came into the laundromat very 
                        graciously. I was most happy that I 
                        could give him this second machine, 
                        and I will remember him just that 
                        way, as a very charming man.

           INT LAUNDROMAT/EXT PARKING LOT, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           As Rockwell leaves the laundromat and walks towards the car, 
           his V.O. starts. His last letter to Alex:

                                 ROCKWELL (V.O.)
                        Dear Mr. Haley, V.I.N., I am 
                        getting up all the steam I will 
                        need on my train, the white train. 
                        I am stoking the fires, training 
                        the fireman and the second engineer 
                        and oiling the gears. We shall be 
                        ready! But, meanwhile, when I meet 
                        such a black passenger as you, I 
                        cannot help shaking my head in 
                        horror at the madness ahead.

           INT ROCKWELL’S CAR, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           OTS: Rockwell begins to perspire in the heat, rolling down 
           his window. He puts the car in reverse and turns toward 
           camera to back it out of the parking spot. 

                                 ROCKWELL (V.O.)
                        You, personally, have become a 
                        ‘gentleman.’ A black gentleman--and 
                        you can bring civilization and 
                        goodness to millions of people who 
                        need you desperately, in Africa. I 
                        cannot help wondering if perhaps 
                        you know how to apply reason to 
                        stop the inevitable and bloody 
                        smash up ahead. 

           A gun’s loud BANG. 

           The bullet TEARS through Rockwell’s chest, flattening him 
           against the seat. Another bullet. Red BLOOD flows up onto his 
           shirt.
           His car rolls backward and hits the parked car opposite. 

           EXT ROCKWELL’S CAR/STRIP MALL PARKING LOT, DAY, CONTINUOUS 

           The commotion attracts attention. People come out of strip 
           mall storefronts.

           Rockwell opens the door. But he cannot stand up, his body 
           pours down the side of the car and onto the pavement. 

           More people gather. No one comes to his side. Rockwell’s 
           blood seeps into a larger and larger pool on the asphalt and, 
           finally, he dies. Alone. 

           INT PLAYBOY MANSION KITCHEN, CHICAGO, EVENING

           BACK WITH ALEX, gazing at Rockwell’s body on T.V. 

                                 ROCKWELL (V.O.)
                        If not, I shall one day sadly stand 
                        over the smoking and twisted 
                        wreckage of the Black Train, 
                        shaking my head over the ruins of a 
                        great black man--and a black 
                        friend. Sincerely, Lincoln 
                        Rockwell, Commander, American Nazi 
                        Party. Typed personally. 

           And yet, there stands Alex. Still alive. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
