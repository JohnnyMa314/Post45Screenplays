           INT. BUS, THE DESERT - MOVING - DAY

           ELIAS HERNANDEZ, 17, Mestizo, features muddled between 
           ethnicities, squints out the greasy windows of:

           THE BUS (EXT. BUS, THE DESERT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS)

           as it rumbles through a GOLDEN-BAKED DESERT. There’s no signs 
           of life, except A LONE BIRD OF PREY high in the sky.

           ELIAS (RESUMING)

           jerks up in his seat as the bus hits a BUMP. 

           He steals a careful peek at his fellow commuters: CONVICTS, 
           whose faded tattoos litter arms, necks, some faces.

           INT. PRISONER TRANSPORT, USFP INTAKE GATE - DAY

           The BUS stalls by a HEFTY GATE - part of the exterior 
           concrete wall of a UNITED STATES FEDERAL PRISON. 

           An ALARM SQUALLS, and the gate WAILS as it opens. The BUS 
           drives into a lot enclosed by electric fence systems. 

           INT. PRISONER TRANSPORT, LOADING COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           A U.S. MARSHAL bangs his hand on the safety gate:

                                 U.S. MARSHAL
                        Move out! Let’s go, let’s go!

           Restraints CLATTER as the PRISONERS shuffle forward.

           EXT. LOADING COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The CONVICTS move to an entry that leads to the innards of an 
           ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING, while OFFICERS monitor them silently 
           from the side. 

           Elias can’t help stare at the ARMED GUARDS' SILHOUETTES in 
           the SENTRY TOWERS. 

           Without warning, he breaks, and COUGHS vomit onto the rough 
           gravel. The INMATE in front of him turns. 
                                 INMATE
                              (angrily)
                        What the fuck, man?

           SGT. JASON SMITHER, 37, emerald army-style uniform over a 
           beefy frame, wraparound shades, and an ORNATE CROSS tattooed 
           into his the back of his bald crown, SHOUTS from the side: 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Cut the Mickey Mouse shit! Keep it 
                        moving!

           Elias wipes his mouth with his sleeve.

           INT. HALLWAY, RECEIVING AND DISCHARGE - DAY

           The PRISONERS sit in claustrophobic HOLDING CELLS, lined down 
           the corridor, as they wait for R&D.

           Elias holds his legs close to his body inside the cage. 

           INT. R&D ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A CAMERA FLASH, as an R&D OFFICER takes a picture of Elias in 
           his JUMPSUIT, holding a SLATE with his intake number on it. 

           Elias turns to side profile. Another FLASH.

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER (PRE-LAP)
                        In order to verify your identity as 
                        an inmate to be admitted to this 
                        federal facility-

           INT. INTAKE CASE MANAGER’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Elias sits in front of a FEMALE INTAKE CASE MANAGER, 40’s, 
           her station plastered with paperwork.

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        - state the location of your 
                        sentencing court, and the name of 
                        the judge in your case trial.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        The court was in Las Cruces... I 
                        don’t remember the judge’s name...

           She finds his jacket from a pile of manilas on her desk, then 
           takes a LONG BEAT to read the text.
                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        You know a convict called Miguel 
                        Farro? He’s an inmate here. Your 
                        victim was called Farro, too. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know what that means...

           The CASE MANAGER groans. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        If they’re related, I might have to 
                        move you.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Can I stay in Arizona? Or move to 
                        New Mexico, that’d be even better-

           She interjects, harshly:

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        Convicts don’t get to make requests 
                        in the federal prison system. I 
                        suggest you learn that right now. 

           Elias sinks into his seat. His gaze lands on a PORTRAIT on 
           the CASE MANAGER’s desk of a BLACK GIRL - her daughter. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You have any history of gang 
                        activity? Any affiliation that’ll 
                        take care of you?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No, Ma’am...

           She chucks the folder on the desk, gives him a once-over.

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        How old are you?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        Your family close by?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        My mom’s a nurse, back home in New 
                        Mexico. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        Your father?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        My dad did photos for, like, 
                        passports and immigration forms.

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        I meant, your father back home too?

           Elias doesn’t answer. The INTAKE CASE MANAGER lets the moment 
           sit, before she continues. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be a times before they 
                        sanction a transfer. I can put in a 
                        request for PC in the meantime.

           Elias shifts uncomfortably in his seat. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What’s PC?

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        Protective Custody. In case we 
                        can’t keep you there, I’ll sign a 
                        request to have you work yard duty. 
                        You ever help your dad out in his 
                        shop? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Not really, I was- 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        No. You ever help your dad out in 
                        his shop?

           She stares at him, waiting for him to get it. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Sure. I helped him out in his shop. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        We have photographers on the yards, 
                        take photos the inmates can send 
                        home. Since you know photography, I 
                        can place you there. That’d keep 
                        you in the open, where the bulls 
                        can keep an eye on you.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (softly)
                        Thank you. 

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        What’s that?
           Elias clears his throat. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Thank you. For helping me.

                                 INTAKE CASE MANAGER
                        I’m not helping you. I’m just 
                        making sure you serve the full 
                        duration of your mandated sentence. 

           INT. HALLWAY, PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - EVENING

           A C.O. escorts Elias down the white and hospital-green 
           hallway of PROTECTIVE CUSTODY. 

           They pass singles, where PC PRISONERS pass the time reading, 
           sleeping, vegetating. No life. 

           INT. CELL, PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - CONTINUOUS

           Elias takes in the confined quarters: A bunk, a table no 
           bigger than a paperback novel, a window too high up.

           The cell door closes behind him, and the C.O.’s footsteps 
           FADE AWAY, until Elias is smothered in silent solitude. 

           INT. CELL, PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT

           Elias turns restlessly in his sleep. Then he wakes with a 
           GASP, his forehead beaded with sweat. 

           He walks to the cell door, leans down to the HATCH.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Officers, I feel sick...

           No answer. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Officers, I don’t feel good. 

           Still, no answer. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m having a medical emergency! 
                        Please, how long am I gonna be 
                        alone in here?

           He BANGS on the door, then turns to pace around his cell. 
           Finally, he sits down in the corner, and the reality of his 
           circumstances washes over him. 

           There, all alone in the dark.

           FADE OUT.

                                                            FROM BLACK:

           INT. FRONT ENTRANCE OFFICE - DAY

           VICTOR CARRIER, 23, short buzz and smooth chin, waits with 
           FELLOW C.O.s to pass through a METAL DETECTOR. 

           Victor takes in his surroundings like a newborn foal. 

           INT. CONTROL POST - DAY

           Victor stands behind a SALLY PORT that DRONES as it opens. 

           The SAFETY CHECKPOINT hugs the outside wall of an EAGLE’S 
           NEST, saturated with monitors and green/red-buttoned panels.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Carrier, Victor. 

                                 CONTROL C.O.
                        Slide your ID through here.

           Victor slips his ID through a sliver in the glass.

                                 CONTROL C.O. (CONT’D)
                        First day checking in?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Yes, sir. 

           The CONTROL C.O. turns to a colleague. She exits the room.  

                                 CONTROL C.O.
                        Welcome. Dodson’s gonna take you 
                        down.  

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           C.O. DODSON and Victor walk down an administrative hallway in 
           an undisturbed segment of the prison. 
           INT. C.O. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smither and C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA, 45, talk casually at their 
           desks when C.O. DODSON knocks on the door pane.

                                 C.O. DODSON
                        New officer, Sergeant. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Enter. 

           Smither stands, as Victor moves inside. They shake hands. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Victor Carrier, sir.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Sergeant Smither. 

           Dodson exits, as Montoya stands and shakes Victor’s hand too. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Montoya. Where you transferring 
                        from?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        This is my first set-up, right 
                        here, sir. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Fresh outta pre-service? I like it! 
                        Well, you couldn’t have asked for a 
                        better start up. We’re a real tight 
                        crew round here.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Uh-huh, that’s right. 

           Smither presses a button on his OFFICE PHONE.  

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Buster, my office.

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO (V.O.)
                        Coming down, Sarge.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Buster’s gonna show you what’s 
                        what. Hang tight for a minute.

           Smither sits down, puts his boots up on the table.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        You got any family, Carrier?
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I got married not too long ago, 
                        sir. We’re actually expecting our 
                        first child...

           Smither scratches the inside of his nose with his thumbnail.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Congrats... I got six, myself. 
                        They’re a pain in my ass, but I 
                        love ‘em to death. How old’s your 
                        boy again, Montoya?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        My boy would have been four...

           Montoya’s face falls, and the room goes ice-cold. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Shit, I’m so sorry, I didn’t 
                        mean... Fuck... 
                              (beat)
                        You know what happened to Montoya’s 
                        boy, Carrier? 

           Montoya grins, a twinkle in his eye as he winks at Victor.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        I pulled out. 

           Smither LAUGHS COARSELY, which builds to a COUGHING FIT. 
           Montoya holds up his hands apologetically. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        We’re just fucking with you, man.

           Victor laughs along carefully, as A PROTECTIVE CUSTODY C.O. 
           slips his head through the door. 

                                 PC C.O.
                        Sarge, mind coming down to PC?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Everything all right?

                                 PC C.O.
                        Yeah, yeah. They just need you down 
                        there. 

           Montoya follows Smither to the door. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Buster’s gonna be down here in a 
                        second. We’ll catch up later, okay? 
           Smither and Montoya exit, leaving Victor alone in the office. 

           On Smither’s desk: There’s a HOLIDAY PICTURE of SMITHER with 
           a Corona, a PERKY BLONDE and SIX KIDS, all in beachwear.

           On the wall: A POSTER of a moodily lit PRISON BLOCK, with the 
           foreboding text:

                                     SLEEP WELL TONIGHT
                        WE’LL KEEP YOUR NIGHTMARES IN THEIR CELLS

           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY HALLWAY - DAY

           Smither and Montoya walk down the hallway of PROTECTIVE 
           CUSTODY. PC OFFICERS wait outside Elias’ cell. 

                                 PC OFFICER
                        He wanted to talk to someone, 
                        wouldn’t take no for an answer. 

           Elias’ exasperated SHOUTS reverberate from within the room.

           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Elias’ LUNCH drips down the wall, a TRAY on the floor. An 
           exhausted Elias stops YELLING when he sees Smither outside. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You did this?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I can’t be in here anymore, sir. 
                        I’m sick, or something. I’m having 
                        nightmares-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        That’s why you called me down here?
                              (to the PC OFFICER)
                        He’s in here voluntarily, correct?

                                 PC OFFICER
                        Correct, sir-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Why are you wasting my time? I 
                        could care less that he doesn’t 
                        want special treatment. Montoya, 
                        oblige him - move him into 
                        population on C. He can clean the 
                        goddamn meatloaf off the wall 
                        himself, too. 
           Smither exits down the hallway. 

           The OFFICERS look to Montoya, the oldest of them. He sighs, 
           then turns to Elias. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        I wouldn’t opt out of PC if I were 
                        you, Hernandez. Once you’re out, 
                        you can’t just go back-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He said I was voluntary, sir. I 
                        can’t be in here anymore.  

           Montoya looks at Elias with pity.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Here’s some advice I recommend you 
                        follow if you’re going into 
                        population: Don’t get involved, 
                        don’t talk to nobody. Just tough it 
                        out. You got that?

           INT. C BLOCK, SEPARATION GATE - DAY

           Elias waits behind the bars of the C BLOCK SAFETY GATE. 
           INMATE WALLA hammers the air.

           The GATE CHUTE opens up into the belly of the beast: C BLOCK.

           INT. C BLOCK, FLOOR TIER - CONTINUOUS

           Elias steps along the FIRST FLOOR of the aquarium: 200 cells, 
           three tiers high. INMATES see Elias, and soon a collage of 
           SHOUTS pummel him:

                                 INMATE (O.S.)
                        New fish in the fish tank!

           The orchestra of MENACING SHOUTS crescendos from above.

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Elias stares at his cellie with wide eyes:

           JAMES LUTHER SPRING, 54, BOLD SWASTIKAS placed symmetrically 
           on his neck, and SHAMROCKS bedizened with the number 666 
           branded onto his arms, is writing at his slim desk. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        New cellie, Spring. 
           Spring looks up, and his pale blue eyes stare at Elias. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        You mind taking him down to laundry 
                        to get his gear?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        I’ll make sure someone gets it 
                        done. Montoya, could you have one 
                        of the C.O.s bring up some cleaning 
                        gear?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        I’ll tell ‘em.  

           Montoya exits down the tier. Elias looks after him. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You can come on in. 

           Elias takes a careful step inside the cell, places his few 
           belongings on the free bunk opposite Spring.  

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Elias...

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Full name.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Elias Hernandez. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        What’re you in for?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Federal trafficking... I was 
                        trafficking narcotics. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Muling what?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Marijuana.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You don’t get pen-time for moving 
                        grass. What you lying to me for?

           Spring stares at him, expression cold. Elias clears his 
           throat, buying some time. 
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I drove sizable quantities. Over 
                        state lines, which made it a 
                        federal offense...

           Spring squints. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You bring anything in with you? 
                        Pot, uppers, hash, amphets, coke, 
                        horse?

           Elias shakes his head. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        Good, cause I don’t want junk in my 
                        cell. You’re gonna clean the unit 
                        before breakfast, every morning. 
                        While you’re here, be respectful of 
                        the fact that you’re a guest, and 
                        we’ll get along just fine.
                              (beat)
                        My name’s James Luther Spring. You 
                        can call me Spring, or Mr. Spring. 
                        I don’t care neither way, so long 
                        as it’s one of those two.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yes, sir...

           Spring goes back to his writing. 

           Elias dips into his bunk. He steals a glance at Spring’s side 
           of the cell: Hardcover books under the cot, portraits and 
           sketches of architectural wonders pinned to the wall.

           INT. STAIRWAY, C BLOCK - DAY

           Victor’s face is locked into a combative frown. Work mode. He 
           wears fatigues, slightly too big.

           C.O. BUSTER BRECKO, 42, morbidly obese, HUFFS with effort as 
           he leads the way up the C BLOCK STAIRWAY.

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO (PRE-LAP)
                        350-400 prisoners on C. Then 
                        there’s all the other yards.

           INT. C BLOCK THIRD TIER - DAY

           Victor and Buster stand on the third tier. It’s quieter here, 
           and they have an overview of the whole block below.
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        How many C.O.s on patrol, sir?

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Two or three per block.

           Victor looks at him incredulously. 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO (CONT’D)
                        We’re at 180 percent capacity. More 
                        coming in every day, son. 
                              (off Victor’s expression)
                        Oh, don’t worry. They’re so busy 
                        fucking each other up, they don’t 
                        have time for us. 

           Buster checks his watch, pats Victor on the back. 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO (CONT’D)
                        Walk a round. I’ll wait here.

           INT. C BLOCK, SECOND TIER - DAY

           Victor patrols. INMATE’s FACES slip out the gate.

                                 INMATE (O.S.)
                        Got a cowboy on C, Ty!

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Do me a favor? Slide your head back 
                        inside your unit? 

                                 INMATE
                        I ain’t doing you no muthafuckin’ 
                        favors, man.

           The INMATE waves him off. Victor hesitates, then exits down 
           the tier, defeated.

           EXT. C YARD - DAY

           Each corner of the yard is marked by ARMED SENTRY TOWERS. 

           Elias squints in the harsh sunlight, looks around at the 
           strictly SEGREGATED GROUPS in each section of the yard. 

           He sees Spring sit with the WHITES, and walks over to their 
           territory, lingering inconspicuously on their perimeter. 
           EXT. NORTEÑOS SECTION, C YARD - CONTINUOUS

           SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ, 27, the word “AZTECA” tattooed 
           below his clavicles, is seated amongst the NORTEÑOS. 

           He sees Elias by the WHITES, turns to the SHOT-CALLER, MIGUEL 
           FARRO, 51, by his side. Miguel looks up, sees Elias. 

           EXT. ARYAN BROTHERHOOD SECTION, C YARD  - CONTINUOUS

           An ARYAN BROTHER nods to HANSEN, 26, slicked-back hair, horse-
           shoe moustache, black sunglasses. Hansen sees Farro and 
           Spectro approaching, with a NORTEÑO BODYGUARD by their side.

           Hansen pokes Spring, sitting next to him. Spring turns, sees 
           the NORTEÑOS approach. He whispers something in Hansen’s ear.

           EXT. C YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Elias wipes gravel back and forth with a shoe.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (O.S.)
                              (in Spanish)
                        What you doing over here?

           Elias looks up, sees the group of NORTEÑOS approaching.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (O.S.)
                        Little far from home, Farro. 

           At the mention of Farro’s name, Elias tightens up, looks at 
           the NORTEÑO SHOT-CALLER with wide eyes.

           Spring stands calmly to the side, flanked by Hansen and an 
           ARYAN BROTHERHOOD BODYGUARD. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        You can’t go grabbing our guys just 
                        cause you need soldiers, Spring.

           Spring CLICKS his tongue. He turns to Elias.  

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        What are you, boy?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (stuttering)
                        Who, me?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Yeah, you. Where you from?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        New Mexico. 

           Hansen SCOFFS next to Spring. 

                                 HANSEN
                        Fuck off with the bullshit, you 
                        know what he mean, boy. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        My mom’s from here. My dad’s 
                        family’s from Nicaragua...

                        Your mom likes jumping on some of 
                        that brown dick, huh?

           Hansen SPITS on the gravel, looking challengingly at the 
           NORTEÑOS in front of him as he does so. 

           Farro returns his attention to Elias. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        ¿Du nombre, chamaco?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (nervously)
                        Hernandez...

           Spectro, next to Farro, shrugs nonchalantly. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Well, his name Hernandez, so...

           Elias shakes with fear, but keeps his jaw locked to hide it. 
           TIME SLOWS, as he looks up at the sky and sees that same 
           image that he saw earlier:

           A BIRD OF PREY circling above, until its contour is swallowed 
           by the glare of the sun.

           Hansen whispers something to Spring, who shakes his head.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        We’re taking him, Spring. His 
                        name’s Hernandez, he’s one of ours. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        I don’t care if his name is 
                        Emiliano Zapata. If you’re taking 
                        him, I’d like to see you take him.  

           They stare each other down, but Farro’s eyes TICK for just a 
           second.
                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Fuck it. Kid’s so fresh out the 
                        water, he’s breathing through 
                        gills.

           Farro leaves with Spectro and his BODYGUARD. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Sort the kid out, Hansen. 

           EXT. NORTEÑOS SECTION, C YARD - CONTINUOUS

           As he walks back to his turf, Farro looks to the ARYAN 
           TABLES, where Spring is sauntering back to his own turf also. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                              (to himself)
                        Hijo de puta...

           He SPITS, then continues back to the NORTEÑO SECTION. 

           EXT. C YARD - CONTINUOUS

                                 HANSEN
                        Where your papers?

           Elias has no clue. Hansen CLAPS his hands.

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Court documents, legal papers, all 
                        that shit, man!

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know! I don’t have them.

           Hansen prods a finger into Elias’ sternum. 

                                 HANSEN
                        If you’re hiding something, I will 
                        find out. And then I’ll kill you 
                        myself. 
                              (beat)
                        How much money you got in your 
                        account?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t have any money...

                                 HANSEN
                        Then you best find some, cause you 
                        start paying rent now, and that 
                        shit don’t go on Layaway. 
           He turns to the WHITE TABLES. Elias hesitantly follows him. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Where you think you’re going? Go 
                        hang with the fucking Natives.

           Hansen points to the back of the yard, where a RAGGED GROUP 
           of INMATES sit in solitude. He exits, back to his locals. 

           Elias takes a breath to calm his shaking hands.

           EXT. NATIVE SECTION, C YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Elias looks at who he’s been jettisoned with: SENILE MEN, 
           NATIVE AMERICANS, ANCIENT ASIANS. The prison weak. Losers. 

           Nobody acknowledges him, as Elias sits down on a bench. 

           INT. TABLES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - AFTERNOON

           Victor and Buster pass down the aisle, making their rounds. 

           At one of the tables, TERRY EDWARDS, 24, a white Peckerwood, 
           plays cards with INMATES OF DIFFERENT RACES. He SLAMS his 
           hand into the metal table as the dealer turns a card. 

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        Quit pulling that fifth-street-get-
                        lucky-quick shit, nigguh! 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Slow your roll, Edwards. 

           Terry looks at the officer, takes a breath to calm himself. 

           Victor and Buster pass on down the aisle, past Elias, who is 
           on the phone in the common area’s corner:

           EXT. PHONES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Elias hears a CRACKLE through the receiver as his MOM, MARY 
           HERNANDEZ, 44, picks up.  

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Hey, Mom. It’s me...

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        Elias?
           Mary starts to CRY on the other end. Then she speed-guns, 
           talking rapidly:

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Elias, I tried calling, but they 
                        wouldn’t put me through to you, 
                        wouldn’t even give you a message-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Slow down, Mom. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’ve been worried sick! Are you all 
                        right?

           Elias looks around at the hardened CONVICTS around him. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yeah, everything’s fine.

           INT. ENTRANCE, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Victor and Buster stand to the side of the common area. An 
           INMATE stares down Victor as he passes.

           Buster JERKS UP, as he hears YELLS from the CARD TABLE. He 
           turns to Victor, nods his head towards the action. 

           INT. TABLES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Terry hovers over the table:  

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        This bitch-ass nigger dealing from 
                        the bottom of the deck-

           Victor walks over, Buster supervising in the background. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        What’s going on?

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        Motherfuckers cheating me outta my 
                        commissary!

           Victor looks to the PLAYER that Terry points at.

                                 POKER PLAYER #2 
                        What you lookin’ at me for? I 
                        didn’t do shit.
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Games over, guys. 

                                 POKER PLAYER #3
                        The fuck it is, little man. We’re 
                        still playing. 

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        He told you to take a hike, boss. 
                        We’ll sort it out ourselves. 

           Victor looks at the CARD PLAYERS, unsure of how to react. 

           EXT. PHONES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Elias looks over at the commotion behind him.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        This has been really hard on me, 
                        Elias... I’m trying to help you, I 
                        really am. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I know. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        But I can’t talk to lawyers every 
                        day. I can’t think about you in 
                        there all the time, it’s too 
                        hard...

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I know, Mom. I’m sorry...

           Elias turns away from the fight at the tables, holds a finger 
           in his ear to block out the noise. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Mom, do you think you could wire me 
                        some money? Please?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’ve spent so much money on legal 
                        counsel, everything. I’m working 
                        double shifts. I can’t keep running 
                        to catch up, Elias.

           Elias looks dejected. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No, I understand, I understand-
           INT. TABLES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           At the card table, Buster walks over to take control of the 
           situation. 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        You heard what the officer said.

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        It’s all good, Officer Brecko-

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Not gonna say it again: Get moving, 
                        gentlemen! 

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        What now, Fat Boy? Playing tough 
                        cause you wanna impress the duck?

           Terry looks to the CARD PLAYERS, who snicker. 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Who are you trying to impress, 
                        Edwards? Last I heard, you’re just 
                        a cheap prison pocket everyone else 
                        moves their contraband around in. 
                        Or am I wrong?

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        Fuck you, man.

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Care to repeat that, Edwards?

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        I said “Fuck you”, motherfucker!

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        I’m confiscating your drawing 
                        materials. Go get ‘em now.

           Terry STARES defiantly at Buster. The officer dips a hand to 
           grasp the handle of his PR-24 BATON. 

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make me wait, or I’ll put you 
                        in the fucking Hole.

           Terry reluctantly gets up. INMATES laugh as he passes. 

                                 TERRY EDWARDS
                        The fuck you laughing at?
                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        Move it, Edwards!
                              (to the CROWD)
                        Show’s over, gentlemen!

           Buster takes a hard look around, before he and Victor move 
           back to the side. 

           INT. ENTRANCE, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Sorry, I messed that up...

           Buster pats Victor on the shoulder.

                                 C.O. BUSTER BRECKO
                        You’ll get the hang of it. You 
                        gotta assert yourself, right away. 
                        It’s like dealing with kids, you 
                        gotta make ‘em respect you.   

           EXT. PHONES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Elias looks away from the commotion at the tables as the 
           conflict ends and Terry exits.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I can probably get an advance on my 
                        paycheck, wire you some of that, 
                        but it won’t be much. What do you 
                        need money for?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I just wanted to buy some stuff. A 
                        toothbrush, toothpaste, snacks...

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        If you write me a list, I can send 
                        you anything you need?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t think they’ll let you send 
                        that stuff in here, Mom.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Oh... Right...

           Mary starts to CRY again on the other end. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I just can’t believe you’re in 
                        there...
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Stop, Mom. It’s okay...

           Elias looks down. A tear streams down his face, but he 
           quickly wipes it, making sure none of the CONVICTS saw it.

           Then Elias’ brow arches in concern as he sees TERRY silently 
           approach Buster and Victor with determined footsteps. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Mom... I have to go...

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Something wrong? We hardly talked. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No, no, no, everything’s all right, 
                        I just have to go. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Can you call in the evenings? I’m 
                        working late, so I-

           Elias’ expressions turns to horror as:

           THWACK! -- TERRY POUNCES. His SHIV moves in a FLURRY, stabs 
           into Buster’s BELLY -- eight, nine, ten times IN A SECOND. 

           Elias fumbles with the receiver, hangs it up with a SMACK!

           INT. ENTRANCE, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - SAME TIME

           Terry’s BLADE STRIKES into Buster’s THROAT and FACE as the 
           OFFICER collapses with a GUTTURAL GROAN, leaking blood. 

           Victor reacts immediately: DRAWS his baton and BELTS Terry’s 
           HEAD. He fumbles with his SpiderAlert transponder -- CLICKS 
           it furiously. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                              (into his radio)
                        10-33! 10-33! Officer down! 

           INT. PHONES, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Elias stands nailed to the floor. Around him, INMATES make 
           ANIMAL NOISES -- spectators in a perverse zoo. 

           Above, a SHRILL SIREN BLARES through the block.

           The C BLOCK C.O. sprints past Elias:
                                 C BLOCK C.O. (O.S.)
                        Requesting immediate assistance to 
                        C! I need medical down here!

           The INMATES around Elias quiet, as Spring approaches calmly.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Let’s not hang around here until 
                        trouble starts brewing, gentlemen.

           The INMATES listen, and start to disperse. 

           Spring taps Elias gently on the shoulder, turns him toward 
           their cell. Elias follows, but he can’t take his eyes off 
           Buster’s body.

           INT. C BLOCK ENTRANCE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           BOOTED FEET sprint down the C Block entrance hallway, as a 
           SQUAD OF C.O.s -- Smither and Montoya with them -- burst 
           through the entrance, batons ready to strike.

           INT. ENTRANCE, COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Victor tries to plug the GASHES in Buster’s throat with his 
           hands, but blood pools out between his fingers.  

           Behind Victor, the C.O. RESPONSE SQUAD, led by Smither, 
           pushes back INMATES. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Back! Get the FUCK back!

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Spring shuts the cell door, goes to rests on his bunk, as 
           though nothing’s happened. 

           Elias stays by the door. He listens to the SOUNDS of the 
           C.O.s fighting to save Buster’s life below:

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.)
                        You’re all right, brother... Hurry 
                        up!

                                 MEDICAL C.O. (O.S.)
                        I’m trying!

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.)
                        Why isn’t the rest of medical down 
                        here? He’s fucking bleeding out!
           Suddenly, there’s a LONG STRETCH of SILENCE. The PRISONERS 
           CHEER as they realize the grisly conclusion. 

           Spring reads in his bunk, calmly turns a page. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Officer Brecko didn’t make it.

           Elias hasn’t blinked once this whole time. 

           INT. C BLOCK, COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Smither sees the MEDIC’s expression. He CHUCKS his baton into 
           the ground in anger.

           Victor, shell-shocked, stares at the body with glazed eyes.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                              (stuttering)
                        I don’t know what... It happened-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Montoya.

           Montoya walks over, shakes Victor’s shoulders softly.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Carrier. Carrier... 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        It just happened-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Get him the fuck outta here, 
                        Montoya!

           Montoya leads Victor out of the block. Victor wipes his blood-
           soaked hands off on his uniform. 

           Smither and the REMAINING C.O.s stand like somber statues 
           next to Buster’s inanimate body in the empty common area. 

           FADE OUT. 

                                                            FROM BLACK:

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - DAWN

           Elias is awoken by the BLARE of the MORNING ALARM.

           Spring sits on the bunk’s edge with a straight back, chin 
           resting on his chest. He breathes steadily: In-out, in-out...
           A FOOD CART wheels up to the cell, pushed by a C.O., who 
           slides the trays into the cell, where Elias accepts them.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Pass Jimmy the paper on my desk. 

           Elias looks down, sees a yellow folded piece of paper, which 
           he picks up, hands to the guard through the hatch. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        You need any books or reading 
                        materials?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Me?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Don’t ask if I’m talking to you all 
                        the time, it bothers me. What do 
                        you read?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t really read...

           Spring stares at him, as though that’s a personal insult. 

                                 C.O. JIMMY (O.S.)
                        I’ll bring these up here ASAP.

           The FOOD C.O. exits down the tier with the cart. Elias sits 
           down on his cot, with his metal tray in his lap.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        When I ask if you want some 
                        literature, that’s a courtesy I’m 
                        extending you. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Thanks, Mr. Spring.

           Spring shakes his head. Then he dips a hand under his bunk, 
           and fishes out a copy of Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends 
           and Influence People, which he tosses to Elias. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Get started. I got work to do, so 
                        you need something to fill your 
                        time, apart from bothering me. 
                              (beat)
                        When you’re done with that one, I 
                        got another one for you.  
           INT. LOCKDOWN OFFICE - DAWN

           Darkness inside an OFFICE, as Victor sleeps. The door opens, 
           and a SLIVER of light peeks through. FOOTSTEPS, and A CLICK 
           from a desk lamp SNAP Victor awake: 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Easy! It’s just me...

           Smither is carrying a TRAY with prison breakfast. He sets it 
           down on a table next to Victor’s cot.

           Smither gets a chair, which he pulls to the side of the cot.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to talk to you about... 
                        You know, it was not a good 
                        situation... I guess I thought you 
                        needed to know that you did 
                        everything to help Buster, until we 
                        got there. That it wasn’t your 
                        fault, you know? 

           Victor picks into his food with his spork, not eating any. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        But what I also wanted to talk to 
                        you about is... Do you think you’re 
                        cut out for the gig?

           Smither looks straight at Victor, not padding the blow any.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        What happened to Buster isn’t a 
                        regular occurrence. But it does 
                        happen, and you seem quite shook up 
                        about it...

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        All due respect, I’m not planning 
                        on being a C.O. forever, sir... I’m 
                        going to college once I’ve got 
                        enough saved, sir.

           Smither leans back in his chair.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        What you wanna study?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Law. If I can get in... Until then, 
                        I gotta provide for my family. I’m 
                        not a quitter, sir. 
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        If you’re rolling with my guys, I 
                        need to know you’ve got my six. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        You can count on me, sir. 

           Smither gives Victor a thumb clasp handshake.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I’ll hold you to that. Meantime, go 
                        home, take a couple of days with 
                        your family.

           Smither stands, walks to the door. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        PD’s here to talk when you’re up 
                        for it. Take your time.

           INT. COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - DAY

           C BLOCK is alive with the hustle of INMATES moving around. 

           Elias walks down the TIER STAIRCASE. He sees the spot where 
           Buster was murdered: It’s sterile. A CONVICT treads through 
           the site, unaware of its significance. 

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - DAY

           Elias unwraps a packet of FILM EXPOSURES. He tinkers with a 
           POLAROID IMPULSE CAMERA in Spring’s empty cell. 

           He accidentally presses the SHUTTER, and BLASTS a FLASH into 
           his own face.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Shit!

           Elias blinks rapidly. The camera SPITS out the exposure. He 
           examines it, shakes the celluloid to develop it. 

           INT. SECOND TIER, C BLOCK - DAY

           Victor walks the tier, toward Smither, who moseys in place 
           further down, hands behind his back. 

           A VOICE stops Victor in his tracks:
                                 SHAWN (O.S.)
                        You’re that new guy that got Fat 
                        Boy killed, right?

           Victor walks back to a CELL, where SHAWN, 27, sits on the 
           bottom of the bunk. 

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        I was there when Terry smoked your 
                        home boy. Never got a chance to say 
                        thanks for the show!

           Shawn FLICKS a cup of BROWN LIQUID into Victor’s face through 
           the hatch. Victor WIPES his face, SPITS vehemently. 

           Victor stops, realizes what the liquid is. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        You’re gonna throw coffee at me?

           Victor HITS his hand against the door, furious, while Shawn 
           CACKLES stupidly inside the cell, laughs in his Southern 
           drawl: 

                                 SHAWN
                        Aw, man! You thought it was shit 
                        didn’t you? I got you good, boy! I 
                        got you good!

           Shawn CHUCKLES like a drunken idiot. 

           Victor grabs his keys, unlocks the door. Shawn’s face drops.

                                 SHAWN (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy, 
                        man! Take it easy!

           Smither moves toward Victor with quick steps.

           INT. SHAWN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           CLANG! The cell door slides open. Shawn cowers into a corner, 
           but Victor approaches and grabs him by the collar. 

                                 SHAWN 
                        It was a joke, boy! It was a 
                        fucking joke!

           Smither enters, his presence filling the confined space. He 
           pushes Victor aside, then: 

           SMACK! Smither strikes Shawn across the arm with his baton. 
           Shawn CRIES OUT, drops to the ground.
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        He disrespected you, Carrier. Make 
                        him respect you. Come on!

           Victor hesitates, but he’s amped up on anger and adrenaline. 

           There’s a CRACK as Victor hits Shawn’s leg bone with his 
           baton. Shawn BAWLS in pain, before Victor hits him once more. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        You respect him now, you piece of 
                        shit?

                                 SHAWN
                        Yes! Jesus, yes!

           Victor stops, his senses returning. He looks at Smither, who 
           still hovers over a BAWLING Shawn.  

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Don’t fuck with him! You got that?

           Smither turns to SHAWN’S CELLIE, who huddles in the top bunk.  

                                 SHAWN’S ROOMMATE
                        I didn’t do anything...

           INT. SECOND TIER, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           They exit the cell. Victor looks down at his stained uniform. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I got spare uniforms in the office.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Should we...

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        We held back on him.
                              (off Victor’s hesitation)
                        He’s fine. Go get changed. 

           Smither pats Victor on the back as he passes. 

           EXT. C YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           A HISPANIC CONVICT, 40’s, mustache and wife-beater, looks 
           straight into the lens of Elias’ camera.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Lean back a little? 
           The CONVICT shifts around uncomfortably, crosses his arms and 
           leans back. Elias looks through the viewfinder of his camera.

           There’s a SNAP, as Elias presses the SHUTTER on the camera. 
           He pulls the exposure, looks at it.

           The CONVICT moves over, looks at the developing picture with 
           the curiosity of a child. 

                                 HISPANIC CONVICT
                        This is for my girl. If I don’t 
                        look flush, I’ll fuck you up, man.

           The CONVICT nudges Elias with his shoulder.  

                                 HISPANIC CONVICT (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding. I am fat, what the 
                        fuck you can do about that? 
                              (seeing the portrait)
                        I can send this to my lady, right? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yeah. Yeah, I think so...

           The CONVICT hands Elias a PHOTO TOKEN in exchange for the 
           photo, then walks off.

           Elias looks at the PHOTO TOKEN - smiles with satisfaction for 
           the first time. 

           EXT. C YARD, NATIVES - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias looks at the world through the camera viewfinder. He 
           moves it up, seeing the faint outline of a bird in the sky. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                        Camera man. 

           Elias looks up, sees Spectro approaching. 

           EXT. C YARD, CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Spectro walks to a deserted corner, Elias following. Spectro 
           looks around to make sure nobody’s watching.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I think... It might be better out 
                        of the shadows, in the sun-

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        I don’t give a fuck where it’s 
                        better. Come closer.
           Elias takes steps closer to Spectro. He puts the camera up to 
           his eye. Spectro faces the camera with his arms crossed. 

           CLICK! The FLASH from the camera goes off. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        You’re inside for trafficking?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I wasn’t... I mean, not that 
                        much... 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Not that much, huh? Just a little 
                        bit of felony trafficking?
                              (off Elias’ silence)
                        I ran my own check, though. 
                        Wouldn’t call what you did running 
                        narco.

           Elias’ eye opens. His pupil pulls tight in the sunlight.

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        I would call what you did, hitting 
                        a little girl with your car. 
                        Fleeing the scene like a chingado 
                        coward. 
                              (beat)
                        You know Miguel, the guy I was with 
                        the other day? That’s his niece. 
                              (off Elias’ silence)
                        Keep taking photos.

           CLICK! Another FLASH from the camera, while Elias’ hands 
           shake with fear.

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        You think I give a fuck about a 
                        dead beaner girl in New Mexico? But 
                        now I know something you don’t want 
                        out there. In return for keeping 
                        that to myself, you’re gonna do 
                        something for me. 

           Spectro continues to survey the area around them.

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Your cellie, right? Tomorrow, some 
                        guys are walking into his cell. 
                        They’re gonna take him out. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Why are you telling me this?
                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        I just saved your life. So now I 
                        own you. 

           A FINAL CLICK hangs in the air. The camera droops from Elias’ 
           taut face, as Spectro walks intimidatingly close. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Your mom is Mary Hernandez. She 
                        works at Mesilla Valley Hospital. 
                        She lives at 966 Augustine Avenue. 
                        If you tell anyone what I just told 
                        you, three guys will show up at her 
                        house before sunset. They’ll take 
                        turns raping her through the night, 
                        then cut her head off in the 
                        morning. 

           He pushes SIX PHOTO TOKENS into Elias’ palm, before he nods 
           to the photos in hand. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Keep the photos. A gesture of our 
                        new friendship.

           INT. CHOW HALL, C BLOCK - AFTERNOON

           Elias sits at his empty table in the busy CHOW HALL. Across 
           the sea of CONVICTS, Spring sits at the ARYAN TABLE. He 
           doesn’t notice Elias staring from across the hall.

           Victor stands at the back of the CHOW HALL. He sees Shawn 
           HOBBLE into the dining hall on the opposite side of the room. 
           Victor looks down, disappointed with himself.

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - EVENING

           Elias walks into the cell, where Spring is resting on his 
           bunk bed, reading. He lies down, with his back to Spring. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You look like you’ve seen a ghost.

           INT. C BLOCK, LAUNDRY ROOM - EVENING

           FLUORESCENT LIGHTS go on in the block’s dark LAUNDRY ROOM. 

           Victor follows Smither into the corner of the room. The 
           sergeant squats down, looks to make sure nobody is coming. 
           Then he wriggles out his leather wallet, and pulls out an 
           object, which he places between two washing machines: 

           A BRASSY 9 MM BULLET. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You and I were doing our rounds 
                        when we came in here, saw this. 

           Smither picks up the BULLET, holds it up in the light.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Sorry, is this a test?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        No, this is a piece of nine 
                        millimeter ammunition for a 
                        handgun. Which we now have to 
                        presume is somewhere on the 
                        premises of this institution. 

           Victor looks at him, puzzled. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        If we find lethal contraband like 
                        this, we have to force a lockdown. 
                        When we go on lockdown, we get put 
                        on lockdown pay. Which means we get 
                        paid what we’re supposed to.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        But we didn’t find this, sir?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You think having a kid is cheap? 
                        You’ll be begging for lockdown pay 
                        in a month, son. 

           Smither puts a hand on Victor’s shoulder.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        This is what makes sure that what 
                        happened to Buster, doesn’t happen 
                        to any of us for another 24 hours. 
                        This keeps the animals locked up 
                        for another night. 
                              (beat)
                        Victor, this is the way this world 
                        works in here. Remember when I had 
                        your six? When you lost your head a 
                        little?

           Victor looks down, embarrassed. Smither stands, SPEAKS into 
           his RADIO.
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        This is Sergeant Smither with C.O. 
                        Carrier. We’ve recovered a 
                        projectile for a firearm in C 
                        Block’s laundry room. I’m advising 
                        an immediate lockdown, pending 
                        further investigation. 

                                 COMMAND VOICE (O.S.)
                        Copy that, Sergeant. 

           Victor stays squatted on the ground.

           INT. C BLOCK - DAWN

           A wide view of the silent C Block, the floor of the hall 
           empty as the INMATES sleep in their cells. 

           INT. C BLOCK, ENTRANCE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           A LOCKDOWN PATROL of FIFTEEN OFFICERS, dressed in full combat 
           gear (visor helmets, shoulder pads, shields) march down the 
           hallway toward C Block. 

           INT. C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           The same wide view of a deserted C Block. 

           Then the SOUND of a TOILET FLUSHING. Then ANOTHER. Soon, the 
           sounds of TOILETS FLUSHING dominate the open space. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. C BLOCK, INMATE CELL #1 - MOMENTS LATER

           THREE LOCKDOWN OFFICERS tear a cell apart. INMATES are 
           detained outside the cell by OTHER LOCKDOWN OFFICERS. 

           INT. C BLOCK, INMATE CELL #2 - CONTINUOUS

           In another cell, the OFFICERS search everything: 

           They rip mattresses, pull boxes onto the floor, and step on 
           the items without care, as they continue their hunt. 
           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Elias looks down the side of the tier, where the LOCKDOWN 
           OFFICERS are approaching. 

           Elias retreats into the corner of his bunk, scared of what’s 
           coming. Spring calmly chews on his cigarette.

           The CELL DOOR slides open, and THREE OFFICERS step inside - 
           one of them VICTOR, dressed in LOCKDOWN GEAR. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        I can’t speak for my hardened 
                        cellie, but I have nothing to hide.

                                 LOCKDOWN OFFICERS
                              (to Victor, quietly)
                        Easy on this one...

           Elias watches the whole ordeal with careful interest, as the 
           OFFICERS take the utmost care to not rearrange anything.

           Victor looks at his colleagues with bewilderment. He turns to 
           Elias’ part of the cell.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        This your stuff, Convict?

           Elias looks at Spring. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        What you looking at me for? He 
                        asked you a question. 

           Victor searches through Elias’ belongings, while the LOCKDOWN 
           OFFICERS continue their gentle search. 

           INT. LOCKDOWN OFFICE, C BLOCK - AFTERNOON

           The LOCKDOWN OFFICERS arrange contraband on a table: HOME-
           MADE WEAPONS, CRUMPLED BAGS OF POWDER, BLOCK CELLPHONES.

           Victor’s sweaty hair is pressed flat by the helmet he’s been 
           wearing.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        We’ll sweep the rest of the house 
                        tomorrow.

                                 LOCKDOWN OFFICERS
                              (in unison)
                        Aye-aye, Sergeant.
           Victor examines the contraband, focusing on a SHIV like the 
           one that was used on Buster. Smither notices, walks over.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Solid work today, Victor. 

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRING’S CELL - EVENING

           Spring meditates. He slowly comes down, then sits at the 
           desk, as Elias eats his tray of food on his bunk, reading. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t understand it, Mr. Spring. 

           Elias holds up a new novel - a copy of Machiavelli’s The 
           Prince. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        “How we live is so different from 
                        how we ought to live that he who 
                        studies what ought to be done 
                        rather than what is done will learn 
                        the way to his downfall rather than 
                        to his preservation.”

           Elias looks at him with a puzzled expression.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What does that mean?

           Spring sighs, takes off his glasses, wipes his eyes. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Means that everybody has their own 
                        visions of ideals, morals, ethics. 
                        But if you’re enlightened and 
                        intelligent, you’ll come to learn 
                        that ain’t a correct depiction of 
                        how the world really works. If you 
                        wanna survive, you don’t do what 
                        you’re supposed to do, you do what 
                        you have to do. 

           Elias nods quietly, chewing on the words. Spring puts on his 
           glasses again, looks coldly at Elias. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What were you talking to Santino 
                        about in the yard?

           Elias freeze.
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        With who?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Don’t insult me like that again, 
                        you know what I’m talking about. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He just... He wanted me to take 
                        some pictures of him. For his 
                        family or friends...

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        That the complete extent of your 
                        conversation?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yes.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You sure about that?

           The muscle under Elias’ eye twitches.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He told me... That some guys 
                        were... coming for you. 

           Spring stares down Elias. He stands, walks over to hover over 
           the kid, who crouches on the edge of his bunk. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Why’re you telling me this?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m not a bad person. I couldn’t 
                        live with myself-

           He SLAPS Elias on the side of the face. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You’re telling me outta the 
                        kindness of your heart? Don’t 
                        patronize me, boy. If Santino told 
                        you something, it’s because he 
                        wants another something in return.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t trust him.

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Then you are not as dumb as you 
                        appear.
           Spring sits on his bunk, lights a cigarette. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t want to be a part of this-

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        But you’re in it now. You were 
                        hoping I would take care of you in 
                        return for telling me?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I see the way you get treated in 
                        here...

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        I thought you were telling me this 
                        outta magnanimity? Don’t pretend 
                        like you’re more noble than anyone 
                        else. You just haven’t gotten the 
                        veneer of civility washed off yet.
                              (beat)
                        You think I believe your story 
                        about muling dope over state lines? 
                        I know you plowed down Farro’s 
                        niece with your car. I know all of 
                        it, and I have from the start. So 
                        don’t talk to me about being a good 
                        person. 

           Elias wipes his hands on the fabric of his pants. Spring taps 
           his cigarette into an ashtray, exhales the smoke.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Does he know?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        If Farro knew, you’d be dead.

           Spring walks over to his desk. He fidgets under one of the 
           drawers, probing for: A BLADE, WRAPPED IN A DUCT-TAPE HANDLE.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Wait, wait, wait-

           Spring squats down in front of Elias. He holds the KNIFE up, 
           as Elias’ leans back as far as possible. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You either leave the pen a man, a 
                        fag, or in a body bag. Nobody’s 
                        gonna save you. I can handle my own 
                        business. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT'D)
                        You ever want to do the same, you 
                        can borrow my blade to take care of 
                        Farro any time you want. 

           Elias shakes his head. Spring pulls the knife away, stands. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think so. 

           INT. C.O. OFFICE - DAY

           Montoya puts on his uniform, as Victor walks into the office. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Sergeant had to take care of 
                        something, so I’m covering for him.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        I’m not your superior, man. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Sorry.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        I’m gonna grab coffee. You want 
                        some?

           Montoya smiles broadly, as he locks in his utility belt.

           INT. C BLOCK - DAY

           Montoya and Carrier stand in the corner of C Block. Montoya’s 
           eyes are animated, as he lectures Victor:

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        ... indigenous glowworm that’s 
                        called Arachnocampa luminosa. 
                        They’re photoluminescent, so you’ll 
                        be walking around dark caves and 
                        you hit a basin, the whole roof 
                        covered with them. Looks like the 
                        night sky, except so close you can 
                        touch it. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Huh... Where’d you say this was?
                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Place called Waitomo. Where I’m 
                        retiring to, living out the last of 
                        my miserable days.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Really?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Probably not. I mean, what the fuck 
                        am I gonna do in New Zealand? 

           Carrier sees Spring pass through, flanked by Hansen.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Who’s that?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Spring. Shot-caller for the A.B. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        When we were doing lockdown, we 
                        took it pretty easy on him-

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Oh, yeah. He gets special 
                        treatment. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Why?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        You gotta have a king on the block. 
                        He keeps check on the convicts, 
                        makes sure shit is somewhat 
                        handled.

           Victor nods. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        How long you been working here, 
                        Montoya?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Shit... About five years?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Working under the sergeant the 
                        whole time?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        He was here before I was, but he 
                        got promoted just after I started. 
                        He’s former Army - Desert Storm.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT'D)
                        Came home, couldn’t get any work in 
                        PD, or anywhere else. Corrections 
                        took him. 

           Montoya scans Victor’s expression.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking. But 
                        he’s a good leader, Victor. He 
                        really cares about the guys working 
                        for him.

           Victor nods softly. 

           INT. C BLOCK, SECOND TIER - DAY

           Victor walks the beat alone. He travels along to the shower 
           area, where an INMATE hangs out, with clothes on. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        If you’re done showering, you’re 
                        not supposed to be here anymore. 

                                 INMATE
                        Sorry, boss. 

           The INMATE grabs his shower gear and exits the area. 

           Victor is taken aback by the effortlessness of the 
           interaction. A small victory, finally. 

           INT. C BLOCK, LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Elias stands in front of an open laundry machine. He fills it 
           with dirty clothes. 

           Spectro approaches from behind, leans in over his shoulder:

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Tonight. 8 PM. You got that?

           Spectro leaves as quietly as he came. Elias watches him go 
           with a grim expression.  

           INT. JAMES LUTHER SPRINGS CELL - EVENING

           Elias sits on his bunk. Sweat covers his forehead, as he 
           stares at an electronic desk clock on Spring’s table: 7:45 PM 

           Spring enters the cell. He puts down his writing materials on 
           the desk. 
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Laundry’s under the bunk... 

           Spring sits. Elias stands, walks to the exit of the cell. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Fold it up before the wrinkles set. 

           Spring points to the laundry bag by his bunk. Elias steals a 
           glance at the clock: 7:47 PM

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Elias folds the clothes, putting each folded item onto a pile 
           on the bed. 

           He looks at the clock, visible over Spring’s shoulder, the 
           foreboding green digits displaying the time: 7:55 PM

           Elias puts the pile of folded clothes down on Spring’s bed. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’ll be right back...

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        What’s the matter with you, boy?

           Elias looks at the clock: 7:56 PM. Spring notices, turns to 
           see what Elias is looking at, realizes what’s going on. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        ‘Bout that time?

           Elias looks out at the dim tier: No sign of anyone. Yet. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        Tell Hansen to come up here. Don’t 
                        run, but do it quick.  

           Spring dips under his bunk and fishes out his SHIV, as Elias 
           swiftly exits the cell. 

           INT. THIRD TIER, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Elias moves down the tier with quick steps. 

           Behind him, FOUR HITMEN, dressed in thick layers of clothing, 
           cross the perpendicular connection between the tiers. 

           Elias looks over his shoulder, just as the HITMEN enter 
           Spring’s cell.
           INT. HANSEN’S CELL, SECOND TIER, C BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Elias rushes up to Hansen’s cell.  

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Spring needs you upstairs!

           Inside, Hansen lazily reads a crusty magazine.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Upstairs! He needs you, now!

                                                              JUMP CUT:

           INT. C BLOCK, FIRST TIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Now on the first floor, Elias HEARS the SHOUTS. He looks 
           around, as C.O.’s rush past, hearing the SHOUTS above also. 

           INT. C BLOCK, THIRD TIER - CONTINUOUS

           A bloodied Spring struggles to crawl out onto the tier.

                                 INMATE (O.S.)
                        They hit Spring! They hit Spring!

           Hansen and ANOTHER ARYAN BROTHER sprint down the tier.

           INT. COMMON AREA, C BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias’ legs pump nervously, as he sits on one of the benches 
           in the common area. He hears the SHOUTS building:

           Spring is wheeled out on a GURNEY by EMTs, flanked by C.O.s, 
           who fight to keep the ARYAN BROTHERS from getting to him. 

           INT. INTERROGATION - NIGHT

           Elias covers his shoulders with a blanket, sitting behind a 
           desk. A C.O. watches him from the corner of the dark room. 

           Smither enters. Victor follows him, walking over to a corner. 
           Smither sits down slowly, takes his time. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You were spotted leaving your cell 
                        just before Spring was assaulted. 
                        You know you’re not supposed to be 
                        running. Why were you?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know anything-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I suggest you let that shit fade 
                        real quick. Adding 10-to-life to 
                        your sentence for conspiracy to 
                        commit murder ain’t gonna do you no 
                        good.

           Elias doesn’t answer.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        We both know you don’t belong in 
                        here. You tell me what you know, we 
                        can protect you. 

           Elias shivers. Smither turns to Victor. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Get him another blanket.

           Smither hasn’t realized that Elias is chuckling grimly.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I saw what happened to the officer 
                        that got killed. I saw him bleed 
                        out like everyone else did. 

           Elias’ expression grows stern. Victor stays in the background 
           shadows, his gaze shifting between Elias and Smither.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Were you born a fuck-up or did you 
                        have to work on it, Hernandez? You 
                        should be walking with a fucking 
                        albatross around your neck. You’re 
                        bad luck. You’re cursed, I can feel 
                        it. 

           Smither smiles broadly with a shit-eating grin.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It’s not my fault Spring’s dead...

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Spring’s not dead. 

           Elias looks at him with surprise. Smither CHUCKLES. 
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t make any sense to me, 
                        either, cause he got hit, like, 30 
                        fucking times. He’s in the ICU, 
                        critical, but holding on. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Like I said, I don’t know 
                        anything...

           Smither claps on the table in frustration.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        We’re going in circles.
                              (to the C.O. behind him)
                        Set up an ad-seg order on Junior 
                        Hernandez. Give him some alone time 
                        to think things through. 

           Elias swallows apprehensively at the mention of “alone time”. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t over. You’re still in 
                        it. If you wanna talk, I suggest 
                        you do it as soon as possible. 

           Smither exits the room.

           Elias looks up at Montoya with sad eyes. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I didn’t know it was going to be 
                        like this...

           It hits Montoya, who opens his mouth to respond. But what can 
           he say?

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Montoya and Victor escort Elias down the red-striped hallway 
           of ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION -- “THE HOLE”.  

           They pass window slivers, where Elias sees INMATES pace 
           around like caged panthers.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Please- I can’t be alone. I’ll tell 
                        you anything you want to know-

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                              (hushed)
                        Stop talking! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT'D)
                        You snitch on shot callers, what do 
                        you think’s gonna happen?

           Victor studies the interaction silently.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        I already told you: You can get 
                        through this if you keep your head 
                        down. Do not start fucking up now.

           INT. AD-SEG CELL - NIGHT

           Elias is awake, as he hears a TAPPING on the metal door. He 
           looks at the open hatch, where a set of eyes peek through. 
           Elias walks over to the door. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Officer Montoya asked me to bring 
                        you some of your belongings.

           Victor slides a toothbrush, toothpaste, a T-shirt, and some 
           books through the hatch. He holds up a MARS BAR, which he 
           unwraps, and passes through. 

           Victor’s about to close the hatch, but Elias stops him:

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Wait, what’s your name?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Carrier. Officer Carrier. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Thanks. 

           The hatch closes, and Carrier’s FOOTSTEPS fade away. 

           Elias studies the Mars Bar. He consumes it in one bite, the 
           taste so good he has to close his eyes to savor it fully. 

           He looks down at the rest of the items that he was brought. 
           Among them are his copies of How to Make Friends and 
           Influence People, and The Prince. 

           EXT. AD-SEG YARD - MORNING

           The ad-seg yard is divided by filled single-man dog cages. 
           INT/EXT. DOG CAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Elias looks at the blue sky above him, cut into fragments by 
           the steel roof of the kennel.

           Miguel Farro sits in one of the adjacent cages. Elias turns 
           his gaze away, trying to remain unseen. 

           INT. AD-SEG CELL - DAWN

           Elias WAKES with a jerk. He looks around the midnight blue 
           cell, then takes a deep breath. 

           He grabs his book, and reads in the faint moonlight that 
           penetrates from a small square window above him. 

           INT/EXT. DOG CAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Elias finishes a last set of burpees. He wipes his sweaty 
           face with the sleeve of his T-shirt.  

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Understand Spanish, kid?

           Elias sees Miguel Farro in the neighbor cage. They speak 
           SPANISH:

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (nervously)
                        A little bit... 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        You roll with the whites now?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know... I don’t think so. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        How about your cell mate? Spring?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He was... How do you say 
                        ”assaulted”? He’s in hospital...

           Farro laughs. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        That’s not what I meant. You close 
                        with him?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No. 
                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Where are you from?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        New Mexico.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        No, no. Where are you from? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        My mom’s from New Mexico. My dad’s 
                        originally from Nicaragua.

           Farro taps his chest. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        I was born in Managua. But I’m 
                        Mexican now. You been to Nicaragua?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yes, he was from Nicaragua.

           Farro CHUCKLES at Elias’ mistake, switches to ENGLISH:

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        When you going back? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        To population? In two days.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        They’re doing asbestos removal on 
                        the block, so they’ve gotten set up 
                        in the gym. You gonna hang with the 
                        jipatos?

           Elias shrugs his shoulders.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        Shoulda been hanging with us from 
                        the start, man. Fucking Spring 
                        thinks he gets to decide shit. 
                        Ain’t deciding shit now, right?

           Farro SPITS through the side bars of his cage. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        When you get back to population, 
                        find a guy called Luis Padilla. 
                        Tell him to start running kites. 
                        He’ll know what that means. If you 
                        need a bunk, tell him I told you 
                        that we’d take you.
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Thanks...

           Farro winks.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        De nada, Nicaragua...

           He leans back, closing his eyes. Conversation over. 

           EXT. GYM - DAY

           Rain gushes onto the orange gravel, falling from dark clouds. 

           Elias carries a laundry bag. Flanked by Montoya, they jog to 
           a large looming building: THE PRISON’S GYMNASIUM. 

           They stop outside the door. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        You have to figure it out on your 
                        own from here.

           INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

           It takes Elias’ eyes a minute to adjust to the dark interior: 
           A SHANTY TOWN of bunk beds, arranged in strict rows. It’s a 
           maze, the PRISONERS moving around like it’s a Turkish market. 

           Elias sees the factions: NORTH MEXICANS, SOUTH MEXICANS, 
           WHITES, ASIANS. They stare back challengingly. 

           INT. THE GYM, THE WHITES - CONTINUOUS

           He walks the side of the gym, to the far corner. He sees 
           Hansen sitting on a bunk, surrounded by the ARYAN BROTHERS.

                                 HANSEN
                        What you doing here?

           Hansen stands, takes an aggressive step toward Elias.

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        I remember telling you to cough up 
                        some rent money. We’re looking at 
                        about a thousand bucks, with 
                        interest. You don’t have Spring to 
                        lean on no more, so you need to get 
                        up some green, son. Fast. 
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        But, I don’t have any-

                                 HANSEN
                        I already told you to go hang with 
                        the Natives. You cough up some 
                        money, then maybe we can talk. 

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           Elias lies awake in the top of his bunk bed. The gym’s quiet, 
           the INMATES asleep. 

           Suddenly there’s a PANICKED YELL from one end of the gym. A 
           FLASHLIGHT turns on in Elias’ end, the BEAM of light rushing 
           toward the scene accompanied by the C.O.s footsteps. 

           The LIGHTS go on, and INMATES wake, complaining and SHOUTING 
           with excitement. Elias looks around, disoriented. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias stands open-mouthed next to a group of INMATES, all of 
           them examining what must be last night’s crime scene:

           A bottom cot COVERED in smears of dry, brown blood. 

           Elias looks at the BLACK INMATE, 23, next to him. 

                                 BLACK INMATE
                        No cameras in here... This whole 
                        motherfucker’s in the cut, nobody’s 
                        watching us. Shit’s gonna go down 
                        every fucking night. Soon as the 
                        lights go out...

           Elias looks over to the entrance, where a set of BIOHAZARD 
           CLEANERS and TWO C.O.s enter, and walk toward the scene.

           INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Elias passes row after row of INMATES, who stand in his way, 
           as he trespasses on their turf. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                        Camera man! Where you been?

           Elias sees Spectro waving him down, at the end of one of the 
           aisles. He tries to get away, but an INMATE blocks his way. 
           Spectro walks down.

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Why you trespassing here without 
                        permission? Come on, get your shit. 

           Spectro slaps Elias on the back of the head, points down one 
           of the walkways, leading into the heart of the NORTEÑO CAMP. 

           INT. NORTEÑO CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Spectro waltzes down the “main street” of the NORTEÑO 
           VILLAGE, while the GANG MEMBERS glare at Elias.

           Spectro leads Elias to the border of their area, where 
           there’s a free bunk bed. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Grab this one...

           Elias puts down his gear onto the bed. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA (O.S.)
                              (in Spanish)
                        What’s going on, Santino?

           LUIS PADILLA, 42, an authoritative gang presence, approaches. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA (CONT’D)
                              (to Elias)
                        You came here to spy on us?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        It’s all right. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        What you doing snooping round here?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        I got it taken care of, Luis. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        This is one of Spring’s fucking 
                        tricks. 

           As Luis argues back, Elias’ attention peaks. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Are you Luis? Luis Padilla?

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        The fuck did you say to me?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Señor Farro, told me to pass on a 
                        message to Luis Padilla...

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        Miguel talked to you?

           Luis looks surprised, but he moves closer. Elias whispers to 
           him, while Spectro looks on with a befuddled expression. 

           Luis takes a step back, contemplating.

                                 LUIS PADILLA (CONT’D)
                              (to Spectro, in Spanish)
                        Why you want him around?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Cause, he’s one of us. And we need 
                        someone to clean, do laundry... 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        He’s not one of us. 
                              (beat)
                        He can grab a bunk on the outside. 
                        If we need it, he’s gone. Until 
                        then, he’s your responsibility. 

           Luis takes one last look at Elias, then exits down the path. 
           Spectro SLAPS Elias on the side of the head, hard. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Don’t talk, unless I tell you.

           Spectro continues down the same way that Luis departed. 

           Elias rubs the side of his face. Then he unpacks his gear, 
           most carefully a crumpled standard issue shirt, that he’s 
           wrapped around his POLAROID CAMERA.

           INT. GYM, PHONE SECTION - DAY

           Elias stands by a row of temporary PAY PHONES that have been 
           set up in one of the gym’s hallways, receiver to his ear. 

           Elias TAPS his fingers impatiently on the phone. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Listen, it’s not like that. I have 
                        to ask you something-
                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        They don’t just put you in 
                        isolation, Elias. You must have 
                        done something-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        They’re doing construction on our 
                        block, so they had to move some of 
                        us around! Mom, listen!

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I really wanted to talk to you on 
                        Monday. Wish you a happy birthday.

           Elias does a double-take. He completely forgot. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I transferred you some money. I 
                        thought you could use-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        How much did you send?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        Elias, that’s rude...

           He SIGHS. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Sorry. That was rude...

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        I sent you sixty dollars. I thought 
                        you could use it to buy something-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Look, is there any way you can send 
                        me more?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        What’s going on, Elias?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Things are expensive here, Mom. We 
                        don’t get enough food, we have to 
                        buy extra food, that sort of thing.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        I’m saving up some money to come 
                        see you-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Can you send me that?
                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        You’d rather have that than have me 
                        come see you?

           Mary SIGHS on the other end.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I can send you another fifty?

           Elias SMACKS his palm into the wall in disappointment. He 
           wipes his brow, thinking hard. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Never mind, Mom. You keep it. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ
                        I’ll send it to you. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No, it’s fine. I’m working next 
                        week, so it’ll be fine. I’d also 
                        rather see you. Of course... 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’m picking up supervising shifts 
                        at the hospital, which means better 
                        pay. I was thinking... If it’s all 
                        right, I could come up there in 
                        about a month?

           Despite everything, Elias smiles. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yeah, that sounds good, Mom. 

           INT. C.O. OFFICE - DAY

           Victor is pouring over paperwork. Montoya slips his head in 
           through the door.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Sarge wants you in his office. 

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE HALLWAY - DAY

           Victor knocks on Smither’s office door. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.)
                        Enter. 

           Victor opens the door. As he steps in, he’s met by:
           INT. SMITHER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A BLARE OF CELEBRATORY NOISE from SMITHER, OFFICERS and 
           SECRETARIES, standing under an “IT’S A BOY” BANNER. 

                                 OFFICERS & SECRETARIES
                              (variations of)
                        Congratulations!

           CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS overwhelm Victor with felicitations. 
           Smither beams at the head of a table with an ICE CREAM CAKE, 
           and half-gallon bottles of OFF-BRAND SODA. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Just cause we don’t carry guns, 
                        don’t mean we shoot blanks.

           The CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS laugh.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           NANCY, 55, a BLACK SECRETARY talks to Victor, who’s digging 
           into a plate of CAKE - as is everyone around him:  

                                 NANCY
                        You and Holly getting any sleep?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                              (laughs)
                        None. Not at all...

                                 NANCY
                        Sweetheart, the next two years will 
                        feel like you’re living the head-
                        end of the worst tequila-bender 
                        hangover you’ve ever had. Oh, and 
                        buy a tumble dryer, cause-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.)
                        Listen up!

           The room quiets, looks to Smither. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        As you all know, Officer Carrier 
                        joined us not too long ago. We’re 
                        here celebrating the birth of his 
                        first child. You found a name yet, 
                        Carrier?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Henry.
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        We’re celebrating Victor and Holly 
                        and Henry. We’re celebrating the 
                        fact that we’re a family here. All 
                        of us. We’re blessed to be in a 
                        place where we care about the 
                        people around us. Their wellbeing, 
                        their safety. Their ability to 
                        build their own lives outside of 
                        here. Victor, if you ever need 
                        anything, just let us know. 

           Everyone nods in agreement.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Thanks, everyone. This really means 
                        a lot...

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Now, back to work before this turns 
                        into a sobfest. 

           The OFFICERS put down plates, file out the cramped room.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        How are things back home?

           INT. C.O. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The office door’s closed, the room quiet. The two men sit. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        They’re, uhm... They’re good. It’s 
                        challenging, definitely. I mean, 
                        you know what it’s like...

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        How’s the monetary situation?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        It’s... okay. Not great. Insurance 
                        didn’t cover as much of the 
                        hospital bills as we hoped for...

           Smither looks at the PORTRAIT of his own family, nodding as 
           though he doesn’t quite know what to say. But he does: 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I’m gonna cut straight to the 
                        chase, Carrier. You remember that 
                        convict you beat the shit out of? 
                        He filed a complaint against you.
           Victor swallows, looks at Smither apprehensively.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        What are we gonna do, sir?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        He filed a complaint against you, 
                        Victor. Not us, not me. You. 

           Smither takes a long drag on his coffee. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. 
                        Talk to the people in charge of 
                        handling this whole business...

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Sir-

           Smither holds up a hand. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Victor, you’ve shown me that you 
                        understand the difference between 
                        the real world and what goes on in 
                        here. That’s a really important 
                        fact of life, and you get it. 
                              (beat)
                        So, here’s what we’re gonna do: I’m 
                        in contact with a CONVICT who needs 
                        some help with his... 
                        “communication”.  

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        What do you mean, sir?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        He’s paying me to bring in some 
                        cellphones. Paying us. 

           Victor looks at him confused. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I can’t do that, sir.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Victor, there’s motherfuckers in 
                        Florence ADX, sitting in isolation 
                        24 hours a day, no outgoing mail or 
                        phone calls. They’re communicating 
                        with the outside world, no problem. 
                        You think here’s any different? 
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I’m not doing this, Sergeant.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I’m not asking you, Victor. I’m 
                        telling you. 

           Victor shakes his head, still not quite understanding. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        This is black-mail...

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Don’t be dramatic, Victor. When you 
                        come in here, you notice how this 
                        whole place is segregated? That’s 
                        not an accident. We’re outnumbered 
                        200 to one. They unite against us, 
                        we don’t stand a fucking chance. 

           Victor interjects, but Smither cuts him off:  

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Victor! The convicts get 
                        things, that we want them to. It’s 
                        a dirty little secret that nobody 
                        talks about, but we all know it. 
                        Phones keep the convicts happy. 
                              (beat)
                        I can’t move ‘em, cause if I get 
                        caught, I can’t protect guys like 
                        you. Know what happens if you get 
                        caught? A slap on the wrist, and a 
                        week’s suspension. So you can 
                        continue this holier-than-thou 
                        bullshit, or you can play ball.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        This a part of being in the family?

           Smither looks at him with a frosty expression. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        I’ll meet you in the parking lot 
                        tomorrow morning, hand off the 
                        phones and explain the logistics-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I’m not doing it, sir.
                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Then good luck paying the bills 
                        while you’re suspended, under 
                        active investigation, and good 
                        fucking luck passing the bar with a 
                        felony conviction for assault! 

           Victor and Smither stare at each other.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        You want to pay off hospital bills? 
                        Go to school? Make something of 
                        yourself that Henry can be proud 
                        of? Then get started. Not that you 
                        have a choice, but it might help to 
                        tell yourself you do. 

           Victor stares at Smither

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Shut the door on your way out. 

           Smither returns to paperwork on his desk. Victor reluctantly 
           turns, and heads for the door. 

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Elias pulls clothes out of a washing machine, folding them 
           neatly. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks the main street of NORTEÑOS’ CAMP, picking 
           garbage from each bunk into a black plastic bag. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias scrubs the pathway with a wet mop.

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias has a collection of SHOPPING LISTS in his hands. 

           A NORTEÑO GANG MEMBER is slouched lazily on a bunk. Elias 
           grabs his list from him, looks it over. 

           INT. GYM, PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elias walks the pathway. Spectro crosses out in front of him. 
                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Where you going?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Headed down to the commissary-

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Not now. Come here.

           INT. GYM, UTILITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Spectro hooks a BUNGEE CORD to a doorhandle to lock the door 
           shut from the inside. 

           He looks at the fidgeting Elias, realizes what he’s thinking. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        You think I’m a bugaron, man? We’re 
                        not fucking. We’re talking. 

           Spectro pulls on the cord, making sure it’s tight. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Listen up, cause I don’t wanna tell 
                        you twice. I got a deal set-up with 
                        an officer, who’s bringing in some 
                        stuff for me. You’ve been 
                        transferred to lunch duty in 
                        another section. Pig’s gonna give 
                        you gear during rounds, and you 
                        bring it back to the kitchen, where 
                        a negro called Jayceon’s receiving.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t really know how to-

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Ah, sorry I wasted your time. You 
                        can go back to cleaning now. 
                              (beat)
                        I set up your work transfer. You 
                        start tomorrow. 

           Spectro stands, wriggles the bungee to loosen it. He opens 
           the door, peeks out the sliver before he exits.

                                 WORK OFFICER (PRE-LAP)
                        Fill this out with your 
                        information...
           INT. WORK DETAIL OFFICE - DAY

           Elias stands at a counter, filling out a form, while a WORK 
           OFFICER puts together an ID BADGE in a plastic clasp case. 

                                 WORK OFFICER
                        You’ll need to wear this when you 
                        leave C Block. There’s a security 
                        checkpoint where you get it, then 
                        they’ll let you through. Any 
                        questions?

           Elias shakes his head. 

                                 WORK OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Says here you checked out a camera 
                        package. Where is it?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What do you mean?

                                 WORK OFFICER
                        You’ve been transferred, so you 
                        have to turn in your gear. 

           Elias opens his mouth to answer. He hesitates, before:

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I lost it, sir...

                                 WORK OFFICER
                        You lost it?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It was in my bunk when I was 
                        showering. When I came back it 
                        wasn’t there, sir...

           The WORK OFFICER shakes his head. 

                                 WORK OFFICER
                        You gotta take better care of your 
                        gear, Hernandez. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It won’t happen again, sir. 

           INT. FRONT ENTRANCE OFFICE - DAY

           Victor takes out his keys and metallic items from his 
           pockets. He puts them in a PLASTIC BOWL, then passes through 
           a METAL DETECTOR, while a SUPERVISING C.O. looks through his 
           DUFFEL BAG behind a counter.  
           While Victor steps through the DETECTOR, the C.O. places a 
           SMALL BAG into Victor’s DUFFEL BAG, looking around to make 
           sure nobody has seen anything. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Elias, wearing his ID BADGE, works in the busy kitchen, 
           surrounded by INMATE KITCHEN WORKERS wearing hair caps. 

           He opens an industrial-sized can of FRUIT SALAD. He sloshes 
           out the liquid into smaller plastic buckets. 

           Across the room, a BLACK INMATE catches his glance, and gives 
           him an acknowledging nod. This is JAYCEON, 27. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias and a KITCHEN WORKER fill LUNCH TRAYS into a ROLLING 
           SERVING CART with a tambour slider.

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

           Elias waits with the SERVING CART behind a sally port. A C.O. 
           opens the gate. 

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The C.O. escorts Elias down the hallway outside of the AD-SEG 
           AREA. An AD-SEG C.O. meets them halfway through the hallway. 

                                 AD-SEG C.O. 
                        I got it, Gary.  

           The AD-SEG C.O. flanks Elias and the CART down to the AD-SEG 
           SAFETY REMOTE OFFICE, where Victor waits inside. 

           The AD-SEG OFFICER leads the SERVING CART to a SAFETY DOOR, 
           which opens electronically: Behind the door, the AD-SEG CELLS 
           align both sides of the dark corridor. 

           Elias pushes the SERVING CART, but the OFFICER stops him. 

                                 AD-SEG C.O. (CONT’D)
                        Hold it there. 

           The AD-SEG OFFICER takes over, pushes the cart into the 
           restricted area. 

           Elias waits. He looks at Victor, who eyes him attentively 
           behind the bullet-proof glass. Elias gives him a polite nod. 
           INT. SAFETY REMOTE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Victor surveys Elias. Then he turns his attention to the 
           CONTROL PANEL, a slew of CCTV MONITORS in front of him.

           With a JOYSTICK, Victor turns one of the SURVEILLANCE 
           CAMERA’S VIEW down the opposite side of the AD-SEG HALLWAY. 

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The AD-SEG OFFICER rolls out the SERVING CART, now filled 
           with EMPTY TRAYS. 

                                 AD-SEG C.O. 
                        Let’s go. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER (O.S.)
                        I’ll lead him out, I’m gonna go 
                        grab a smoke in the parking lot. 

           Elias looks up. Victor leaves the REMOTE OFFICE, an OVERCOAT 
           and the BAG that Smither gave him in his hand. 

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elias rolls the SERVING CART forward, Victor by its side. 

           Victor looks up, sees the CAMERA that he panned. He checks 
           the hallway, as they pass under the CAMERA. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Stop. 

           Victor slides the CART DOOR open. He moves trays to the side, 
           then places the CELLPHONE BAG snugly into the cart’s corner. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        Anybody searches you, you don’t 
                        tell them anything. Got it?

           Elias nods. 

           INT. UTILITY ROOM, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside the kitchen’s utility room, Jayceon sits on a bucket, 
           zips the sack open, pulls out the CELLPHONES - BLOCKY 
           MOTOROLA INTERNATIONAL 3200’s - from the bag. 

                                 JAYCEON
                        Open up the rest of ‘em for me...
           Jayceon SNAPS the cover open, revealing a BAG OF POWDER where 
           the battery should be. Elias sees what he’s doing, helps him 
           open the rest of them, fishing out the BAGGIES. 

                                 JAYCEON (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, gimme the rest.

           Jayceon collects them, and the cellphones in a KITCHEN TOWEL, 
           that he places in a metal tray.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jayceon moves out of the space with the tray. 

           Elias exits too, looks around the large kitchen, ablaze with 
           work activity. Nobody noticed a goddamned thing. 

           INT. GYM - EVENING

           Elias moves down the path between the bunks. He finds 
           Spectro, engaged in discussion with another INMATE. 

           Spectro sees Elias, pats the INMATE on the shoulder to end 
           the conversation. He approaches Elias.

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        How’d it go?

           Elias nods, confirming the transactions gone through. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Shit, that’s pretty good.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I know what you’re doing.

           Spectro stares at him.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re moving drugs to the 
                        other side of the prison. I’ll do 
                        it, but I think it’s fair I get 
                        something out of it...

           Spectro looks at Elias, maybe even slightly impressed. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Sure, you’re doing a job. Why 
                        shouldn’t you get paid a little? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        How about a thousand dollars? 
           Spectro laughs. Elias doesn’t miss a beat: 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        500, then. I’ll still clean, I’ll 
                        do everything I already am. You can 
                        transfer the money to my account.  

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        It’s gonna take me awhile to get a 
                        feed to you, but you got my word.

           Elias extends his hand. Spectro shakes it with a laugh. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Federal drug trafficking, right? 

           Spectro lets go of his hand, ponders a moment. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what, I’ll do you one. You 
                        got someone looking at your case?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Why?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        I got legal counsel on retainer.

           INT. ACCOUNTS OFFICE - DAY

           Elias waits, as an ACCOUNTS C.O. prints out a receipt, hands 
           it to him. 

           Elias looks at the balance: 527.87 dollars.

           EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - DAWN

           Morning sunlight peaks through thick clouds, as Victor pulls 
           into the prison parking lot. 

           He steps out of his sedan, grabs his duffel bag from the 
           passenger seat. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMIHTER (O.S.)
                        Carrier!
           Victor looks over, sees Smither getting out of his FORD 
           LIFTED PICK-UP TRUCK. 

           Victor closes his car door, walks toward the prison entrance. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Carrier!

           Victor hesitates, then walks over to Smither, who’s smoking a 
           cigarette next to his truck. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        My shift hasn’t started yet, sir. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        That’s really funny, kid. 

           Smither fishes something out of his truck: An envelope, which 
           he hands to Victor. Victor looks inside, sees that it’s 
           filled with CRISP HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m fair. 

           Victor steps past him, chucks the envelope into the truck. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I applied for a transfer.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You’re just moving the whole family 
                        up the block to the next prison?

           Victor doesn’t answer.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Who do you think approves those 
                        transfers? You don’t think I talk 
                        to them? I decide what happens to 
                        you, Victor. 

           Smither looks at his watch.

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        Your shift just started. 

           Victor exits, heading up to the prison entrance. Smither 
           flicks his cigarette after him. 

           INT. COUNSEL OFFICE - DAY

           Elias sits behind a desk in the middle of an austere counsel 
           office. A C.O. watches him from the corner. 
           A female Hispanic lawyer, CAMILA LOPEZ, 31, steps inside. 

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ
                        Sorry, I’m late.

           She opens a BRIEFCASE and shuffles documents onto the desk. 

           As she does this, Elias steals a glance at her black skirt, 
           moving up to her beige blouse, which reveals a hint of 
           cleavage, and a gold pendant hanging around her neck. 

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you?

           Elias snaps out of it, but she’s addressing the C.O. in the 
           corner. 

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to discuss some matters 
                        with my client in private. 

           The C.O. nods curtly, steps out of the office. 

           Elias looks at her lean wrist, the bottom outline of a TATTOO 
           visible just below the cut of her blouse sleeve. 

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ (CONT’D)
                        How old are you?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ

           She SIGHS, then moves to the door.

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ
                        Come on.

           Elias walks over to her, confused. She pulls him close, still 
           looking out the window keeping a watch that nobody’s coming. 

           She UNTIES the string of his pants, slides a hand down his 
           boxers.  

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What are you doing?

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ
                        Santino didn’t tell you?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No, uhm...

           Elias scratches his head, not sure how to say it. 
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Uhm, I’ve never had...

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ
                        What?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        This is my... I’ve never... 

           She looks at Elias, realizes what he’s saying. 

                                 CAMILA LOPEZ
                        Then this shouldn’t take long.

           She dips her head down to Elias’ crotch. Elias takes a deep 
           breath, closes his eyes.

           INT. HALLWAY, COUNSEL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           A C.O. opens the door, and Camila, put together, steps out 
           without a word. Her heels CLICK as she exits down the hall. 

           The C.O. holds the door open for Elias. As he walks down the 
           hallway, he grins stupidly to himself.  

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks over to Hansen, who’s discussing something with 
           his FELLOW BROTHERS. One of them nods to Hansen, and he turns 
           to see Elias approach. 

                                 HANSEN
                        I thought I fucking told you not 
                        come around here no-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I can pay you what I owe. How do I 
                        transfer it to you?

           Hansen looks at Elias with surprise. 

           INT. ACCOUNTS OFFICE - DAY

           Elias stands by the ACCOUNTS COUNTER, looking down at his 
           balance: 2214.38 USD. 

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O. 
                        You send a request for the amount, 
                        which goes to the assistant warden. 
                        He approves it, based on what it’s 
                        for. What’s it for?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m sending some money to my uncle. 

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O. 
                        It’s a verified account?

           Elias nods.

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O. (CONT’D)
                        Then that should be fine. A portion 
                        of your transfer goes to the 
                        Arizona Crime Victims Commission, 
                        you know that right? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What do you mean?

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O. 
                        If you transfer out 200 dollars, 
                        some of it goes to your uncle, some 
                        of it goes to help pay reparations 
                        for victims of crimes in the state.  

           Elias thinks for a minute. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Is there something like that for 
                        New Mexico, sir?

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O.
                        Yes. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Then I’d like to make a deposit to 
                        that one too. Is that all right?

                                 ACCOUNTS C.O.
                        If that’s how you wanna spend your 
                        money. You wanna fill out a form?

           He hands Elias a form, which the boy looks over.

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           A) INT. AD-SEG HALLWAY - DAY: A SECURITY CAMERA pans to the 
           side. 

           BELOW: Close on the CONTRABAND BAG and Victor’s hand holding 
           it, as he moves down the hallway to the REMOTE OFFICE.

           B) INT. AD-SEG HALLWAY - DAY: Elias rolls the SERVING CART 
           forward, is let through a sally port by a C.O.
           C) INT. KITCHEN UTILITY ROOM - DAY: Elias and Jayceon CRACK 
           open the BATTERY COVERS, pull out the BAGGIES.  

           D) INT. ACCOUNTS OFFICE - DAY: CLOSE ON: A BALANCE RECEIPT 
           being printed out. 

           An ACCOUNTS C.O. hands Elias a copy of his balance. Elias 
           focuses on the digits: A cool 1500-and-pocket-change-dollars. 

           E) INT. C.O. CAFETERIA - DAY: Victor sits alone at a table, 
           eating lunch, while a crew of C.O.s, SGT. SMITHER among them, 
           sit at their own table. 

           Smither entertains: LAUGHS BOORISHLY at a joke he just made, 
           while the other C.O.s join in. 

           It’s not hard to read the disdain in Victor’s expression. 

           F) INT. THE GYM - DAY: Elias’ grasp is filled with COMMISSARY 
           GOODS. 

           He walks the NORTEÑO beat, handing out the appropriate 
           deliveries to each gang member. They thank him with pats on 
           the back, the generous of them with a handshake. 

           A CAMERA FLASH brings us to:

           G) EXT. YARD - DAY: The COMPLETE CREW OF NORTEÑOS, seen 
           through the viewfinder of Elias’ POLAROID CAMERA pose in a 
           group tableau.  

           Elias nods, confirming that he got the picture, and the MASS 
           of gang members splits up. 

           ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH, which brings us to:

           F) INT. GYM - DAY: An INMATE focuses on Elias, who stands in 
           front of a wall with his arms crossed, through the 
           viewfinder. 

           SNAP! The INMATE takes a picture of Elias. Elias takes back 
           the camera, pulls out the exposure. 

           We stay on it as it develops: A PORTRAIT of Elias.  

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ  (PRE-LAP)
                        Don’t inject too deep...

           END OF MONTAGE.
           INT. GYM UTILITY ROOM - EVENING

           Elias hovers over Spectro, who’s sitting down, his sleeve 
           rolled up as Elias handles a syringe clumsily. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Aw! The fuck you doing?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Why can’t you do it yourself?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        I fucking hate needles, man.

           Spectro looks away, biting his lip as Elias finds a vein. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Pull back on the plunger.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Like this?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        What don’t you get, man? I don’t 
                        wanna fucking look at it! Is it 
                        pulling red into the hypo? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yeah.

           Elias concentrates, presses the plunger. Spectro exhales, and 
           his body melts a tiny bit.

           He undoes the tourniquet around his arm, then looks at Elias 
           with wet eyes. 

           MOMENTS LATER:

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        The Sergeant’s bringing it all in, 
                        using the new pigs, so he don’t get 
                        his feet wet. 

           Spectro chews on a cigarette, his eyes still glassy. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        Big ugly dude with the skull 
                        tattooed on his dome? That 
                        motherfucker...

           Spectro takes a puff on his cigarette, while Elias processes 
           everything. 
                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        You can’t talk about what we’re 
                        doing with anyone. You know that 
                        right? I mean anyone, man... You’ll 
                        be the first to go, I’ll follow 
                        quickly after you. We don’t deal 
                        with the black cars, Farro doesn’t 
                        allow it. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Farro would...?

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Farro would take me out? In a 
                        heartbeat, yeah. Luis would, too. 
                        You don’t follow orders, you gotta 
                        go. 

           Spectro rolls the tip of his cigarette into the palm of his 
           hand, extinguishing it. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        I never see you buy any shit for 
                        yourself, man. How much money you 
                        have now?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t have that much.

           Elias shrugs. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Why, what happened to it?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I spent it all. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Spent it on what?

           Elias waves him off. Spectro grows serious. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                              (sternly)
                        I asked you a fucking question.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I sent it to victim reparations...

           It registers with Spectro, who LAUGHS mockingly to himself. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        You’re buying a clean conscience?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It’s not like that-

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        Fuck it, who am I to judge? Do 
                        whatever you want.
                              (beat)
                        But you gotta ask yourself who 
                        you’re doing it for. That money 
                        ain’t bringing her back, so my 
                        guess is you’re only doing it cause 
                        it makes you feel better.

           Elias clearly hasn’t thought of this. Meanwhile, Spectro 
           lights another cigarette. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        You wanna know why I don’t feel 
                        guilty about none of the things I 
                        done?

           Elias just stares at Spectro’s droopy, high eyes. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s cause I’m honest about the 
                        fact that I don’t give a fuck about 
                        nobody but me. You’ll get there 
                        too, sooner or later.
                              (beat)
                        Do up the gear again for me...

           INT. GYM, COMMON AREA - DAY

           Luis talks in hushed tones with TWO NORTEÑOS by a round 
           table. Elias sets down COFFEE MUGS in front of each man. 

           The NORTEÑOS speak Spanish: 

                                 NORTENO #1
                        How far southwest are we going? 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        Delano. As close to the border as 
                        we can get without starting a war. 

           Elias wipes the table clean with a dishcloth, listening 
           circumspectly. 

                                 NORTENO #2
                        You got word from Sinaloa?
                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        That’s all Miguel. I need to know 
                        what to do, who to talk to. 

                                 NORTENO #1
                        Any news on when’s he coming out of 
                        isolation?

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        Not anytime soon. He’s dead and 
                        buried. For now.

                                 NORTENO #2
                        We gotta figure something out 
                        before that connection expires. We 
                        don’t move down on it soon, we lose 
                        all that ground.

           The NORTEÑOS nod respectfully, then leave the table. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (O.S.)
                        I can get you in touch with him...

           Luis looks up. Elias switches to ENGLISH.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I can get messages to him. From 
                        him, too. 

           Luis stares intensely at Elias. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I move the food to ad-seg. I have 
                        the roster of meals, so I know what 
                        cell’s his... I can give him a 
                        message, let him know there’s a way 
                        to communicate with you.

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        Why would you do that?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Farro said I was one of you.

           Luis weighs the option. Doesn’t sound like a too dumb idea. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        What time you going on shift?

           INT. SECURITY HALLWAY - DAY

           Elias is frisked by a C.O. by the block exit point. They are 
           thorough, which makes Elias look nervous. 
           They finish, give Elias his ID BADGE and he continues on. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Back in the heated kitchen, the SUPERVISING COOK sees Elias 
           enter, walk through the kitchen. 

                                 SUPERVISING COOK
                        You’re late, Hernandez! Where you 
                        going?

           Elias continues on. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I gotta go to the bathroom, sir.  

                                 SUPERVISING COOK (O.S.)
                        Tell your ass to hurry its shit up!

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Elias sits on the toilet. He’s cringing, pulling something 
           out from between his ass cheeks. 

           MOMENTS LATER:

           A stream of water from the sink washes a CONDOM, while Elias 
           turns his gaze away, disgusted. 

           He dries the condom with toilet paper, rips it open and slips 
           out a KITE - a piece of paper folded tightly. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Jayceon opens the door to the utility room, and looks around 
           cautiously before he exits. 

           Elias’ head slips out, before he closes the door, remaining 
           inside the room. 

           INT. UTILITY ROOM, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Elias shuffles through the TRAYS, marked with numbers. He 
           finds the right one, sorting through the utensils and food: 
           Nothing. 

           But then his eye catches something. He sifts through mashed 
           potatoes. Sheathed in a plastic wrapper is another KITE. 
           He hesitates, but then unfolds it. Elias looks down at the 
           series of non-connected letters, forming a CRYPTIC PARAGRAPH. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks through the gym. He sees Luis, in conversation at 
           a table. 

           But he hesitates, and instead of going over, he walks the 
           opposite direction. 

           INT. ELIAS’ BUNK, GYM - DAY

           Elias lifts the mattress on his bed, fishing out his CAMERA. 
           He looks around, making sure nobody is watching him. 

           Then he lays out FARRO’S KITE on the bed. He focuses, takes a 
           picture of the note. He pulls out the exposure, looks at it. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks over to Luis, taps him on the shoulder. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Here...

           Elias hands Luis FARRO’S KITE, which he unfolds, looks over. 
           He pulls a notebook from his back pocket, writes a big 3 on 
           the top of the page, which Elias sees. 

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           The gym is dark, the rows of INMATES quiet, except for a few 
           LOUD SNORES. A LIGHT from a passing C.O. cuts through the 
           darkness, before a door closes and the light disappears.

           Elias points his own weak light into his mattress, as he 
           examines the POLAROID that he took of Farro’s kite. 

           He’s got a notebook, with the number 3 printed on the top of 
           the page, trying to decipher the code. 

           But then he shakes his head, giving up. He hides the PICTURE 
           in his copy of The Prince, on the shelf above his head. 
           INT. CHAPEL - DAY

           Victor stands in the back of the PRISON CHAPEL, prudently 
           packed with INMATES. Some listen intensely, others pass in 
           and out of sleep. 

           The PRISON CHAPLAIN recites a passage:

                                 PRISON CHAPLAIN
                        My son, if sinful men entice you, 
                        do not give in to them. If they 
                        say, “Come along with us; let’s lie 
                        in wait for innocent blood, let’s 
                        ambush some harmless soul; let’s 
                        swallow them alive; we will get all 
                        sorts of valuable things and fill 
                        our houses with plunder; cast lots 
                        with us; we will all share the 
                        loot”— my son, do not go along with 
                        them, do not set foot on their 
                        paths; for their feet rush into 
                        evil, they are swift to shed blood. 
                        How useless to spread a net where 
                        every bird can see it! These men 
                        lie in wait for their own blood; 
                        they ambush only themselves! Such 
                        are the paths of all who go after 
                        ill-gotten gain; it takes away the 
                        life of those who get it.

           Victor’s gaze drops. 

           INT. C.O. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Victor opens his locker. He pulls out the CONTRABAND BAG, 
           puts the strap over his shoulder. He lingers, and instead of 
           leaving, he squats down and opens the bag.

           He fishes out one of the CELLPHONES, and runs a finger over 
           the battery cover. He CRACKS it open, and fishes out the 
           BAGGIE filled with BROWN POWDER. 

           INT. C.O. OFFICE - DAY

           Montoya’s face is serious, as he stares at the TEN CELLPHONES 
           on the table in front of him. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Who else have you talked to about 
                        this?
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Nobody else.

           Victor scratches the back of his head. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        I thought I should go to the 
                        warden, he could get IDOC involved-

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Internal Affairs?

           Montoya exhales for emphasis. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do anything rash, Victor. 
                        Cause it’ll come back and bite you 
                        in the ass. You start snitching-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I’m not snitching-

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Lotta officers are gonna take it 
                        that way. How long you known about 
                        this?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Since this morning. 

           Montoya looks at Victor with a sceptical glance. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        I guess I knew something was up 
                        since the start. But I didn’t want 
                        it to be, so I didn’t check on it.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        That’s the way they’re gonna look 
                        at it, too. They’re gonna think 
                        something soured, and that’s why 
                        you’re coming to them now. They’ll 
                        take you down, just like everyone 
                        else involved.  

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        This is so fucked.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        So far, no damage done. 

           Montoya looks at the CELLPHONES. 
                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t tell anyone anything. 
                        Yet. Leave these here, I’ll take 
                        care of ‘em, get ‘em outta here. 
                        But I need some time to come up 
                        with a plan for how to handle the 
                        situation.

           Victor nods quickly, his hands on the back of his head. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Okay. Okay... Thanks...

           INT. AD-SEG HALLWAY - DAY

           Elias pushes the SERVING CART down the AD-SEG HALLWAY. He 
           reaches the REMOTE OFFICE, does a double-take when he sees a 
           NEW C.O. sitting inside. No sign of Victor. 

           MOMENTS LATER:

           The NEW C.O. pushes the SERVING CART out of AD-SEG. Elias 
           stays put, looking between the NEW C.O. and the REMOTE C.O. 
           behind the bullet-proof glass.  

                                 NEW C.O. 
                        What you looking at?

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Elias enters the kitchen. Across the room, Jayceon is washing 
           dishes. He sees Elias, walks over. 

                                 JAYCEON (PRE-LAP)
                        The fuck you mean you didn’t get 
                        anything?

           INT. UTILITY ROOM, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias and Jayceon look into the SERVING CART. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I told you, it was a new C.O. over 
                        there. He didn’t give me anything. 

           Jayceon SLAMS the SERVING CART door shut. 

                                 JAYCEON
                        Motherfucker! What’d Spectro say?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He didn’t say anything- 

                                 JAYCEON
                        You trying to pull a fast one on 
                        me, nigger?

           Jayceon peers at him angrily.

                                 JAYCEON (CONT’D)
                        You best figure this shit out real 
                        quick.

           Jayceon turns, exits through the door, SLAMMING it shut. 

           Elias massages his neck, where Jayceon grabbed him. He looks 
           at the door, which stays shut. 

           He turns to the SERVING CART, fishes out Farro’s tray and 
           sifts through the food, finding his KITE. 

           INT. GYM, COMMON AREA - DAY

           Spectro and Elias stand in the back of the gym’s common area. 
           They stand close, keeping the conversation down. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m just saying, I don’t know how 
                        you handle that deal. I’m not the 
                        one that talks to Smither. 

           Spectro’s nostrils flare. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        And what the fuck are you doing 
                        running kites to Farro, huh? 
                        Slipped your mind to tell me you’re 
                        doing work for Luis now?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It’s got nothing to do with this-

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ
                        You do something, you tell me!

           Spectro notices that INMATES are looking. 

                                 SANTINO “SPECTRO” MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell ‘em we’re bringing in 
                        double next time... 
           INT. C.O. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Victor puts on his uniform in the locker room, next to TWO 
           OTHER OFFICERS, who do the same. 

           Smither enters, spots Victor. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Jackson, Ryan, gimme a minute alone 
                        with Carrier.

           Victor looks over his shoulder, sees Smither, but doesn’t 
           acknowledge him. He continues buttoning his shirt. 

                                 C.O. RYAN (O.S.)
                        Just a second, boss-

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Now, Ryan. 

           Jackson and Ryan move out quickly.

           Smither moves close, hovers behind Victor. He pushes him into 
           the locker, and Victor hits his eyebrow into the edge of it. 
           He tries to resist, but Smither pins him against the locker. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Get off me!

           Smither pushes him into the wall, holding him by the chin. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        Where is it?

           Victor scrambles for his BATON, but Smither knocks his hand 
           away with ease. He grabs it, chucks it onto the floor. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Get the fuck off me!

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You gonna calm down?

           Slowly, Smither lets go of Victor. Victor pushes him away, 
           moves past him. He wipes his face, buttons his uniform. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER (CONT’D)
                        You best start following orders, 
                        Victor, or else-
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Or else what? I go to fucking 
                        Internal Affairs and have them 
                        handle this shit? I’m done. You get 
                        that? Done. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You’re starting problems that we 
                        can’t control right now. I don’t 
                        think you realize-

           Victor gets close into Smither’s face. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Fuck your problems. I’m done, so 
                        are you. I find out you’re still 
                        doing this, I’ll take you down. I 
                        don’t give a fuck if it means that 
                        I go out too. And I flushed your 
                        dope down the toilet. Consider it 
                        sunk cost, motherfucker. 

           Smither glares at him. Victor turns, leaves the office.

           INT. AD-SEG REMOTE OFFICE - DAY

           Elias taps his feet quickly, waiting outside the AD-SEG 
           SAFETY GATE.  

           The C.O. exits, hands the CART over to Elias, who looks at 
           him with an anticipatory glance. 

           INT. AD-SEG HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The C.O. walks next to Elias. Elias looks over at him, the 
           C.O. noticing. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        You know when Officer Carrier’s 
                        going to be back here?

                                 AD-SEG C.O. 
                        None of your concern, Hernandez.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Jayceon grabs Elias by the collar, shoves him into the shelf. 
                                 JAYCEON
                        Might been an accident first time, 
                        but now I know you’re pulling some 
                        shit, motherfucker.

           Jayceon GRABS a SHANK, pushes it up against Elias’ windpipe.

                                 JAYCEON (CONT’D)
                        You and your boy owe me a hundred 
                        K.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’ll talk to Spectro-

                                 JAYCEON
                        You finished talking, you about to 
                        do some doing. You have a week. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks down row after row after row, passing through 
           HORDES of INMATES. 

           INT. NORTEÑO CAMP, GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias, in the NORTEÑO CAMP, pats a NORTEÑO GANG MEMBER lying 
           on his bunk on the shoulder. They speak SPANISH:

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        You seen Santino?

           The GANG MEMBER shakes his head. Elias continues down the 
           tier.

                                 NORTENO GANG MEMBER (O.S.)
                        You gonna clean soon? It’s getting 
                        fucking gross-

           INT. SHOWER, GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias walks into the shower. Nothing, except NAKED INMATES. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Spectro? You seen him?

                                 INMATE (O.S.)
                        Get the fuck outta here, faggot!
           INT. GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias passes down the hallways, head turning from side to 
           side, while INMATES continue their lives uninterrupted. 

           Elias sees ANOTHER NORTENO GANG MEMBER waving him down. 

                                 NORTENO #1
                        Luis wants to see you. 

           INT. COMMON AREA, GYM - DAY

           Luis is sitting at a table, engaged in a heated debate with 
           other SENIOR NORTEÑOS. 

           The NORTENO GANG MEMBER and Elias walk up, stand on the 
           outskirts of the conversation. 

                                 NORTENO GANG MEMBER
                              (quietly, to Elias)
                        Spectro’s been dealing with the 
                        black cars. He’s gone into 
                        lockdown.

           Elias swallows, looks at Luis nervously as he continues to 
           talk to the SENIOR NORTEÑOS. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        The last thing we need is trouble 
                        with black cars.  

                                 SENIOR NORTENO
                        I’ll handle him, Luis...

           Luis stands, sees Elias.  

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        You got something for me?

           Elias walks over, hands Luis the KITE. 

                                 LUIS PADILLA (CONT’D)
                        You’re always hanging with Spectro. 
                        You know anything about this?

           Elias shakes his head calmly. Luis turns to the SENIOR 
           NORTEÑOS.

                                 LUIS PADILLA (CONT’D)
                        I want Spectro handled. Talk to 
                        your guys, take care of it. 
           INT. UTILITY ROOM, GYM - DAY

           Elias paces around the dark utility room. He grabs one of the 
           metal gate shelves and topples it over in anger, frustration. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Fuck!

           He sits down on the ground, while industrial cleaner seeps 
           out onto the floor between the mess next to him.

           INT. WORK DETAIL OFFICE - DAY

           Elias stands by the WORK DETAIL COUNTER. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I just want to be transferred to a 
                        different work detail. 

                                 WORK DETAIL OFFICER
                        You need to give a valid transfer 
                        reason, or you wont be able to 
                        apply for a different job-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Then I quit.

           EXT. YARD - DAY

           Elias sits to the side of the yard. He looks around nervously 
           at the faces of the CONVICTS. Nobody seems to notice him. 

           INT. SHOWER - DAY

           Water pelts Elias in the back of the neck, as he stands in 
           the steaming shower amongst other NAKED INMATES. 

           A BLACK INMATE, KERSHAW, 35, enters. He steps over to the 
           spot next to Elias, starts washing up. 

                                 KERSHAW
                        You think J can’t touch you, cause 
                        you’re back on your own block?

           Elias looks at him with wide eyes. Kershaw spits water out, 
           washing his closely cropped hair.

                                 KERSHAW (CONT’D)
                        You got five more days. Then I come 
                        to collect. 
           INT. NORTEÑO CAMP, GYM - DAY

           Elias, dressed, wet hair, walks the main street of the 
           NORTEÑO camp. 

           He reaches his bunk, where a NORTEÑO is setting up. Elias’ 
           stuff is thrown onto the floor next to it. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What are you doing? That’s my 
                        bunk... That’s my bunk. 

           The NORTEÑO looks past Elias, to Luis, who approaches.

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        You’re not working kitchen anymore, 
                        not passing any messages. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Luis, please? 

                                 LUIS PADILLA
                        You were Spectro’s boy. What use I 
                        got for you now? Take your things. 

           Elias sluggishly packs his stuff into his laundry bag. As he 
           picks up the copy of The Prince, one of the KITE PICTURES 
           falls from between the pages. It lands face-down, right in 
           front of Luis. Elias looks at it with wide eyes. 

           Luis glances at it. Then he turns, walks away. Elias moves 
           over, and stuffs it into his back pocket. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks the outside column of the gym, his hands filled 
           with his possessions. He makes his way to the NATIVE section.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        This bunk free?

           He points to an empty bunk. One of the NATIVES responds with 
           a tired shrug. 

           As Elias organizes his stuff, he looks to the side, where the 
           BLACK VILLAGE borders the NATIVES. 

           Kershaw stares back. He WHISPERS something to the BLACK GANG 
           MEMBER next to him, who looks at Elias, and then gives 
           Kershaw an understanding nod. 

           Elias avoids their stare, continues to stow away his effects.
           He peaks up as he hears COMMOTION from the gym entrance: 

           INT. GYM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The group of ARYAN BROTHERS hug Spring, whose face is covered 
           with cicatrices. He supports himself with a CANE. 

           Elias moves up to stand with a group of on-looking INMATES.

           Spring hugs Hansen. As he does so, he sees Elias behind them. 
           He smiles faintly, gives the kid a curt nod. 

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           Elias lies awake in the gym’s darkness. He stares at the 
           BLACK VILLAGE. A DARK SILHOUETTED FIGURE gets out of its 
           bunk, creeps toward Elias. Closer, closer.

           Elias jerks up in his bunk, prepared for the worst. But it’s 
           just a PASSING INMATE, headed to the bathroom. 

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Elias hides behind a book in the library, the KITES laid out 
           in front of him. He rips out a page from his notebook, 
           crumbling it up. His eyes fill with juvenile frustration.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (quietly)
                        Come on... Come on!

           He looks down at the FIRST KITE. Suddenly, his brow drops as 
           he realizes something. He shuffles onto the next kite, counts 
           the number of words in the first line:

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                              (quietly)
                        One, two, three, four...

           He circles every fourth letter, nodding as he writes out the 
           resulting sentences they form. 

           Onto the next KITE. He counts the number of words. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                              (quietly)
                        One, two...

           He circles every second letter, his pen now SCRIBBLING 
           cohesive sentences into his notebook. 
           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks toward the ARYAN CAMP. Hansen sees him approach, 
           immediately stands. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I need to talk to Spring...

           Hansen punches Elias in the gut as he tries to push past him. 
           Elias collapses. 

           Spring walks forward with slow steps. 

           INT. UTILITY ROOM, GYM - DAY

           Elias sits across from Spring and Hansen in the utility room, 
           the door shut, giving them privacy. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know what some of it means, 
                        but if you read it through-

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        I know exactly what it means.

           Spring reads Elias’ notebook. He turns to Hansen. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        They’re moving further south. 
                        Delano.

                                 HANSEN
                        Where they getting it from?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I heard Luis talk about Sinaloa.

           Elias points to the notebook. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        That’s their whole outside trade. I 
                        have the name of their contact and 
                        how to get in touch with them. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        That’s not in here?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        No. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        That’s the trade you want to make?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        It’s a valuable name to know. 

           Spring CHUCKLES. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Looks like we have a new prince on 
                        C Block...

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        “He that cannot obey, cannot 
                        command.”

           Spring looks at him with genuine surprise. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m not coming to you to save me, 
                        and I’m not expecting a hand out. 
                        This pays for itself. I want a 
                        guarantee you’ll keep me safe until 
                        I’m out of here. I want it to end. 

           Spring nods, looks to Hansen. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Talk to the black cars.

                                 HANSEN
                        Really?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Get their outside accounts, find 
                        someone to do the transfer. I’m not 
                        paying interest on it. They’ll get 
                        their money, but the clock stops 
                        now.

           Spring turns to Elias. 

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING (CONT’D)
                        I want that name. And I wanna know 
                        everything about the trade inside 
                        the prison, too. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Do I have your word on it?

                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        You have my word on it. 

           Spring extends a scarred hand, which Elias shakes firmly.
           EXT. C YARD - DAY

           Elias sits in the baking sunshine of the yard. He looks up at 
           the empty sky: Empty, no birds flying...

           INMATES file outside, including Kershaw. As he walks onto the 
           gravel he catches Elias’ glance, gives him a concluding nod. 

           FADE OUT. 

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. C YARD - DAY

           The ARYAN BROTHERS pose as a group, Spring standing proud in 
           the middle of the pack. 

           There’s a SNAP, as a CAMERA takes a picture.

           FADE OUT.

                                                            FROM BLACK:

           INT. MAIL - DAY

           Elias opens a piece of mail in his bunk, pulls out a form. He 
           reads it - at first confused, but then a smile spreads across 
           his face. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (PRE-LAP)
                        They’re transferring you? 

           INT. PHONES, GYM - DAY

           Elias holds the PHONE RECEIVER up to his ear. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m coming back to New Mexico. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        What does that mean? How long-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Three weeks. They’re moving me to a 
                        lower security facility, too.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I can’t believe it-

           There’s a LOUD CRASH on the other end of the PHONE.
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What was that, Mom?

           The RECEIVER CRACKS violently. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                              (worried)
                        Mom?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’m fine - God, damn it! - I just 
                        knocked over a pan... I got 
                        excited. 
                              (PHONE CRACKLES)
                        That’s the best news I’ve gotten in 
                        a long time, Elias. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I know. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ 
                        Do you mind if I come up there in a 
                        week still? I don’t think I can 
                        wait three weeks to see you. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yeah, I should be free.  

           He smiles. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m really looking forward to being 
                        closer to home, Mom. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias reads a book on his bunk, when Hansen walks up.  

                                 HANSEN
                        I need a spotter. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What do you mean?

                                 HANSEN
                        I’m exercising. I need someone to 
                        spot me. I’m going heavy. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Now?
                                 HANSEN
                        You can finish reading Louis 
                        L’Amour some other time. 

           EXT. YARD - DAY

           Hansen lifts a HEAVY BARBELL, Elias hovering over him, ready 
           to grab it. Hansen RE-RACKS the weight easily. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Do you even need my help? Looks 
                        like you’re doing fine on your-

                                 HANSEN
                        Hey, listen...

           Hansen ignores Elias, gestures for him to come closer. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Spring is in contact with Farro’s 
                        outside affiliates.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        That’s good, right?

                                 HANSEN
                        Could be. Could be really good. 

           Hansen changes his tone, speaking so softly it’s eerie. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re rolling with us now, right? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m not rolling with anyone.

                                 HANSEN
                        You’re not working with Luis or 
                        anyone else, at all?

           Elias shakes his head. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Good... So, since you’re rolling 
                        with us, you’re gonna work with us. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m keeping to myself, Hansen. 

                                 HANSEN
                        You don’t get benefits without 
                        doing work. 
           Hansen nods, thinking something over real well. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Spring wants you to take out Luis. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (laughs)
                        You’re joking...

                                 HANSEN
                        No. I’m not. 

           Hansen looks at him with expressionless eyes. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I can’t do that... I don’t 
                        understand, that wasn’t our deal? 

                                 HANSEN
                        We paid off your old debts, but you 
                        still gotta pay us for now, boy. 
                        You think any of that changed? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        But-

           Hansen shushes him, still speaking calmly.

                                 HANSEN
                        You ever kill anyone? I mean, where 
                        it wasn’t an accident? 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I never killed anyone...

                                 HANSEN
                        It’s not hard. You just gotta do it 
                        right. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I wanna talk to Spring. 

                                 HANSEN
                        He don’t have nothing to talk to 
                        you about. He’s the one told me to 
                        tell you this. 

           INT. CHOW HALL - DAY

           There’s a stir of INMATES in the busy CHOW HALL. 

           Hansen sits closely to a blank-faced Elias, at an empty 
           table. 
                                 HANSEN
                        They’re not expecting anything, 
                        cause they think the hit on Spring 
                        left us weak. But we’re stronger 
                        than we’ve ever been. Spring came 
                        back from the dead, that’s how 
                        strong we are. 

           Hansen takes a slurp from his water cup. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna hit Luis in the 
                        showers. He gets it for himself at 
                        quarter to four, so he’ll be alone. 
                        We’ll cause a distraction to draw 
                        away anyone guarding him. 

           Elias looks to the other side of the room, where the NORTENO 
           GROUP, including Luis, are eating their food. 

           Hansen continues to chow down hungrily beside Elias. 

                                 HANSEN (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        You mind I grab your cornbread? I’m 
                        hungry like a motherfucker today.

           EXT. YARD - DAY

           Elias walks next to Hansen on the outskirts of the yard. 

                                 HANSEN
                        That’s the most important part - 
                        surprised. He won’t see it coming, 
                        unless you freeze up when it 
                        matters. 

           He stops Elias. They stand across from one another. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You run in, and don’t slip on them 
                        tiles, or make any other stupid 
                        mistake, that fucks it all up. 

           Hansen points to his neck, then jabs a finger into Elias’ to 
           illustrate his next point:

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t cut into his neck. Cut’s 
                        superficial.

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You hit that motherfucker in there, 
                        and then you keep going, until 
                        there’s so much blood on the floor 
                        there ain’t none left in him. Until 
                        you drained that fucking spic.

           Hansen slaps an open hand into Elias right side, which makes 
           Elias jump with shock. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        If he’s blocking his neck with his 
                        hands, you hit him right here, in 
                        the liver. Ain’t no ribs, bones 
                        there to protect it. It’s all 
                        tissue, so it’s easy to pierce. 

           INT. VISITOR’S ROOM - DAY

           Elias’ leg taps like a speeding metronome.

           He looks around the thriftily filled VISITOR’S ROOM, where 
           FELLOW INMATES sit with loved ones. 

           Elias looks at the CLOCK above the entrance, craning his neck 
           out slightly to see if anyone’s on their way in. 

           INT. VISITOR’S ROOM - DAY

           The INMATE’S FAMILIES file out. Elias sits at the table, 
           looking over at a VISITATIONS C.O.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Where’s my visitor?

                                 VISITATIONS C.O. 
                        I don’t know what to tell you, 
                        Hernandez. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias is on the phone. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        They said I couldn’t come in 
                        because I wasn’t “appropriately 
                        dressed”...

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What were you wearing?
                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t cause of what I was 
                        wearing. Other visitors got to go 
                        in without any issues, while 
                        this... this fucking officer just 
                        stood there and laughed at me.

           She’s really upset, her voice shaking with anger. 

                                 MARRY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’m outside now. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        You’re outside now?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’m outside, and they won’t let me 
                        in. I took the trip, seven hours, 
                        and they won’t let me in now I’m so 
                        close...

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Change clothes, and-

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I tried that, but they said it was 
                        too late-

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (angrily)
                        So come in tomorrow, Mom!

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        They don’t open up until Monday, 
                        and I have to be back for work. 
                        You’re coming back to New Mexico in 
                        two weeks, Elias. I can see you 
                        then?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I really needed to see you, and you 
                        weren’t there. You were never 
                        fucking there!

           She doesn’t answer.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Mom?

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Yeah, I’m here... I mean, I’m 
                        “here”...
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said 
                        that. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        Elias, I promise I’ll come visit 
                        all the time when you’re back in 
                        New Mexico.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (quietly)
                        It’ll be too late... 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        What?

           Elias smiles weakly. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I said, “that sounds great”, Mom...

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        I’m here, Elias. On the other side. 
                        I wanted to see you, too. But I’m 
                        here. Just, please, for a second 
                        pretend that I’m there with you. 
                        Please? If I was there, what would 
                        we talk about? 

           Elias nods with closed eyes, playing along. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        If you were here... If you were 
                        here, I’d want you to know that if 
                        anything happens, I’m sorry. For a 
                        lot of things. For ending up in 
                        here. For what I did... And putting 
                        you through that.
                              (beat)
                        I love you, Mom. I know I haven’t 
                        said that after Dad. But I do, I 
                        really do. 

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        What’s going on, Elias?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I just really wanted to see you.

                                 MARY HERNANDEZ (V.O.)
                        But I’ll see you in New Mexico. 
                        Only two more weeks, right?
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Sure. 

           EXT. GYM, YARD - DAY

           Elias walks across the orange gravel, ominous storm clouds 
           building above his head. INMATES play HANDBALL against one of 
           the walls, while others do PUSH-UPS, or JOG around. 

           As Elias walks closer to the gym, he sees Victor, who is 
           walking the beat on yard patrol. 

           They catch each other’s eyes, but Elias quickly looks away, 
           continuing toward the gym.  

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Hansen sits next to Elias on his bunk, talking softly to him, 
           as Elias is keeled over. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I have to throw up.

           Hansen grabs Elias by the neck and turns his head toward him.

                                 HANSEN
                        We don’t have time for bullshit. 
                        We’ll be there to take care of you 
                        once it’s done. 

           Hansen looks around, then hands Elias a SHIV. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        Hide it. Back of your trunks. 
                        Here...

           Hansen hides the SHIV in the back of Elias’ pants. Elias 
           looks at him with wet eyes. 

                                 HANSEN (CONT’D)
                        You can do this.

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias walks down the side of the bunks with soft steps and a 
           dazed look on his face. 
           INT. GYM SHOWERS - CONTINUOUS

           He makes his way to the back of the gym, where the SHOWERS 
           are located. He lingers in the corner close by, the entrance 
           to the showers visible behind him.

           With his back turned, he fidgets with one of the PHONES that 
           hangs on the wall, pretending to make a call. 

           Behind him, Luis walks to the SHOWERS with TWO BODYGUARDS. 

           INT. GYM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Elias peeks around the corner, where he sees the BODYGUARDS 
           waiting by the shower entrance. He dips his head back again. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Fuck...

           He walks away from the entrance.

           Suddenly, a NORTEÑO jogs to the SHOWER ENTRANCE. Elias turns 
           his face away, but listens: 

                                 NORTENO
                              (in Spanish)
                        Ramon, Carlos! Some of the Brothers 
                        are starting some shit!

           One of the BODYGUARDS replies, but the NORTEÑO cuts him off. 

                                 NORTENO (CONT’D)
                        We need you, both of you! There’s a 
                        lot of them!

           The NORTEÑO runs back, and the TWO BODYGUARDS follow him. 

           Elias sees them leave, shivers with excitement and fear as he 
           walks back to the SHOWER ENTRANCE. 

           INT. SHOWER ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Elias’ head turns from side to side as he walks across the 
           bathroom section just outside the shower: Nobody there. 

           INT. SHOWERS, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elias prowls through the SHOWER HALLWAY, hugging the wall.

           Steam from the MAIN SHOWER ROOM spills into the hallway, 
           enshrining Elias in a translucent mist. 
           His feet hit into puddles as he moves forward. 

           Water drips from patches of moisture on the ceiling. 

           As he sneaks closer, he hears Luis HUM from the MAIN ROOM.

           Elias reaches the corner of the short hallway. He squats, 
           making himself as small as possible. Then he glimpses around 
           the corner, where he sees:

           INT. SHOWERS, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Luis, naked, washing his scalp, as he HUMS peacefully. Luis 
           turns toward Elias, rinsing off. 

           INT. SHOWERS, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elias dips his head back before Luis sees him. 

           Through tense breaths, Elias slowly dips his hand toward the 
           small of his back. The ELASTIC band of his pants SNAPS, as he 
           pulls out the SHIV.  

           Slowly, he stands to his full height, his eyes closed. He 
           takes DEEP BREATHS, opens his eyes.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Elias, clothes splashed with water, walks with rapid steps 
           down the side of the gym. 

           He passes the NORTENO CAMP BORDER, where Hansen and a GROUP 
           OF BROTHERS are engaged in confrontation with the NORTEÑOS. 

           Hansen sees Elias walking. He catches the boy’s glance, nods 
           to confirm. Elias looks away. 

           Hansen squints, unsure. He sees Elias speed up, and breaks 
           away from the confrontation, pursuing the boy. 

           INT. GYM, ARYAN BROTHERHOOD CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Elias jogs through the gym, looking over his shoulder. Behind 
           him, Hansen runs after him. 

                                 HANSEN (O.S.)
                        Yo, Tommy! Grab that fucker!
           Elias passes TOMMY, 30’s, resting in his bunk. Tommy looks 
           over his shoulder, sees Hansen coming toward them, and Elias 
           running away. 

           He jumps out of his bunk, joining the pursuit on Elias. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Elias pushes past INMATES, as Hansen and Tommy close in. 

           Ahead, the GYM DOOR stands open. Elias continues, pushing 
           over an INMATE that’s in his way. 

           EXT. GYM - DAY

           Elias runs into the yard, slowing his gait immediately. He 
           looks up at the towers, around to make sure none of the C.O.s 
           have been alarmed. 

           Elias walks with determined steps toward Victor, who’s 
           standing in the corner closest to the gym.

           Behind him, Hansen and Tommy exit the gym. They look up at 
           the GUARD TOWERS, then to Elias. 

                                 HANSEN
                        Shit!

           EXT. GYM YARD, CORNER - CONTINUOUS

           Elias walks toward Victor. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        You need to help me. 

           Elias comes closer, a little to quickly, still skimming up at 
           the GUARD TOWERS to make sure they’re not alarmed. 

           Victor instinctively grabs for his SpiderAlert transponder. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        Please, please, please!

           Elias holds out his empty hands. Victor hesitates. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know what you got me 
                        into. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
                        I know the sergeant made you, cause 
                        Spectro told me, I know you were 
                        forced into it, cause I was too, 
                        but you gotta help me out of it. 
                        Please. Help me. 

           Victor sees the pleading look on Elias’ face. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Elias sits in the interrogation room, a CUP OF COFFEE in 
           front of him. Victor rests in a chair next to him. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                              (softly)
                        Your name’s Carrier, right?

           Elias looks at him with tired eyes.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Yeah.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m Elias...

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Victor. 

           The DOOR OPENS, and Montoya steps inside the room. He looks 
           between Elias and Victor, shakes his head with exacerbation. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        You need to hear him out, Montoya.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (PRE-LAP)
                        I gave you a very clear instruction 
                        to not do anything stupid.

           INT. OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Montoya stands across from Victor, outside the interrogation 
           room.  

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        His problems ain’t ours-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Why else are we here?

           Montoya takes a moment, sizing up Victor. 
                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        So what do you wanna do?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I want to go to the warden. 
                        Combined with what he has to tell 
                        us, I’ve got a strong case 
                        indicating a network of narcotics 
                        conspiracy involving prison staff-  

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Including you. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I’ll corroborate everything he 
                        says. It’s the right thing to do...

           Montoya wipes his chin, thinking it over. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Let me talk to my guy with IA-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        You promised me you’d find a way to 
                        solve this already-

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        This changes things. I’ll talk to 
                        him tomorrow morning, off the 
                        record. I’ll ask him how you get 
                        immunity. And how to help him. Just 
                        gimme until tomorrow. 

           Montoya waves a finger at the door, indicating Elias.

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        He’s safe now, okay? That’s what 
                        matters. Now it’s about covering 
                        your ass.   

           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - DAY

           Victor and Montoya escort a shackled Elias down the HALLWAY 
           of PROTECTIVE CUSTODY. 

           They make their way to a cell door, that gives an ELECTRONIC 
           BUZZ as it opens. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        What’s gonna happen to me?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        You’ll be all right. You’re safe.
           Montoya shakes his head. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                              (quietly)
                        You’re going up against some evil, 
                        evil people. The information you 
                        have is valuable to agencies who 
                        will do a lot to... accommodate you 
                        in exchange. And their protection, 
                        you can count on.

           Victor looks at Elias, who’s listening closely to all this. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll debrief on all the gang 
                        activity that you’ve been involved 
                        with. Before that, you need to talk 
                        to a lawyer, make sure you get 
                        something in return. Sentence 
                        reduction, or immunity. Depending 
                        on what happens, you may be put 
                        into Witness Protection. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        How about my mom?

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        She’ll be all right. Don’t worry 
                        about that now. Get some sleep. 

           Montoya nudges his head toward the open cell door. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Thank you. Thank you, Victor. 

           Victor nods gently in return. 

           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, CELL - CONTINUOUS

           The door closes behind Elias, and he walks to the corner of 
           the cell, where he crumbles.

           He leans his head back against the cement wall. Then he 
           CHUCKLES, relieved. Gradually, his CHUCKLE turns into a SOB 
           and he sits there weeping, letting it all out.

           EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - EVENING

           The red sun sets, washing the clouds in orange and pink. 
           Victor sits on the curb by the prison, lost in thought. 
           A SEDAN drives up through the parking lot. Victor sees it, 
           walks to meet it with his duffel bag. 

           Inside, his WIFE, HOLLY CARRIER, 23, smiles back at him. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        Hey, honey-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Could you pull over?

           Her face falls when she sees his serious expression. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        You all right? 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Just pull over, Holly. Please...

           She pulls the car over, puts it in park. Victor opens the 
           back door, fidgets with HENRY’S BABY SEAT. 

           He pulls the SLEEPING TODDLER out and holds him so close to 
           his chest. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (O.S.)
                        Victor? What are you doing?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I just needed to hold him for a 
                        second...

           Holly exits the car, and walks over to Victor.

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        Victor, you’re scaring me...

           He smells the top of Henry’s soft head, before he turns to 
           Holly, gathering the necessary courage. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I have something I have to tell 
                        you.

           EXT. PRISON - DAY

           The sun rises over the PRISON, striking onto the vast expanse 
           around it, sweeping it bright and clean. 
           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, CELL - DAY

           Elias is sound asleep in his cell, as the door BUZZES open. 
           Elias calmly wakes, sees Montoya standing in the doorway. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        You sleep all right?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I slept really well, actually...

           It’s true: Elias looks rested for the first time. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Victor opens his locker, and pulls his UNIFORM out of a 
           DUFFEL BAG, while the OTHER C.O.s do the same around him. 

           He looks over his shoulder, sees Smither approach. He ignores 
           him, continues prepping. Smither hovers behind him. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        We need to talk.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I don’t have anything to say to 
                        you. 

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        A little bird told me that you’re 
                        preparing to do something drastic, 
                        and I think if we talk about it-

           Victor looks surprised. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Who told you that?

                                 SGT. JASON SMITHER
                        You think anything happens in here 
                        I don’t know about?

           Victor rushes out of the locker room. 

           INT. AD-SEG CONTROL POST - SAME TIME

           Montoya escorts a SHACKLED ELIAS to the sally port leading 
           into AD-SEG. The CONTROL POST C.O. BUZZES the gate open. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Warden asked me to move you here, 
                        until we can transfer you out. 
           Montoya gives him a reassuring nod, and Elias continues into 
           AD-SEG. Montoya leads him to a CELL DOOR, which BUZZES open.

           Elias looks at him with a puzzled expression. 

           INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Victor stands inside the PC Control Room. 

                                 CONTROL C.O. 
                        It’s empty, ain’t nobody in there-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Where’s Hernandez?

                                 CONTROL C.O. 
                        He got moved.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Who moved him?

           The CONTROL C.O. shrugs, not sure. 

           INT. AD-SEG CELL - SAME TIME

           Elias stands inside the austere cell. There’s nothing there, 
           except new bedsheets on the single bunk. 

           As Elias moves past a break in the wall, he also moves past A 
           FIGURE, leaning against the cement in the corner.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (O.S.)
                        Hernandez...

           Elias turns and sees a smiling Farro standing in the corner. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        Long time no see. Sit down.

           INT. GYM - SAME TIME

           Victor scampers through the rows in the gym. He points at one 
           of the INMATES. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Where’s Hernandez’ bunk? Young guy?

           INT. AD-SEG CELL - SAME TIME

           Elias slowly descends onto the bunk. 
                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        You were the one running kites to 
                        Luis, right?

           Elias nods, while Farro moves to the chair by his slim desk, 
           across from the boy. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        I’ve learnt a lot of things about 
                        you this night.

           Elias doesn’t answer. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        Like how you were working with 
                        Spectro. Is that true?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Yes. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Did he threaten you?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        He said he’d hurt my mom.

           Farro shakes his head. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        I apologize about that. Spectro 
                        used to be an Azteca. Then he 
                        became a coward. In any case, you 
                        don’t have to worry about Spectro 
                        anymore.

           INT. GYM, ARYAN CAMP - SAME TIME

           Victor stands by Elias’ empty bunk. Hansen is drooped on his 
           bunk across the walkway.

                                 HANSEN
                        Man, I don’t fucking know where 
                        he’s at. 

           Victor looks to Spring, who approaches with his cane. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Where is he?

           Victor takes a step toward Spring, which triggers all the 
           BROTHERS to jump to attention. 
                                 JAMES LUTHER SPRING
                        Get out of here, Officer. For your 
                        own good. 

           INT. AD-SEG CELL - SAME TIME

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        But then you got greedy. Just like 
                        Spectro. You talked to Spring. 

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I had to-

           Farro holds up a hand.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Turns out Spring’s got a lot of 
                        pull with the C.O.s. He’s got a lot 
                        of pull outside, too. He suggested 
                        working together. Expanding with 
                        their help so that it would benefit 
                        us both.

           Elias foot TAPS into the ground, which Farro sees. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t mean to do it, but you 
                        helped everyone out. We can expand 
                        to places that we never could 
                        before without their help. As for 
                        old grudges, there’s a lot of 
                        things we can let go, when there’s 
                        money to be made. 

           Miguel CHUCKLES for just a beat, then his stare grows cold.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        But, in the interest of building a 
                        solid working relationship, Spring 
                        felt like he needed to disclose 
                        some things with me. You know what 
                        I’m talking about.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know-

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Nothing you say will save you, 
                        Elias. You know that I’m talking 
                        about Manuela. About my baby 
                        sister’s twelve-year-old, beautiful 
                        girl.  
           Miguel clears his throat. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        You left her there. Left her there 
                        alone to die in the middle of the 
                        road... You think she would have 
                        survived if you’d have stopped? 
                        Called an ambulance?

           A tear rolls down Elias’ cheek.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I don’t know.

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        You don’t know... 

           Miguel nods swiftly, forcing a wide smile as his eyes brim. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        Do you think about it?

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I can’t sleep when I’m alone, cause 
                        every time I do, it comes back...

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Stand up.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        Señor Farro, please-

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        Elias, nothing you say will save 
                        you. Stand up. 

           Miguel stands. Elias’ knees buckle under his weight. Miguel 
           takes a slow step toward Elias, holding out his empty hands. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        I forgive you.

                                 ELIAS HERNANDEZ
                        I’m sorry...

                                 MIGUEL FARRO
                        I forgive you.

           He pulls Elias into a hug. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        I forgive you.
           Elias SOBS into his shoulder, while Miguel comforts him. He 
           pulls away from Elias, staring into the boy’s eyes. 

                                 MIGUEL FARRO (CONT’D)
                        I forgive you, because God won’t 
                        for what you did. I forgive you so 
                        that I can let go of my pain. You 
                        understand?

           Elias nods, wipes his eyes. Farro smiles at him, taps him 
           fatherly on the side of the face with one hand.

           In one flash move, Farro SWIPES a SHIV across Elias’ throat. 
           It cuts a gushing, deep gash which sprays the white wall 
           behind Farro in a neat, maroon curve. Elias drops to the 
           ground. 

           Farro takes a seat on the chair, lights a cigarette, takes a 
           drag as he watches Elias bleed out on the ground by his feet. 

           INT. C.O. OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Victor RIPS open the door to Montoya and Smither’s office. 
           Montoya looks up from his paperwork. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Where’d you take him?

           Montoya sighs, closes up his paperwork. He stands. 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        Carrier, let it go-

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        You spoke to Smither? 

                                 C.O. JAVIER MONTOYA
                        You think you’re the only one who’s 
                        done some work? You shouldn’t have 
                        gotten everyone involved-

           The PRISON ALARM goes off, blares through the hallway outside 
           the office. Victor turns and runs out the office. 

           INT. AD-SEG HALLWAY - DAY

           A team of C.O.s, PARAMEDICS and POLICE OFFICERS stand outside 
           Farro’s cell. 

           A CORONER exits, pushing a GURNEY with a closed BODY BAG. 
           EXT. BACK ENTRANCE - EVENING

           A small circus: An AMBULANCE, SEVERAL POLICE CARS, with the 
           appropriate PERSONNEL surrounding them. 

           Victor talks with a POLICE OFFICER. He looks over to an 
           AMBULANCE, where Smither talks to ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Wait here for me, Officer?

           The BACK GATE opens. The CORONER pushes the gurney with 
           Elias’ body out into the courtyard, toward a CORONER’s CAR.

           Victor sees it being pushed into the CORONER’S VAN. 

           With quicks steps, Victor walks over to Smither and the COP 
           that he’s talking to. Neither of them see it coming, as 
           Victor SMACKS a FIST into Smither’s face. The sergeant 
           stumbles to the ground, shaken. 

           The COP jumps in, holds Victor off. Surrounding COPS and 
           C.O.s rush to assist. 

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - LATER

           Victor waits on a bench next to a COP, still handcuffed. 

           Down the hall, Smither and Montoya are escorted out of the 
           prison by A SET OF COPS each. 

           As they pass Victor, Montoya looks to the ground, while 
           Smither, bruised nose, stares daggers at him. They’re led out 
           of the door, toward POLICE CRUISERs that wait in a COURTYARD. 

                                 COP
                              (to Victor)
                        Let’s go. Move out. 

           FADE OUT. 

           TRANSITION: WATER beats on a glass surface, as we:

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. SHOWER, CARRIER HOME - DAY

           Victor scrubs his body inside his family shower cabin. He 
           turns off the water, and steps out. 

           He’s got an ANKLE MONITOR attached around his shin. 
           INT. RALPH’S - DAY

           Standing in the PAPER TOWEL SECTION of the busy supermarket, 
           Holly and Victor, his buzz grown out an inch, bicker over 
           toilet paper. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                              (hushed, irritable)
                        Cause we don’t have money to pay 
                        for it, Victor-

           Henry is attached to Holly’s chest in a BABY STRAP.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        We’re still good for a little bit- 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        No, we’re not. I looked over our 
                        accounts. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Holly, we’re fine-

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        Victor, don’t tell me we’re fine-

           Victor interrupts her, as he puts a roll of BOUNTY into the 
           cart. Holly immediately grabs it, puts it back on the shelf. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        I’d prefer not to spend money on 
                        things like name-brand kitchen 
                        towels if you’re going to jail.

           This shell-shocks Victor. Holly catches herself:

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that.

           Victor nods, looks into the ground, ashamed. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m sorry. Victor-

           She takes a step forward, Henry making a sound on her chest, 
           as she takes Victor’s face in her hands. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        Victor, I’m sorry. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I shouldn’t have gotten us into 
                        this...
                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        You did the right thing. I’m 
                        just... I’m scared about what’s 
                        gonna happen.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        I should have kept my mouth shut 
                        about everything. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        No, hey-

           He gets his attention, and he looks up. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good man. I wouldn’t be 
                        with you if you weren’t. 
                              (beat)
                        Just... Please get the store brand. 
                        We’ll figure everything out, but we 
                        gotta start shopping somewhere 
                        cheaper first... Okay?

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Okay.

           She gives Victor a kiss on the top of the head. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        I’ll go get in line. Can you grab 
                        diapers?

           INT. RALPH’S BABY SECTION - CONTINUOUS

           Victor walks down the BABY SUPPLY AISLE. He grabs a package 
           of DIAPERS, looks it over to make sure it’s the right one. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Which ones you looking for?

           Victor looks up, sees a LEAN MAN, 38, next to him. He’s 
           cleanly dressed, but is obviously a VETERAN - an ARMY TATTOO 
           on his FOREARM and worn combat boots on his feet. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Just looking. 

           Victor returns his attention to the diapers. 

                                 VETERAN
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude. I 
                        just had my first kid, not sure 
                        which ones to get.
           The VETERAN pulls a PACK OF DIAPERS off the shelf, looks at 
           the back of it.

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Sorry - We used to get those ones. 

           He points at the NAME BRAND DIAPERS on the shelf, which the 
           VETERAN picks up. 

                                 VETERAN
                        23.99 for diapers? He’s just 
                        shitting in them. 

           Victor laughs politely. The VETERAN shakes his head, still 
           looking at the PACK OF DIAPERS. 

                                 VETERAN (CONT’D)
                        My friend’s got six kids. I have no 
                        idea how he does it. 

           Something about that stops Victor’s laugh. 

           The VETERAN’s phone CHIMES in his pocket. He flips open the 
           CELL, checks a MESSAGE. 

           He puts the PHONE back in his pocket, grabs the PACK OF 
           DIAPERS. 

                                 VETERAN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the help, man. Don’t 
                        forget to stay on your kid’s six. 
                        You never what kind of trouble 
                        they’ll get into, right?  

           He passes Victor, continues around the aisle. 

           Victor quickly walks the opposite way, toward the STORE’S 
           COUNTERS - toward Holly and Henry. 

           INT. COUNTERS, RALPH’S - CONTINUOUS

           Holly is putting ITEMS onto the belt, when Victor walks up 
           with a PACK OF DIAPERS. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        What took you so long?

           Victor looks down the row of COUNTERS, the VETERAN nowhere in 
           sight. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (CONT’D)
                        Victor?
                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Just wanted to make sure I got the 
                        right kind.

           He turns to Holly, smiles at her. 

           EXT. RALPH’S, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Victor loads groceries into the trunk of their sedan, while 
           Holly struggles with Henry and the baby seat. 

           Victor sees TWO SHADY-LOOKING MEXICAN GUYS smoking 
           cigarettes, gazing at him from across the lot. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (O.S.)
                        You ready?

           Victor stares at them, still loading groceries, before the 
           MEXICANS get in a PICK-UP carrying A LAWN MOWER and GARDEN 
           UTILITIES, and exit the parking lot. 

           INT. VICTOR’S CAR - DAY

           Holly TALKS to Victor, who’s driving, but her VOICE is 
           drowned out. 

           He’s busy looking at his REARVIEW MIRROR: There’s a MENACING 
           BLACK SUV tailing them, the DRIVER obstructed by the glare 
           off the front windshield. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER
                        Watch out!

           Victor swerves the car to the left to avoid a car that’s 
           stopped ahead. 

                                 HOLLY CARRIER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Can you keep your eyes on the road, 
                        please? 

           Victor looks in the rearview, where the SUV pulls off to a 
           side road. 

           Henry WHIMPERS in the backseat. 

           INT. CARRIER HOME, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY

           Victor is holding Henry close to his chest. Holly cooks in 
           the couples cramped kitchen behind him. 
           EXT. CARRIER HOME - DUSK

           Victor walks the garbage bag to the curb, where he opens the 
           lid of a trash can and dumps it. 

           He wipes his hands on his pants, skimming a quick look at the 
           small, but tranquil houses in the desert suburban area. 

           Up the road, about fifty yards, is a CAR, no license plates, 
           at the curb with A GROUP OF GUYS inside. 

           He keeps his stare locked on the car, as he walks toward it. 

                                 VICTOR CARRIER
                        Can I help you?

           The CAR starts up, and SPEEDS past. THREE SCRUFFY MEN stare 
           at him as they pass. Was one of them the VETERAN from the 
           store? They’re gone so quickly it’s hard to tell. 

           Victor watches the car exit down the road, leaving the 
           neighborhood serene again. 

           He stands there, so fragile and alone, in the middle of the 
           street, looking down both sides of the road, as we:

           CUT TO BLACK.

                                                               THE END.
