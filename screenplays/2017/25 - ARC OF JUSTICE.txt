           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER ONE  “THE DOCTOR”

           A MAN’S VOICE is heard, measured and respectful.

                                 VOICE/SWEET
                        You see, I truly believe that, Mr. 
                        Beckworth, I believe a man is the 
                        sum total of the life he’s lived.

                                                       FADE FROM BLACK:

           INT. FIRST STATE BANK - DAY

           The polished wood and marble lobby of a bank.

           Seated behind a large desk, facing the camera, is a banker, 
           MR. BECKWORTH, 50s, upright and well-groomed in a tailored 
           suit.  The year is 1925.  But his expression is that of every 
           money-lender since the trade began:  pleasant and unreadable.

           The owner of the voice continues speaking from off-screen.

                                 VOICE/SWEET
                        If you look closely at my 
                        application, you will see that mine 
                        is a life forged in discipline and 
                        hard work.  Howard medical school.  
                        Overseas study in Austria and 
                        France.  Married the perfect woman; 
                        she too, a child of God who wishes 
                        only to live a proper Christian 
                        life...  Even after we lost our 
                        first child, she didn’t wallow.  Oh 
                        no sir, she held her head high as 
                        Christ himself would teach.

           Beckworth leans back in his chair.  But offers nothing.

                                 VOICE/SWEET
                             (a hint of desperation 
                              creeps in)
                        ...And this would not be a handout.  
                        Oh no sir.  I wouldn’t accept such 
                        a thing.  A man never asks for a 
                        handout -- charity -- he forges his 
                        own path -- rises on his merits and 
                        falls just the same.  And if you 
                        think about it, Mr. Beckworth -- 
                        Ralph -- if I can call you that?
           At this Beckworth looks up for the first time.  Making eye-
           contact with the owner of the voice behind the camera.

                                 BECKWORTH
                             (after a hesitation)
                        Certainly.

                                 VOICE/SWEET
                        Well, that’s because I’m not some 
                        stranger off the street.  You’ve 
                        known me...how long, ten years?  
                        Rent bills on the practice, medical 
                        supplies and such -- this bank’s 
                        been my home.  And I’ve never been 
                        late with a single payment -- no 
                        sir, not even once.  This loan 
                        would be repaid in that tradition.

           A beat passes, and Beckworth realizes the pitch is done.  He 
           regards the owner of the voice across his desk.  REVEAL:

           DOCTOR OSSIAN SWEET, 38, a handsome man in an expensive suit, 
           pince-nez glasses, and a neatly-trimmed mustache.  Everything 
           about the doctor reads distinction and respectability.

           Everything except one thing.  Doctor Ossian Sweet is black.

                                 BECKWORTH
                        It’s a solid application...

           Beckworth pages through a document as Sweet looks on.  
           Awaiting a verdict.  A sheen of sweat adorns his brow.

                                 BECKWORTH
                             (looks up at last)
                        Let’s talk terms.

           Sweet stares for a moment, stunned.  Elated.  Overwhelmed.

                                 SWEET
                        ...Okay then.

           CIRCUS MUSIC carries us to:

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - DAY

           Signs announce:  "MICHIGAN STATE FAIR 1925 - THE FUTURE NOW!”

           FOLKS in their Sunday best throng past carnival amusement 
           rides and open-sided tents with pens of blue ribbon heifers, 
           cages of exotic animals, an exhibition of gleaming Model-T 
           Fords and Chrysler Phaetons.  All the prides of Motor City.
           The scene is a snapshot of Detroit’s demographic breakdown.  
           WHITES and BLACKS stand in lines without ill will.  Just 
           FAMILIES of every shape and size out to enjoy the fair.

                                 GLADYS
                             (laughing)
                        Tell me you did not say that.

           FIND Sweet walking hand-in-hand with his wife, GLADYS, 30s, 
           almond skin, wry and strong-willed, with the self-possession 
           of a black woman raised in the comfort of the middle class.  
           Sweet pushes a stroller with their infant daughter, IVA.

                                 SWEET
                        Damn if I didn’t.  Woman, I pulled 
                        so many words out of my ass I 
                        thought Beckworth was gonna throw 
                        the money at me just to get me to 
                        shut up.  You should’ve seen it 
                        when I called him “Ralph.”

                                 GLADYS
                        You did not!

                                 SWEET
                        Hell, I’d’ve called him Babe Ruth 
                        if it meant we’d get that money.
                             (Gladys laughs)
                        It’s not enough, but it gets us 
                        closer.

                                 GLADYS
                        It’s really going to happen, isn’t 
                        it?

           Sweet looks at her, embracing the realization, smiles.

                                 SWEET
                        Yeah, I really think it is.

           They kiss.

                                 SWEET
                        I love you Gladys Sweet.

                                 GLADYS
                        I love you too Ossian Sweet.
                             (then)
                        Love you even more if you get me 
                        some of that cotton candy.

           She motions to a VENDOR with a tree of colored cotton candy.
                                 SWEET
                        As a doctor, I should frown upon 
                        that much sugar going into anyone’s 
                        body.  But since I’m going to be 
                        asking for a little of your candy 
                        later tonight...

                                 GLADYS
                        Ossian!

           Gladys playfully slaps his shoulder, blushing as she looks 
           around in hopes that no one overheard the innuendo.

                                 SWEET
                        What?  You’re my wife.  I’ll say it 
                        again...

                                 GLADYS
                        You do and the only sweetness 
                        you’ll be tasting is strained 
                        peaches out of Iva’s baby jar.

           Beat as Ossian considers this.

                                 SWEET
                        I’ll go get that cotton candy.

                                 GLADYS
                             (wearing a loving smile)
                        You do that.

           Sweet tips his hat to her and moves off.  As he does, several 
           BLACK FOLKS recognize and greet him:  “Hello, Dr. Sweet,” 
           “Afternoon, Dr. Sweet,” etcetera.  He acknowledges them all.

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - CARNIVAL GAMES - SAME

           A young black couple has been waylaid at the baseball-tossing 
           booth:  HENRY SWEET, late-20s, youthful and intense, 
           accompanied by WILAMAE DAY, 20’s, brassy and flirtatious.

           An ATTENDANT, 20s, white, hands Henry another ball.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You got two more balls.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Could give him ten more and he’s 
                        still not gonna knock them over.

           The attendant contains a laugh.  Henry notices.

                                 HENRY
                        You call that supporting your man?
                                 WILAMAE
                        I just call it as it is.  We 
                        already spent two dollars --

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Two fifty.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Two fifty on this damn game and you 
                        ain’t managed to knock down 
                        anything but the net that’s 
                        supposed to catch the ball.

           The attendant laughs out loud this time.  Henry glares.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        It’s her, not me.  She’s funny.

                                 HENRY
                             (winds up for his pitch)
                        Yeah, she’s a real Buster Keaton.

           He lets the ball go, knocking down one metal milk can.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Well, you got one.
                             (motions to a sign-board 
                              with the game rules)
                        Problem is you got to knock down 
                        three to get a prize.

                                 HENRY
                        I can read.

                                 WILAMAE
                        He just can’t aim.
                             (she drags him off)
                        C’mon.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Come back soon, I can use the 
                        money.

           Henry frowns as Wilamae leads him, arm-in-arm, past stalls 
           with other games and exhibitions of the “oddity” variety; 
           GIANT ALLIGATORS, MINIATURE PONIES, FAT PEOPLE, etc.

                                 WILAMAE
                        What you looking all mad for?  Just 
                        cause you strong as a bull don’t 
                        mean you ready to pitch in the 
                        negro leagues.
                                 HENRY
                        I put it on you.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Me?

                                 HENRY
                        All this Alaska talk.
                             (she looks away as they 
                              continue strolling)
                        I got a life planned for us.  And 
                        I’m willing to work hard -- earn 
                        the future you deserve.

                                 WILAMAE
                        You mean as long as it’s here?  In 
                        Detroit?  In Black Bottom?

           His expression betrays him.

                                 WILAMAE
                        There’s fences on that life, Henry.  
                        I don’t want fences on my life.  
                        And if you love me, you wouldn’t 
                        want that for me either.
                             (beat)
                        You’d come with me.

           This time Henry looks away.  Wilamae rolls her eyes.

                                 WILAMAE
                        But then again I guess it ain’t up 
                        to you, huh?

                                 HENRY
                        Wilamae --

                                 WILAMAE
                        What if I ask your brother for you?  
                        He’s who runs things, isn’t he?

                                 HENRY
                        It’s not that simple.

                                 WILAMAE
                        No?  You going to be a dentist 
                        cause you love teeth?
                             (then)
                        You don’t owe him a damn thing.

                                 HENRY
                        I do.  Not for him, I’d be running 
                        wild like our daddy did.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        He gave me a path and you mad cause 
                        I’m walking it?  Lot of ladies 
                        would appreciate a man like me.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Be with them then.

           She drops his arm and walks away.  He hustles after her.

                                 HENRY
                        No, no, no...  Let me think this 
                        through, okay?
                             (she regards him with 
                              uncertainty)
                        What about the cold?  Negroes are 
                        tropical people.  Them up there --

                                 WILAMAE
                        Eskimos.

                                 HENRY
                        Indians in fur coats if you ask me.  
                        What they know about colored folks?

                                 WILAMAE
                        Nothing.  That’s what’s so great.  
                        They don’t care.  All that matters 
                        is what’s on the inside of a 
                        person.  Henry, they got good jobs 
                        up there in canneries.  They’re 
                        even putting in a railroad.  It’s a 
                        place that’s beautiful beyond 
                        compare.  Where people work 
                        together instead of fighting over 
                        scraps.  I want to die in a place 
                        like that.  And no one...even 
                        someone I love is going to stop me.

           Henry looks at her, in love but torn.  Just then, two WHITE 
           BOYS, 9, careen past them toward a crowded EXHIBITION TENT.

           Henry and Wilamae exchange looks and approach the tent.

           INT./EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - EXHIBITION TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Wilamae press through a throng of bodies for a 
           view.  REVEAL:  A BARKER, 40s, white, in a safari costume.  
           He stands on a raised platform with a long chain in his fist.  
           The other end is fastened to the collar of a naked BLACK 
           WOMAN, 30s, with two BLACK INFANTS suckling her breasts.

                                 BARKER
                        From the jungles of Africa are 
                        savages unseen by civilization!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARKER (CONT'D)
                        Beasts untamed by the ways of 
                        modern man!

           Wilamae looks on in shock as WHITE ONLOOKERS gape and gawk at 
           the “savages.”  Henry notices the two white boys.  Pointing.  
           Giggling.  Henry glowers at them, simmering with rage.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Henry?

           Henry takes a step toward the white boys.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Henry!

           The FATHER, 40’s, spots Henry’s movement and reactively 
           corrals his boys, breaking the spell.  They hustle off.

           Wilamae grabs Henry by the arm.  He looks at her.  Then back 
           at the naked woman on the stage.  The sadness in her eyes.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Let’s move on.

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - PARKING LOT - DUSK

           PATRONS filter from the grounds, departing for the night.  
           FIND Henry and Wilamae nursing ice creams as they stroll.  In 
           silence.  Their levity supplanted now by something darker.

           NEARBY, Henry notices the two white boys and their father at 
           a car.  The father and Henry lock eyes for a moment...

                                 HENRY
                        You got something to say, 
                        peckerwood?

           Henry moves to the man with conviction.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Henry no!

                                 FATHER
                             (fearful, backpedaling)
                        Hey fella I --

           Before another word is out, Henry PUNCHES the man.  The blow 
           sends him reeling to the ground.  His two boys scream for 
           help as heads spin among the PASSERSBY.  The father scrambles 
           to his feet, inflamed, and leaps for Henry.  The fight is on.

           A pair of BLACK MEN notice and move in as a crowd of WHITE 
           MEN rush the scene.  Confusion.  Heated words exchanged.  
           Wilamae is screaming, scrambling for Henry, but nobody hears.  
           Shoves give way to blows.  A full-scale brawl erupting, and --

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - FERRIS WHEEL - SAME

           From a BASKET of the Ferris wheel, Gladys and Sweet observe 
           the sudden chaos down below.  Bodies scuffling like insects.  
           The shriek of a POLICE WHISTLE as POLICEMEN run to intervene.

                                 GLADYS
                        Ossian...is that Henry?

           Sweet spots his brother -- horrified -- and bolts out of the 
           basket just before it touches down.  He races off.

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Later now, and calm has been restored.  The white father and 
           his boys are giving statements to a pair of UNIFORMED POLICE, 
           as Sweet converses with a SENIOR OFFICER.  After a cordial 
           beat, the two shake hands and Sweet leads Henry off.

           Nearby, a ruffled Wilamae waits outside a polished four-door 
           BUICK.  Beside her in a chauffeur’s uniform is JOE MACK, 40s, 
           black.  Gladys sits with Iva in the back seat, the door open.

           Wilamae approaches Sweet and Henry as they step up, but Sweet 
           moves past her with a cold look, addressing Mack.

                                 SWEET
                        See she gets where she’s going.
                             (he walks up to the Buick 
                              and leans in, to Gladys)
                        I’ll see you at home.

                                 GLADYS
                             (stopping him; re: Henry)
                        He okay?

           Behind them, Wilamae dabs blood from a cut on Henry’s head.

                                 SWEET
                        At the moment, yes.  Once I get 
                        done with him’s another story.

                                 GLADYS
                        Go easy.

           Sweet meets her gaze and frowns.  They kiss.

                                 SWEET
                             (looks to Mack)
                        Drive safe.
                                 JOE MACK
                        Yes, sir.

           Mack helps Wilamae into the car, then gets behind the wheel.  
           Sweet moves past Henry without offering a look, only:

                                 SWEET
                        We’re walking.

           EXT. BLACK BOTTOM, DETROIT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The black part of town; a slum.  Half-paved roads crisscross 
           between rundown tenements and makeshift storefronts bustling 
           with BLACK MEN and WOMEN on their evening errands.

           FIND Sweet and Henry, strolling side-by-side.  Brothers with 
           the body language of a father and his son; Henry the latter.

                                 SWEET
                        It’s the girl, isn’t it?

                                 HENRY
                        She got nothing to do with this.

                                 SWEET
                        Then can you please explain to me 
                        why, every time I turn my head I 
                        see you complicating your life?

                                 HENRY
                        That ofay had it coming.

                                 SWEET
                        Oh?  He call you a name?  Slight 
                        you in some way?

                                 HENRY
                        I could see it in his eyes.

                                 SWEET
                        Ah you read minds now.  You wanna 
                        open up a booth there at the fair?
                             (then, off his look)
                        Henry, you have to see the forest, 
                        not fall prey to the trees.  If it 
                        wasn’t for that policeman knowing 
                        my stature in the community we’d be 
                        having this talk in the pokey.  
                        With your butt in a cell.

           Henry blushes underneath his brother’s gaze, shakes his head.
                                 HENRY
                        Not sure how you do it.  Smile when 
                        ain’t nothing funny.  Swallow the 
                        pill when you ain’t sick.  They 
                        look at us like animals.

                                 SWEET
                        Some...yes.  That’s why it’s on me 
                        not to act like one.  The only way 
                        they’ll ever see us for who we are 
                        is if we show them.

                                 HENRY
                        And how’s that gonna be?  They live 
                        in their world, we live in ours.

           Henry motions to the street, no white faces to be seen.

                                 SWEET
                        Not for long.
                             (Henry looks at him)
                        At least for us.

                                 HENRY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SWEET
                        I got the house.

           This stops Henry in his tracks.  Sweet is beaming.

                                 SWEET
                        That’s right.  Got the loan at the 
                        bank and called in some funds from 
                        overdue accounts.  Soon as we sign 
                        the papers it’s goodbye Black 
                        Bottom, hello Garland Avenue.

           Henry stares at Sweet in shock, floored by the news.

                                 HENRY
                        For real?  That’s...incredible.

                                 SWEET
                        That it is.  And once we’re there, 
                        I need you to grow a thicker skin.  
                        Now get your jaw off the floor and 
                        buy me a drink to celebrate.

           Laughing, Sweet drapes an arm over Henry’s shoulders and 
           leads him toward the smoky entrance of a JAZZ CLUB.
           INT. AUTOMAT RESTAURANT - DAY

           BLOOD splatters on a surface...  No, not blood.  Ink.  
           Dripping from a fountain pen onto a table.

                                 SWEET
                        Now look at the mess I’ve made.

           Sweet blots the nib.  He wears a dapper suit.  Gladys sits 
           beside him in a stylish dress.  Across the table is an older 
           couple, MR. and MRS. SMITH, 60s, white, in drab attire.

           Sweet unfolds his handkerchief to wipe the table.

                                 GLADYS
                        Honey, don’t...don’t wipe, you’ll 
                        make it worse.

           Gladys takes the handkerchief and gently daubs the spilt ink.  
           Sweet blushes.  Glancing to Mr. Smith for a connection.

                                 SWEET
                        Wives.  Something else aren’t they?

                                 MR. SMITH
                        That they are.

                                 GLADYS
                        There.

           Gladys smiles.  Pause.  The common ground has been exhausted.

                                 MR. SMITH
                        Well.

                                 GLADYS
                        We’ll have to have you two for 
                        supper once we’re settled.

           This brings an awkward fluster from the white folks.  Mrs. 
           Smith offers an unsure smile but her husband cuts her off:

                                                        MR. SMITH
                        MRS. SMITH
           That...that would be very --
                                              Did you bring the money?

           So much for small talk.  Smith looks at Sweet.  All business.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.  Of course.

           Sweet slides a small parcel across the table.  Smith unwraps 
           the butcher paper to reveal a stack of hundred dollar bills.

           He starts to count it.
                                 SWEET
                        It’s all there.

           Smith continues counting.  Gladys puts a calming hand onto 
           Sweet’s knee under the tabletop and gives a squeeze.  A beat.

                                 MR. SMITH
                             (looks up, smiles broadly)
                        So it is.

           Smith unfolds a LEGAL CONTRACT on the table in between them:  
           “DEED OF SALE OF HOME - 2905 GARLAND AVENUE.”  Sweet flicks 
           his fountain pen and signs his name in perfect script.

                                 MRS. SMITH
                        Garland is a quiet street made up 
                        of nice folks just like yourselves.  
                        I’m sure you’ll fit right in.

           INT. JUKE JOINT - BLACK BOTTOM - DAY

           The joint is jumping.  A crowd of young black men and women 
           dance and sweat it out to uptempo backwater jazz.

           Henry and two friends his age sit at the bar nursing drinks 
           and taking in the sights.  They are:  MORSE, 20s, intense and 
           cynical; and DAVIS, 20s, smooth as silk, the hustler type.

                                 MORSE
                        So I guess this is goodbye huh?

           Henry ignores the sarcasm and sips his drink, conflicted.

                                 DAVIS
                        Ain’t like that, Morse.  Henry here 
                        is going out to greener pastures.
                             (to Henry)
                        C’mon now brother, let us in on the 
                        word.  Your big time doctor brother 
                        think he too good for Black Bottom?

                                 HENRY
                        Ain’t no such a thing.

                                 MORSE
                        Better not be.  Much money I done 
                        gave that shiny nigger.

                                 HENRY
                        Man just want to live where he want 
                        to live.  That’s what America say 
                        it’s all about right?  Freedom.

           Davis and Morse exchange a look, then bust up laughing.
                                 MORSE
                        Man, who you think you talking to?  
                        That uppity moon-cricket think his 
                        shit smell sweet as sugar.

                                 HENRY
                             (losing patience)
                        Put a cap on it, nigger.

                                 MORSE
                        Oh now don’t go getting mad.  All I 
                        want to know is why a colored man 
                        that live better than any colored 
                        man I know want to leave a place 
                        that’s working for him.  What...he 
                        gonna be their doctor?  Help them?

                                 DAVIS
                        Now if he going out to be a spy and 
                        pluck a few off I can get with 
                        that.

                                 MORSE
                             (hoists a glass)
                        Damn right.  Tell all them crackers 
                        good to the motherfucking hell bye.

           Morse and Davis toast.  Henry glowers for a beat, then turns 
           his back to the duo, shifting focus to the entryway, where 
           Wilamae walks in.  She spots Henry but doesn’t move to him.

                                 DAVIS
                        Look like someone in the dog house.

           Henry downs the remainder of his drink for liquid courage and 
           walks over to Wilamae as she positions herself by the stage.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Best leave me be.  I’m looking for 
                        a new man, cause word on the street 
                        is my old one’s moving to a new 
                        neighborhood without telling me.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s not that way.  Ossian talked 
                        on it, but I had no idea ‘til 
                        yesterday that it was even real.

           Wilamae regards him coolly.

                                 WILAMAE
                        So much for Alaska then.  I guess 
                        we’re done.
                                 HENRY
                        I didn’t say that...

                                 WILAMAE
                        Let me guess:  you gonna invite me 
                        to move in, too?  Better run it by 
                        the doctor.  Ain’t no way he wants 
                        my common no-college ass up in that 
                        house...unless maybe I’m the maid.

                                 HENRY
                        Baby --

           She cuts him off with a look.  He means this though.

                                 HENRY
                        My heart belongs to you.

                                 WILAMAE
                        You know something, Henry Sweet?  I 
                        truly do believe you mean that.
                             (she leans in; lips close, 
                              grazing his)
                        But your behind belongs to him.

           She kisses him, leaving a lipstick trace.  Then walks away.

           INT. DUNBAR HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           A shirtless patient, WINTHROP, 40s, black, sits on the exam 
           table.  Sweet stands above him in a crisp, white lab coat, 
           using a stethoscope to measure Winthrop’s blood pressure.  A 
           NURSE, 30, black, stands with a clipboard to assist him.

                                 WINTHROP
                        Telling you, Doc, them white folks 
                        gone crazy.

                                 SWEET
                        Over a picture show?

                                 WINTHROP
                        You know the one.  With all them 
                        Kluxers riding in on horses?

                                 SWEET
                        Birth of a Nation.
                             (to Nurse)
                        One sixty over a hundred.
                             (to Winthrop)
                        If your piano playing duties are 
                        going to raise your blood pressure 
                        like this, you might want to find 
                        another way to make a living.
           Sweet unstraps the blood pressure cuff and moves around to 
           check on Winthrop’s lungs.

                                 WINTHROP
                        Doc Sweet, you should have heard 
                        them bastards when that Geechee got 
                        his self strung up.  You would’ve 
                        thought the Tigers won the pennant.

                                 SWEET
                        The power of cinema is strong, Mr. 
                        Winthrop.
                             (then)
                        Cough for me.

           He does.  Sweet listening on stethoscope.

                                 WINTHROP
                        You’d think all them crackers had a 
                        mandingo put some honeysuckle in 
                        their main slice.

                                 SWEET
                             (laughing)
                        Again.

           Winthrop coughs once more, shaking his head.

                                 WINTHROP
                        Whole damn picture show was tailor-
                        made to get them riled up at 
                        coloreds.  Like we ain’t got enough 
                        shit on us as it is.

                                 SWEET
                        Lord doesn’t put more on a man than 
                        he can carry.  It’s up to us to 
                        show our best selves to the world.

           Winthrop looks at Sweet.

                                 WINTHROP
                        That’s why you’re moving out there 
                        with them white folks?

           This question was unexpected.

                                 SWEET
                        I’m moving to Garland Avenue 
                        because my wife and I took fancy to 
                        a house and decided to purchase it.
                                 WINTHROP
                        Everybody talking about it.  Some 
                        say you think you’re better than 
                        regular colored.  Others say you 
                        got the right to be where you want.

                                 SWEET
                        And what do you say? 

                                 WINTHROP
                        Me?
                             (thinks)
                        I say Black Bottom’s bout to lose a 
                        real good doctor.

           Sweet smiles.

                                 SWEET
                        Thank you, Mr. Winthrop.

                                 WINTHROP
                        That said, I put two bucks on you 
                        not making it more than a week.

           HOLD on Sweet, taken aback.

           INT. CROWLEY’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           A sprawling retail mecca with signs advertising “EVERYTHING A 
           HOME REQUIRES.”  MIDDLE-CLASS CUSTOMERS (most female; all 
           white) browse the aisles, attended to by SHOP GIRLS.

           FIND Gladys, pushing Iva in her stroller, the only people 
           here of color.  They get no attention from the shop girls.

           QUICK CUTS of Gladys shopping:

           - She peruses draperies, running her hands over the lush, 
           expensive fabrics.  Touching silk against her cheek.

           - She peers in the door of a brand-new ELECTRIC REFRIGERATOR.

           - She holds a bowl of fine bone china to the light.

           - She flops down, giddy, on the mattress of an elaborate FOUR-
           POSTER BED.  She shuts her eyes, indulging in the fantasy.

                                 FLOOR MANAGER
                        Can I help you, madame?

           Gladys opens her eyes to see a domineering spinster of a 
           woman, the FLOOR MANAGER, 50s, eyeing her with irritation.

           Gladys meets her stare, undaunted.  Smiles.
                                 GLADYS
                        Yes.  I’d like to buy this, please.  
                        The whole set.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT - DAY

           Gladys strides out of the store, pushing Iva’s baby stroller 
           as she brandishes the sales slip:  “$1500 - PAID IN FULL.”

                                 GLADYS
                             (sotto, to herself)
                        Hell yes, you can help me.  You can 
                        kiss my rich Black ass, bitch.

           A SHOPPER overhears this, turns; but Gladys is already gone.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           A step up from the juke joint frequented by Henry and his 
           friends.  More dignified decor and older, well-heeled 
           clientele; these are the city’s black elite.  A BAND plays 
           ragtime for a lively dance floor.  Bathtub liquor flows.

           At a private table, Sweet and six friends smoke cigars.  They 
           all wear tailored suits, Masonic rings; professionals.  Among 
           them:  EDWARD CARTER, 40, blustery, is holding forth...

                                 CARTER
                        So let me get this straight.  You 
                        gonna take yourself and your whole 
                        family out there to live amongst 
                        them crackers with no cheese?  
                        Nigger must’ve lost your damn mind.

                                 SWEET
                        Please don’t refer to me by that 
                        word.

                                 CARTER
                        Can’t take it from me, but you’re 
                        gonna take it from them white folks 
                        on Garland Avenue?  Or you think 
                        they gonna call you “doctor.”

           Carter and the other men trade chuckles.  Sweet regards them.

                                 SWEET
                        You’re trying to tell me the same 
                        race that invented the aeroplane, 
                        the automobile, and virtually every 
                        aspect of civilized society are so 
                        blinded by hate that they won’t 
                        recognize a man of value just due 
                        to the color of his skin?
                                 ALL
                        Yes.

           Sweet rolls his eyes.

                                 CARTER
                        Sweet, is that black skin on you or 
                        cork?  You act like we don’t have a 
                        few hundred years of history to go 
                        on with the white man you glorify.
                             (then)
                        And quiet as it’s kept, they didn’t 
                        invent the world all by themselves.

           Murmurs of accordance from the others.

                                 SWEET
                        Firstly, I don’t glorify him, I 
                        respect him.  And if the colored 
                        man will ever have a chance to make 
                        his mark in this land he’s going to 
                        have to do it at their side.

                                 CARTER
                        Sure.  Arm in arm like brothers...  
                        To the promised land.

           This wins a hearty round of laughter from the group.  Sweet 
           fixes Carter with a stare and sips his drink.

           EXT. BLACK BOTTOM SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           The men trade drunken handshakes, saying their good-byes.

                                 VARIOUS
                        Good luck with the move, Doc./  
                        We’re praying for you.

           Carter and Sweet grip hands longer than they have to...

                                 CARTER
                        There’s a part of me that wants you 
                        to be right, you know.

                                 SWEET
                             (beat; he nods)
                        We’ll have y’all for supper when 
                        it’s done.

           They shake and Carter walks off.  Sweet’s Buick is parked at 
           the curb.  Joe Mack awaits in his uniform, holding the door.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Dr. Sweet.
           Sweet hesitates a beat as he watches the other men depart.

                                 SWEET
                        Joe, see to it for tomorrow this 
                        car is shiny as a buffalo nickel. 
                             (looks to Mack’s shoes)
                        And those shoes could use a polish.  
                        Don’t forget you are a 
                        representative of me.

           Sweet puffs his cigar and climbs into the car.  After a beat, 
           the smoke cloud dissipates.  Mack, stoic, shuts the door.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Yes, sir.

           EXT. BLACK BOTTOM ROW HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           Lights glow in the tiny windows of a railroad tenement.  The 
           smokestacks of an auto factory rise in the sky beyond.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM ROW HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A cramped room with a single bed, a bureau, and a bassinet 
           with Iva, fast asleep; for now.  Sweet is in his undershirt, 
           Gladys in her slip.  They lay in each others’ arms, her head 
           on his chest, speaking softly so as not to wake the baby.

                                 GLADYS
                        Just wait until my momma sees the 
                        kitchen...  And that porch swing.

                                 SWEET
                        Probably have to pry her out of it.

                                 GLADYS
                        And the lawn...  We need to get us 
                        one of them jockeys.

                                 SWEET
                        A black one, just so’s they don’t 
                        view us as too “uppity.” 

           Sweet and Gladys crack up, laughing.  A soft whimper comes 
           from the bassinet.  Gladys shushes Sweet to quiet him.

                                 GLADYS
                        You’re waking her.

                                 SWEET
                        Me?

                                 GLADYS
                        You laugh like a foghorn.
           Gladys cups his mouth.  A beat.  The baby returns to silence.  
           Gladys takes her hand away but Sweet stays quiet.  Pensive.

                                 GLADYS
                             (staring at him)
                        What?

                                 SWEET
                        Do you think this is a good idea?

                                 GLADYS
                        The move?

                                 SWEET
                        I mean...is it the right thing?  
                        Been hearing so much from so many I 
                        start to questioning my motives.

                                 GLADYS
                             (after a pause)
                        Well...this is America.  You have 
                        the right to live wherever you 
                        want.  We want this so --

                                 SWEET
                        “Right” don’t make it safe though.
                             (their eyes meet)
                        Am I putting my family in harm’s 
                        way just because I like a house?

           Gladys regards him.  Love in this.

                                 GLADYS
                        Once those folks see what kind of 
                        man you are, whatever ideas they 
                        have about the colored race will 
                        disappear.  They have never seen a 
                        man like you Doctor Ossian Sweet.

           A beat.  Then Sweet smiles, flirting.

                                 SWEET
                        Y’know right about now I think I’d 
                        like to see a little more of you.

           He kisses her, then slowly works his way down lower in 
           between her legs -- until the baby starts to cry.

           Sweet groans and Gladys bites her lip, exhales.

                                 GLADYS
                        ...So when do we move in?
           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER TWO  “THE HOUSE”

           EXT. DETROIT - ESTABLISHING - DAYBREAK

           Sunrise over Motor City.  Factory steam clouds dot the sky.

           EXT. BLACK BOTTOM ROW HOUSE - DAYBREAK

           Joe Mack polishes the Buick.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM ROW HOUSE - DAYBREAK

           QUICK CUTS of Sweet preparing for his day:

           - He shaves with a straight razor; neatly trims his mustache.

           - He buttons down his crisp, starched collar.  Fastening on a 
           pair of onyx CUFF-LINKS in the shape of a medical caduceus.

           - He regards himself in the mirror, clean-shaved and neatly 
           groomed.  A doctor of distinction.

           EXT. BLACK BOTTOM ROW HOUSE - DAY

           Mack waits beside the gleaming Buick, accompanied by three 
           HIRED HANDS, black, 40s, in workman’s coveralls:  MURRAY, 
           jovial, heavyset; LATTING, scrappy and high-strung; and 
           WASHINGTON, a barrel-chested mute with dip-stained teeth.

                                 HENRY
                        Morning Joe.

           Henry ambles up accompanied by Morse and Davis, all three 
           still dressed in last night’s rumpled suits -- and hangovers.

           Mack regards them up and down, disguising his contempt.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Mr. Henry.

                                 SWEET (O.S.)
                        You’re late.

           Sweet emerges from the row house.  Then stops, seeing Morse 
           and Davis.  He surveys them with disappointment, judgment.

                                 MORSE
                        Dr. Sweet.

                                 DAVIS
                        Sir.

                                 SWEET
                        Henry why are they here?
           Morse and Davis trade looks, not pleased but not surprised.  
           Henry hustles up to keep things from unraveling.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, I knew we needed a couple 
                        more hands so I asked them to help.

                                 SWEET
                        You should’ve consulted me first.

                                 MORSE
                             (chimes in, half-amused)
                        Why, we ain’t welcome?

           Sweet steps down the stoop to meet the men on even plane.

                                 SWEET
                             (regards them evenly)
                        You reek of gin and look like pimps 
                        in last night’s clothes, so no, 
                        welcome’s not the word that leaps 
                        to mind.  But it appears there’s 
                        little time to change that now.  
                        What can be changed, at least for 
                        the moment, are your dispositions.  
                        Once we arrive at Garland I expect 
                        your best demeanor.  No hard faces, 
                        smiles if possible.  As soon as the 
                        truck is unloaded, you can leave.  
                        I will pay you each five dollars 
                        for your time and effort.

           With that, Sweet casts a last stern look at Henry and 
           withdraws into the house.  Morse and Davis exchange stares.

                                 DAVIS
                        That nigger’s crazy.

           EXT. GARLAND AVENUE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A quiet street of spindly elms and modest wood-frame 
           dwellings, each with its own postage stamp front lawn. 

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - DAY

           FULL FRAME:  The house.  A quaint two-story brick bungalow 
           sits on a corner lot surrounded by a white picket fence.

           The street is empty.  Quiet.  Then:

           The chauffeured Buick pulls up to the curb, followed by a 
           MOVING TRUCK.  Mack gets out of the Buick first, opens the 
           rear door for the family:  Sweet and Gladys, holding Iva.
           They step up to the white fence, hand-in-hand, and take it 
           in.  Gladys looks at Sweet.  He looks at her.  They’re home.

           Behind them, Henry hops down from the moving truck.  The 
           hired men (Murray, Latting, Washington) climb out of the 
           back.  They stare up at the house, impressed.  Soft mutters 
           of “Damn” and “Shee-it.”  Washington, the big mute, whistles.

           Morse and Davis get out last, taking in the block, uneasy.

                                 DAVIS
                        Bet them crackers looking out the 
                        windows like the circus passing by.

                                 MORSE
                        Wish I had a rock for each of ‘em.

                                 SWEET
                             (shoots a quick glare)
                        You want that five spot you’ll put 
                        a cap on that sass.

           Morse and Davis look to Henry, then:

                                 BOTH
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - DAY

           Sweet and Gladys step into the vacant house.  It’s silent.  
           Lifeless.  Just the ghosts of missing furniture on walls.

           Gladys paces to the kitchen.  Sweet peers out a window at the 
           other houses on the street.  All quiet, no sign of life.

           There’s a clatter from the entryway, where Henry, Morse and 
           Davis enter with the hired men, lugging the four-poster bed.  
           They pause there, taking in the lofty space, impressed.

                                 ALL
                        Day-um.../  Oo-ee...

           Even Henry swells with pride, forgetting any tension.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s the biggest on the block.

                                 DAVIS
                        Maybe shoulda made myself a doctor 
                        too.

           Sweet and Gladys trade fast looks, on the same page.
                                 SWEET
                        All of you keep it down.  This 
                        isn’t Black Bottom.  Act like 
                        you’ve been somewhere.

           The hired men go mute, upbraided.

                                 GLADYS
                        And get those work-boots off my 
                        floors, y’all tracking dirt.

                                 ALL
                        Sorry, sir./  ’Scuse us, ma’am.

           Morse and Davis look to Henry.  Nearing an end of their rope.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY

           The hired men remove their work-boots on the porch as Morse 
           and Davis congregate with Henry, grumbling in hushed tones.

                                 DAVIS
                        What, he thinks white folk can hear 
                        through walls and cross the street?

                                 MORSE
                        Wasn’t for that five bucks I’d kick 
                        him square up in his tight ass.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright, alright, calm down.  Man’s 
                        got a lot of pressure on him --

                                 MORSE
                        Pressure he put on himself.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  Didn’t nobody twist the 
                        motherfucker’s arm to move...

                                 HENRY
                        Look, you’re both justified in your 
                        feelings.  My suggestion is we get 
                        this stuff unpacked then take those 
                        five spots and get blotto.

           Morse and Davis look at him, then smile in agreement.

                                 MORSE
                        Now the man be talking sense.

           With their shoes off, the men continue moving furniture in 
           just their stocking feet.
           Sweet exits past them onto the porch.  He unrolls something 
           from a pole:  a brand new AMERICAN FLAG.  He fits the pole 
           into a notch already cut into the porch and steps back to 
           admire it.  The flag flaps in the breeze.  Sweet beams.

           Across the street behind him, a FACE peers through a window.

           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           MARY HOUGHBERG, 30s, white, reserved, stands frozen at her 
           kitchen window.  Staring at the black folks moving in.

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        What’cha looking at mommy?

           Mary nearly jumps with a start.  JUNE, 6, stands behind her 
           in the doorway clutching to a tattered rag doll.

                                 MARY
                        Oh...nothing.  Go play with dolly.

           It’s too late.  June has already stepped up to the window.

                                 JUNE
                             (wide-eyed)
                        Those are colored people.

                                 MARY
                             (hesitates; uncharted 
                              territory in this)
                        Yes they are.

                                 JUNE
                        I wonder if they have any kids.

           The SOUND of a factory lunch bell carries us to:

           EXT. FORD ASSEMBLY PLANT - DAY

           A throng of WORKERS (all white) trudges from a sea of picnic 
           tables as the lunch hour ends.  Paper bags and half-eaten 
           sandwiches are tossed away as men head back to the line.  
           Amidst the crowd is MAC, 50’s, gaunt, walking with a limp.

           From an upstairs office window, a figure watches him:  ERIC 
           HOUGHBERG, 35, sturdy build, kind eyes, the junior foreman.

           In his hand he holds a PINK SLIP.  He seems torn.

                                 ERIC
                             (calling out)
                        Mac?

           As Mac looks up from below --
           INT. FORD ASSEMBLY PLANT - JUNIOR FOREMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mac now sits across the desk from Eric.  He’s been gut-
           punched.  Struggling to find the words...

                                 MAC
                        How...what do you mean, “let go?”

           Eric appears genuinely broken to be doing this.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m real sore about it too, Mac.

                                 MAC
                        I...I don’t understand.  Ain’t I 
                        been keeping up with quotas?

                                 ERIC
                        Thing is, I get it from upstairs.  
                        They don’t give me any choice here.

           Mac begins to weep.  Openly, right there in front of Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        Mac...c’mon now...  You know if I 
                        could do something --

                                 MAC
                        You are!

           Their eyes meet.  Eric, taken aback, just stares.

                                 MAC
                        ...You’re doing this.

           Mac walks out, leaving Eric dumbstruck.  A man divided.

           EXT. TROLLEY STOP, GARLAND AVENUE - LATE DAY

           A group of men in factory attire disembark a crowded trolley.  
           Among them, we find Eric.  He looks weary, just off shift.

           Some NEIGHBORS have paused ahead of him, blocking the way.

                                 ERIC
                        C’mon fellas, what’s the hitch?

           Eric pushes through to see what they’re all staring at:

           The corner bungalow across the street.  Lights on in the 
           windows.  Curtains drawn.  All we see are moving SILHOUETTES.  
           The Buick is still parked at the curb.  Gleaming, spotless.
                                 NEIGHBOR #1
                        What sort of nigger owns a Buick?

           INT. GARLAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLHOUSE - LATE DAY

           The auditorium is packed with FAMILIES (all white):  MEN just 
           off work in soot-stained coveralls, WIVES with CHILDREN on 
           their laps.  Several men in supervisor uniforms are riled:

           POLK, 40s, balding and unglued.  KOWALSKI, 50, with a sneer.

                                 KOWALSKI
                        ...Smith told me he was selling to 
                        a doctor.  Never said what color 
                        though.

                                 POLK
                        This can’t be legal, can it?  What 
                        happens to my mortgage if the 
                        values drop?  We’re already 
                        underwater as it is.

           He directs the question to a small thin man with cropped 
           white hair and an air of authority.  LEON BREINER, 60, level-
           headed, in a tailored vest, not coveralls; a bank teller.

                                 BREINER
                        Enough, enough, calm down.  We 
                        ain’t in the end times yet, Polk.

           Scattered chuckles buoy the mood.  He spots Eric entering.

                                 BREINER
                        Eric, thanks for coming.

           Folks turn and acknowledge him with nods.  Eric blushes.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry to barge in.

                                 BREINER
                        Not at all.  I take it you’re 
                        informed of our predicament?

                                 ERIC
                        Ran into Fitz.  Says Smith sold the 
                        bungalow to negroes?

                                 KOTKE
                             (chimes in)
                        Question is do you still got that 
                        Enfield from the army -- we may 
                        need it.
           Breiner winces.

                                 BREINER
                        Now then, weapons won’t be 
                        necessary.  What we have here is a 
                        misunderstanding, that’s all.  Our 
                        former neighbor Mr. Smith obviously 
                        took advantage of that colored 
                        family -- gouged them in the price, 
                        no doubt -- and told them this was 
                        a different kind of neighborhood 
                        than what it is.  When they find 
                        out we’re not their sort of people, 
                        I’m sure they’ll listen to reason.

           Breiner doffs his hat and tosses in a couple bills, adds:

                                 BREINER
                        ...Reason and the mighty dollar.

           He passes the hat into the crowd for a collection.  Women 
           scrounge coins from their purses; men toss dirty dollars from 
           their pockets, adding to the pot with all they can afford.

           When the basket reaches Eric, he hesitates a beat.  Folks 
           stare.  Eric shoves a hand into his pocket, rummages as if in 
           vain, and pulls out a small handful of coins to toss them in.

           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - ENTRY - LATE DAY

           Eric dumps the remaining contents of his pocket on a bureau 
           by the door:  a fold of bills.  Clearly he was holding out.

           He rounds a corner, entering:

           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           June is pressed up to the window glass, spying on the house 
           across the street.  Mary spots her from the stove, perturbed.

                                 MARY
                        June!  How many times have I told 
                        you to get away from there?

           She shoos June from the windowsill.

                                 JUNE
                        Did you meet the neighbors daddy?

                                 MARY
                             (losing it)
                        Get!

           June scurries off.  Eric looks at Mary.  She stares back.
                                 ERIC
                        I was at the schoolhouse.

                                 MARY
                        And?

                                 ERIC
                        Listening to Breiner and Kowalski 
                        talk you’d think their people came 
                        here on the Mayflower.

                                 MARY
                             (her eyes narrow; is he 
                              making light of this?)
                        We’re not talking about Catholics, 
                        Eric, this is different.

                                 ERIC
                        Is it?  Hell, my best friend in the 
                        service was a negro.  Stu Dorsey.  
                        Cook.  That man --

                                 MARY
                        ...Could make a peach cobbler that 
                        tasted just like home.  I know.  I 
                        have nothing against negroes.  I 
                        voted for Harding, remember?  You 
                        know how we Republicans are soft on 
                        race.
                             (then)
                        But June has a window by her bed.

           Eric meets her stare, torn.

                                 ERIC
                        I know.

                                 MARY
                        So what do we do?

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - TWILIGHT

           The keys of a PLAYER PIANO tinkle out a ragtime melody.

           Sweet, Gladys, Henry, Morse and Davis are eating at the 
           dining table.  There are no chairs for the hired men and 
           taciturn Joe Mack, who sit on boxes eating off their laps.

           Washington helps himself to seconds of the ham.

                                 GLADYS
                        Save some room for pie, now.
                                 LATTING
                        Don’t fret ma’am, Wash always got 
                        more room.  He nothing but room.

           The others laugh.

           Finished eating, Sweet leans back, lighting a cigar.

                                 MORSE
                        Doc Sweet, can I ask you a 
                        question?

                                 SWEET
                        You just did, son.

                                 MORSE
                        What happens when we go?  You think 
                        they gonna invite y’all for supper?  
                        Maybe bring a loaf of bread for 
                        housewarming?

                                 SWEET
                             (blows out a plume of 
                              smoke, then looks at him)
                        I think that tomorrow the sun will 
                        rise and what will be will be.  
                        Whatever that is, I will accept it.  
                        That, my young cynical friend, is 
                        the key to success in life.

                                 MORSE
                             (still not convinced)
                        Uh huh.

           Sweet rises from the table and approaches Henry, brooding in 
           an armchair nearby.  He pulls out a long cigar and offers it.

           Henry regards his brother and the cigar, uncertainly.

                                 HENRY
                        Guess you really made it huh?

                                 SWEET
                        We did.

           Sweet strikes a match to light Henry’s cigar.  Just then:

           A serving platter crashes to the floor and Gladys SCREAMS.  
           Heads spin to see her at the window, ducking out of view.

                                 GLADYS
                        Quiet!  Turn that off, turn it off!
           Gladys scrambles to the player piano and abruptly shuts it.  
           Silence.  Her eyes meet Sweet’s.  Without a word, he strides 
           up to the window, parting the curtains to look out:

           HIS POV - OUT THE WINDOW

           The street outside the house is filled with WHITE FOLK.  
           Hundreds.  Bodies move like apparitions in the twilight.  MEN 
           gathered in the street, WOMEN and CHILDREN on their porches.

           One of them spots Sweet in the window, and a hush falls.  
           Everybody stares.

           HOLD on Sweet, stunned for a beat...  As Henry, Morse, Davis, 
           and the hired men all join him at the window.

                                 WASHINGTON
                             (his first words)
                        Shit.

           Sweet snaps the curtains shut, collects himself.

                                 SWEET
                        Hold true.  This will pass.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

           The four-poster bed sits at the center of the room, unmade.  
           Gladys bursts in juggling Iva and a knitted baby blanket.  
           She sets them on the bed and swaddles Iva as Sweet enters.

                                 SWEET
                        Baby, it’s alright.  They’re just a 
                        bit stirred up is all.
                             (she’s not looking at him; 
                              her hands are trembling)
                        Hey.  Look at me.

           He stops her with a steady hand.  She looks up, glowering.

                                 GLADYS
                        Fix this, Ossian.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The other men crowd to the window as Sweet reenters.

                                 MURRAY
                        Must be hundreds of ‘em!

                                 SWEET
                        Stay away from there, you’re only 
                        taunting them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SWEET (CONT'D)
                        And hundreds is good.  It means 
                        they aren’t criminals, just folks.

                                 MORSE
                             (getting in Sweet’s face)
                        Folks who want to see us hanging 
                        from a tree.  Your white god gonna 
                        listen to your good sense then?

           Henry moves between them, squaring off on Morse.

                                 HENRY
                        Watch yourself nigger!  You got 
                        something to say you say it to me.

                                 DAVIS
                             (intercedes)
                        Easy now...them whites bout to kill 
                        us all, no need to do it for them.

           Davis separates the friends as Sweet regains composure.

                                 SWEET
                        Everybody keep your wits.  This is 
                        new for them, same as it is for us.

           EXT. GARLAND AVENUE - NIGHT

           NEIGHBORS crowd the street outside the bungalow.  All white.  
           Most of them are simply curious.  Ogling the windows for some 
           signs of exotic life.  Rumors pass by scuttlebutt:

                                 NEIGHBORS
                        Must be dozens of ‘em./  I heard 
                        the wife ain’t even colored.

           The occasional (anonymous) shout can be heard.

                                 NEIGHBORS
                        Get out!/  Go home, niggers!

           A POLICE SEDAN pulls up on the outskirts of the crowd.  A 
           plainclothes officer emerges:  BERT NORTON, 50, a cop who 
           came out of the womb already weary.  He takes in the scene.

                                 NORTON
                             (to himself)
                        Shit.

           TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS are posted on the sidewalk by the 
           bungalow to keep the peace.  They seem out of their league.

           Norton comes up, shoving through the crowd.
                                 NORTON
                        Alright, stand back.  Stand back!
                             (to Officers)
                        What are you two, lollygaggers?  
                        Keep these people off the sidewalk.  
                        We don’t need em starting anything.

                                 UNIFORM #1
                        This don’t look started to you, 
                        lieutenant?

           Norton shoots him a look, but he can’t argue.  Exhales.

                                 NORTON
                        Where’s Breiner?

           NEARBY

           A group is gathered at the rear of the crowd where Breiner is 
           rallying a group of local men, including Polk and Kowalski.

                                 BREINER
                        The language I’m speaking here is 
                        simple economics.  The value of our 
                        property goes down every day that 
                        they remain.  What’s next, our 
                        jobs?  You don’t see us moving down 
                        to Black Bottom to take what’s 
                        theirs.  Now who’s with me?
                             (spots Eric)
                        Eric?

           FIND Eric on the fringes of the gathering.  Conflicted.

                                 ERIC
                        ...I don’t know the man.

                                 POLK
                        You want to meet the jungle bunny?

                                 VARIOUS
                        Gotta go!/  Drive em out!

                                 NORTON
                        Don’t nobody go driving nothing!

           Heads turn as Norton pushes up.

                                 BREINER
                        Lieutenant.

           Norton tugs Breiner to the side, exasperated.
                                 NORTON
                        You told me a few men.  This is a 
                        carnival.

                                 BREINER
                        The people were inspired.

           A beat.  Norton turns back toward the bungalow to take it in.

                                 NORTON
                        They’re in there now?

                                 BREINER
                        Eight of em.  All men.  Sound like 
                        folks who ain’t expecting trouble?

           Norton digests this.

                                 NORTON
                        You got cash to buy the place?

           Breiner parts his jacket to reveal a BUNDLE OF CASH.  In his 
           waistband is a GUN.

                                 BREINER
                        The idea is to have him consider 
                        the errors of his decision.

           Norton glares at him, stern.

                                 NORTON
                        Keep these people back.  I’ll talk 
                        to them.

           Norton waits for a concurring nod from Breiner, then turns 
           and wades back through the crowd, heading for the bungalow.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           As Gladys descends from upstairs, Sweet intercepts her, 
           whispering so that the other men can’t hear.

                                 SWEET
                        Baby, you need to leave.  Get Iva, 
                        take her to your parents’ house.  
                        I’ll telephone you when it’s over.

                                 GLADYS
                        What?  No...I’m not leaving you.

                                 SWEET
                             (calls to Mack)
                        Joe, get the Buick.  You’re 
                        driving.
                                 JOE MACK
                        Nigger, I ain’t going out there.

                                 SWEET
                             (taken aback; firm)
                        You work for me.

           A beat.  Everyone is watching now.  Henry steps between them.

                                 HENRY
                        You want him to die for you too?

                                 SWEET
                        Stay out of this and keep your 
                        head.  Ain’t nobody dying here.

                                 MORSE
                        You right about that.

           Morse parts his jacket to reveal a HANDGUN in his waistband.

                                 SWEET
                             (stunned)
                        What is that?

                                 MORSE
                        Protection.

                                 DAVIS
                        Damn straight.

           Davis parts his coat too, revealing another GUN.  Sweet 
           stares at them, then back at Henry, apoplectic, spiraling.

                                 SWEET
                        You idiots...  I’m a doctor...

           Just then, A LOUD FIST POUNDS THE FRONT DOOR, startling them.  
           Heads turn.  The pounding comes again.  A muffled VOICE:

                                 NORTON (O.S.)
                             (from behind the door)
                        Mr. Sweet, this is the police.  I 
                        just want to talk.

                                 SWEET
                             (panicking; thinking fast)
                        Put those things away and keep your 
                        mouths shut.  Gimme that.

           He grabs Morse’s gun and shoves it into his own pocket.

                                 SWEET
                        Gladys, get upstairs.
           Sweet hurries to the door, then stops.  Collects himself.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The mood is tense.  The crowd has fallen to a hush.  All eyes 
           on Norton on the porch step with one hand resting on his gun.

           A beat, then a lock clicks.  Norton stiffens as the door 
           creaks open to reveal Sweet at the threshold, one hand in his 
           pocket; on the hidden gun.  Norton clocks it but keeps cool.

                                 NORTON
                        Mr. Sweet?

                                 SWEET
                        “Doctor.”

                                 NORTON
                        Want to take your hand out of your 
                        pocket, doctor?

           Sweet blushes, realizing now Norton’s seen the gun.

                                 SWEET
                        Forgive the precaution, officer.  I 
                        know there’s some tension about, 
                        but I’m sure in a few hours --

                                 NORTON
                             (cuts him off, harshly)
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 SWEET
                        I purchased this property.  I own 
                        it.

           Norton stares at him. 

                                 SWEET
                        Is it wrong to want to have a 
                        better life?

                                 NORTON
                        This look like that to you?

           Sweet looks out at the massive crowd.  Then back to Norton.

                                 SWEET
                             (faltering)
                        If we give it time --

                                 NORTON
                        For what?  Hell, it ain’t even that 
                        nice a neighborhood.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NORTON (CONT'D)
                        What kind of person leaves where 
                        they belong to put his kin into a 
                        bind like this?

           For the first time, Sweet is at a loss.  Then:

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        An American.

           Sweet turns as Henry steps up from behind him, stern.

                                 HENRY
                             (to Norton)
                        We’re not leaving.

           Henry shuts the door in Norton’s face.

           HOLD on Norton, as a murmur rises from the crowd behind him.  
           He looks back, seeing Breiner.  Then spots Eric.

                                 NORTON
                        Houghberg!

           Eric seems surprised to hear his name.  Norton approaches.

                                 NORTON
                        Your time in the war, you’ve seen 
                        hairy situations.  These yahoos 
                        haven’t.  This thing gets out of 
                        hand, do what you can.

           Norton pulls a spare PISTOL from his coat.  Eric balks 
           slightly at the sight of the gun.  Norton notices.

                                 NORTON
                        Okay?

                                 ERIC
                             (he takes the gun)
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sweet grabs Henry by the collar, furious.

                                 SWEET
                        What in hell is wrong with you?  
                        You trying to inflame them?

                                 DAVIS
                             (losing nerve)
                        He got a point, man.  Maybe we 
                        should leave.
           The hired men nod in accord.

                                 LATTING
                        I heard that.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Them crackers ain’t playing.

                                 HENRY
                        Nobody’s going anywhere.
                             (to Sweet)
                        This is your house.  You put us 
                        into this.  You want to run?

           The brothers are eye to eye.  After a long beat, Sweet nods.

                                 SWEET
                             (returning to himself)
                        We stay calm.  We give it time.  
                        This too shall --

           SMASH!  A BRICK CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, cutting him off.

           EXT. GARLAND AVENUE - NIGHT

           The crowd goes still at the SOUND of crashing glass.  Eyes 
           dart.  Unclear who among them threw the brick.  For a moment, 
           things are calm.  Eric knows better.  Grabs Mary by a wrist.

                                 ERIC
                        Take June inside now.
                             (Mary hesitates)
                        Go!

           A fusillade of stones fly past him, battering the bungalow.  
           Eric recoils at the sound as if from mortar fire.

           Some TEENAGE BOYS are chucking rocks across the street.

                                 NORTON
                             (shouting futilely)
                        No...  Stand down dammit!

           But it’s too late.  The floodgates open.  GROWN MEN in the 
           crowd shove past Norton, hurling rocks toward the bungalow.

                                 NEIGHBORS
                        Get ‘em out!/  Get the niggers!

           The teens rail on the picket fence with baseball bats.  A 
           CRIPPLED MAN joins in, smashing pickets with his crutch.  
           WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS join too, prying at the fence posts.

           It’s madness.  Chaos.
           And Eric is frozen in the middle of the melee.  Eyes wide.  
           Sweat glistening his brow.  Pulse racing faster...  As the 
           noise and chaos send him spiraling into a PTSD fugue state.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Broken glass rains from the windows as objects pelt the house 
           from every angle.  The hired men take cover.  Gladys screams.

           For a moment, Sweet stands motionless.  In shock.  Henry 
           reaches in his brother’s pocket, taking back the gun.

                                 HENRY
                             (to Morse and Davis)
                        Upstairs windows...let’s go!

           Henry takes off running up the stairs, followed by Morse and 
           Davis.  Sweet snaps out of his reverie.  Seeing them.

                                 SWEET
                        No...Henry, no!

           Sweet takes off bounding up the steps behind him.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Eric crouches in his fugue state, eyes wide but blank.  
           Shuddering at each harsh sound and movement all around him.  
           Through the frenzied crowd, he SEES Breiner and some other 
           men up on the porch steps, tugging at Sweet’s flagpole.

           It snaps in half and Eric HEARS it like a thunderclap.

                                 NORTON
                        Houghberg!

           Norton grabs him from behind and Eric spins back, gun 
           clenched, aiming right at Norton.  Norton stumbles backwards.

                                 NORTON
                        The hell is wrong with you?

           Norton races off, and just then:

                                 CHILD’S VOICE
                        Gun!

           A YOUNG BOY is pointing at the upstairs window of the 
           bungalow, where Henry has reached the window with his gun.

                                 HENRY
                             (shouting down)
                        Everybody get back!
           The mob panics.  Some scattering, some taking cover.  People 
           shove past Eric as he wavers, frozen like the eye of a storm.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME

           Sweet drags Henry from the window.  Henry shoves him back.  
           Iva is swaddled on the bed behind them, wailing loudly.

                                 SWEET
                        Put that thing down!

                                 HENRY
                        What kinda man are you?

                                 SWEET
                        A doctor!

                                 HENRY
                        Not to them!

           Henry motions to the window.

                                 SWEET
                        Get away from there --

                                 HENRY
                        Look at ‘em!

                                 SWEET
                        You’ll ruin everything!

                                 HENRY
                        You think that’s how they see you?

           Out the window, the vast crowd down below.  Sweet goes for 
           the gun, but Henry’s stronger.  They wrestle for the weapon.

                                 SWEET
                        Gimme it!

                                 HENRY
                        Open your eyes!

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - SAME

           The other men are crowded in the stairwell, listening, as 
           Gladys pushes past them.  Racing for the door, when:

           BANG!  A GUNSHOT rings out.  BANG!  Another.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - SAME

           As the second gunshot echoes, a flood-tide of humanity races 
           off in panic.  Mass exodus, screaming, fleeing to REVEAL:
           TWO BODIES fallen on the grass.  Breiner.  And Eric.  The 
           broken flagpole rests between them.  Fabric stained by blood.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - SAME

           Gladys rushes in to see Sweet and Henry at the window.  The 
           gun is on the floor between them, cylinder still smoking.

                                 GLADYS
                        What have you done?

           Sweet staggers to the window and stares out at the bodies 
           down below, in shock.  He shoves past Gladys, rushing out.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Sweet bursts out, stumbling down the porch steps to the 
           bodies.  Breiner is face down in a pool of blood.  Unmoving.  
           Beyond him, Eric is face up, bleeding profusely from a leg.

           Eric looks up weakly as Sweet kneels in, checking his vitals.

                                 SWEET
                        It’s okay...it’s gonna be okay.  
                        It’s only a flesh wound.

           Sweet quickly removes his belt, loops it as a tourniquet.  
           Other folks are crowding up now.  Norton shoves past them.

                                 NORTON
                        Stand back, police!

                                 SWEET
                        It’s okay, I’m a --

           WHAM!  Norton cuts Sweet off with one swing of his 
           nightstick, kayoing him as Gladys SCREAMS.  And:

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER THREE  “MR. WHITE”

           INT. FLATBED TRUCK, MOVING - DAY

           A jalopy rattles down a rural road.  Two men in front wear 
           canvas hoods with holes cut for the eyes:  KLANSMEN.  The one 
           not driving aims a pistol at a blindfolded PASSENGER in back.

           The passenger is WALTER WHITE, 33, thin, with dirty blonde 
           hair half-combed in a windblown part.  He wears a linen suit 
           and the wry expression of a man who thinks he’s seen it all.  
           But at the moment even White has tempered his aplomb, 
           swiveling his head to listen to the SOUNDS he can’t see 
           through the blindfold:  A baying dog...  A distant gunshot...

           The Klansman with the pistol shouts above the wind.

                                 KLANSMAN
                        First time in Alabama?

                                 WHITE
                             (finding his voice; droll)
                        Can you believe it?

           EXT. SWAMP - DAY

           The Klansmen prod White, still blindfolded, into a clearing.  
           A DOZEN KLANSMEN in full regalia step from the trees.  Some 
           carry rifles.  The handlers back away from White.  A beat.

           White reaches to lift his blindfold.

                                 GRAND WIZARD
                        Keep that on, if you don’t mind, 
                        Mr. White.  We prefer our privacy.
                             (then)
                        Cigarette?

           The GRAND WIZARD nods to one of the handlers, who offers 
           White a pack.  White feels for it, taking one, and lights it.

                                 WHITE
                             (inhales a puff; beat)
                        Not my brand.

           The Grand Wizard, not without a sense of humor, smiles.

                                 GRAND WIZARD
                        You’ve come a long way to be here.  
                        Which Yankee paper was it sent you?

                                 WHITE
                        New York Post.  But I’m no Yankee, 
                        sir.  I’m from Atlanta.

                                 GRAND WIZARD
                        That right...?  And they sent you 
                        back home to Dixie to write about 
                        our backwards ways, is that it?

                                 WHITE
                        No, sir.  As I told your men --
                                 GRAND WIZARD
                        Or maybe you’re here on behalf of 
                        that nigger Advancement 
                        Association.  The one sending all 
                        them Yankee niggers down here, 
                        putting notions in our own good 
                        niggers’ heads.

           White keeps his cool under the blindfold.  Beat.

                                 WHITE
                        Are you asking me if I’m a nigger?

           Chuckles from the hoods.

                                 WHITE
                        I’m a reporter.  My story is on law 
                        and order.  Up north crime is high.  
                        Especially among the immigrants and 
                        coloreds in the cities.  Down here 
                        on the other hand, you’re seeing 
                        record lows.  I’m here to find out 
                        why.  How it is you keep the peace?

           Grand Wizard stares.

                                 GRAND WIZARD
                        Boy’s in the right place then.

                                 WHITE
                        And where exactly is that?
                             (after a beat)
                        Mister...?

           It’s quiet.  Too quiet.

                                 WHITE
                        Hello?

           Silence.  White wavers, lifts his blindfold...  And he sees 
           he’s been left alone; the Klansmen are gone.  White turns 
           around to look for them, but stops short.  Seeing something:

           EIGHTEEN BLACK BODIES hang from the trees, flesh charred.  
           One of them is female.  Her womb split open.  A fetus hangs 
           from the umbilical cord.  Ropes creak in the breeze.

           White staggers.  Then stumbles to his knees and vomits.

           INT. GRAND HOTEL - MEN’S ROOM - DAY

           White splashes water on his face and stares at his reflection 
           in the mirror, still recovering.  Long beat.
                                 ATTENDANT
                        Towel, sir?

           A BLACK ATTENDANT holds a towel out.  White takes it.

                                 WHITE
                        Thank you.

           He wipes his face, then tips the man and exits.

           INT. GRAND HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           The lobby of a posh hotel.  White occupies a phone booth, on 
           the line with the door shut.  Even so, he’s whispering.

                                 WHITE
                             (into phone)
                        Klan runs rampant outside Mobile.  
                        Nineteen Negroes hanged from 
                        trees...  Yes, nineteen, the girl 
                        was pregnant...  Tell Johnson he’ll 
                        have my copy for the late edition.
                             (beat)
                        No, I’m fine...  Crackers thought I 
                        was one of them.
                             (beat)
                        I look good in white.

           A chuckle on the line.

                                 WHITE
                        Bye, now.

           White hooks the ear piece and hangs up, opening the booth to 
           exit.  A stocky BLACK MAN blocks the door, speaks quietly.

                                 BLACK MAN
                        You Mr. White?

                                 WHITE
                        Who are you?

                                 BLACK MAN
                        They know.

           The man walks off.  Leaving White completely ashen.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - LATE DAY

           A RAILROAD idles at the platform, belching smoke.

           White spots a POLICEMAN with a hound dog by the ticket 
           counter.  Avoiding both, he boards the train beneath a 
           hanging sign:  “THIS CAR FOR WHITES ONLY.”
           INT. TRAIN CAR - LATE DAY

           White takes a window seat towards the rear as the CONDUCTOR 
           moseys down the aisle, punching tickets.  White finds a 
           NEWSPAPER on the next seat and opens it, pretending to read.

           He notices his hands are shaking.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Ticket?

           White looks up from the paper.

                                 WHITE
                        Made it in a rush.  Mind if I buy 
                        one here?

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        That’ll be five.

           White nods as calmly as he can, takes out his wallet, and 
           counts out five dollar bills.  The Conductor writes a ticket.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Too bad, Mister.  You’re leaving 
                        town before the fun starts.
                             (leans in)
                        Some yaller nigger’s passing for a 
                        white man.  Boys are looking.  Time 
                        they done with him, he won’t pass 
                        for anything but black and blue.

           White stares for a beat, forgetting to breathe.

                                 WHITE
                        I hope they get him.

           The Conductor moves along.  White sinks behind his newspaper.  
           We notice a HEADLINE that he hasn’t seen yet.  He will soon:  
           “NEGRO DOCTOR ARRESTED FOR MURDER IN DETROIT.”

           INT. HARLEM TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           A well appointed townhouse abuzz with a gathering of Harlem 
           renaissance intellectuals, mainly black, but integrated.  
           White is regaling a small group including H.L. MENCKEN, 45, 
           white, acerbic, and several attractive WOMEN of both races.

                                 WHITE WOMAN
                        You must have been terrified!

                                 WHITE
                             (shrugs, flirting)
                        Been there before.
                                 MENCKEN
                        His asshole didn’t unclench ‘til he 
                        crossed the Mason-Dixon.

           Wincing laughter from the group.

                                 WHITE
                        H.L. Mencken, ladies and gentlemen.  
                        Thank you for the vivid picture.

           ZORA, 30s, black, shakes her head.

                                 ZORA
                        I don’t care if you are light as 
                        snow, if I was you I’d keep my 
                        Negro heinie here in Harlem.

                                 WHITE
                        You making me a proposition, Zora?

                                 ZORA
                        A proposal.

           On cue, a young musician (DUKE) hammers out the “Bridal 
           Chorus” on a nearby piano, segueing into a jazzy riff.

                                 WHITE
                        Say what you will about the 
                        Southern whites, at least they tell 
                        you what they’re really thinking.

                                 ZORA
                        Which is what, pray tell?

                                 MENCKEN
                        By an objective measure, very 
                        little.

                                 WHITE
                        That we’re beneath them.  That the 
                        black man is a taker, not a maker.

                                 DUKE
                        And his woman’s for the taking.

                                 ZORA
                        Let em try.

           Nods from the women.  A young man, 20s, (LANGSTON) chimes in.

                                 LANGSTON
                        So Garvey’s right then, we should 
                        all go back to Africa?
                                 WHITE
                        Not me, I burn too easily.

           This wins a laugh.

                                 WHITE
                        Tell me...Langston, what kind of 
                        men built Carnegie Hall?

                                 LANGSTON
                             (pause)
                        I’m a poet...  White men?

                                 WHITE
                        In your eyes, maybe.  Dirty Irish 
                        Catholic men.  Like Mencken here.

                                 MENCKEN
                        Technically, I’m German.

                                 WHITE
                        Which was just another nigger to 
                        the Puritans who got here first.  
                        And they were niggers to the 
                        English, who were niggers to the 
                        Romans, who were niggers to the 
                        Greeks...  And whoever came before 
                        that spoke in grunts and grumbles -- 
                        but you mark my words, they had 
                        their niggers, too.

                                 JOHNSON (O.S.)
                        So we’ll get ours, eventually?

           Heads turn at the arrival of JAMES WELDON JOHNSON, 54, 
           debonair, the soirée’s host, a poet, playwright, public 
           intellectual, and the executive secretary of the NAACP.

                                 MENCKEN
                             (lifts his cocktail; wry)
                        To progress.

           People clink their glasses.  Johnson, smiling at White.

                                 JOHNSON
                        And people ask me why I let you 
                        write my speeches.

           INT. HARLEM TOWNHOUSE - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

           SOUNDS of the soirée continue through the door, but this is 
           Johnson’s sanctum.  Wood-paneled walls are adorned with 
           framed news clippings and photos of his exploits:  shaking 
           hands with W.E.B. DuBois; visiting the White House.  
           One headline reads:  “JAMES WELDON JOHNSON NAMED FIRST NEGRO 
           SECRETARY OF NAACP.”

           Johnson is at his desk, perusing the contents of a folder 
           filled with newspaper cuttings on the case of Ossian Sweet.

           White is hovering, a manic energy.

                                 JOHNSON
                        What exactly am I looking at?

                                 WHITE
                        Our future, Mr. Johnson.  The trial 
                        that puts the National Association 
                        for the Advancement of Colored 
                        People on the map.

                                 JOHNSON
                             (skims the cuttings)
                        Negro doctor and his people kill 
                        one, wound another, both white...

                                 WHITE
                        Both laying siege to his hearth and 
                        home, along with hundreds more.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You’re saying what...we run an 
                        editorial?

                                 WHITE
                        We bankroll the case.  A legal 
                        action fund.  Backed by donations 
                        from our members.  And all along, 
                        I’m there following the trial -- in 
                        print, step by step -- putting our 
                        readers in the shoes of this man.  
                        Opening their eyes to his plight 
                        and our cause -- to progress.

           It’s quite a breathless pitch.  Johnson looks at him.

                                 JOHNSON
                        No.
                             (White reacts)
                        Our efforts should be focused on 
                        the South.  Negroes are dying --

                                 WHITE
                        And they aren’t in the north?  With 
                        race riots popping up in every 
                        city?  You think what’s happening 
                        in Alabama can’t happen in Chicago?  
                        Or St. Louis?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WHITE (CONT'D)
                        First it’s housing laws and 
                        neighborhood associations, next 
                        it’s courts and prisons -- one day 
                        fifty years from now, maybe we win 
                        the battle in the South but look up 
                        to find we lost the war.

           Johnson digests the speech.

                                 WHITE
                        You hired me because I know how to 
                        tell a story.  This is the one.

                                 JOHNSON
                        About a murderer...

                                 WHITE
                        A doctor.  Husband, father.  A man 
                        who pulled himself up by his boot-
                        strings, chasing a common dream.  
                        An American dream.  And now he 
                        stands staring at the gallows, 
                        because he dared defy the mob that 
                        showed up at his door.

           Johnson stares at White.  A pause.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You haven’t met him yet.

                                 WHITE
                        I’ve known him my entire life. 

           EXT. DETROIT - ESTABLISHING - DAYBREAK

           Buildings scrape the sky.  Smokestacks billow in the sunrise.

           A PASSENGER TRAIN chugs into the rail yard, approaching the 
           grand Beaux Arts facade of MICHIGAN CENTRAL STATION.

           INT. MICHIGAN CENTRAL STATION - DAY

           Sunlight beams from vaulted windows to a platform mobbed with 
           PASSENGERS and PORTERS.  FIND White amidst the throng.

           To all outward appearances a well-dressed white man, he takes 
           in the diversity around him like a stranger in a strange 
           land.  New arrivals wait to retrieve their baggage under 
           signs marked with the cities of their origin:

           White BUSINESSMEN, just in from Chicago; working class 
           ITALIANS and JEWS from New York; and the largest cohort, poor 
           SOUTHERN WHITES and BLACKS, just off the Jim Crow line from 
           Georgia.  They collect their bags from separate, equal piles.
           An old VENDOR, 60s, black, is hawking local papers with the 
           headline:  “RACE MURDER!  NEGRO DOCTOR TO STAND TRIAL.”

                                 WHITE
                        You think he did it?

                                 VENDOR
                        Finest paper in the town, sir...  
                        So it must be true.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - DAY

           UNIFORMED POLICE bustle up and down the steps of the imposing 
           jail.  White is keeping up with a young jail guard, DUNN, 
           20s, white, not a bad sort just limited.  Both on the move.

                                 DUNN
                        Those negroes are under special 
                        guard, Mister.  Reporters need to 
                        check in with the jailer and he 
                        ain’t in ‘til Monday.

                                 WHITE
                        Look...Dunn, is it?  I got me a 
                        boss, too, and he’s been breathing 
                        down my neck to wire a story by the 
                        late edition in Manhattan.

           Dunn pauses on the stairs. 

                                 DUNN
                        New York, Manhattan?

                                 WHITE
                        You been?

                                 DUNN
                        Got an aunt there.

                                 WHITE
                             (sees his opportunity)
                        Well she must read news...
                             (thinks fast, pulling out 
                              his steno pad, a pen)
                        Spell your full name for me...  See 
                        if I can’t get it in for auntie.

           OFF Dunn, a simple man, beguiled.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - VISITING CELL - DAY

           Sweet sits on a stool at a small table in a threadbare 
           uniform of prison stripes.  He hasn’t shaved.  Of the man we 
           know, only his posture remains.  Upright, ramrod straight.
           The door opens with a clang, revealing White.

                                 DUNN
                             (from the door)
                        Five minutes.

           White nods, steps in as Dunn shuts the door behind him.  
           Sweet regards White for a moment.  Just another white man.

                                 WHITE
                        Dr. Sweet.

           White extends a hand.  Sweet stares at him, not taking it.

                                 SWEET
                        How can I help you?

                                 WHITE
                        Actually, I’m the one who’s here to 
                        help you.  My name is Walter White 
                        and I’m a negro.  Yes, I’m aware my 
                        skin tone implies otherwise but my 
                        grandparents were of opposing 
                        races.  I live in Harlem, New York 
                        City, and I was sent here on behalf 
                        of Mr. James Weldon Johnson, 
                        executive secretary of the NAACP to 
                        cover your case for our paper.

           White produces a BUSINESS CARD and slides it to Sweet.

                                 SWEET
                        I didn’t ask for your help.

           The skepticism catches White off-guard.

                                 WHITE
                        You’re a brother.  And you need the 
                        support of your people.

                                 SWEET
                        I’ve already engaged a lawyer.  I 
                        require no other “support” so I 
                        suggest you concentrate your 
                        efforts elsewhere.  Many folks with 
                        far better stories to tell.

                                 WHITE
                        Perhaps I can meet him...your 
                        attorney?  Discuss strategy --

                                 SWEET
                             (cuts him off, harsh)
                        He’s fine, thank you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SWEET (CONT'D)
                        I pay him handsomely to not spend 
                        time with journalists.

                                 WHITE
                        As I said, I’m more than that.  I’m 
                        here to help.  This trial may drag 
                        on for some time, the attorney fees 
                        alone could be enormous.  Now 
                        there’s money to be had.  Donations 
                        from others of our race...

                                 SWEET
                        Our race is why I’m here.

           White looks at Sweet, flummoxed by him.

                                 SWEET
                        That’s all they saw of me.  Now 
                        it’s all that you see, too.

                                 WHITE
                        I see a colored man in need.

                                 SWEET
                        Not a doctor?  Not a man who’s 
                        dedicated his life to becoming the 
                        best possible version of himself?  
                        Only “a colored man in need.”

                                 WHITE
                        I’m not negating --

                                 SWEET
                        Don’t you see?  If your negro 
                        papers and negro readers just stay 
                        the hell away -- maybe, just maybe 
                        the people at the heart of this 
                        won’t see a negro any longer...  
                        They’ll see me.

           White regards him.

                                 WHITE
                        Which is what exactly?

                                 SWEET
                        Not a begging man, for one.  A hard 
                        worker.  A fellow worthy of respect 
                        and empathy.  And not a martyr.

                                 WHITE
                        I never said that.
                                 SWEET
                        Sure you did.  With your donations 
                        and support?  One big hosannah to 
                        the heavens that I’m here to be 
                        pitied.  Just another helpless, 
                        shiftless, two-bit nigger, like 
                        they always knew we were.

           For the first time, White is speechless.

                                 SWEET
                        Good day, Mr. White, but no thank 
                        you.  Good luck on your crusade.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - HOLDING CELL - DAY

           The other men (Morse and Davis, Latting, Murray, Washington, 
           and Joe Mack) sit about a cell.  Waiting for Sweet.

           Henry is brooding to the side.  The men are bickering.

                                 LATTING
                        Doctor says we were protecting 
                        ourselves -- that’s self-defense.

                                 DAVIS
                        They gotta see you as a self for 
                        that, nigga.  And the doctor is the 
                        reason we’re all in this mess.  A 
                        white man died.  Another lost his 
                        leg.   This was Mississippi we’d be 
                        swaying like wet willow whips.

                                 MURRAY
                        But it ain’t.  This is Detroit.

                                 MORSE
                        Yeah, they got the electric chair.

           This gives Latting and Murray pause.

                                 MURRAY
                             (fearfully realizing)
                        Electric chair?  Well they can’t 
                        put murder on all of us...can they?  
                        It wasn’t but two shots and there’s 
                        a damn sight more of us than two.

                                 MORSE
                        From the looks of your black ass I 
                        don’t see no mathematician.

           Morse and Davis laugh.
                                 JOE MACK
                        He right though.  Only one in here 
                        do know who shot them crackers.
                             (he looks at Henry)
                        Which one of y’all was it?

           Heads turn to Mack, who had been silent until now.  Henry 
           looks up for the first time, fierce.

                                 HENRY
                        Motherfucker, shut your mouth.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Just asking the question, Mr. 
                        Henry.  Why we all in here.

           Henry moves aggressively at Mack, but Morse restrains him.

                                 MORSE
                        Easy...

                                 HENRY
                             (staring daggers at Mack)
                        Always one coon in the group.  One 
                        who wanna lick the watermelon rind.

                                 MORSE
                             (to Mack)
                        That shot could’ve come from 
                        anywhere.  A ricochet.  What 
                        matters is we keep our mouths shut.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Why?  So seven fall for one man’s 
                        pride?

           This wins nods and “Mm-hm”s from the hired men.

                                 MURRAY
                        Truth.

                                 LATTING
                        Yeah, we just hired men...  Lord 
                        knows if’n the doctor ain’t selling 
                        us out right now to them police.

                                 HENRY
                        He wouldn’t do that.

           Morse and Davis trade looks.

                                 DAVIS
                        Last I looked you two wasn’t 
                        exactly thick as thieves.
                                 HENRY
                        I know my brother.  He’s not a rat.
                             (then)
                        He’ll get us out of here.

                                 MORSE
                        And if he don’t?

           The others stare at Henry.  The question lingers for a beat.

                                 JOE MACK
                        ...Then y’all best hope black 
                        heaven is a damn sight better than 
                        this white hell we living in.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - WOMEN’S BLOCK - DAY

           The women’s block.  Shrieks and howls echo.  Gladys, in 
           prison stripes, faces Sweet through the bars of her cell.

           A BURLY GUARD stands to the side, allowing them a moment.

                                 SWEET
                        Have you heard from your mother?

                                 GLADYS
                        She came.  She says Iva’s fine.  
                        But I’m so sick with worry...

                                 SWEET
                        Calm yourself.  We’ll be out soon.  
                        Cecil is a fine attorney and he 
                        believes the law is on our side.

           Gladys nods, trying her best to believe it, too.

                                 GLADYS
                             (after a beat)
                        I just wanted a house that’s one 
                        room bigger than my momma’s.

                                 SWEET
                        You have one.

                                 GLADYS
                        I wish we could give it back.

                                 SWEET
                        Don’t say that...

                                 GLADYS
                        I do.  This whole thing is because 
                        of that house.  Jesus spoke of the 
                        man that was motivated by pride.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GLADYS (CONT'D)
                        How it blinds the heart and makes 
                        its keeper foolhardy.  That’s us, 
                        Ossian.  We made this.

                                 SWEET
                        No.  We did what was our right to 
                        do and justice will be served.

                                 GLADYS
                        Justice...in a courtroom?  They 
                        wouldn’t accept us as their 
                        neighbors, Ossian, you really think 
                        they’ll treat us fairly on a jury?

           Sweet hesitates.  She holds his gaze.

                                 SWEET
                        They will.

                                 GLADYS
                        You’re a good man, Ossian Sweet.

                                 SWEET
                        They will.

           Sweet reaches through the bars to touch her hand, but the 
           Burly Guard raps the gate hard with his nightstick.

                                 BURLY GUARD
                        Time to go.

           He prods Sweet onward down the corridor.

                                 SWEET
                             (calls back to Gladys)
                        You hear me?  I’ll get us home.

           By now Sweet is out of sight.  A gate slams behind him.  
           Leaving Gladys in the darkness of her cell, alone.

                                 GLADYS
                             (after a beat, to herself)
                        ...Too good.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - DUSK

           The Burly Guard unlocks a gate leading from the women’s block 
           across the enclosed yard.  Sweet shuffles through and the 
           guard locks the gate behind him.  As Sweet makes his way 
           across the empty yard towards the gate leading to the men’s 
           block, WHITE PRISONERS leer down at him from cells above.

           Catcalls come from unseen VOICES:
                                 VOICES
                        Run along nigger!/  Watch your 
                        back!

           A glob of spit smacks Sweet on the forehead.  He shuffles 
           faster, jangling the chains.  A rotten egg splatters on his 
           back.  Then more debris and stones rain down, pelting him.

           Sweet tries to raise his arms to shield his face but chains 
           prevent him.  He grits his teeth and shuffles faster as the 
           obscenities and taunts and filth continue to bombard him.

           Sweet reaches the men’s block gate...  It’s locked.

           Behind it, the YARD GUARD locks eyes with Sweet, then slowly, 
           very slowly, reaches for his keys and opens up the gate.

           Sweet shuffles in, covered in filth.  Clinging to composure 
           with the last threads of his dignity.

           The last shouts from the yard echo behind him:

                                 VOICES
                        Good luck in court, nigger./  
                        Justice for all!

           As we HOLD on Sweet, humiliated, shaken...

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - VISITING CELL - DAY

           Sweet sits across from White, eyes trained on the floor.  
           This is difficult for him.  Putting ego to the side.

                                 WHITE
                        You asked to see me, Doctor?

           Sweet struggles for a moment.  Lifts his eyes to meet White.

                                 SWEET
                             (after a pause)
                        I don’t want to be a martyr.

                                 WHITE
                        Martyrs are only called that when 
                        they lose.  I want you to win.
                             (then)
                        Pride goeth before the fall, Dr. 
                        Sweet.  Let us help you.

           Sweet regards him.

                                 SWEET
                        I presume you have a plan?
           EXT. BELLE ISLE PARK, DETROIT - DAY

           A city view beyond the trees.  White and Johnson stroll.

                                 WHITE
                        ...He needs another lawyer.

                                 JOHNSON
                        A white one.

                                 WHITE
                        Not just white, he needs someone 
                        who can knock down the wall they’re 
                        building up around him.  I have 
                        feelers out to all the white-shoe 
                        firms.  Hays, Spingarn.

                                 JOHNSON
                        And?

                                 WHITE
                        It’s apparently a busy summer.

                                 JOHNSON
                        They’re scared shitless.

                                 WHITE
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHNSON
                        So am I.
                             (White regards him)
                        Your instincts are right on this 
                        thing, Walter, but the case is bad.

                                 WHITE
                        The evidence is with us...

                                 JOHNSON
                        Evidence?

                                 WHITE
                        The bullets weren’t found.  The 
                        cops can’t prove who fired the 
                        shots and even if they could, these 
                        folks had a right to self-defense.  
                        State law...hell, common law from 
                        time imperial says a man’s home is 
                        his castle.  Imagine a group of 
                        negroes stormed a white house.  If 
                        the races were reversed --

                                 JOHNSON
                        Except they’re not.  Are they?
           White pauses to collect himself.

                                 JOHNSON
                        When I found you, you were writing 
                        novels, Walter.  You know how to 
                        spin shit into sugar, craft a 
                        sympathetic story.  But in real 
                        life you can’t write the endings.

           INT. SILENT MOVIE HOUSE - NIGHT

           White sits alone at the back of a crowded movie theater, lit 
           by the reflected flicker of the screen.  He’s lost in his own 
           world, as AUDIENCE MEMBERS, all white, settle in around him.  
           Chatting, chomping peanuts.  Ignoring the only other man of 
           color in their midst:  a black man playing music at a piano; 
           we recognize him as Sweet’s exam-room patient, Winthrop.

           A NEWSREEL plays on screen.  Slide reads:  “MONKEY TRIAL IN 
           TENNESSEE.  LEGAL GIANT CLARENCE DARROW DEFENDS EVOLUTION.”

           White sits forward in his seat.

           ON SCREEN:  FOOTAGE of CLARENCE DARROW, 65, a rumpled lawyer 
           in a white suit, gesticulating expansively to a jury.  MORE 
           FOOTAGE of Darrow wading through a crowd of fans and press.  
           A slide reads:  “NEXT STOP SPEAKING TOUR IN NEW YORK CITY.”

           White is already out the door.

           INT. THE TOWN HALL THEATER, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           White enters the rear of a packed house.  Standing room only.  
           PATRONS of both genders, all white, watch the stage, rapt.

           Darrow commands the stage.  A tall, weathered man with a 
           shambling gait, a mop of white hair, and suspenders.  His 
           manner is homespun, direct.  He is not reading from a speech.

                                 DARROW
                        I first knew I was a lawyer when I 
                        was six years old.  Defending my 
                        beloved Bassett hound from going in 
                        the old man’s loafers.

           Chuckles from the crowd.

                                 DARROW
                        Don’t laugh, it was a bad case.  
                        The facts were all against us.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARROW (CONT'D)
                        I couldn’t deny the crime.  I had 
                        to explain it.  See, most people 
                        think there is no cause for crime, 
                        except the pure cursedness of those 
                        they call “criminals.”  But as a 
                        matter of fact, there’s a cause for 
                        everything on Earth; be it poverty 
                        or ignorance or dandruff.  When I 
                        looked at it that way, the angle of 
                        attack was clear.  “He’s just a 
                        dog,” I said.  And my father let 
                        him stay.

           LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the crowd.  Darrow soaks it in.

                                 DARROW
                        You’d be surprised the verdicts you 
                        can win by just appealing to that 
                        oft-forgotten flame of decency.

           HOLD on White, knowing that he’s found his man.

           EXT. THE TOWN HALL THEATER - STAGE DOOR - DAY

           A crowd is gathered at the stage door, where Darrow has been 
           waylaid by his fans, autographing copies of a book:  
           “DEFENDER OF THE DAMNED:  CLARENCE DARROW’S GREATEST TRIALS.”

           He’s savoring the adulation, in his element.

                                 DARROW
                        My thoughts on the White House?  
                        When I was a boy I was told that 
                        anybody could be President.  The 
                        problem is, these days I’m 
                        beginning to believe it.

           LAUGHTER.  White has worked his way through the crowd.  He 
           holds out a folded NEWSPAPER:  “SWEET TO STAND TRIAL.”

                                 WHITE
                        Mr. Darrow.  My name is Walter 
                        White.

                                 DARROW
                        That’s fine.
                             (re: newspaper)
                        Is this for me to sign?

                                 WHITE
                        To read.  I believe that it should 
                        be your next case.
                                 DARROW
                        Do you now?  Well as the harlot 
                        said, I take a lot of things but 
                        not requests.

           He thrusts the paper back to White and moves on, gravitating 
           to an attractive YOUNGER WOMAN.  He opens her book to sign.

                                 WHITE
                        The defendant’s name is Sweet, you 
                        might have heard of him.  He’s 
                        wrongfully accused.

                                 DARROW
                        There’s your problem.  I prefer my 
                        clients guilty.  Thrill of the 
                        challenge.
                             (to Younger Woman)
                        And who is this for?

                                 YOUNGER WOMAN
                        Josephine.

                                 DARROW
                        An empress!  How would you like to 
                        escort me to the streetcar, Madame 
                        Bonaparte?

           Darrow offers her an arm.  White stops him.

                                 WHITE
                        He’s a Negro, Mr. Darrow.  You want 
                        a challenge?  That’s a greater 
                        crime than teaching we descend from 
                        apes.

           Darrow regards him, for the first time maybe intrigued.

                                 DARROW
                        His victim?

                                 WHITE
                        As white as this young lady.
                             (then)
                        As the jury will be.

           White holds out the newspaper again.  Darrow considers it.

                                 WHITE
                        If you’re looking for another 
                        chapter to your book, sir.  This is 
                        it.
           INT. MIDTOWN STEAKHOUSE - DAY

           A corner booth.  The table is spread with food, all Darrow’s, 
           and he’s tucking into it with relish as he pages through a 
           file on the Sweet case.  White is still in sales mode.

                                 WHITE
                        The first question one must ask is 
                        whether or not a negro is legally 
                        able to defend his home.  My 
                        people, Mr. Darrow, do not know the 
                        answer to that question...

           Darrow peers up from the file with his mouth full.

                                 DARROW
                        Your people?

                                 WHITE
                        Yes, sir.

           Darrow regards White with a modicum of curiosity, and shrugs.  
           But doesn’t comment on it.

                                 DARROW
                        Well did he do it?

                                 WHITE
                        Sorry?

                                 DARROW
                        The good Doctor.  Did he fire the 
                        shot that killed the man and 
                        wounded the other?

           White hesitates, starting to hedge.

                                 WHITE
                        He says he did not.

           Darrow smiles.

                                 DARROW
                        But I’m not asking him yet.

                                 WHITE
                             (wavering, unsure)
                        The bullets weren’t found.  For all 
                        we know, the shots could have come 
                        from someone in the crowd.  Or the 
                        police...  And when you consider 
                        the patent case for self-defense --
                                 DARROW
                        Enough, enough.  You’re writing a 
                        column, Mr. White.  I asked for an 
                        opinion.  Did he shoot them?

           White looks at Darrow.  No sense lying.

                                 WHITE
                        I don’t know.

                                 DARROW
                        Better.  Although I’d preferred he 
                        had.

           He forks a bite of steak into his mouth, chewing as he talks.

                                 DARROW
                        I’ve never killed a man myself, but 
                        I do read many obituaries with a 
                        smile in my heart, and this is one.
                             (taps the file; working up 
                              a head of steam)
                        These so-called “victims” were 
                        members of a mob.  A Noble Nordic 
                        horde the likes of which last raped 
                        and pillaged with the Vikings.  Our 
                        Doctor was fighting for his home 
                        and hearth...why if it had been two 
                        hundred, or even two black men 
                        storming on a white’s house, this 
                        wouldn’t be a case or conversation.  
                        He’d be lauded as a hero.

           Darrow finally swallows the bite and sips his drink to wash 
           it down.  He’s gotten himself riled up, and White’s excited.

                                 WHITE
                        Which is what he is!  A hero.  
                        That’s the argument exactly --

                                 DARROW
                             (cuts him off)
                        It’s a fantasy.

           Darrow frowns.  His mind moves fast and his fleeting 
           enthusiasm has gone as quickly as it came, replaced by doubt.

                                 DARROW
                        I can convince a jury of a lot of 
                        things; that black is white will 
                        not be one of them.  I’m afraid 
                        those twelve men will reach their 
                        verdict the very moment that they 
                        see the skin of the accused.
           He wipes his mouth and throws his napkin to the table.

                                 WHITE
                        So you won’t take his case?

                                 DARROW
                             (a long beat; then)
                        No.  That’s exactly why I will.

                                 WHITE
                             (whiplashed)
                        That’s...that’s wonderful!

                                 DARROW
                        Isn’t it?

           Darrow stands and stuffs a couple dinner rolls into his 
           pockets, then glances at the bill, then White.

                                 DARROW
                             (re: bill)
                        You get this.  We’re colleagues 
                        now.  I’ll see you in Detroit.

           Darrow trundles off as White watches him go, still dazed.

           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER FOUR  “THE GREAT DEFENDER”

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - VISITING CELL - DAY

           Sweet sits alone, waiting, habitually straightening the 
           creases on his ratty prison trousers.  He finds a stain and 
           rubs it with a finger.  No help.  He scrapes it harder with 
           his fingernail, obsessing at it.  But the stain remains.

           He hasn’t noticed Darrow enter.

                                 DARROW
                        Have a go at mine next, would you?  
                        Ruby always tells me I’m a slob.

           Sweet blushes, mortified, and launches to his feet.

                                 SWEET
                        Mr. Darrow.  It’s an honor.

                                 DARROW
                        I think so, too.

           Darrow shakes his hand.
                                 SWEET
                        My apologies that I’m not more 
                        presentable.  Conditions here --

                                 DARROW
                        You’re a physician, aren’t you?  
                        You see folks naked.  I see them 
                        like this.  No shame in that.

           The easygoing manner puts Sweet at his ease.

                                 SWEET
                        Of course.  Thank you.

                                 DARROW
                        Sit.

           Sweet does so.  Darrow sits down in the other chair.

                                 DARROW
                        I understand you studied medicine 
                        in Europe.

                                 SWEET
                        Paris.  At the Sorbonne.  Under 
                        Madame Marie Curie.  I was one of 
                        only two Americans to be admitted 
                        to the course that year.

                                 DARROW
                        The only negro?

                                 SWEET
                             (slight hesitation)
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        Quite a credit to your race.

                                 SWEET
                        I believe a man ought to be judged 
                        on his own merits, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        I see.

                                 SWEET
                        I’ve lived my life by that creed.

                                 DARROW
                        And now you’re rotting by it.  God 
                        bless America.

           The bluntness wrong-foots Sweet, uncertain how to take it.
                                 SWEET
                        What is your plan here, Mr. Darrow?

                                 DARROW
                        To save your life.  And those of 
                        your wife, and your brother, and 
                        the other men.  To win this case.

                                 SWEET
                        How?

                                 DARROW
                        By admitting what you did.  And 
                        standing by it.

           Sweet stares at him in disbelief.

                                 SWEET
                        You think I shot those men?

                                 DARROW
                        I suppose it may have been your 
                        brother.  Or your baby, Iva.  She 
                        was in the room, too, wasn’t she?  
                        Must have been a sight to see her 
                        shooting through that swaddling.

                                 SWEET
                        You think this is funny.

                                 DARROW
                        Most things are with some 
                        perspective.

                                 SWEET
                        You want me to admit to murder!

                                 DARROW
                        Self-defense, provoked and 
                        justified.  Anybody looking out a 
                        window at a mob would do the same.

                                 SWEET
                        But I’m not anybody, Mr. Darrow.

           Darrow regards him, stymied.

                                 DARROW
                        Evidently.

                                 SWEET
                             (after a pause; evenly)
                        I know you can’t understand it.  I 
                        know you think it’s pride.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SWEET (CONT'D)
                        But I have had to live my life to a 
                        higher standard just to get to 
                        where I am.  A doctor who saves 
                        lives, not takes them.  If I admit 
                        to firing those shots, that’s gone.  
                        I’m nothing more than what they 
                        feared.  That thing that I despise 
                        as much as they do...  And I won’t 
                        be a nigger.  Not for anything.

           For the first time, it is Darrow at a loss for words.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - WAITING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Dunn escorts Darrow back into an antechamber where White is 
           waiting for him.  He rapidly approaches, on the move.

                                 WHITE
                        Well?

                                 DARROW
                        I didn’t take you for a grifter, 
                        Mr. White but you sold me a bill of 
                        goods.  A sympathetic man, the kind 
                        a jury has a hankering to feel for.
                             (then)
                        ...That bastard, even I’d convict.

                                 WHITE
                        I understand he can be stubborn.

                                 DARROW
                        As a mule.
                             (then)
                        What you need is a champion of the 
                        negro cause.  That man has no cause 
                        but his own.  Hell, if he thought 
                        god could make him white he’d pray 
                        every day and twice on Sunday.

                                 WHITE
                        I’ll give you the man you need.

                                 DARROW
                        A different one?

                                 WHITE
                        I’ll give him to you in the press.  
                        I’ll give you a hero.  You just 
                        give us justice in the court.

           This pauses Darrow, and he looks at White.  A beat.
                                 DARROW
                        I’ll do my best to save his ass.  
                        But you keep that word out of it.  
                        There’s no such thing as “justice.”  
                        In or out of court.
                             (he walks off)
                        See you Monday.

           EXT. DETROIT HALL OF JUSTICE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           An imposing neoclassical facade with the words “DETROIT HALL 
           OF JUSTICE.”  Hordes of PRESS and PUBLIC ascend marble steps.

           INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - COURTROOM - DAY

           The gallery is packed.  We recognize some angry faces from 
           the mob on Garland Avenue, all white.  The black folks are 
           relegated to standing room in back, hemmed in by BAILIFFS.

           Armed bailiffs guard the nine defendants.  Sweet is seated 
           next to Gladys, with Henry and the other men beside them.  
           Gladys appears sallow, nursing a cold, or just bad nerves.

           TWELVE MEN sit in the jury box, all white.  The room is rapt.  
           Darrow has just begun.

                                 DARROW
                        I’d like to bid good morning to our 
                        jury.  To the fine Judge Murphy...

           Darrow nods to the bench where JUDGE MURPHY, 50s, blushes 
           slightly, awestruck at the famous lawyer in his midst.

                                 DARROW
                        ...To our prosecutor, Mr. Toms...

           Darrow nods to ROBERT TOMS, 45, lanky and tightly wound, at 
           the table for the prosecution.  He forces a thin smile back, 
           as Darrow turns his attention to the crowded press box, where  
           White sits among a bevy of NEWSMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS.

                                 DARROW
                        ...And, from the papers I’ve read 
                        in the past few days, to what I 
                        feel safe to say must surely be the 
                        finest press corps in the land.

           Fawning chuckles from the press corps, eating this right up.  
           Among them, we recognize H.L. Mencken, sitting next to White.

                                 MENCKEN
                             (under his breath; amused)
                        What a load.
                                 DARROW
                        Now as you all may know, I am not a 
                        citizen of Detroit.  My parents had 
                        not the foresight to see that the 
                        influence of growing up in a city 
                        as fine as this one would have 
                        broadened my mind in ways their own 
                        could not conceive.  But I am a 
                        citizen of these United States.  
                        Which commits me to the same ideal 
                        that we all share:  justice.

           This wins affirming nods from press, jury and gallery.  White 
           beams; this guy is good.  Toms sinks deeper in his seat.

                                 TOMS
                             (sotto; to his CO-COUNSEL)
                        We’re fucked.

           Even the defendants seem pleased, Morse and Davis trading 
           looks with Henry; maybe they’re in good hands, after all.

                                 DARROW
                        The people will try to tell you 
                        this is not a case of prejudice.  
                        That race and color never entered 
                        into it.  This is a case of murder.
                             (beat)
                        I say hogwash.

           He gestures to the defendants.  The jury looks at them.

                                 DARROW
                        Gentlemen, I am here to say that 
                        there is nothing in this case but 
                        prejudice.  Eight colored men and 
                        one woman stand indicted, to be 
                        tried by twelve jurors, all of you 
                        white.  Now you’ve all told this 
                        court that you’ll be fair and 
                        decent in this matter, put your 
                        biases aside, and I believe you.  
                        But let’s not fool ourselves 
                        pretending that we’re here to do 
                        some justice for the victims.

           He gestures to Eric in the gallery, seated upright and 
           composed.  Mary and June sit with him, next to a widow in a 
           black veil, MRS. BREINER, 50.  Gladys looks at them uneasily.

                                 DARROW
                        I intend to prove the only victims 
                        in this case are these defendants.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARROW (CONT'D)
                        That if one fact was inverted and 
                        nine whites had shot and killed a 
                        black while protecting their home 
                        against a negro mob, nobody would 
                        have dreamed of having them 
                        indicted.  They’d be given medals.
                             (he gestures to Sweet, 
                              Gladys, Henry, et al.)
                        And so should they.

           All eyes in the room on the defendants.  Sweet sits proud.  
           Mrs. Breiner can’t be seen behind her veil, but she seems to 
           be staring right at Gladys.  Glaring at her.  Gladys squirms.

           INT. DETROIT HALL OF JUSTICE - CORRIDOR - LATE DAY

           With court recessed, Judge Murphy poses for a photograph with 
           Darrow.  FLASHBULBS POP as the duo smiles for posterity.

           NEARBY, the hired men are energized, admiring Darrow.

                                 MURRAY
                        White man sure got a silver tongue.

                                 LATTING
                        Guess we ain’t swinging from the 
                        gallows yet.

                                 DAVIS
                        Electric chair, remember?

           Latting and Murray look at Davis, remembering.

                                 LATTING
                        Shit.

           Henry sees someone in the crowd.  It’s Wilamae.  Their eyes 
           meet.  Love between them, but now distance too.

                                 WILAMAE
                        Hello Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey.
                             (then)
                        Thought you’d be gone by now.

                                 WILAMAE
                        I leave tonight.  Taking the train 
                        west.

                                 HENRY
                        That sounds nice.
                                 WILAMAE
                        That’s my hope.
                             (then)
                        Maybe when you get your fine ass 
                        outta here, you’ll join me.

           She kisses him and turns to go.  He grabs her wrist.

                                 HENRY
                        Wait for me.

                                 WILAMAE
                        See you in Alaska, Henry Sweet.
                             (she pulls away and moves 
                              off; bumping into Sweet)
                        Evening, doctor.

           Sweet nods curtly and watches her depart.  He looks to Henry.  
           Reading heartbreak in his eyes.

                                 SWEET
                        Forget her.

           White hustles up, snagging Sweet and Henry by the elbows.

                                 WHITE
                        Let’s get a photo for the papers.

           White corrals the defendants into two rows, flanking Darrow, 
           as the press photographers await.  Sweet looks to Joe Mack.

                                 SWEET
                        Joe, fix my collar.

           Mack seems caught off-guard by the presumption.  But habit 
           overtakes resistance and he does so.  Sweet draws Gladys 
           close to him as they pose for the picture.  But just then:

                                 MRS. BREINER
                        Murderers!

           Heads turn.  Mrs. Breiner has her veil up, revealing tear-
           fraught eyes.  She’s pointing a bony finger right at Gladys.

                                 MRS. BREINER
                        You’re murderers!

                                 DUNN
                             (he rushes up)
                        That’s enough, ma’am.  Let’s go.

           Dunn, the guard, guides her away.  But Gladys remains frozen.  
           Blanched and trembling like she’s seen the devil.  From 
           across the corridor, Toms has clocked this, observing Gladys.
                                 SWEET
                             (notices and prods her)
                        Control yourself, they’re watching.

           Gladys looks up.  All the eyes and lenses of the press corps 
           trained on her.  Assaulting her.  Their FLASHBULBS POP --

           THE IMAGE FREEZES TO A PHOTOGRAPH IN BLACK AND WHITE.

           INT. PRINTING PRESS - NIGHT

           A TYPESETTER, 50s, black, composites the same photograph onto 
           the front page layout of a magazine, “THE CRISIS,” the 
           official periodical of the NAACP.  Fifteen cents a copy.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           White sits at his hotel desk, surrounded by a mosaic of steno 
           notes and crumpled paper, pecking at his CORONA TYPEWRITER.  
           A cigarette dangles from his lips, burning to ash.

           As he types we HEAR the copy read in voiceover:

                                 JOHNSON (V.O.)
                        “With the good doctor and his 
                        people wrongfully accused, one ray 
                        of hope remains:  the Great 
                        Defender, Clarence Darrow, late of 
                        the famed Monkey Trial in 
                        Tennessee...”

           INT. HARLEM TOWNHOUSE - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

           James Weldon Johnson paces in his smoking jacket, on the 
           phone, reading aloud from a TELEX PRINTOUT.

                                 JOHNSON
                        “...If Pontius Pilate had had Mr. 
                        Darrow to contend with, I daresay 
                        Christendom would have been short a 
                        savior.  As it stands, the negro 
                        race has found its own.”
                             (he stops reading, rolls 
                              his eyes; into phone)
                        You’re joking with this.

           EXT./INT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT - PHONE BOOTH - INTERCUT

           A summer rain pours down in buckets outside the phone booth.  
           White is shouting to be heard above the rain.

                                 WHITE
                        I thought it was a decent turn of 
                        phrase.
                                 JOHNSON
                        We’re already getting dinged for 
                        calling a white man to the rescue, 
                        now you’re comparing him to Jesus?

                                 WHITE
                        Black folks have been calling out 
                        to Jesus for a long time.  At least 
                        Mr. Darrow finally showed up.

           Johnson frowns at the heresy.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Do me a favor.  Don’t say that in 
                        church tomorrow.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM AME CHURCH - DAY

           A service is in full swing.  The Gospel CHOIR sways on the 
           stage behind White, as he speaks from the pulpit to a packed 
           congregation of BLACK MEN and WOMEN in their Sunday best.

           Signs announce a meeting of the “NAACP SWEET DEFENSE FUND.”  
           Copies of “The Crisis” magazine are being passed around.

                                 WHITE
                        And I was on my knees last night, 
                        and called on Jesus for his help.

           SHOUTS of “Amen” from the gallery.  White is channeling a 
           very different energy, preaching his atheistic heart out.

                                 WHITE
                        I said, Jesus, this man, this good 
                        Doctor Sweet who stands accused of 
                        taking life works as a healer for 
                        his people.  Mending bodies the 
                        same way you mend our souls.  And 
                        now the forces of injustice want to 
                        break his body and his spirit, too, 
                        and ours right with it -- but we 
                        won’t let them, will we?

           Hosannas from the crowd.  A HAT is passed.  Dollar bills and 
           coins are stuffed in, poor people giving everything they can.

           Then suddenly:  CRASH!  A BRICK flies through the stained 
           glass window high above the pulpit, shattering it.

           White takes cover as the glass rains down.  SCREAMS of terror 
           and confusion from the congregation.  Folks flee for the 
           exit.  White, helpless, can only watch his donors disappear.
                                 WHITE
                             (gets his bearings; 
                              calling out)
                        It’s okay, folks.  Stay calm...  
                        The Lord will see us through!

           But it’s too late.  White is left alone.  The collection hat 
           remains abandoned on the floor amidst some scattered bills.

           Jesus stares down from the broken stained glass window.

                                 WHITE
                        Yeah, I get it.  We’re on our own.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - WOMEN’S BLOCK - NIGHT

           Gladys sits alone in darkness.  She HEARS the cell unlock and 
           looks up to see Toms.  He steps in and nods back to the Burly 
           Guard, who shuts the heavy door behind him with a CLANG.

           Gladys flinches at the noise.  Toms notices.

                                 TOMS
                        Heck of a sound, isn’t it?  Can you 
                        imagine spending, say...another 
                        forty years listening to that door 
                        close day after day, and never 
                        being on the other side of it?
                             (beat)
                        And you, a mother no less.

           He looks at Gladys.  She just stares off at the darkness.

                                 GLADYS
                        Is there a point to this or is your 
                        purpose here to see me suffer?

                                 TOMS
                        You mistake me, Mrs. Sweet.  I’m 
                        here to help.
                             (she looks at him)
                        I saw you there in court.  How you 
                        reacted when the victim’s wife 
                        berated you.  You’re not a 
                        murderer.  You’re a Christian.  You 
                        don’t want to be here and you don’t 
                        deserve it, so I’ll make you a 
                        deal.  Tell me who fired the shots 
                        that night.  Give me that one name, 
                        and you have my word the rest of 
                        you go free.  You, back to the 
                        loving arms of Iva...isn’t it?

           Gladys stares at him, a beat, then starts to laugh.
                                 TOMS
                             (confused)
                        Is something funny?

                                 GLADYS
                        Do you have children, Mr. Toms?

           Toms hesitates, unsure where this is going.

                                 TOMS
                        Two.  A son and a daughter.

                                 GLADYS
                        Nice.  And the house that you 
                        provide for them...is it nice, too?

                                 TOMS
                        No mansion, but it keeps the 
                        elements at bay...  Damned gazebo 
                        could use a coat of paint.

                                 GLADYS
                             (eyes widen)
                        Gazebo?  I love gazebos.  And your 
                        neighbors?  Good people are they?

           Gladys stands and Toms backpedals slightly as she approaches.

                                 TOMS
                        Yes...I suppose.

                                 GLADYS
                        And what if a hundred of those good 
                        people surrounded your house and 
                        tore down that gazebo -- and 
                        threatened to bring harm to your 
                        nice son and daughter and your 
                        lovely wife -- what then, Mr. Toms?

           She’s in his space now; Toms is rattled.

                                 TOMS
                        I...I’m not the one on trial.

                                 GLADYS
                        No.  I am.  For something you just 
                        said you know I didn’t do.  And I 
                        don’t blame you for that, Mr. Toms.  
                        We all have our roles to play.  
                        Yours gets you a gazebo.  I was a 
                        doctor’s wife.  That made me the 
                        cat’s meow in Black Bottom, let me 
                        tell you.  My mother, she was a 
                        domestic -- still is.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GLADYS (CONT'D)
                        Never had much time for lotions and 
                        nice clothes -- except the ones she 
                        put on white folks.  How it must 
                        feel to feed their children, tend 
                        to their needs, and watch them go 
                        through life like they live on a 
                        movie screen and you’re only the 
                        audience.  If she was standing here 
                        in my shoes, Mr. Toms, mark my 
                        words -- she’d take your deal.

                                 TOMS
                             (pause)
                        Wise woman then.

                                 GLADYS
                        No, just filled with fear.  Of you.  
                        A white man in a cell, alone -- why 
                        she’d admit to crucifying Christ on 
                        the cross not to incur your wrath.

                                 TOMS
                        I never raised a hand to you...

                                 GLADYS
                        Didn’t have to.  You knew that.  
                        All you had to do was smile, and 
                        you want to know the truth?  Inside 
                        I’m just as scared as she would be.
                             (pause; eye to eye)
                        But I am not my mother, Mr. Toms.  
                        And I will die before I take your 
                        deal.

           Gladys holds Toms’ gaze, unwavering, for an extended beat.  
           Until at last, shaken, he looks away.  Nods to the guard.

                                 TOMS
                        We’re finished.

           Toms walks out as Gladys watches.  The cell door clangs shut 
           loudly in his wake.  This time Gladys doesn’t flinch.

           INT. DETROIT HALL OF JUSTICE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Sweet, Henry and the other male defendants mill about the 
           large cell, dressing, grooming, preparing for a day in court.

           Latting is reading aloud from a copy of “The Crisis.”

                                 LATTING
                        “Sweet is no less than a beacon for

                             (grabs the magazine)
                        Who cares?  Man with my picture in 
                        the paper I’m gonna get so much 
                        tail the population of Black Bottom 
                        might hit a all new high.

           Laughter from the group.  Sweet approaches Henry, standing at 
           the small tin mirror by the toilet, fastening his tie.

                                 SWEET
                        How are your spirits, brother?  
                        Still dwelling on that woman?

                             (looks at him)
                        What woman?

           Sweet smiles at his brother.

                                 SWEET
                        That a boy.

                                 SWEET
                        More than thinks it.  A man of his 
                        sort wouldn’t take a case he wasn’t 
                        certain of.  In fact, he’s so 
                        certain, he won’t even take a fee.

                        And by the state of his attire he 
                        could use one, too.

           Henry laughs.  Sweet joins him.

                                 SWEET
                        ...I think the man spends 
                        everything he earns on food.

           It’s the first moment of levity between the brothers in some 
           time.  Finally, the laughter stops.  Henry becomes pensive.
                                 HENRY
                        I know all this is my fault, 
                        Ossian.  We wouldn’t be here if I --

                                 SWEET
                             (cuts him off, firm)
                        Stop.

           Their eyes meet.  A world unspoken in this.  Their secret; 
           the only ones who truly know what happened in that bedroom.

                                 SWEET
                        We all make mistakes.

           Henry nods.

           A CLANG breaks the moment as a BAILIFF unlocks the door.  
           Sweet checks his attire in the mirror; noticing his cuffs.

                                 SWEET
                        My links.
                             (then)
                        Hey Joe...

           He looks around to see that Joe Mack isn’t in the cell.

                                 SWEET
                        Where’s Joe?

                                 MURRAY
                        Guard took him earlier this 
                        morning.  Figured he had a guest.

           The news registers on Sweet as the bailiff prods him out.

           INT. DETROIT HALL OF JUSTICE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Joe Mack sits on the stand.  A witness for the prosecution.

           The other defendants wear a look of shock.  Sweet seethes 
           with anger, glaring ice at Mack, who doesn’t meet his gaze.

                                 TOMS
                        And when was it that the Doctor 
                        himself first picked up a gun?

                                 JOE MACK
                        After that police came banging on 
                        the door, I guess.

                                 TOMS
                        And what do you suppose he meant to 
                        do with it?  The gun.
                                 JOE MACK
                        What else?  What he done.  Shoot 
                        hisself some white folks.

           This rouses a MURMUR from the gallery, even among the blacks 
           in back.  White squirms in the press box as the other (white) 
           reporters scribble frenzied notes.  Things are going south.

                                 MENCKEN
                             (sotto; with a smirk)
                        Sounds like a party.

           White shoots him a dagger.

           Henry and the other men trade dire glances.  Gladys looks to 
           Sweet, alarmed.  Sweet bristles angrily, leans up to Darrow.

                                 SWEET
                             (whispering)
                        He’s lying.

                                 DARROW
                             (not bothering to look up)
                        You don’t say.

           Darrow is hunched over his notebook, doodling a cartoon, 
           ostentatiously paying as little attention to this as he can.

                                 SWEET
                        You should object to this.

                                 DARROW
                        You should have been a lawyer.

           Darrow slides Sweet his CARTOON, a caricature of Sweet like 
           Jesus on a cross, with Mack below holding three silver coins.

                                 DARROW
                        And I should have been an artist.

                                 TOMS
                             (continuing; to Mack)
                        You’re saying the doctor shot those 
                        men himself?

                                 JOE MACK
                        Him or his hoodlum brother.  They 
                        was the only two men in that room.

                                 TOMS
                        The upstairs bedroom.  And when you 
                        entered following the gunshots, you 
                        found them both at the window?  The 
                        gun between them on the floor?
                                 JOE MACK
                        Still smoking.

           This wins an audible reaction from the gallery and jury.

                                 TOM
                             (triumphantly)
                        Your witness, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                             (looks up from his doodle)
                        Is it now?  Just this morning, that 
                        same man was still my client.  At 
                        this rate, he’ll be working for the 
                        hangman before supper.

           Darrow rises to his feet with a great show of effort for the 
           jury, as though he can only barely just be bothered.

                                 DARROW
                             (to Mack, offhand)
                        How many pieces of silver did the 
                        people pay you for your testimony?

                                 TOMS
                        Objection!

                                 DARROW
                        On what grounds, sarcasm?  If I 
                        refrained from that I’d be a mute.

           This wins LAUGHTER from the press.  White, still uneasy; 
           hoping Darrow has a rabbit up his sleeve.

                                 TOMS
                        That’d be a novelty.

                                 JUDGE MURPHY
                        Objection overruled.  Try not to be 
                        too cute here, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        Wouldn’t dream of it, your honor.
                             (to Joe Mack)
                        You can answer.

                                 JOE MACK
                        I ain’t took a nickel.

                                 DARROW
                        Except the price of your own neck.  
                        The People did agree to drop the 
                        charge of murder, didn’t they?
                                 JOE MACK
                             (hesitates)
                        That’s true.  But I ain’t done 
                        nothing to deserve no charges.  All 
                        I did was help the Doctor.

                                 DARROW
                        Help?  That would suggest a 
                        friendly gesture, when in fact the 
                        Doctor paid you money, didn’t he?

                                 JOE MACK
                        Two bucks a day.

                                 DARROW
                        No small sum for a man of little 
                        training and few prospects.

                                 JOE MACK
                        If you say so.

                                 DARROW
                        I do say so.  In fact, I say it’s a 
                        job most men would be grateful for.  
                        He even tailored you a uniform.

           This prompts a darker look from Mack, a glare at Sweet.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Yes, sir.  He had me wear it 
                        everyday, too.

                                 DARROW
                             (picking up on something)
                        Is that right?  Even hot days?  
                        Summer days?  And that silly little 
                        cap, too?

                                 JOE MACK
                        Even when no one was around but 
                        him.

                                 DARROW
                        The tyrant.  Now I see why you’d 
                        betray your race to hang him.

           This raises a reaction from the black folks in the gallery.

                                 TOMS
                        Objection --
                                 DARROW
                        That’s why we’re here, isn’t it?
                             (to Joe Mack)
                        Isn’t it?

                                 JOE MACK
                        He ain’t give a damn about our 
                        race!  Never did.  He thinks he’s 
                        better than the rest of us.

                                 DARROW
                        Heaven forbid.  A medical 
                        physician.  That’s a fine sight 
                        better than a man who drives a car.

                                 JOE MACK
                        Maybe it is.  But at least I ain’t 
                        pretending to be something else.  
                        You trying to get these folks to 
                        think he did this for our race?  He 
                        did this for hisself.  That’s why 
                        we’re here.  ‘Cause he thought the 
                        white man’s water was a little 
                        sweeter but it ain’t, is it Doctor?
                             (he stares at Sweet)
                        How it taste now?

           Sweet just stares back, fuming.  But Toms has clearly scored 
           a point.  Even the black folks in the back gallery are 
           shaking their heads in scorn.  Mencken cocks a brow at White.

           Darrow remains composed.  But he, too, knows it ain’t good.

                                 DARROW
                        Thank you for your objectivity.
                             (to the court)
                        I’m done.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - VISITING CELL - DAY

           Sweet flings a metal chair across the floor, livid with rage.

                                 SWEET
                        How dare he?  How dare he!  I was 
                        good to that man.  Let him drive a 
                        car he couldn’t have afforded in a 
                        million years...gave him a uniform.  
                        I exposed him to a world most 
                        colored would die to see!

           Sweet kicks the chair again.  Darrow watches with a wry look.

                                 DARROW
                        And what exactly did the chair do?
                                 SWEET
                        Everything’s a joke to you.

                                 DARROW
                        It was a stunt.  He took a deal to 
                        sell you out.  The jury sees that.

                                 SWEET
                        They hear him say I’m a tyrant and 
                        a climber --

                                 DARROW
                        They hear a poor, sad sap who wants 
                        to stick it to his boss.  Leave it 
                        at that.

                                 SWEET
                        That’s easy for you.  It’s not your 
                        reputation on the line.  The way 
                        they looked at me --

                                 DARROW
                        Untie my hands then.
                             (Sweet looks at him)
                        A strategy of self defense --

                                 SWEET
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        Admit to firing the shots and make 
                        them understand it --

                                 SWEET
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        Put them in your shoes --

                                 SWEET
                        I won’t admit to something that I 
                        didn’t do!

                                 DARROW
                        You’d rather fry for it?

                                 SWEET
                        I’m not some ruffian.  I won’t be 
                        seen that way.  I’m a doctor!

                                 DARROW
                        Don’t think I don’t know it.
                                 SWEET
                        You’re mocking me.

                                 DARROW
                        No, I’m starting to think you’re 
                        everything that driver said you 
                        are.  A man so full of pride he 
                        cares more about his reputation 
                        than his neck!  His family’s!

           Long beat.  This lands on Sweet.  But he meets Darrow’s gaze.

                                 SWEET
                        You’ve never seen a black man of 
                        honor, have you?

                                 DARROW
                             (stares, a beat; no use)
                        It seems I’m about to see one all 
                        the way to his funeral.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM AME CHURCH - NIGHT

           The stained glass window has been boarded up.  This is 
           another meeting of the “NAACP SWEET DEFENSE FUND.”  But now 
           copies of “The Crisis” lay in stacks; there’s nobody here.

           The collection hat is empty.  White sits beside it, glum.

                                 DARROW (O.S.)
                        Turn out like this probably won’t 
                        stir Jesus from his slumber.

           White looks up to see Darrow in the aisle.  He steps up and 
           slumps into the pew beside White, exhales wearily.

                                 DARROW
                        ...Probably too busy saving kids 
                        from burning buildings anyway.

                                 WHITE
                        Folks in the community got wind of 
                        today’s testimony.  Now they think 
                        Sweet’s just another Uncle Tom.

                                 DARROW
                        You disagree with the assessment?

                                 WHITE
                             (considers it)
                        Let you in on a little secret, Mr. 
                        Darrow.  Colored people can be 
                        assholes, too.  Just turns out we 
                        put our money on a big one.
           Darrow smiles, then looks out at the empty church.

                                 DARROW
                        Maybe, too, a finger can be pointed 
                        at the fickle masses.

                                 WHITE
                             (knows he’s right)
                        Black folks don’t get heroes very 
                        often.  Makes it hurt worse when we 
                        lose them.

                                 DARROW
                        “We?”  Don’t tell me you actually 
                        believed in this one, Mr. White.  I 
                        took you for a level-headed cynic.

           White regards him; maybe a little surprised himself.

                                 WHITE
                        Me too.
                             (pause)
                        When I was young I caught hell from 
                        both sides.  Wasn’t white enough to 
                        be white, or black enough to be 
                        black.  Some point I had to choose.

                                 DARROW
                        Perhaps that’s where you and the 
                        good doctor differ.

                                 WHITE
                        Except he never had that choice.  
                        Thought he did.  Spent his whole 
                        life becoming what he thought he 
                        had to be to be respected.  But he 
                        couldn’t change his color.

           Darrow considers this, a beat. 

                                 DARROW
                        You say you’ve never been a lawyer?  
                        That was quite a closing argument.
                             (off White’s smile)
                        This trial isn’t over, Mr. White.  
                        But I need facts.  If Sweet won’t 
                        allow a strategy of self-defense, I 
                        need to know what really happened 
                        that night.  Who fired those shots?
                             (beat)
                        Find that, and maybe we can win.

           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER FIVE  “THE WAR HERO”
           INT. FORD ASSEMBLY PLANT - MAIN FLOOR - DAY

           The factory in full swing.  Workmen labor on the line, 
           welding parts of a brand new Model-T.  On a catwalk above, 
           Eric paces with a clipboard, limping on his game leg.

                                 SUPERVISOR/O’BRYAN (O.S.)
                        Houghberg.

           Eric looks up to see his SUPERVISOR (O’BRYAN), 50, motioning 
           from an office door.  For a moment, Eric’s color drains.

           Then he sees White is standing at O’Bryan’s side.

                                 O’BRYAN
                        This man wants to have a word.
                             (then; to White)
                        That’s O’Bryan with a “y.” 

                                 WHITE
                        In big bold letters.

           O’Bryan withdraws into his office, leaving White with Eric, 
           who seems visibly relieved he hasn’t just been fired.

                                 WHITE
                        May I join you for lunch?

           EXT. FORD ASSEMBLY PLANT - DAY

           Scattered workmen eat sack lunches, a brief respite from the 
           grind.  Eric is rolling a cigarette as White looks on.

                                 WHITE
                        As I told you, I’m a newsman and 
                        I’d like to paint a picture for my 
                        readers of that night.  The sights 
                        and sounds.  All that commotion.

                                 ERIC
                        Already told the cops what I know.

                                 WHITE
                        And I’ve seen their sequence of 
                        events.  Warm night.  Sundown.  
                        Just folks out on the street.  They 
                        say everything was peaceable until 
                        the negroes fired shots.

                                 ERIC
                        Reckon that sounds right then.

           Eric lights his cigarette, inhales.
                                 WHITE
                        I just thought a man like you, 
                        who’s been in war, might have a 
                        keener recollection of specifics.

                                 ERIC
                        There was some hollering.  Then 
                        someone said there was a gun.

                                 WHITE
                        And that’s when the shots came?

                                 ERIC
                        Things happened fast.

                                 WHITE
                        See that’s what’s bugging me.  
                        Things happening so fast.  How do 
                        we know those first shots came from 
                        the house at all?  There must have 
                        been more guns in the crowd.
                             (then; faux casual)
                        You had one, didn’t you?

           Eric looks at White.

                                 ERIC
                        I did.

                                 WHITE
                        For what purpose?

                                 ERIC
                        Lieutenant Norton gave it to me.  
                        For protection.

                                 WHITE
                        Not to fire at the negroes?

           Eric stares.

                                 ERIC
                        I have no quarrel with negroes.

                                 WHITE
                        No.  Of course.
                             (checks his steno notes)
                        In fact, you served in a mixed 
                        division, didn’t you?  Fort Monroe?

           Eric bristles slightly, uneasy at what White appears to know.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s right.
                                 WHITE
                        Never any conflict?

                                 ERIC
                        No more than usual.  Found a home 
                        there with all sorts...  Is this 
                        about that night or not?

           White clocks his agitation; then checks his steno, smiles.

                                 WHITE
                        Just one more question.  Your time 
                        in the Army.  Living with all 
                        sorts.  How come you left?  Man 
                        makes it through a war unharmed, 
                        he’s looking at a long career...  
                        Instead, you’re here.

           The question flat-foots Eric.  Hanging in the air a beat.  
           Just then a BELL rings, ending lunch.  Breaking the moment.

                                 ERIC
                        I have to go.

           Eric hurries off, returning to work as White looks on with 
           mounting interest; like a bloodhound on a scent.

           EXT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

           Darrow emerges from a TAXI, looking weary, probably hungover.  
           He lumbers toward the court steps. 

                                 WHITE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Darrow!

           White rushes up beside him.  Matching his sluggish pace.

                                 DARROW
                        Where do you get your energy, Mr. 
                        White?  Must be the mongrel blood.

                                 WHITE
                        I think I have something.

                                 DARROW
                        Do you now?  I ought to warn you 
                        disappointing me before my morning 
                        scotch risks harm unfathomable.

           White holds out a FILE:  “U.S. ARMY.”  Darrow regards it.

                                 DARROW
                        What is this?
           INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Eric sits on the witness stand.  His wife Mary and daughter 
           June look on from the packed gallery, wearing their Sunday 
           best.  Next to them sits Lieutenant Norton, in dress blues.

                                 TOMS
                        I hate to ask this, Mr. Houghberg.  
                        But would you show it to the jury?

           Eric hesitates, then rolls up his pant leg to reveal:  a WOOD 
           PROSTHESIS.  He unstraps the buckles to hold it up for view.  
           The gallery emits a quiet gasp.  Jurors lean forward in their 
           seats, titillated.  It’s a moment of pure theater.

                                 ERIC
                        Some days I still feel it.

                                 TOMS
                        I’m sure you do.

           NEWSMEN in the press box scribble down the quotes.

                                 MENCKEN
                             (sotto; to White)
                        Look out, Walt, I think they just 
                        got a leg up on you.

           White cocks a brow at Mencken as Toms continues to the jury.

                                 TOMS
                        Thank you, Mr. Houghberg.
                             (to Darrow)
                        Your witness.

           Darrow remains seated as per usual, paying little mind.  He 
           puts the last few touches on a doodle without yet looking up.

                                 DARROW
                        Just out for a stroll that evening, 
                        were you, Mr. Houghberg?  When you 
                        strolled into a hail of bullets?

                                 ERIC
                        No, sir.

                                 DARROW
                        What then?  Star gazing?

           Eric looks to Norton in the gallery.  He nods reassuringly.

                                 ERIC
                        I had no meaning to harm anybody, 
                        if that’s what you’re asking.
                                 DARROW
                        Not precisely, but I’ll take it.

           Darrow rises slowly, hooks his thumbs into his vest holes.

                                 DARROW
                        So you were out amongst the crowd 
                        but had no intent to cause any of 
                        the negroes harm, is that it?

                                 ERIC
                        Yes, sir.

                                 DARROW
                        And the gun you carried?  That was 
                        just in case the family inside got 
                        rowdy?  Maybe the little one took 
                        to a slingshot?

           A chuckle from the room, as Darrow snaps the Army file off 
           his table, pacing toward the witness.  White leans in.

                                 DARROW
                        You served in the Army, didn’t you?

                                 ERIC
                        I did.

                                 DARROW
                             (referencing the file)
                        Don’t be humble now, you were a war 
                        hero.  Silver Star; Master Sergeant 
                        stripes.  After the war you were on 
                        track to be an officer -- but then 
                        you left.  Why was that?  Can't be  
                        you found the fumes of an auto-
                        plant so alluring you turned down a 
                        life of service and distinction?

                                 ERIC
                             (hesitates)
                        I was discharged.

                                 DARROW
                        So I see.  And why was that?  I 
                        read here you suffered episodes?

           Eric stiffens.  A MURMUR ripples through the gallery.  Mary 
           looks to Norton to be reassured.  But he seems stunned.

                                 MARY
                             (sotto; urgent)
                        What is he talking about?
                                 TOMS
                        Objection!

           Heads turn to Toms, roused now from his seat and flustered.

                                 JUDGE MURPHY
                        What for, Mr. Toms?

                                 TOMS
                        I...I’m not sure.

                                 JUDGE MURPHY
                        In that case, overruled.
                             (to Eric)
                        You may answer the question.

           Eric sees Mary staring at him.  He looks away, ashamed.

                                 ERIC
                        I...froze in situations.

                                 DARROW
                        Situations, or combat?

                                 ERIC
                        Combat at first.  Then it started 
                        happening on base...any time that I 
                        got startled.  By loud noises.  Or 
                        confusion.

                                 DARROW
                        Shell shock.  Is that the term?

                                 ERIC
                        I guess.

                                 DARROW
                        Isn’t it true, one time in such a 
                        state you even attacked an officer?

                                 ERIC
                        They said so.

                                 DARROW
                        But you couldn’t remember.

                                 ERIC
                        They called it a “fugue.”
                             (then)
                        But it doesn’t happen anymore.

           Now the gallery is in a mild uproar; whispers rippling like 
           waves.  Eric looks to Mary in the gallery.  She’s mortified.
                                 DARROW
                        Oh no?  So take us back to Garland 
                        Avenue.  You testified that you 
                        were standing in the street.  A mob 
                        of people all around you.  Loud 
                        noise, confusion.  Someone yelled 
                        they saw a gun.  Then what?

                                 ERIC
                        I was on the ground.

                                 DARROW
                        Next thing you knew?

                                 ERIC
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        Just like that?  With no 
                        recollection of the shot itself?

                                 ERIC
                             (after a beat)
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        Which means it could have come from 
                        anywhere -- even you?

                                 TOMS
                             (on his feet)
                        Objection!

           A furor from the gallery.  But Darrow is unrelenting.

                                 DARROW
                        But isn’t it possible, given your 
                        history, that your mind froze while 
                        your body still attacked -- just 
                        like it attacked that officer -- 
                        that you fired the shots yourself, 
                        hitting Breiner and your own leg!

                           TOMS
                                                          ERIC
           Objection, objection --
                                              I --

                                 DARROW
                             (in his face now)
                        You what?

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t remember.
                             (then; ashamed)
                        I don’t know.
           Total silence in the courtroom.  Darrow milks it for a beat.

                                 DARROW
                        Of course.  And nor can we.

           EXT. HALL OF JUSTICE - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Court in recess.  Mary pushes through a hubbub of departing 
           bodies with June in her arms, tears streaking her cheeks.

                                 ERIC
                             (rushes after her)
                        Mary!

           He grabs her arm and she wheels back at him, eye to eye.

                                 MARY
                        Is it true?

                                 ERIC
                             (hesitates)
                        I’d never hurt you.

           Mary tugs free of his grip, repelled.  She rushes off.

                                 ERIC
                        Mary wait --

           Several members of the press spot Eric, blocking his way.

                                 PRESS
                        Mr. Houghberg, is it true you’re 
                        shell shocked?/  Did you shoot at 
                        the negroes?/  Did you kill Breiner 
                        and shoot yourself to cover it up?

           Eric looks into the crowd, but Mary is gone.  Other folks are 
           staring at him, neighbors and coworkers.  He spots his 
           supervisor, O’Bryan, who looks away when their eyes meet. 

           And for a moment, Eric stands there.  Frozen.  Shell-shocked.

                                 NORTON (O.S.)
                        He’s got nothing to say.  Let him 
                        be!

           Cutting through the crowd like a knife to butter is Norton.  
           He makes his way to Eric and ushers him around a corner to:

           INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A quiet area.  Norton signals to some UNIFORM OFFICERS to 
           keep the press at bay.  Eric is still flustered, recovering.
                                 NORTON
                        Let me give you a lift. 

                                 ERIC
                        No.  No, I need to go --

           Norton stops him with a palm and Eric lashes out, grabbing 
           Norton firmly by the collar and pinning him against the wall.

                                 ERIC
                        Why did you give me that gun?  Why?

                                 NORTON
                        I...I didn’t know...

                                 ERIC
                        I never asked for this!

           The other officers rush up to intercede.  But Eric releases 
           Norton and limps away.  As Norton looks on, guilt-ridden.

           EXT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

           From the court steps, White watches Eric hurry off.  He seems 
           torn.  Behind him, Darrow emerges from a gaggle of press.

                                 DARROW
                        Well done, Mr. White.  Fine job.

                                 WHITE
                        You think it’s true?

                                 DARROW
                        True?

                                 WHITE
                        That he fired the shots?
                             (then, conflicted)
                        Can’t help feeling for the guy.

           Darrow looks at White, bemused.

                                 DARROW
                        That’s the trouble with your race, 
                        White.  You really think you people 
                        ought to win because it’s right.

           Darrow moves off.  Leaving White behind him, speechless.

                                 DARROW
                             (to himself, delighted)
                        Shell shock...what a world.
           EXT. GARLAND AVENUE - HOUGHBERG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eric limps up the porch to find the door has been left ajar.  
           A pair of WOMAN’S BLOOMERS lays fallen on the threshold.

           Eric picks them up, confused.  He enters the house.

           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is in a shambles.  Closets and drawers are open, 
           emptied out.  Eric limps from room to room in rising panic.  

                                 ERIC
                        Mary?  June?

           Eric stops short, seeing something.  A FOLDED NOTE rests on 
           the bureau.  His name written in script.  They’re gone.

           INT. PADDY WAGON, MOVING - NIGHT

           The defendants sit in the back of a paddy wagon, handcuffed 
           and jostled by the rutted road.  They’re in high spirits.

                                 MORSE
                        You see how he shook that 
                        peckerwood?  I’d say the 
                        motherfucker went white, but he 
                        already was!

           The others laugh.  Sweet, beaming, looks to Henry.

                                 SWEET
                        Told you brother, did I not?  The 
                        worm has turned.

                                 HENRY
                             (not sure)
                        Looks like.

                                 SWEET
                        Count on it.
                             (louder, to the group)
                        Gentlemen, mark your calendars.  
                        When we get out, dinner’s on me.

           The men hoot approval.  The good cheer carries into:

           INT. PADDY WAGON, MOVING - FRONT CAB - SAME

           The front cab of the paddy wagon.  Norton is seated shotgun, 
           stewing as the sounds of laughter filter from the rear.

           He glances to the Burly Guard behind the wheel.
           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Eric sits in the dark, nursing sips of whiskey from a bottle.  
           In his other hand, he holds the pair of woman’s bloomers.

           Eric stares at them.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - REAR GATE - NIGHT

           TORRENTIAL RAIN batters the prison compound.  The Burly Guard 
           leads Sweet and the defendants through a gate.

           Sweet looks back to see Norton watching from the window of 
           the paddy wagon.  Staring coldly, as it drives away.

           INT. HOUGHBERG HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Eric holds the whiskey bottle in one hand.  The bloomers in 
           the other, balled into a fist.  He stuffs the bloomers down 
           the bottle neck, upending it to douse them in the whiskey.

           He holds the bottle up:  a makeshift Molotov cocktail.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - NIGHT

           Rain continues falling as the defendants trudge through a 
           gate into the muddy yard.

                                 MORSE
                        So what is it we eating, Doc?  I 
                        just want some real food.  Slop 
                        they giving us may as well be dog.

                                 DAVIS
                        Might actually be dog.

           Laughter echoes in the yard.  Henry pauses in his tracks.

                                 HENRY
                        Hold up.

           Sweet and the other men follow his gaze.  The Burly Guard is 
           nowhere to be seen.  The defendants have been left alone.

           SIX WHITE PRISONERS step from the shadows in the yard.  The 
           LEADER holds a chain.  Sweet goes still, horror in his eyes.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The street is quiet.  Eric stands in the pouring rain outside 
           the vacant bungalow.  A lone man staring at his monolith.
           He holds the whiskey bottle in his hand.  Looking down, he 
           toes at something half-buried in the mud:  it’s Sweet’s 
           American flag; pole broken, fabric torn and drenched in mud.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - NIGHT

           The white prisoners loom in closer as Morse and Davis stand 
           their ground.  Murray, Latting, and Washington behind them.

           Henry moves to join them but Sweet holds him back.

                                 SWEET
                             (to Henry; firm)
                        It’s what they want...

           The white prisoners stop mere inches from Morse and the 
           others.  The leader staring like a mad dog, eye-to-eye.

           Rain pelts down between them.

                                 MORSE
                        Back off, crackers.

           The leader smiles.  Then spits right in Morse’s eye.  Morse 
           lunges at him, joined by the others -- and the fight is on.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Eric sets a lit match to the bloomers, igniting the cocktail.

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - NIGHT

           The white prisoners and black defendants continue brawling.  
           Mean and sloppy.  Latting and the hired men are no match for 
           the convicts, gutting hard but taking a beating.  Morse and 
           Davis have some fight in them but they’re outnumbered.  Davis 
           goes down first.  Then Morse takes a chain-whip to his jaw.

                                 HENRY
                        Morse!

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           With a primal scream, Eric flings the flaming bottle through 
           the air onto the roof, where it explodes...

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - NIGHT

           The white leader chain-whips Morse again as he lays prone.  
           Henry tries to join the fray but Sweet restrains him.
                                 HENRY
                             (struggling)
                        What’s wrong with you?  They’re 
                        killing him!

                                 SWEET
                        I’m trying to protect you!

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Eric.  Lit by the glow of flames.  Watching the fire spread 
           across the pitched roof of the bungalow...

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - YARD - NIGHT

           The brightness of a SPOTLIGHT bathes the yard as an ALARM 
           BELL sounds.  The white inmates scatter, leaving Latting, 
           Murray, Washington, and Davis, groaning in the mud.

           Morse is face down, motionless.

           Henry breaks free of Sweet and rushes over, flips Morse to 
           his back.  His head, a bloody pulp, flops lifelessly.

                                 HENRY
                        No.  Morse, brother, wake up...

                                 SWEET
                             (stepping up)
                        Move aside now.  Let me see him.

                                 HENRY
                        Stay away from him!

           Henry tackles Sweet into the mud.  Straddling him, shaking 
           him violently, furiously, with tears and hatred in his eyes.

                                 HENRY
                        You killed him...  You killed him!

           PRISON GUARDS rush in, dragging Henry off.  As Sweet looks 
           on, stunned, shattered.  Bleeding from a cut above his brow.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Eric slowly turns and limps, with effort, back toward his 
           house across the street.  Behind him, flames lick the 
           bungalow, but Eric doesn’t watch.  Just as a FIRE WAGON 
           rumbles up, he reenters his house and shuts the door.

           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER SIX  “THE SHOOTER”
           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - WOMEN’S BLOCK - DAY

           A new GUARD waits to the side as Gladys regards Sweet through 
           the cell bars.  His eyes are bloodshot.  His garb still caked 
           in mud.  The cut above his brow is stitched and bandaged.

                                 GLADYS
                        Henry did that?

                                 SWEET
                        He didn’t mean it.  The boy’s 
                        distraught.  He’ll come to his 
                        senses when he realizes that damned 
                        thug brought it on himself.

           Gladys stares, sees through the thin veneer of confidence.

                                 GLADYS
                        Promise me when this is over we’ll 
                        go home.

                                 SWEET
                        Soon.

                                 GLADYS
                        No.  Our home.  Where we belong...  
                        Not that place. 

           Sweet’s expression hardens.

                                 GLADYS
                             (continues; urgent)
                        We’ll find someplace new.  Far away 
                        from here -- like Paris, remember?

                                 SWEET
                        That house is mine.  I didn’t let 
                        them take it and I won’t let you.

                                 GLADYS
                        I’ll die in that house, Ossian!
                             (he stares at her)
                        ...I dreamed it.  And the angels, 
                        though they saw me, left my soul to 
                        linger there for all eternity.

                                 SWEET
                        You’re feverish.

                                 GLADYS
                        It’s punishment.  For pride.  
                        Idolatry.
                                 SWEET
                        Stop.

                                 GLADYS
                        They’re my sins, too.  I always 
                        wanted more than others -- my way 
                        of separating from the common folk.
                             (she grabs his wrist)
                        Ossian, that thing is in you too.  
                        Maybe it’s in all negroes.  The 
                        want to feel better ‘bout being 
                        yourself.  Like a real person, not 
                        some...afterthought that’s just 
                        plain there.  But a house ain’t 
                        gonna calm that feeling.

           She reaches for his cheek but he stops her; stares coldly.

                                 SWEET
                        I won’t back down.  I won’t.

                                 GLADYS
                             (she looks at him; and it 
                              breaks her heart because)
                        I know.

                                 SWEET
                             (after a pause; stern)
                        Be presentable tomorrow.  You stand 
                        before the world with my last name.

           The words strike Gladys like a slap.  Sweet walks away.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - VISITING CELL - NIGHT

           A newspaper hits the table.  Headline reads:  “NEGRO 
           PRISONERS INCITE RACE RIOT; 1 DEAD; CITY ON EDGE.”

                                 WHITE
                        We’re finished...

           White is pacing.  Darrow remains seated, nursing a hangover.  
           They are alone here; waiting for their clients to arrive.

                                 DARROW
                             (rolls his eyes)
                        Don’t be dramatic.

                                 WHITE
                        Easy for you to say.  You won’t be 
                        the one they lynch when this whole 
                        city erupts into a race war.
                                 DARROW
                        Correct me if I’m wrong, Mr. White.  
                        You picked this fight to win it.  
                        To prove for all the world that 
                        white supremacy can be defeated by 
                        the very system that created it.  
                        By the time this trial’s over, 
                        you’ll have donations in the bank 
                        to back a dozen more.  A permanent 
                        defense fund.  The courts can be 
                        the battleground where you win your 
                        equality.  Isn’t that the idea?

                                 WHITE
                        If we survive that long.

                                 DARROW
                        We won the day in court.

                                 WHITE
                        And the court of opinion?  Even 
                        jurors read the newspaper, Mr. 
                        Darrow.  They have families and 
                        children to think of, and this 
                        tells them our clients...our whole 
                        race is a public threat.  Acquit 
                        them and a riot breaks out.  Do you 
                        know how many black men I’ve seen 
                        hanged for less than that?
                             (tosses the newspaper)
                        We’re finished.

           Silence hangs between them for a beat.  Then, from off:

                                 SWEET (O.S.)
                        I want to testify.

           White and Darrow turn to see Sweet standing at the cell door, 
           accompanied by the same guard; they’ve just come from Gladys.

                                 SWEET
                        You’re right, Mr. White.  That jury 
                        has no reason to believe we’re 
                        anything but thugs and criminals.
                             (then)
                        So put me on the stand.  Let me 
                        show them otherwise.

                                 DARROW
                        No.  Absolutely not.

                           WHITE
           He’s right, it’s too risky --
                                                         DARROW
                                              Toms would have a field day --
                                 SWEET
                        I’m not asking for permission.

           This stops them both.  Sweet regards them.

                                 SWEET
                             (to Darrow, then White)
                        You’re scared I’ll ruin your 
                        reputation...and you’re afraid I’ll 
                        hurt your cause.  But this is my 
                        life.  My neck.  And if I’m going 
                        to swing by it, I’ll do that on my 
                        own terms.  I want to speak.

           With that, Sweet turns and walks back out the cell door, led 
           off by the guard.  White and Darrow look at one another.

                                 DARROW
                             (after a pause)
                        Well shoot.  I need a drink.

           INT. UPSCALE SPEAKEASY - DOWNTOWN DETROIT - NIGHT

           A higher end establishment than what we saw in Black Bottom.  
           A BLACK BAND plays buoyant ragtime as scantily clad FLAPPER 
           SHOWGIRLS shimmy on the stage.  The crowd is all white.

           Darrow pours champagne at a corner table.  White beside him.

                                 DARROW
                        You’re seeing culture at its 
                        finest, Mr. White.  Don’t get me 
                        wrong, the prohibiting of alcohol 
                        is damnedest folly and a senseless 
                        law by any measure, but our 
                        nation’s nightlife has become a 
                        great deal more exciting since we 
                        forced it underground.
                             (slides White a drink)
                        Drink up.

                                 WHITE
                        We need to do something.

                                 DARROW
                        And that we are.  One of my 
                        favorite things, in fact.

           Darrow sips his drink and savors it.  White rankles.

                                 WHITE
                        Those men on the jury don’t ride 
                        chauffeured limousines.  They don’t 
                        have medical degrees.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WHITE (CONT'D)
                        All they do have in this world is 
                        comfort in the fact at least 
                        they’re better than the negro.  If 
                        you put Sweet on that stand, he’ll 
                        prove that wrong.  They’ll hate him 
                        for it.

                                 DARROW
                        Most probably.

                                 WHITE
                        You aren’t worried?

                                 DARROW
                        Worry is a futile concept, Mr. 
                        White.  Be there calm or storm, the 
                        sun will rise.

           Darrow finishes his drink and pours another.

                                 WHITE
                        Must be nice to live in that world.

                                 DARROW
                        Forged over time, my friend.  And 
                        champagne helps the sentiment.
                             (then)
                        Tell me something, I’ve been 
                        curious.  You don’t look like a 
                        negro.  I mean, I understand there 
                        must be heritage to think of.  Some 
                        percentage of the blood, for what 
                        that’s worth.  But it seems to me

                        both worlds, if you wanted.  Why 
                        live your life carrying the cross 
                        for a group of people who wouldn’t 
                        even welcome you to Sunday dinner 
                        if they saw you on the street?

                                 WHITE
                        Why do you do what you do?

                                 DARROW
                        To get laid.
                             (shrugs)
                        Mainly that.  Plus, I can’t help 
                        being contrary.  The world’s so 
                        damned wrong most of the time, it 
                        feels good being a little right.
                             (beat)
                        But I still take vacations.
           Darrow sips his drink and stares out at the stage show.  
           White regards him.  No sign of any great emotion.  Then:

                                 WHITE
                        I watched my father lynched during 
                        a riot in Atlanta when I was six 
                        years old.  He was no darker than I 
                        am on the outside.  But he thought 
                        he could pass.  Did it for a time.  
                        Then they strung him up and burned 
                        him, and I watched little children 
                        my own age pick off pieces of his 
                        flesh for souvenirs.  His body was 
                        pretty black by that point so it 
                        worked out fine.

                                 DARROW
                             (after a long pause)
                        Christ.

           White takes his drink and downs it in a swallow.  Stands.

                                 WHITE
                        There’s a redhead over there.  I 
                        think she’s seen your picture in 
                        the paper.  Have fun, Mr. Darrow.

           Darrow watches him walk off.

                                 DARROW
                        Good advice.

           INT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - CELL - NIGHT

           Henry sits on the edge of his bunk.  He looks up at the SOUND 
           of footsteps.  From the shadows, Dunn appears at the barred 
           door, unlocks it and steps aside, revealing White.

                                 WHITE
                             (to Dunn)
                        That’s Dunn with two “n”s, right?

           Dunn nods and shuts the door behind him, walking off.  White 
           waits for the footsteps to recede.  Then:

                                 WHITE
                        Your brother wants to take the 
                        stand himself.  He wants to 
                        testify.

                                 HENRY
                             (short laugh)
                        He always did dream of an audience 
                        with white folks.  Now he’s got it.
                                 WHITE
                        You need to talk him out of it.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re not too observant for a 
                        writer, Mr. White.  Nobody talks 
                        that man out of anything.  He gets 
                        his mind set on a way, he takes it.

                                 WHITE
                        If he says the wrong thing up 
                        there, those men will hang him.  
                        And the rest of you with him.

                                 HENRY
                        Yep.

                                 WHITE
                        The prospect of death sits well 
                        with you?

                                 HENRY
                        Look around you, man.  If this 
                        ain’t death, it’s cousin to -- and 
                        ain’t no way them crackers letting 
                        our black asses out of here.  Soon 
                        as them bullets went into them 
                        white folks, our fate was set.  All 
                        else is just talk for talk’s sake.

                                 WHITE
                        Did Toms offer you a deal?

                                 HENRY
                             (regards him; shrugs)
                        They say if I put it all on Ossian 
                        they’ll hit us with public 
                        disturbance and we’re free.

                                 WHITE
                        So why aren’t we having this talk 
                        at a juke in Black Bottom?

           Henry stares forward for a long beat.  Into the shadows.

                                 HENRY
                        I remember when me and Ossian was 
                        kids...  Maybe twelve or thirteen, 
                        we’d go down to this watering hole 
                        to fish.  On this particular day we 
                        were with the Hillman brothers.  
                        Tommy and Kyle -- their daddy was a 
                        timber man so they got prime wood 
                        to make the best poles.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        And man was them fish biting...
                             (he smiles at the thought)
                        Across the way this older lady, 
                        Miss Anna, was fishing with her 
                        granddaughter.  We started us a 
                        little competition of sorts -- she 
                        catch a fish and stick her tongue 
                        out, then we would catch a fish and 
                        point back...  It was a good time.  
                        On a fine, fine day.

           Henry’s disposition darkens. 

                                 HENRY
                        Then these two white boys came.  We 
                        stopped playing the game.  No more 
                        flirting, no more fun.  Just 
                        fishing.  One of the white boys got 
                        hisself a bite and got so out of 
                        sorts he slipped and fell into the 
                        water.  We all looked away like you 
                        was supposed to, but Miss Anna’s 
                        granddaughter...  She laughed.
                             (pause)
                        Now me, Kyle and Tommy was way 
                        bigger than them white boys, so we 
                        move to step between, but Ossian 
                        blocked our way.  He told us to 
                        gather up our fish and poles and go 
                        about our business.
                             (tears push to his eyes)
                        Miss Anna tried to tell them white 
                        boys that the girl didn’t mean no 
                        harm, but they wasn’t listening.  
                        As we walked away I looked back to 
                        see the one beat Miss Anna in the 
                        head with a flat rock.  And her 
                        granddaughter...  They did things.  
                        I can still hear her screaming.  
                        And Ossian?  He whistled as we 
                        trekked the road.  “Sonny Boy.”  
                        You know the Jolson tune?

           White is dumbstruck.  Henry looks at him.

                                 HENRY
                        I will not turn against my brother.  
                        But whether we get out of here or 
                        not, I’ll never speak to him again.

           EXT. DETROIT STREETS - DAYBREAK

           The paddy wagon makes its way through town:  BLACK SUPPORTERS 
           cheer from church steps.  WHITE PROTESTERS jeer and catcall.
           The entire city is on edge.

           INT. PADDY WAGON, MOVING - SAME

           The defendants sit in silence.  Sweet, dressed in his best 
           suit, sits alone.  Embracing neither the jeers nor cheers.

           Henry is seated on the other bench.  Their eyes don’t meet.

           INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - COURTROOM - DAY

           The room is well beyond capacity, all silent.  Sweet is on 
           the witness stand.  The BAILIFF holds a Bible.

                                 BAILIFF
                        Do you solemnly swear to tell the 
                        truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
                        but the truth, so help you God?

                                 SWEET
                        I do.

           Darrow casts a glance to White over his shoulder, whispering.

                                 DARROW
                        That’s what I’m afraid of.
                             (then louder; as he stands 
                              and Sweet takes his seat)
                        Dr. Sweet, you take this oath of 
                        your own volition, do you not?

                                 SWEET
                        I do.

                                 DARROW
                        You had no obligation.

                                 SWEET
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        In fact no one, myself included, 
                        wanted you to testify here in your 
                        own defense.

                                 SWEET
                        We had a decent argument about it.

           This wins a minor chuckle from the crowd, even the jury.  A 
           good start.  White allows himself an exhale.  Darrow smiles.

                                 DARROW
                        That we did.  I warned you of the 
                        risks.  If you say the wrong word.

                        Put the wrong intonation in your 
                        voice.  Sit in a way that strikes 
                        these jurors as too casual.  Or too 
                        confident.  Grow rattled under 
                        cross-examination.  Succumb to a 
                        single flash of anger...  Whatever 
                        sympathy our side has won will be 
                        lost.  Our defense destroyed.  You 
                        understand all that?

                                 SWEET
                        I do.

                                 DARROW
                        But here you are.

                                 SWEET
                        I want them to know the man I am.  
                        In my own words.

                                 DARROW
                        Very well.  Let’s start with the 
                        obvious.  You are a negro man.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        A grandson of slaves on both sides.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        And you yourself were born and 
                        reared south of the Mason-Dixon 
                        line, in a backwater of Florida 
                        where horrors could and would 
                        befall the negro man with frequency 
                        and prejudice.

                                 SWEET
                        I saw things.

                                 DARROW
                        Horrors.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        The lynching of a man, his wife, 
                        and their six children because they 
                        had the temerity to own a piano.
           Sweet continues to respond in monosyllables, without emotion.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes. 

                                 DARROW
                        You saw them strung up by white men 
                        while your momma hid you in the 
                        reeds with a cotton gag plugged in 
                        your mouth so that you wouldn’t 
                        make a noise and be discovered.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        You were how old?

                                 SWEET
                        Four.

           The court is breathless, silent, as the horror resonates.

                                 DARROW
                        Four years after that, you left the 
                        South.  Came north.  Looking for 
                        that America we’re told about, 
                        where law is just and life’s not 
                        cheap.  But did the horrors end?

                                 SWEET
                        They did not.

                                 DARROW
                        No, you watched brothers of your 
                        fraternity in college -- a negro 
                        college -- the best men of your 
                        race shot down in a white pogrom.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        While policemen stood in silence.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        You yourself were nearly killed by 
                        fire when white men torched the 
                        colored section of Chicago.
                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        Where you were practicing to be a 
                        doctor.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        In fact if I asked how many violent 
                        deaths of black men at the hands of 
                        whites you’ve witnessed with your 
                        own eyes, close as I stand next to 
                        you, could you tell me?  Could you 
                        even count that high?

                                 SWEET
                             (pause)
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        And every one, dead at the hands of 
                        whites.  You’ll forgive me, Doctor, 
                        but after all that, all that horror 
                        you saw done to black men just for 
                        the crime of being black, tell me 
                        why in God’s name did you move your 
                        family to Garland Avenue, a street 
                        you knew full well was lily white?

                                 SWEET
                        Because I don’t believe that’s what 
                        defines us.

                                 DARROW
                        Color.

                                 SWEET
                        I believed they would see me for 
                        me.

                                 DARROW
                        An upstanding citizen.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        A proud American.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.
                                 DARROW
                        You even hung a flag that day.

           This detail catches Sweet.  The first hint of emotion as we:

           FLASHBACK:  EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - DAY

           Moving day.  The moment we saw.  Sweet unrolling something 
           from a pole:  a crisp new AMERICAN FLAG.  His VOICE is heard:

                                 SWEET (V.O.)
                        I bought it as a student, years ago 
                        on a July Fourth.  Always hoped one 
                        day I’d have a place to hang it.  
                        That’s why I picked that house.  My 
                        own wife doesn’t know it.  Never 
                        told a soul.  But I knew I had to 
                        have it when I saw it had a little 
                        notch already cut into the porch 
                        post.  Just the right size.

           Sweet slots the flag into the notch.  It flaps in the breeze.

           RETURN TO SCENE.

                                 DARROW
                        It was flying as those people 
                        gathered there to drive you out.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        You thought when they saw you, a 
                        man who works hard, at the top of 
                        his profession -- an American -- 
                        with no vices other than the ones 
                        we all have as people, you’d be 
                        accepted as a neighbor.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        And what was that thought met with?

           Darrow stares at Sweet, confronting him.  A beat.

                                 SWEET
                        It looked like a human sea.

                                 DARROW
                        The mob.
                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        You gave those folks a chance to 
                        see you for the man you are, and 
                        yet they came at you like an enemy.  
                        That’s how they repaid your faith.

           This is hard for Sweet.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        But here you are.  Giving twelve 
                        white men a chance to judge you the 
                        same way.  After all that, you 
                        still believe that they can do that 
                        fairly?  You put faith in them?

                                 SWEET
                             (after a pause)
                        Yes.  I do.

           Darrow looks at the jury.  Meets their eyes, judgment in his.

                                 DARROW
                        Let’s hope they deserve it.
                             (beat; to Toms)
                        Your witness.

           Darrow returns to his chair near White, who leans in.

                                 WHITE
                             (sotto; hopeful)
                        That wasn’t so bad.

                                 DARROW
                        That was the easy part.

           Toms rises to his feet, addresses Sweet.

                                 TOMS
                        You say you’re here to show this 
                        court what kind of man you are.  So 
                        what kind are you.  A decent man?

                                 SWEET
                        I hope to be.

                                 TOMS
                        A law abiding man?
                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 TOMS
                        Well that’s debatable.  How about a 
                        leader of your own community?

           Toms gestures to the black folks in the gallery.

                                 SWEET
                        I am an accomplished man.

                                 TOMS
                        Who abandoned his community.

                                 SWEET
                             (flustered)
                        No.

                                 TOMS
                        Didn’t you, though?  Isn’t that why 
                        we’re all here?  You were a leader 
                        in Black Bottom.  A doctor folks 
                        looked up to.  Trusted with their 
                        lives.  Paid hard-earned money.  
                        They made you the successful man 
                        you are.  And you left them.  First 
                        chance you got.  You moved right 
                        out.  To Garland Avenue.  In a 
                        chauffeured limousine.  To live 
                        among the whites.

                                 SWEET
                        It wasn’t about that.

                                 TOMS
                        Then what was it?

                                 SWEET
                        I have a family.  I wanted to 
                        provide.  Give them a better 
                        situation...

                                 TOMS
                        This family?  The ones for whom 
                        your actions led right here?

           Toms points to Henry, Gladys.  Their stares are cold.

                                 SWEET
                        We were attacked!

                                 TOMS
                        So you’re a victim?
                                 SWEET
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 TOMS
                        Then you’re a murderer?

           Toms is up in Sweet’s face now, rattling him.  This back-and-
           forth continuing at full-speed, almost overlapping:

                                 SWEET
                        No --

                                 TOMS
                        Well you must be one or the other!

                                 SWEET
                        You don’t understand --

                                 TOMS
                        Then tell me!  Tell us all what 
                        kind of man you are!  A selfish 
                        man?

                                 SWEET
                        No --

                                 TOMS
                        A prideful man?

                                 SWEET
                        No --

                                 TOMS
                        You want to know who I see, Doctor?  
                        I see an angry man.  That’s why you 
                        had your brother shoot those men.

                                 SWEET
                        No!

                                 TOMS
                        You hated those white men.

                                 SWEET
                        No --

                                 TOMS
                        Because they hated you!

                                 SWEET
                        Because they made me hate me!

           The outburst echoes in the court.  The gallery reacts.  White 
           and Darrow wince.  Sweet is shaken with emotion.  Simmering.
                                 SWEET
                             (emotion pouring forth)
                        I came there in peace.  I put up a 
                        flag.  My friends laughed at me.  
                        My own brother...
                             (he looks to Henry, who 
                              meets his stare, cold)
                        My brother, who I love more than 
                        anything in this world -- called me 
                        a coward.  Because I believed in 
                        decency.  Because I had a flag that 
                        I thought meant I was American.
                             (beat)
                        And they tore it down, Mr. Toms.  
                        Right off that post.

           FLASHBACK:  EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           The mob scene.  Breiner and some other men are up on the 
           porch steps, tugging at Sweet’s flagpole.

           It snaps in half and we HEAR it like a thunderclap.

                                 SWEET (V.O.)
                        They snapped it in two.

           Sweet and Henry are struggling over the gun when Sweet sees 
           it from the upstairs window.  In the yard below:

                        I saw it then.  Clearer maybe than 
                        I ever had.  The way they looked at 
                        me.  The me they saw.  No matter 
                        how many degrees I get, or fancy 
                        clothes, or cars, or things.  No 
                        matter how well I speak or carry 
                        myself, to every white that walks 
                        the earth I’m still no more than a 
                        low down dirty nigger...  And 
                        there’s nothing I can do about it.

           FLASHBACK:  INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME

           Sweet, staring at the mob below.  A writhing horde of rage 
           and fear.  His fingers tighten on the grip of Henry’s gun.
                                 SWEET (V.O.)
                        ...Nothing.

           RETURN TO SCENE.

                                 TOMS
                             (realizes; surprised)
                        You shot those men yourself?

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

           Stunned murmurs ripple the gallery, whites and blacks alike.

                                 TOMS
                        You meant to kill them.

                                 SWEET
                        Yes.

                                 TOMS
                        And you’d do it again right now.

           Tears streak Sweet’s cheeks, but he is beyond caring.

                                 SWEET
                        Wouldn’t you?

                                 TOMS
                             (turns away)
                        No further questions.

                                 SWEET
                        I asked you a question.

           This stops Toms, faltering.  Unsure how to answer it.  Sweet 
           looks to the jury, raw with emotion.  Meets their stares.

                                 SWEET
                        ...Wouldn’t you?

           The courtroom is in silence.  Gladys shuts her eyes.  Henry 
           is still staring at his older brother.  Ice in his eyes.

           White leans up to Darrow, whispering.  Both men at a loss.

                                 WHITE
                        Did he just save or kill us?

                                 DARROW
                             (after a pause)
                        Damned if I know.
           TITLE CARD:  CHAPTER SEVEN  “JUSTICE”

           EXT. DETROIT STREETS - DAY

           The city streets are quiet.  Eerily deserted.

           INT. BLACK BOTTOM AME CHURCH - DAY

           BLACK PARISHIONERS file into the church, packing the pews.  A 
           large tube RADIO is set up on the pulpit.  For the verdict.

           INT. AUTOMAT RESTAURANT - DAY

           WHITE PATRONS sit in silence, awaiting the broadcast.

           EXT. BRIGGS STADIUM - DAY

           Home of the Detroit Tigers.  But no game is in session.  A 
           large speaker is set up in the field.  The crowd is still.

           EXT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

           POLICE with helmets and billy clubs position themselves on 
           the court steps, keeping the onlookers at bay.  PRESS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS crowd through the doors.  The verdict is in.

           INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Tenterhooks.  An envelope is passed from hand to hand up to 
           Judge Murphy, who opens it and reads impassively, then hands 
           the page back to the Bailiff, who returns it to the FOREMAN.

           White holds his breath.  Darrow is not doodling.

           Sweet looks to Gladys on one side, takes her hand, then looks 
           to Henry on the other.  Henry stares ahead, ignoring him.

                                 JUDGE MURPHY
                        The foreman may read the verdict.

                                 FOREMAN
                        We the jury, in the case of the 
                        People versus Ossian Sweet, et 
                        al...do find the defendants not 
                        guilty of all charges.

           The room erupts.  White leaps from his seat, shaking Darrow’s 
           hand.  Black folks in the gallery embrace in tears.  Latting, 
           Murray, Washington, and Davis are celebrating cheerfully.

           Sweet stands alone, somewhat in shock.  He looks to Gladys.  
           There’s love in her eyes.  But also something else.
                                 SWEET
                        We did it.  We won.

                                 GLADYS
                             (after a pause; says this 
                              as a fact, no judgment)
                        You did.

           Sweet turns to see Henry walking toward him up the aisle.

                                 SWEET
                        Henry, we did it, we’re free --

           Sweet moves to him, but Henry walks past Sweet without a 
           word.  Sweet watches helplessly as Henry walks away.

           INT. MICHIGAN CENTRAL STATION - LATE DAY

           Shafts of sunlight flood the platform mobbed with people.  
           White and Darrow stand beneath the giant flap display.

           Darrow regards a new copy of “The Crisis” magazine.  Headline 
           reads:  “NAACP VICTORIOUS!  JUSTICE AND PEACE PREVAIL.”

                                 DARROW
                        Well...you did it, Mr. White.  And 
                        nary a race riot to be seen.

                                 WHITE
                        That’s a good thing.

                                 DARROW
                        A better thing is the financial 
                        forecast of your little group.  
                        I’ve heard money is pouring in.

                                 WHITE
                             (nods)
                        It seems this fiasco has raised 
                        folks’ hopes for the prospect of 
                        real integration.

           The way White says this makes it seem he’s not so optimistic.

                                 DARROW
                        Hasn’t it raised yours?
                             (wry)
                        Now that we’ve conquered the 
                        scourge of hatred in America?

                                 WHITE
                        I guess I’ll retire.
                                 DARROW
                        At least a vacation.  Or a bourbon 
                        on the rocks.

           White smiles drily.  The flap-board clacks and reconfigures 
           into new departure times.  Darrow checks his ticket.

                                 DARROW
                        That’s me.
                             (then, almost as an 
                              afterthought)
                        You did a good thing, Mr. White.  
                        Just because it won’t make any 
                        difference in the long run, isn’t 
                        any reason not to celebrate that.

           This catches White off-guard.  Darrow tips his hat.

                                 DARROW
                        Safe travels, Walter.

           He walks off, merging with the shifting sea of people on the 
           platform.  Leaving White just standing there.  Alone.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - LATE DAY

           Sweet steps through the empty house.  A ghost house.  Vacant.  
           Wind whistles through the broken windows.  There’s water 
           damage on the floorboards.  Dust and cobwebs everywhere.  
           What furniture there was, is gone.  Probably looted.

           Sweet pauses at the bedroom.  Steps inside.

           INT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - LATE DAY

           The four-poster bed is still here but its mattress has been 
           carved up with a knife.  The sheets in tatters.

           Sweet regards them for a beat.  Without emotion.

           EXT. GARLAND BUNGALOW - DUSK

           Sweet stuffs the tattered sheets into a garbage can.  It’s 
           almost dark.  The street is quiet.  He shuts the lid and 
           wipes his hands.  Then pauses.  He looks up.

           Eric is on the porch behind him.  He is working the bloodied, 
           tattered American flag onto a mended pole.  Sweet watches 
           intently as Eric fits the pole into its socket on the post, 
           then shapes the flag into a neat drape.  He salutes it.

                                 ERIC
                        Can’t do much about the blood.  But 
                        then again maybe it should stay.
                                 SWEET
                        Maybe.

           The two men look at one another for a moment.

           An eternity.  Then:

                                 ERIC
                        Looks like rain.

           Sweet steps up the porch to follow Eric’s gaze.  Both men 
           look out.  A dark thunderhead looms on the horizon.

                                 SWEET
                        Yeah, looks like it’ll let go for a 
                        while, too.

                                 ERIC
                        You better get that roof patched.

           Sweet regards the charred patch on the bungalow.

                                 SWEET
                        Yeah.

           Both men stare at the bungalow.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah.

           Eric nods and walks back toward his house across the street.

           Sweet gazes at the bungalow for one more moment, then walks 
           back in and shuts the door.

           TIME LAPSE BEGINS as we hold on the bungalow, day fading into 
           night, then day again, as years elapse before our eyes...

           TITLE CARDS:

                   THE SWEET CASE PUT THE NAACP ON THE MAP.  BUOYED BY 
                   NATIONAL PRESS AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT, THE ORGANIZATION 
                   WAS ABLE TO FURTHER ITS REACH THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

                   IN 1929, WALTER WHITE BECAME ITS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY.  
                   FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY HE DIRECTED A BROAD 
                   PROGRAM OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO RACISM IN AMERICA.

                   AMONG THESE WAS THE LANDMARK SUPREME COURT VICTORY IN 
                   BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, WHICH LED TO THE END OF 
                   LEGAL SEGREGATION.

                   WHITE DIED JUST MONTHS LATER IN 1955.
           Then:

                   NEITHER GLADYS NOR HENRY SWEET EVER GOT TO LIVE ON 
                   GARLAND AVENUE.  BOTH SUCCUMBED TO CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS 
                   THEY CONTRACTED IN THE JAIL WHILE STANDING TRIAL. 

                   OSSIAN SWEET CONTINUED LIVING THERE UNTIL 1958, WHEN 
                   FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS FORCED HIM TO MOVE OUT.

                   THE NEXT YEAR, HE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

           The TIME LAPSE ENDS in present day Detroit.  The bungalow is 
           now the only well-kept building on a rundown street of 
           boarded houses.  POLICE SIRENS can be heard in the distance.

                   THE HOUSE ON GARLAND AVENUE IS LISTED ON THE NATIONAL 
                   REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES.  IT STANDS TO THIS DAY.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
