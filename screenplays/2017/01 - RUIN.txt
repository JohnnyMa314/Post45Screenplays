           EXT. LAKESHORE - DUSK

           Dusk falls on a quiet lake in some far corner of Germany. 

           The wind whips across the surface, stirring up ripples. 
           Faintly, in the background, we hear-- 

           The sound of a man's labored breathing.

                                                             HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE - RUINED HOME - AFTERNOON

           Two eyes, the color of the sea. As they spring open, there's a 
           brief moment of sharp tension - then they go still. Hollow.

           THE CAPTAIN sits in the ashen ruins of a home, a WEATHERED 
           RIFLE lying heavy on his broad shoulders. Dirty blond hair. 
           Thick beard. Cold eyes. German. 

           He turns the collar of his worn leather overcoat up against 
           the cold. He's a solemn shell of a man - a powerful frame 
           with nothing left inside.

                                 TEXT: Germany, Fall 1945
                           Six months after the end of the war.

           The Captain racks a bullet into the chamber. It's time.

           Rising to one knee, he steadies his rifle on the remains of a 
           wall, and sights through the chipped glass scope.

           SCOPE POV: A RUNDOWN FARMHOUSE comes into focus. In the 
           circle of the crosshairs, a gray, tired face, a soldier’s 
           face. This is KONRAD (20s). Plainclothes and haggard, he 
           holds a BATTERED CARBINE at the ready.

           The Captain flicks off the safety on his rifle. In the 
           distance, a small engine coughs and sputters--

           SCOPE POV: A battered TRUCK with a cracked windshield pulls 
           up. It's driven by ECKHART (30s), thin and balding. He 
           signals to Konrad as he disappears into the farmhouse.

           The Captain wraps his finger around the trigger. Then his 
           hand gently begins to shake. He pulls it back. Closes his 
           eyes. Waits for it to pass. Finally--

           He aims carefully, hand steady now. He takes a deep breath. 
           Lets it out. CRACK.

           SCOPE POV: There's a slight delay, then - BANG. Konrad's head 
           BURSTS OPEN. His body topples to the ground.
           The Captain racks another bullet into the chamber.

           SCOPE POV: Eckhart rushes out of the farmhouse, stumbling 
           over Konrad's body. He freezes. Our crosshairs are fixed 
           right on his head. Then--

           The Captain lowers the rifle by a single degree. CRACK.

           SCOPE POV: Eckhart's groin EXPLODES. He goes down.

           The Captain calmly ejects the shell, and begins the long walk 
           to his wounded target. He's in no hurry.

           EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eckhart rolls on the muddy ground, moaning in agony.

           NOTE: As the film mixes multiple languages, all non-English 
           dialogue is noted and italicized.

           The Captain steps over Konrad's body and approaches Eckhart. 
           The man's eyes focus on the Captain, he registers the rifle. 
           Suddenly understands. In German:

                                 ECKHART
                        Coward... 

           He's in too much pain. Spittle collecting on his chin, he 
           can't even get the words out.

           The Captain doesn't even blink. He leans down and grabs 
           Eckhart by the arms, dragging him towards the farmhouse.

                                 ECKHART 
                        Wh-what are you doing?

           The Captain drops Eckhart on his back, and positions his head 
           between the door and the door-frame. 

                                 ECKHART 
                        STOP! Stop! Wait!

           The Captain grips the door tightly, then - WHAM! He slams it 
           against Eckhart's head with incredible force.

           Eckhart's lights go out for a brief moment. He recovers.

                                 ECKHART 
                        You traitor...

           WHAM! Another shot to the head.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Where's Richter?
                                 ECKHART
                        What?

           WHAM! Eckhart coughs out blood and teeth. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Where is Richter?

           Eckhart starts to laugh - delirious with pain.

                                 ECKHART
                        They're going to cut you open and 
                        hang your body from a tree.

           Eckhart continues to laugh, madly now. He's losing it.

                                 ECKHART 
                        You think if you kill us, they'll 
                        let you go? You're a dead man. 

           WHAM! The Captain hits him again. He stops laughing.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You have one more chance.

           A terrifying lucidity seems to come over Eckhart. He looks 
           the Captain right in the eye.

                                 ECKHART
                        "My honor is loyalty."

           Eckhart shakily pulls aside his shirt to reveal: A black SS 
           Death's Head Tattoo just beneath his collarbone.

           The Captain stares down at it, grey-blue eyes hard as stone. 
           Then, from a distance, we watch as he takes hold of the door 
           and slams it as hard as he can. Again and again and again. 

           The Captain wipes a fleck of blood from his cheek, then bends 
           down and removes a bloody set of DOG TAGS from around the 
           dead man's neck. He puts them in his pocket. 

           A heavy stillness. Only the sound of the Captain's labored 
           breathing and the MUFFLED CRACKLE OF A RADIO. After a moment, 
           he follows the sound into--

           THE FARMHOUSE

           In one corner, a 35MM STILL CAMERA and TRIPOD faces a CLEAN, 
           WHITE SHEET tacked tightly to the wall. PHOTO CHEMICALS and 
           PROCESSING TRAYS rest on a nearby table.

           On a desk in the other corner is a PORTABLE MILITARY RADIO 
           connected to a rusted MICROPHONE.
                                 MAN'S VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        This is Radio Werwolf: voice of the
                        German Freedom movement in the
                        enemy-occupied territories...

           The Captain takes a step towards the desk, discovers--

           Several PASSPORT-SIZED PHOTOS of Eckhart, Konrad, and a few 
           other German men fanned out atop Eckhart's LEATHER-BOUND 
           LEDGER. He brushes them aside, revealing-- 

           OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT-ISSUE PASSPORTS. All of them blank, 
           waiting to be forged and falsified.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (ON RADIO) 
                        Our duty is to the Reich. Traitors, 
                        cowards and defeatists shall be 
                        destroyed...

           One of the PHOTOS suddenly gets the Captain's attention. He 
           picks it up slowly, studies it with a quiet intensity--

           In grainy black and white, a man's face, cold eyes and jet-
           black hair, stares defiantly back at us. A man who has never 
           apologized for anything. This is ANTON RICHTER.

           The Captain's hand shakes almost imperceptibly - Richter's 
           eyes taking him back to dark places. He lowers the photo, 
           looks over at the radio transmitter-- 

                                 MAN'S VOICE (ON RADIO) 
                        Our love for country has only grown 
                        stronger in hate. Behind us lie 
                        ruins, but before us lies the 
                        future....

           The Captain reaches down and gently turns a knob on the 
           record player - CLICK - transforming the broadcast into 
           nothing but HISSING STATIC.

           With that, he gathers the ledger, turns, and steps over the 
           ruined bodies of the dead men out into the morning.

           PRE-LAP: The hum of a speeding engine.

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY, OPEN ROAD - CREDITS

           The Captain roars full speed on his RUSTED MOTORCYCLE down a 
           desolate highway, eyes straight ahead. It's a worn, MATTE-
           BLACK 1941 ZUNDAPP 750. The growl of the engine is deafening.

                                 TITLE: RUIN
           The Captain and his Zundapp speed through a wasteland of 
           burnt fields and demolished buildings. Everything as far as 
           we can see is ashes and ruin.

           OPENING CREDITS. 

           GENUINE RADIO WERWOLF BROADCASTS play over everything we see:

                                 RADIO WERWOLF (V.O.)
                        Everything we own has been smashed 
                        and burned by the invading 
                        Allies...

           Tires grip the asphalt as the Captain floats across the 
           blackness of the road. A ghost in an empty landscape. 

                                 RADIO WERWOLF (V.O.) 
                        Everyone we love, mothers and 
                        fathers, women and children, 
                        murdered by Allied bombers...

           He passes an OLD MAN'S CORPSE left to rot on the side of the 
           road, eyes wide open, staring up at the heavens.

           He passes an ornate six-hundred year old CATHEDRAL, reduced 
           to a single wall, where GERMAN GRAFFITI is scrawled: Traitors 
           Beware. Werwolf is watching. 

                                 RADIO WERWOLF (V.O.) 
                        Germany lies in chaos. A land 
                        divided. A land without laws. But 
                        we are here!

           A group of STRAY ORPHANS, ages six to ten, run alongside the 
           road, begging him to stop. They're filthy, malnourished and 
           terrified. He keeps driving.

           A FERAL DOG, more bone than flesh, keeps a nervous eye on the 
           Captain and his bike as they race past.

                                 RADIO WERWOLF (V.O.) 
                        We call all revolutionaries! 
                        Werwolves! Rise up! We fight and 
                        die for the German future...

           On the roadside ahead, A SOVIET MILITARY CONVOY has stopped. 
           A handful of RED ARMY SOLDIERS stand around, drinking from a 
           bottle of vodka, piss-drunk, pointing at-- 

           A gnarled, 200-year-old oak tree where the CORPSES OF THREE 
           GERMAN SOLDIERS hang by their necks, swaying with the breeze. 
           CRUDELY-PAINTED SWASTIKAS cover their dirty uniforms.
                                 RADIO WERWOLF (V.O.) 
                         Death to our enemies! We will win our 
                         freedom! Germany will rise again!

           A few SOLDIERS blearily eye the Captain as he rumbles past, 
           too drunk or too tired to care. The Captain keeps his head 
           down. As soon as he's out of sight--

           He rips the throttle, putting distance between him and the 
           Soviets, heading for a DENSE TREE-LINE on the horizon.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK

           The Captain sits in an ashen meadow, alone. A small CAMPFIRE 
           trails a weak plume of smoke into the darkening sky. The 
           intermittent CLINK of the cooling motorcycle is all we hear.

           With incredible care, The Captain tunes the well-worn bike, 
           working with a set of HOMEMADE TOOLS. His practiced hands oil 
           the chain, gauge tire pressure. For him, it's more than a 
           motorcycle. It's a companion.

           He digs through his SADDLEBAGS, finds a spare shirt. As he 
           changes, we catch a glimpse of a BRUTAL-LOOKING SCAR, just 
           below his collarbone - the exact same size and shape as 
           Eckhart's "Death's Head" tattoo.

           The Captain lays out Eckhart's Leather-bound Ledger, 
           carefully reading and re-reading its orderly pages: NAMES, 
           ADDRESSES, NOTES. Information on the Werwolves' Operation. 

           CAMPFIRE - LATER

           It's dark out now. The Captain sits, still and quiet, an 
           unsettling hollowness in his eyes. He stares at the fire, 
           watches it burn.

           He's holding something but we can't see what it is. Then--

           The Captain raises his LUGER. He calmly places the barrel in 
           his mouth, wraps his finger around the trigger, and holds it 
           there for the longest time. 

           His breathing is heavy, but his face is impossible to read. 
           Unlike the killings before, his hand is steady, no tremors. 

           He's not scared. He's not desperate. He's simply nothing at all.

           The wood in the fire pops and hisses.

           He takes the gun out of his mouth.
           EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - THATCHED COTTAGE - LATER

           The front door of a cottage bursts open as A GERMAN MOTHER is 
           dragged out by two POLISH POLICE OFFICERS - thugs for the 
           Soviets. She screams, desperately reaching back for--

           Her six year-old SON, who's being carried out by another 
           POLISH POLICE OFFICER. A SOVIET OFFICER stands nearby, 
           supervising, almost bored. This family is Volksdeutsche, 
           Polish citizens that are still ethnically-German.

           A gathered CROWD watches as--

           The Police Officers toss the mother and her child into the 
           street. She grabs hold of her son, squeezing him tightly, 
           lost in a fit of hysteria. In peasant German (no subtitles):

                                 VOLKSDEUTSCHE MOTHER
                        PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!

           Two more POLISH POLICE OFFICERS emerge from the house, 
           dragging a GERMAN TEENAGE BOY with them. He goes quietly, 
           doesn't resist or fight back - trying to protect his family.

           The Captain passes through the crowd, watching silently as--

           They lead the teen to a nearby JEEP idling in the road. They 
           don't carry guns, but LARGE WOODEN BATONS, stained dark with 
           dried blood. 

           Most people in the crowd stay quiet, but a few wild-eyed 
           POLISH NATIONALISTS hurl insults at the condemned family--

                                 NATIONALISTS
                        SEND THEM HOME! They don't belong 
                        here anymore!

           Suddenly, the little boy breaks free of his mother's grasp, 
           racing over to his brother. He grabs hold of his leg, crying.

           One of the Police Officers swats at him with his stick, 
           catching him clean in the jaw. The boy topples to the ground.

                                 VOLKSDEUTSCHE TEEN
                        NO!!!

           The brother snaps, swinging wildly at the Police Officers. He 
           lands a couple of blows, but within seconds--

           He's flat on the ground, being beaten by the Officers' heavy 
           batons. No mercy.

           The mother SHRIEKS in horror while the other Officers hold 
           her down--
           The Captain closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. Fights to 
           keep everything inside of him. Then-- 

           Turns and disappears into the crowd.

           INT. SMALL VILLAGE - ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Captain walks slowly through a filthy alley, carefully 
           scanning the rooftops, searching for something. Finally, he 
           stops at--

           A well-hidden COIL OF WIRES running out from a window on the 
           TOP FLOOR of a nearby APARTMENT BUILDING. The wires run up to 
           a carefully-camouflaged RADIO ANTENNA on the roof. 

           If you weren't looking, you'd never notice it.

                                 GERMAN RADIO VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        There are four Soviet jeeps working 
                        in steady rotation--

           INT. RADIO WERWOLF - BASEMENT STATION - THAT MOMENT

           A shabby basement with peeling wallpaper. BROADCASTING 
           EQUIPMENT crowds the wooden desk in the middle of the room. 

           Hunched over a heavy, oversized MICROPHONE, PETR MÜELLER 
           (30s) sits murmuring in the dim light of a bare bulb, leather 
           HEADPHONES perched on his balding head. 

           Beside him, KLAUS PLISKA (30s), reads off a missive through a 
           pair of greasy EYEGLASSES.

           In the far corner of the room, a SKINNY BLOND KID plays with 
           an SS DAGGER, pouring over a map of Divided Germany.

                                 PETR
                        One truck in the camp at all times, 
                        five men per truck--

           Suddenly, Klaus puts a hand on Petr's arm, silencing him.

                                 PETR 
                        What is it...?

                                 KLAUS
                        Do you hear that?

           They both listen, carefully. The kid stares at the men 
           nervously. After a long moment of silence--

           Petr returns to his microphone, speaking quietly--
                                 PETR
                        We'll find her. Of course. My honor 
                        is loyal--

           There's a FAINT CREAK from the other side of the door. Klaus 
           signals to Petr again. They go quiet. Listening. Klaus slowly 
           stands, peering curiously at--

           The FADED RED DOOR leading to the hall. 

           Petr sits, frozen. Klaus takes a small step closer, tilts his 
           head, trying to hear above his own heartbeat. The kid grips 
           his dagger tightly.

           It's dead quiet. Then--

           The DOOR BURSTS WIDE OPEN as the Captain storms into the 
           room. Klaus goes for his gun, but he's too slow--

           The Captain SMASHES his face with his LUGER, shattering his 
           glasses into his eyes. Klaus screams, blinded.

           Petr tries to stand, but the Captain pistol-whips him back 
           into his chair. In one swift motion, the Captain unsheathes a 
           BLADE and jams it right through Petr's hand, pinning it to 
           the wooden desk. It's all over in seconds. 

           The skinny blond kid stands, paralyzed. His dagger abandoned 
           on the floor. The Captain rounds on him--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Go home.

           He stumbles to the door, fleeing without another look back. 
           The Captain turns back to Petr--

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        Tell me how to find Richter.

           Petr is in hysterics, half-screaming, half-babbling:

                                 PETR
                        I-I don't, I-I--

           The Captain shoves the barrel of his Luger into the man's 
           temple, pressing Petr's face down onto the rough wooden desk.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Tell me.

                                 PETR
                        I-I haven't seen him since the war. 
                        Not since Einehof-- 
           Just then, Klaus staggers to his feet:

                                 KLAUS
                        Tell him nothing!

           He makes a half-blind charge, but he doesn't make it three 
           steps before the Captain blows his head wide-open.

           The Captain presses the burning-hot barrel of the freshly-
           fired Luger into Petr's eye. It sizzles, burning into his 
           sclera like a branding iron.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        WHERE IS HE?

           Petr cries out in agony-- 

                                 PETR
                        GOD NO! STOP, ANYTHING--

           The Captain pulls back the gun. Petr finds his voice: 

                                 PETR 
                        He doesn't tell us where he is - he 
                        never has, I swear to you! But-but 
                        there's a refugee camp, just east of 
                        here, near Gross-Rosen--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Which camp?

                                 PETR
                        Liegnitz! It's called Liegnitz. 
                        There was some girl, she came to 
                        the Soviets there, claiming she 
                        knew everything about Richter--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        What's her name?

                                 PETR
                        I don't rememb--

           The Captain moves the gun two inches towards Petr's eye--

                                 PETR 
                        Elsa. IT'S ELSA! Richter's whore 
                        from the camps! She says she knows 
                        where he is! 

           The Captain loosens his grip for a moment. That name brings 
           back hard memories.
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ...Elsa's dead.

                                 PETR
                        She's not. Two weeks ago she 
                        registered at Liegnitz. Richter 
                        sent us here. To kill her.

           The Captain absorbs this, shaken. Slowly, he regains control. 
           He rips off Petr’s DOG TAGS from beneath his shirt--

           At this, Petr suddenly stops shaking. It's over for him, and 
           he knows it. The Captain stares down at him, then notices--

           The heavy metal MICROPHONE next to Petr's face. A dim red 
           light burns faintly. It's been LIVE ON AIR this entire time. 

           As both men realize this, Petr screams out:

                                 PETR 
                        GET TO LIEGNITZ! KILL THE GIRL! 
                        KILL ELSA! KILL HER!

           The Captain seizes the microphone, raising it high above 
           Petr's head. As he brings it CRASHING DOWN, WE CUT TO--

           INT. RICHTER'S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ANTON RICHTER (40s), same jet-black hair and jet-black eyes as 
           the photo, sits in the warm glow of a dying lantern, a 
           PORTABLE MILITARY-GRADE RADIO on the table in front of him, 
           listening to--

           The steady THUMP of the Captain's violence. 

           Richter flinches, almost invisibly, with each blow.

           At the sound of SOFT FOOTSTEPS from down the hall, he shuts 
           off the radio. The door slowly opens to reveal--

           LENI, an adorable blonde-haired, blue-eyed toddler, wearing a 
           white smock and yellow rainboots. She stares at Richter, 
           expectantly, before finally raising her hands. In German: 

                                 LENI
                        Vatti...

                                 RICHTER
                        Schatzi...

           Her lip quivers as she holds out her hands, pleading.
                                 RICHTER 
                        I'm sorry. Is it time to feed the 
                        chickens?

           Leni gives him a big nod--

                                 LENI
                        Huhn!

           Richter walks over and lifts her up in his arms.

                                 RICHTER
                        Okay. Let's go feed the chickens.

           Leni smiles as he carries her out the FRONT DOOR--

           EXT. LAKEHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           A small COTTAGE next to an idyllic LAKE. It's quaint and 
           charming - wood shingles and exposed beams. Nearby is--

           A SMALL CHICKEN COOP where a half-dozen CHICKENS run amok. 
           Leni and Richter stand outside the fence, tossing handfuls of 
           grain to the birds. The whole scene is like something out of 
           a German postcard.

           Richter stares out into the distance, his face suddenly cold 
           and dangerous in the late afternoon light.

           PRE-LAP: The angry ROAR of an unruly mob.

           EXT. LIEGNITZ REFUGEE CAMP - COURTYARD - SAME

           CLOSE ON, a young Polish woman, standing stoic and silent 
           amidst a jeering crowd. Her face is pale and drawn, her eyes 
           are sharp blue points. On her COAT, broken threads form the 
           outline of a STAR OF DAVID, long since removed. 

           This is ELSA.

                                 POLISH MATRON (O.S.)
                        Elsa Brzezina!

           A stern-looking BARBER takes Elsa roughly by the arm, and 
           pulls her into the clearing at the center of the mob.

           They pass a PRETTY WOMAN sobbing uncontrollably, as another 
           BARBER shaves her head with a set of RUSTY HAIR CLIPPERS. He 
           expresses neither joy nor pity. 

           The pair is one of many. Around them, more hysterical WOMEN 
           are having their heads shaved by more stern-looking MEN while 
           a heavy POLISH MATRON reads their names from a list.
           Elsa is shoved onto an empty stool in the middle of this 
           chaos. The Barber begins his work on her.

           A CROWD surrounds them, screaming obscenities. A few words 
           are heard above all others:

                                 CROWD
                        WHORE! TRAITOR!

           Elsa quietly stares straight ahead as her shoulder-length 
           hair collects in a messy pile at her feet.

           The other women sob, broken and humiliated as--

           The heavy Polish Matron moves through their ranks, using a 
           TUBE OF RED LIPSTICK to scrawl a greasy RED SWASTIKA on their 
           foreheads. Finally, she reaches--

           Elsa - who stares up at her coldly.  

           The woman leans forward, brandishing the lipstick, when--

           Elsa suddenly seizes her by the wrist. The woman falters, 
           tries to twist loose, but Elsa's grip is too strong. The look 
           in Elsa's eyes is deeply unsettling.

           Unnerved, the woman backs away. She tries to play it off:

                                 POLISH MATRON
                             (to crowd)
                        This one liked it rough!

           The crowd jeers and the woman moves on to her next victim.

           HOLD ON, Elsa's face, all fire and fury. Then-- 

           EXT. ALLEY - LIEGNITZ CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Elsa sits in the dirt, back against a crumbling wall, bawling 
           her eyes out. She rubs her hands over her shaved head, tears 
           running down her face. She is all alone.

           Finally, she regains control. She fishes an OLD HANDKERCHIEF 
           from her pocket and fashions a makeshift SHAWL. 

           Elsa ties it tight. Wipes away the tears. Pulls herself 
           together. One more deep breath, then she's on her feet. 

           EXT. LIEGNITZ REFUGEE CAMP - COURTYARD - THAT MOMENT

           Elsa steers clear of the mob, heading towards a STREET on the 
           far side of the courtyard. She keeps her eyes on the ground, 
           avoiding the stares of the passing CROWD.
           Meanwhile--

           AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE COURTYARD

           The Captain steps off his Zundapp and surveys the scene. He 
           watches grimly as another YOUNG WOMAN has her head shorn. 

           The Captain scans the crowd. Just then, he spots--

           A familiar-looking GREY JEEP with a cracked windshield. It 
           pulls up and parks at the far edge of the courtyard. A TALL 
           BLOND MAN steps out--

           The Captain narrows his eyes, gets a closer look. He knows 
           this man. It's ERICH (20s), a cruel, fanatical member of his 
           old Death's Head unit. The Captain suddenly notices--

           Erich is searching the crowd, looking for someone. 
           Eventually, Erich settles on a figure in motion.

           The Captain follows Erich's gaze. It's Elsa. Just as the 
           Captain realizes this--

           Erich spots him from across the square, looking just as 
           stunned as the Captain. He immediately looks back at--

           Elsa. Walking past the chanting onlookers.

           Erich and the Captain lock eyes. They stare at each other, 
           frozen. Then--

           They take off, SPRINTING for Elsa at the other end of the 
           crowd. It's a race and Erich is closer.

           But the Captain is quicker, and he's steadily making up 
           ground, until he hits--

           The crowd. All those bodies slow him down. Erich is dealing 
           with the same problem, but there are fewer people between him 
           and Elsa. He's closing in.

           At the sound of the commotion behind her, Elsa turns to see--

           THE TWO MEN BARRELING TOWARDS HER THROUGH THE CROWD. 

           She stands, frozen in place for a moment. Taking in this 
           strange scene. Then, she starts to run--

           The Captain bulldozes his way through men, women and 
           children. He's getting desperate. He's not going to make it.

           Elsa is at the very edge of the square now, running as fast 
           as she can. She's about to break off into an ALLEYWAY when--
           Erich bursts out of the crowd, grabs her roughly by the 
           shoulder, and pulls her towards him. Elsa screams, as Erich 
           rips a BLACK SS DAGGER from a sheath on his hip and--

           PLUNGES IT STRAIGHT INTO HER BELLY.

           Elsa's scream is cut short as she goes into shock. The whole 
           courtyard goes silent, staring, frozen. Elsa’s eyes go wide. 

           As Erich rips the dagger free-- 

           The Captain SLAMS into him, taking the man down hard onto the 
           wet cobblestones. 

           And like that, the spell is broken - women scream and the 
           crowd scatters. It's chaos as refugees flee, calling out for 
           the military police--

           Back on the ground, Erich's knife FLASHES, catching the 
           Captain deeply on his left arm. The Captain grits his teeth 
           and slams Erich’s hand down, sending the bloody knife 
           skittering away.

           The two struggle, fighting for control. Erich manages to get 
           a big hand around the Captain's throat, squeezing as hard as 
           he can. Desperately trying to breathe, The Captain hammers 
           away at Erich's face and neck, but it's no good.

           The Captain is growing weak. On the verge of blacking out.

           Elsa lays curled on the muddy ground next to them. As she 
           fights to stay conscious, she realizes with strange clarity - 
           these men are German. 

           The Captain's eyes start to glass over. His hand reaches out 
           for something, anything--

           Then, all at once - the Captain seizes a loose COBBLESTONE 
           from the ground and SMASHES it into Erich's head, caving in 
           the blond man's skull.

           After a long moment, the Captain staggers to his feet. 
           Struggling to catch his breath, he scans the square. Spots--

           Elsa on the ground, face-down. She's not moving. 

           The Captain starts to panic. He whips around to find--

           One of the HEADSHAVERS, frozen with fear, staring back at him 
           like he was the Angel of Death.

           In an instant, The Captain is inches from the man's face--
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Tell me where to find a doctor.

           The Headshaver is dumbstruck. He shakes his head, tries to 
           speak, but nothing comes out. 

           In the distance, we hear the faint sound of truck engines, 
           shouting voices - the Soviets.

           The Captain draws his Luger and fires a SHOT into Erich's 
           corpse. The Headshaver snaps out of his trance--

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        I need a doctor. NOW.

           PRE-LAP: The sound of furious POUNDING on a wooden door.

           I/E. NURSE'S HOUSE - DUSK

           A heavy wooden door is thrown open to reveal--

           The Captain, with a bleeding, unconscious Elsa held in his 
           arms. He's breathing hard. Desperately, he addresses--

           MARTA (50s), a short, stout, Jewish nurse with the look of a 
           woman who's seen great darkness. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        She needs help.

           Marta is in no hurry. She looks him over. Takes her time 
           before she responds.

                                 MARTA
                        You're German.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Yes.

           This is not what Marta wanted to hear. But she doesn't close 
           the door. Yet.

                                 MARTA
                        Is she German?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        She's a Jew.

           Marta studies his face. Skeptical.

           The Captain lifts Elsa's limp wrist, presenting the CRUDE  
           SERIAL NUMBER TATTOO, black against her pale skin.  

           Marta glances at it.
                                 MARTA
                        Bring her inside.

           The Captain staggers into the house with Elsa. Marta scans 
           the street outside for witnesses before shutting the door 
           behind them.

           INT. NURSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER

           CLOSE ON, a SERIES of PHOTOGRAPHS of Marta and her family 
           before the war. They look happy, relaxed - the MEN WEARING 
           YARMULKES, the WOMEN WEARING SIMPLE BLACK DRESSES. There was 
           life here once. It's long gone now.

           The Captain regards these relics from a dusty armchair in the 
           corner. Their smiling faces make him extremely uncomfortable.

           Marta enters, wiping blood from her hands with a ragged 
           cloth. She remains standing.

                                 MARTA
                        She was lucky.

           The Captain stands.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Is she awake?

                                 MARTA
                        The blade just missed her liver. 
                        She'll hurt, but she'll be alright. 
                        With rest.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I need to speak to her.

           Marta searches the Captain's face. 

                                 MARTA
                        She's sleeping.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I'll wake her up.

                                 MARTA
                        She needs to rest.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How long?

                                 MARTA
                        Until she wakes up.

           His intensity is making her uncomfortable.
                                 MARTA 
                        How do you know this girl?

           The Captain stares at her coldly. 

                                 MARTA 
                        Are you the reason they shaved her 
                        head?

           The same cold stare. Marta's eyes wander to:

           THE KNIFE-WOUND ON HIS FOREARM.  

           It looks bad. Nearly down to the muscle.

                                 MARTA 
                        If you sit at the table, in the 
                        light, I can take a look at those 
                        wounds.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How long will she sleep?

                                 MARTA
                        Sit down at the table.

           After a long, tense moment: the Captain sits down at a nearby 
           DINING TABLE with two chairs. 

           Marta grabs some MEDICAL SUPPLIES from a CABINET and sits 
           across from him. 

                                 MARTA 
                        Let me see.

           The Captain lays his arm across the table. His breathing 
           shallow and drawn.

                                 MARTA 
                        It's deep. You'll need stitches.

           She begins cleaning the wound with gauze and alcohol. After a 
           long moment, the Captain speaks, clipped.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        What do you want for this?

           She wipes the dried blood away. 

                                 MARTA
                        You're asking what I want?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I have cigarettes.
           She looks him in the eye.

                                 MARTA
                        Cigarettes. Is that why you think 
                        I'm doing this?

           She shakes her head softly, gestures towards his knife wound.

                                 MARTA 
                        You're lucky. Most soldiers prefer 
                        guns.

           The Captain looks at her carefully.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Why are you helping me?

                                 MARTA
                        We do the things we're trained to 
                        do. 

           She looks at him.

                                 MARTA 
                        Why are you helping her?

           The Captain gives her nothing. Eyes cast down towards his 
           open wound. Marta searches his face.

                                 MARTA 
                        It doesn't matter anyway. All that 
                        matters now is that you're alive. 
                        Survival is the only job we have left.

           She cleans the wound softly with the gauze. 

                                 MARTA 
                        But there's no training for that.

           She looks right at him - sees things inside him he doesn't 
           want anyone to see. He just wants her to stop talking. Now. 
           His hand begins to tremble.

           The Captain unholsters his gun from inside his jacket. Points 
           it at her. He's not entirely in control.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Wake her up. 

           Marta stares back at him and his gun with a look of profound 
           sadness. Finally: 

                                 MARTA
                        Put your gun away. The war is over. 
           With that, she turns her back on him and walks out of the 
           room. The Captain keeps his gun trained on her as she leaves, 
           even as he crumbles inside. 

           EXT. NURSE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The Captain stumbles into a small, overgrown backyard, 
           closing the BACK DOOR softly behind him. He holsters his gun 
           with shaking hands, pulls up the collar of his coat. 

           He sits on a stump out in the tall grass, his back against a 
           barren tree. He stares off into the night, drifting. 

           PRE-LAP: The clink of glasses, the sounds of laughter.  

           INT. BERLIN BAR, 1941 - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           TEXT: Berlin, 1941

           The place is packed with drunk, GERMAN SOLDIERS. They're 
           gathered at the bar, arms around each other, singing the 
           National Anthem of the Third Reich at the top of their lungs.

                                 SOLDIERS
                        Clear the streets for the storm 
                        divisions! The call to arms is 
                        sounded!

           The Captain is among them - younger, clean-shaven, and 
           wearing an impressive, freshly-ironed ALL BLACK WAFFEN-SS 
           UNIFORM. He has a BEER in one hand and his other arm around--

           RICHTER, cheerful and more handsome, his SS Death's Head cap 
           polished to a shine. He's the life of the party, a deeply-
           charismatic man who uses those talents to manipulate others. 
           A true sociopath. 

           They're surrounded closely by the TWELVE MEN who make up the 
           core of their unit (some of whom we recognize, others we'll 
           meet later):

           AGUSTIN, MAX, KONRAD, ECKHART, PETR, KLAUS, ERICH, WERNER, 
           LEO, OSKAR, ALFONS and SEBASTIAN.

           They're all drunk on beer and war, singing at the top of 
           their lungs:

                                 THE CAPTAIN/RICHTER
                        The flag on high! The ranks tightly 
                        closed!

           The men erupt in THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. The Captain's eyes 
           shine with a terrifying conviction.
           LATER, AT THE BAR.

           CLOSE ON, a WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH of Richter with his arm around 
           a pretty, young GERMAN WOMAN, dressed in white.

                                 RICHTER (O.S.)
                        We had the ceremony at the 
                        Starnberger-See.

           Richter holds the photograph, a little drunk.

                                 RICHTER  
                        We ate outside near the lake. Four 
                        hundred and ten people at fifty-
                        four tables. Goering was there.

           The Captain sits next to him, swaying on his bar stool. 

                                 RICHTER 
                        When we served the cake, it started 
                        raining. Nina was so embarrassed. 
                        Everyone started running inside. 
                        But Goering just took another bite 
                        and said, "I don't know why they're 
                        running. If they think this is bad, 
                        they should try the cake in 
                        Poland."

           They share a big, drunken LAUGH. As it dies down, Richter 
           smiles at the Captain fondly.

                                 RICHTER 
                        I remember when I made Captain. I 
                        received my medal from the Führer 
                        himself... As a German, I want to 
                        personally thank you for your 
                        service in France, Captain. You're 
                        a hero.

           The Captain is genuinely moved by this. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Thank you, Commandant.

           Richter glances around the bar, leans close.

                                 RICHTER
                        I've been given command of a great 
                        undertaking. The orders come from 
                        Himmler himself. What I say here 
                        cannot leave this bar. Understand?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Yes, Commandant.  
           Richter smiles, pours the Captain another drink.

                                 RICHTER
                        The war is over. We'll be in Moscow 
                        by Christmas. We've won. We can be 
                        proud. But many armies have won 
                        wars in the past. And for what? 
                        Land? Resources? Prestige?

           He scoffs.

                                 RICHTER 
                        These rewards are trivial. Germany 
                        has the opportunity to do something 
                        revolutionary. Something no other 
                        nation was able to do. Something 
                        truly meaningful. We get to 
                        reinvent the world in our image. We 
                        decide what it will look like, 
                        smell like, taste like. We get to 
                        choose who belongs there. And who 
                        does not. Do you realize the 
                        significance of this, do you 
                        understand the power we hold? We 
                        will design the future.  

           The Captain hangs on his every word.

                                 RICHTER 
                        I'm looking for men like you - men 
                        of principle - to join me in this 
                        mission. To help build the world of 
                        tomorrow. 

           Richter quietly awaits his reaction. Finally, the Captain 
           raises his glass. Proudly:

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        "My honor is loyalty".

           Richter smiles. 

                          RICHTER
                                                        THE CAPTAIN 
           Heil, Hitler.
                                               Heil, Hitler.

           They clink glasses and toss back their shots.

           EXT. NURSE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING

           The Captain sleeps in the overgrown backyard, back against 
           the old barren tree. It's a rare moment of peace. 
           Birds call softly in the distance, and he's awake - his eyes 
           falling into that same dead, hollow stare. It takes a moment 
           for him to get his bearings, but when he does, he sees--

           Elsa, pale as a ghost, standing over him. Wrapped in a 
           threadbare blanket, she studies him, almost curiously.

           Instinctively, he reaches for his pistol, only to find: the 
           holster is empty. When he looks up again, he finds himself 
           looking down the barrel of his own gun.

                                 ELSA
                             (in Polish)
                        Who are you?

           He just stares back at her. She asks again, this time in 
           English:

                                 ELSA 
                        Who are you?

           The Captain is silent a long time before responding. In 
           lightly-accented English:

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You were a prisoner at Einehof. 
                        Your name is Elsa.

           The Captain glances at her tattoo. Elsa notices, pulling her 
           sleeve down to cover it up.

                                 ELSA
                        You didn't answer my question.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I don't want to hurt you. 

           Elsa cocks the hammer, unnerved.

                                 ELSA
                        What's your name?

           He stares back at her, coldly. Even though she's the one with 
           the gun, he looks scarier.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        A man told me you know where I can 
                        find Anton Richter.

           She flinches at the sound of that name. 

                                 ELSA
                        Who told you that?
           Instead of answering, the Captain lunges.

           He wrenches the gun from her hand and slams her to the 
           ground. He aims the barrel right at her head.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Tell me where to find him.

           Elsa clutches her bandaged side, breathing heavily. 

                                 ELSA
                        I don't know.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You're lying.

                                 ELSA
                        Why do you want to find Richter?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Because I'm going to kill him.

           This surprises Elsa.

                                 ELSA
                        Who are you?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Tell me where to find him.

           She considers.

                                 ELSA
                        I can show you where he is, but you 
                        need to take me with you.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I'm not negotiating.

                                 ELSA
                        Neither am I. 

           She sits up, wipes the mud off her hands. In the distance, we 
           hear the low RUMBLE of approaching MILITARY TRUCKS.

                                 ELSA 
                        If you're going to kill Anton 
                        Richter, I'm going to watch him die.

           They stare at each other for a long, tense moment. Then--

           RUSSIAN VOICES call out from the front of the house, arguing. 
           Moments later, Marta bursts out of the back door--
                                 MARTA
                        It's the Soviets. You need to 
                        leave. Now.

           The Captain looks down at Elsa, staring up at him defiantly. 
           The VOICES outside continue to argue, louder now, getting 
           closer. He has no other option and she knows it.

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY, OPEN ROAD - LATER

           The Captain's Zundapp SCREAMS down the open road. The Captain 
           at the helm with Elsa on the back, arms around his waist, 
           holding just tight enough to stay on the bike and no more.

           Overhead a squadron of AMERICAN CARGO PLANES pass on their 
           way to Berlin.

           EXT. MEADOWLANDS - SUNSET

           A small campfire smokes and spits in the dusk. Elsa sits on a 
           rock, knees drawn up to her chest, clutching her bandaged wound. 
           She rubs her shaven head, still getting used to it. 

           On the other side of the fire, the Captain adds PETR'S DOG 
           TAGS to his collection.

           Elsa breaks the heavy silence--

                                 ELSA
                             (re: dog tags)
                        Did you kill all those men?

           The Captain ignores her. He puts the dog tags back in his 
           bag, and removes a SEWING NEEDLE. Holds it over the coals.

                                 ELSA 
                        The doctor said you saved my life.

           The Captain's eyes meet hers, then drift back to the needle. 
           He bends it, threads it carefully, then rolls up his 
           shirtsleeves, exposing the brutal knife-wound on his forearm. 

           Elsa winces at the sight of it.

                                 ELSA 
                        I remember that man. From Einehof. 
                        His name was Erich...

           The Captain takes a sharp breath in as he works the needle 
           into the soft flesh around the cut. He begins the slow, 
           painful process of stitching it up.

           Elsa can hardly watch. But she can't look away.
                                 ELSA 
                        Why was he trying to kill me?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Because of what you know.

                                 ELSA
                        About Richter?

           The Captain continues working the needle, ignoring her. His 
           body is a mess of scars and bruises. 

                                 ELSA 
                        Why are they still fighting for 
                        him? The war is over.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Not for them.

           Elsa puts the pieces together in her head, as she watches the 
           Captain pushes the needle through the last bit of flesh. 

                                 ELSA
                        You never told me your name.

           He stares at her. All patience lost.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Where are we going?

                                 ELSA
                        To find Richter.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Which direction?

                                 ELSA
                        North.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How far?

           Elsa looks at him, really studying him now.

                                 ELSA
                        What did he take from you?

           The Captain's eyes go ice-cold. There's an oppressive, 
           foreboding silence as they stare at each other. Finally, the 
           Captain picks up his Luger, stands, cocks the gun and...

           Places it in his holster. He walks off into the woods. As 
           soon as he's gone--
           Elsa lets the tears fall. She stares at the dying fire, alone 
           in the darkness.

           EXT. MEADOWLANDS - THE NEXT MORNING

           Elsa wakes up with a start. The fire next to her is just 
           smoldering ashes. It's eerily quiet. She quickly realizes--

           She's all alone. She sits up, in a panic. She scans the 
           surrounding woods, then notices--

           A RATION CAN OF PRESSED BEEF, half-full, cooking on the fire. 
           Elsa doesn't wait for permission. She grabs a nearby fork, 
           snatches the can, and desperately wolfs it down.

                                 THE CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        There's a refugee camp near Bamberg, 
                        close to the American Zone.

           Elsa is startled. She turns around, mouth full, to find--

           The Captain, sitting behind her on a fallen log, cleaning his 
           battered RIFLE.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        They have food, beds, doctors. It's 
                        protected. 

           Elsa slowly scans the campsite, registering the FOOD and 
           SUPPLIES.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        You'll be safe there.

                                 ELSA
                        I'm not going back to one of those 
                        camps.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        There's a map, on the ground next 
                        to the fire.

           Elsa notices the CLOTH MAP beside her. 

           The Captain is calm and steady. He's formulated a plan and he 
           expects her to follow it. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        When you've finished eating, you're 
                        going to open it and show me 
                        exactly where to find Richter.

                                 ELSA
                        Did you hear what I said?
           He ignores her. Continues cleaning his rifle.

           Elsa notices the Captain's FRESHLY-CLEANED PISTOL sitting on 
           the log next to him. She looks back at him, resolved:

                                 ELSA 
                        I said I'm not going back to one of 
                        those camps.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I'll give you a day's supplies and 
                        drop you near the main road. You 
                        can make it there by nightfall.

           The Captain turns away to retrieve his RIFLE SCOPE. The 
           moment he does--

           ELSA LUNGES FOR THE PISTOL.

           She gets to the gun first. Stumbling back, she keeps the 
           barrel fixed on the Captain's forehead.

                                 ELSA
                        Stop. Put the rifle down. Slowly.

           The Captain just stares at her. He looks vaguely surprised, 
           but there's not a trace of fear. He calmly sets his rifle on 
           the ground.

           In one quick movement, Elsa crouches down, picks up the rifle 
           and slings it over her shoulder.

           She slowly walks backwards, keeping the gun trained on the 
           Captain the entire time. She grabs his CANVAS RUCKSACK and 
           begins stuffing it, one-handed, with SUPPLIES. As she packs:

                                 ELSA 
                        I told you before, I'm going to 
                        find Richter. If you're not going 
                        with me, I'm going alone. Now, I'm 
                        going to head in this direction--
                             (gestures north)
                        And you're going to head in that 
                        direction.
                             (gestures south)
                        I don't know how you found me, but 
                        don't find me again.

           The rucksack's nearly full. Elsa throws it over her shoulder. 
           There's a good distance between them now. She softens--

                                 ELSA 
                        Thank you for saving my life.
           Elsa has reached the TREE-LINE. One more step and she's gone. 
           Then--

           The Captain stands up. Begins striding towards her.

                                 ELSA 
                        STOP. Don't come any closer.

           He keeps moving.

           She starts to panic.

                                 ELSA 
                        I will shoot you. Do not come any 
                        closer!

           He's closing in. Only ten feet away now.

                                 ELSA 
                        STOP. RIGHT NOW.

           The Captain doesn't stop. He doesn't slow down. He doesn't 
           even look angry.

                                 ELSA 
                        DON'T--

           There's no more time. He's too close. She needs to make a 
           decision. The Captain reaches for the gun and--

           ELSA POINTS IT STRAIGHT AT HIS FACE AND PULLS THE TRIGGER.

           CLICK. 

           She pulls the trigger again. CLICK, CLICK.

           The gun is empty.

           In one swift motion, the Captain rips the gun from her hands 
           and STRIKES HER ACROSS THE FACE. Hard.

           Elsa collapses to the dirt, face down. Gasping. The empty 
           rifle lying beside her.

           The Captain picks it up. Looms over her, a gun in each hand. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        If you point a gun at me again, 
                        I'll slit your throat. Understand?

           Elsa nods, defeated.

           The Captain looks down at her. His hand lightly trembling.  
           Finally--
                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        We need gas.

           The Captain turns and heads for the Zundapp. Elsa touches her 
           busted lip. She spits blood, watches it mix with the dirt. 
           That familiar mixture of rage and fear.

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY, OPEN ROAD - LATER

           The Zundapp roars down what's left of the road. The Captain 
           leans over the handlebars as Elsa clings to her seat. She 
           looks out at the passing landscape as they drive:

           Endless fields of yellow wheat with vast snow-capped 
           mountains towering in the distance.

           A narrow, brown river where a naked CORPSE floats face-down, 
           adrift in its current. It almost looks like he's swimming.

           A farmhouse burns, thick plumes of black smoke pouring into 
           the clear blue sky above.  

           Elsa watches the smoke tumbling up in eddies as they pass.

           EXT. LUBIN, THE BLACK MARKET BAZAAR - LATER

           The Zundapp pulls up in front of an old, two-story building. 
           DESPERATE-LOOKING MEN wander in and out of its doors. 

           A REFUGEE carries a BASKET of worthless REICHSMARKS out with 
           him, abandoning it on the steps as he leaves. 

           As the Captain and Elsa dismount the bike:

                                 ELSA
                        ...what is this place?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        A brothel.

           She stops. 

                                 ELSA
                        I'm not going in there.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You think you're better off out 
                        here?

           Elsa notices the men outside leering at her. She looks back 
           at the Captain, grits her teeth, and follows him towards the 
           front door. After they disappear inside--
           Two TALL, POCKMARKED MEN, watching them from the shadows, 
           stand up and circle around the back of the building.

           INT. THE BLACK MARKET BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The place is dusty, dimly-lit, with a large makeshift bar. 
           Greasy, unwashed LABORERS are scattered throughout, perched 
           atop three-legged chairs and split-wood barstools.

           The PROSTITUTES, filthy and homely in their knee-length 
           tattered smocks, wander around looking for a date, a hollow 
           look in their eyes.

           An overwhelming sadness permeates the room. Man or woman, 
           prostitute or John, no one is happy here.

           As the Captain and Elsa enter, all eyes fall on them. Elsa 
           shies away from the stares, but the Captain just heads 
           straight for--

           THE DUSTY BAR

           They take up a spot near the end. As soon as they do--

           A young, DOE-EYED PROSTITUTE approaches the Captain. She 
           can't be a day over 13. Without a hint of emotion, she raises 
           her grey smock and shows him her filthy white panties. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Go away.

           The doe-eyed prostitute drifts away like a ghost. Elsa 
           watches her go, upset and uncomfortable.

           The Captain waves over the craggy, old Polish BARTENDER.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What'd you like?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Petrol.

                                 BARTENDER
                        How much?

           The Captain places a BOX OF AMERICAN CIGARETTES on the bar.

           The Bartender looks at the cigarettes, looks at the Captain. 
           He's suspicious.

                                 BARTENDER 
                        You German?
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Just the petrol.

           The Bartender studies him, then Elsa. Finally--

           He picks up the cigarettes and disappears down a HALLWAY 
           behind the bar.  

                                 ELSA
                        Where is he going?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Stop talking.

           The Captain scans the room, on guard, searching for threats, 
           escape routes. His eyes land on a CORNER TABLE where--

           A HUSKY PROSTITUTE lets a trio of AMERICAN SOLDIERS play with 
           her INFANT DAUGHTER. They bellow with DRUNKEN LAUGHTER as the 
           older one bounces her up and down on his knee. The child 
           CRIES, reaching for her mother.

           Elsa watches, heartbroken, lost in some dark memory. 

           Finally, the Bartender returns, and the Captain turns to 
           Elsa, startling her out of her reverie--

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        Let's go.

           Elsa nods slowly. The Bartender impatiently gestures--

                                 BARTENDER
                        Down the hall. Last door on the 
                        left.

           The Captain turns. Leaving the Bartender behind, he leads 
           Elsa into--

           INT. HALLWAY - THE BLACK MARKET BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           MOANING, SOBBING, and the occasional SLAP can be heard from 
           behind the many closed DOORS that line the narrow corridor. 

           The Captain leads Elsa down the hall. We hold on her as they 
           walk, the sounds of sex and violence surrounding them is 
           taking its toll on her. Taking her back to places she doesn't 
           want to remember.

           They reach the end of the hall - last door on the left. As 
           the Captain raises his fist to knock, something catches his 
           eye. In the GAP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR, he sees--

           Four black columns - THICK SHADOWS, waiting.
           The Captain slowly lowers his hand, sensing something.

           THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - STORAGE ROOM

           Two EX-SS SOLDIERS, OSKAR and LEO (20s), the same POCKMARKED 
           MEN from outside, stand with their GUNS pressed against the 
           door. They're listening closely, carefully tracking the 
           Captain by the sounds of his movement.

           Behind them, another German, WERNER (30s), stands with his 
           own PISTOL pointed squarely at the door. Next to him stands 
           the Polish Bartender.

           This is an ambush.

           Nobody moves a muscle. It's dead quiet on both sides of the 
           door. They can't place the Captain.

           Werner motions to the Bartender.

                                 BARTENDER
                             (calls out)
                        You still want petrol?

           They all wait, listening for the slightest movement. 

           HALLWAY

           Now the Captain definitely knows something is wrong. Without 
           even looking at her, he slowly pushes Elsa clear of the door.  

           Elsa stumbles back, holding her breath. 

           The tension builds and builds... 

           Until finally, the Captain shifts the smallest step to his 
           left, and a FLOORBOARD CREAKS--

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS suddenly TEAR through the thin wooden 
           door. Rays of harsh sunlight pour through the gaping holes 
           into the hallway.

           The Captain throws himself against the wall, just barely 
           clear of the line of fire. Elsa screams as--

           All hell breaks loose. 

           The hallway is flooded by a sea of half-dressed, terrified  
           PROSTITUTES and sweaty, pantless MEN running for their lives.

           Elsa is swept up by the hysterical mass, pushed away from the 
           Captain, and through a DOOR into--
           THE ROOM NEXT DOOR

           She stumbles into the adjoining room, a thin wall the only 
           thing between her and the Gunmen now. She looks around, in a 
           panic, and sees--

           The Polish Bartender cowering in the corner.

           They lock eyes.

           BACK IN THE HALLWAY

           The Captain scrambles to his feet. He presses his back to the 
           wall, right beside the shattered door. He waits, then--

           The door opens.

           The Captain unsheathes his DAGGER.

           Oskar steps out, gun-drawn. As soon as he does--

           The Captain's blade FLASHES forward--

           Instinctively, Oskar raises a hand for protection. The blade 
           punches through his palm and buries itself in his left eye. 
           He dies instantly.

           STORAGE ROOM

           As Oskar collapses into the room, Leo wildly unloads into--

           THE HALLWAY 

           The Captain pivots against the wall on the other side of the 
           door, sharp splinters of wood raking his face and neck.

           A FLEEING PROSTITUTE isn't so lucky. A stray bullet catches 
           her in the temple and she topples to the floor.

           THE ROOM NEXT DOOR - THAT MOMENT

           Elsa screams as Leo's BULLETS rip through the walls around 
           her, shattering a MIRROR above her head.

           The SHATTERED GLASS rains down, scratching up her hands and 
           face as it falls. She looks around at the wreckage, eyes 
           falling on a JAGGED SHARD OF GLASS.

           THE HALLWAY

           On the CLICK of Leo's empty clip--

           The Captain spins halfway into the doorway, and grabs Leo by 
           the collar, jamming his gun straight under the man's chin.
           The Captain pulls the trigger--

           STORAGE ROOM

           BANG! Werner watches in horror as Leo goes down. After the 
           shock wears off--

           He shakily raises his Luger and squeezes off a few poorly-
           aimed SHOTS. 

           THE HALLWAY

           The Captain keeps his back pressed against the wall, gun 
           raised, waiting for the right opportunity. 

           STORAGE ROOM

           Werner is sweating heavily now - his gun fixed on the door. 
           He calls out, in German:

                                 WERNER
                        We should have killed you back at 
                        Einehof when we had the chance. I 
                        demanded it. But Richter, he 
                        refused. He protected you.

           THE HALLWAY

           The Captain continues to wait, patiently. Ice cold.

                                 WERNER (O.S.)
                        You were one of his special 
                        projects. A pet - like one of his 
                        dogs. You and ELSA. 

           THE ROOM NEXT DOOR 

           Elsa listens. Werner switches to English:

                                 WERNER (O.S.)
                        I KNOW YOU'RE HERE, ELSA. I KNOW 
                        YOU'RE LISTENING. 

           Her eyes go wide, heart racing. She knows that voice.

           STORAGE ROOM

           Werner looks to his right and sees--

           The open SERVICE DOOR that leads to THE ROOM NEXT DOOR.

           He slowly edges towards it, keeping his gun, fixed on the 
           Captain out in the hall--
                                 WERNER
                        Richter's not here to protect you 
                        anymore. You're just a couple of 
                        stray dogs now. Ready to finally be 
                        put down.

           THE HALLWAY

           The Captain shifts his weight. By the sound of his voice, he 
           can tell Werner's on the move. He quickly steals a look 
           around the corner and--

           BAM! BAM! BAM! Three more SHOTS tear into the door-frame, 
           forcing the Captain back out into the hall. 

           STORAGE ROOM

           Werner keeps moving towards the service door, eyes trained on 
           the Captain. Only a couple more steps now. He finally turns 
           to make a break for it, only to see--

           Elsa blocking the entrance, looking like something out of a 
           nightmare. Blood runs down her face from the broken glass.

           Werner freezes. Elsa reacts first--

           She raises the jagged SHARD OF BROKEN MIRROR, and with both 
           hands, RAMS it straight into Werner’s neck. She keeps pushing 
           until the shard is buried deep, slicing open her own hands in 
           the process. 

           Werner stares at her, stunned, choking on his own blood. He 
           stumbles backwards to the ground, clawing at his throat. 

           Elsa stands, almost catatonic. She looks down at her 
           trembling, blood-stained hands.

           The Captain steps through the doorway, gun raised - then 
           freezes. He looks down at Werner's quivering body. Then up at 
           Elsa, standing motionless.

           The Captain swiftly holsters his Luger and grabs two full GAS 
           CANS. He moves towards the door--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We need to move.

           Elsa blinks, coming back from whatever far away place she had 
           gone. She looks down at Werner, as if registering him for the 
           first time. Something suddenly clicks in her.

           She kneels down, pulls the BLOODY DOG TAGS from the remains 
           of his throat. And then she's gone.
           EXT. ROADSIDE SERVICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           A barely-standing old service station, long since looted of 
           anything valuable.  

           The Zundapp pulls in with a roar. But before the Captain can 
           even shut off the bike, Elsa is off, stumbling to a nearby 
           ditch. She VOMITS until there's nothing left.

           The Captain watches from the motorcycle.

           Kneeling in the dirt, Elsa begins shaking. As it builds, we 
           realize, she isn't crying - she's laughing. But this is not a 
           joyous laughter. It's the laughter of a madwoman.

                                 ELSA
                        His face--he was so surprised! He 
                        looked so stupid--did you see how 
                        he looked? 

           Elsa loses herself to hysteria - years of trauma, loss, all 
           storming inside her.

           The Captain watches, betraying nothing.

           Eventually, the well runs dry. She stops shaking, stands. She 
           turns to face him, suddenly terrifyingly lucid:

                                 ELSA 
                        Tell me what's going on.

           The Captain doesn't react.

           Elsa charges him, shoves him as hard as she can--

                                 ELSA 
                        WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING 
                        THIS?

           She's right up in his face, pounding his chest with both 
           fists-- 

                                 ELSA 
                        TELL ME.

           The Captain struggles to control the violence inside himself.

                                 ELSA 
                        GODDAMN YOU! TELL ME.

           He steps forward, pushing her back with his body.
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You've told me nothing. Do you know 
                        where we're going? Do you even know 
                        where we are?

           He stares her down--

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        Give me one reason I shouldn't 
                        leave you here right now. Because 
                        I'm starting to think you don't 
                        have the slightest idea where 
                        Richter is. I think you saw an 
                        opportunity to get out, and you 
                        took it. That's it.

           Elsa's face goes dark. The accusation touches a deep wound 
           for her - survivor's guilt. She suddenly explodes, charging 
           the Captain:  

                                 ELSA
                        I DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS. 

           The Captain steps back, overwhelmed by the fury and pain in 
           Elsa's voice, as she bears down on him:

                                 ELSA 
                        HE CHOSE ME. He chose me. 

           Elsa stops, her uncontrollable rage transforming into 
           uncontrollable sadness.

                                 ELSA 
                        Anton Richter raped me every day 
                        for almost three years. I lost my 
                        mother, my father, my sister, my 
                        brothers. I have lost so much. But 
                        I'm still here. Why? Can you tell 
                        me that? Am I such a good whore, 
                        that I was worth saving?

           Elsa turns her back to him.

           The Captain watches quietly, keeping his distance.

           Elsa takes a deep breath. She seems suddenly calm - focused.

                                 ELSA 
                        Anton Richter has my baby... 
                        Finding her is all I have left.

           At this, the Captain goes completely still. A cold uneasiness 
           rising in his chest. He knows something about this story. 
           After a long, tense moment--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        What makes you think Richter has 
                        your child?

           Elsa turns to face him--

                                 ELSA
                        Because she's his daughter.

           At this, she storms off into a nearby field, wind whipping 
           through the grass around her. 

           The Captain watches her walk away, consumed by memory. 
           There's a flicker of deep shame in his eyes.

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY - NATURE - SUNSET

           SERIES: Moments of the German countryside at dusk. It's 
           quiet, peaceful, serene. 

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY - SMALL STREAM - DUSK

           Elsa sits on a fallen log, listening to the gentle sound of 
           the stream. The rustling leaves. She holds WERNER'S DOG TAGS, 
           absently rubbing away the dried blood.

           The Captain approaches slowly, carrying CLEAN BANDAGES. He 
           sits on the other end of the log, and gently takes the bloody 
           dog tags from Elsa.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        They're fleeing Europe...

           The Captain lays COMPLETED PASSPORTS for Leo, Oskar and 
           Werner from the brothel on the log next to Elsa.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        ...Richter and the rest of the men 
                        from Einehof. Forged passports get 
                        them to Spain. From there, they 
                        travel to South America. Then they 
                        disappear.

           Elsa reaches down and picks up WERNER'S PASSPORT. Studies his 
           photo, bitterly.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        The names are fake, but they're 
                        official passports. They're all 
                        stamped from the same place: Zagan. 
                        In the Russian Zone.
           She looks up at him now, concerned.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        They have someone working inside 
                        the Tracking Bureau.

           Elsa looks back at the passport, examines the OFFICIAL STAMP 
           of the ZAGAN TRACKING BUREAU.

                                 ELSA
                        Who?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Read the signature.

           She holds the passport closer, squinting as she reads:

                                 ELSA
                        Alfons Niemann.

           Elsa goes cold.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        He was--

                                 ELSA
                        The doctor. At Einehof. I remember.

           The Captain watches quietly as Elsa drifts to a dark place 
           inside her mind.

                                 ELSA 
                        He's a murderer.

           The Captain nods in quiet agreement. He gently takes the 
           passport--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Give me your hand.

           Elsa offers him her wounded hand. The Captain methodically 
           cleans and bandages her cuts as Elsa stares right through him.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        The Russians need people - even 
                        Germans - to help re-build the 
                        country.

           She considers this, in all its unfairness and injustice.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        We need to go to Zagan, and find 
                        Alfons. He may have Richter's 
                        passport. 
           Elsa looks down at the deep wounds on her palms. The dried 
           blood. Remembering.

                                 ELSA
                        It felt good to kill that man.
                             (a breath)
                        To be the one in control. I'd 
                        forgotten about that feeling...

           Elsa looks carefully at the Captain now.

                                 ELSA 
                        So you're going to kill them all?
                        All the ones who got away.

           He finishes tying her bandage. Elsa pulls her hand close to 
           her chest, suddenly seeing the Captain in a new light.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Not all. Just my unit.

                                 ELSA
                        What was your unit?

           The Captain looks away. Takes a moment before answering.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        When Berlin fell, our mission was 
                        to liquidate the camps. Before the 
                        Allies could see what we'd done. 

           Elsa looks away, deeply unsettled by his confession. A long 
           quiet moment between them. Then--

           She makes a choice. Slowly, she digs A FOLDED-UP PHOTOGRAPH 
           from the hem of her panties. Stares down at it for a long 
           time. Then hands it to the Captain.

           B&W PHOTOGRAPH, Richter stands in front of a familiar COTTAGE 
           on a lakeshore with his arm around his wife, Nina.

                                 ELSA (O.S.)
                        He has a cottage on Lake Müritz. 
                        Outside Elbe, in the British Zone.

           The Captain looks up at Elsa. He flips over the photograph, 
           on the back, in Richter's precise hand: "Lake Müritz. Nina & 
           I, 1938."

                                 ELSA 
                        Richter gave me this when he took 
                        my baby. He told me that's where he 
                        was taking her. That it would be a 
                        safe place after the war.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELSA
                        That he and his wife... they'd 
                        raise her as their own.

           Elsa points to the cottage in the photograph--

                                 ELSA 
                        That's where Richter is.

           The Captain nods. A new arrangement has been reached.

           EXT. EASTERN GERMANY, OPEN ROAD - MORNING

           The Captain and Elsa race down the open road on the Zundapp. 
           They seem united now, Elsa gripping the Captain's chest 
           tightly as they speed ahead. A single unit - on a mission.

           EXT. ZAGAN, EASTERN GERMANY - AFTERNOON

           The Zundapp idles through a bustling town as the Captain and 
           Elsa enter ZAGAN.

           The STREETS and BUILDINGS remain mostly intact. STOREFRONTS 
           are open, selling rationed goods. There's life here. 

           Elsa takes everything in as the Zundapp rumbles around a 
           corner to find--

           A BUSY STREET

           It's lined with SOVIET MILITARY JEEPS, most of them empty. An 
           occasional SOVIET SOLDIER stands, observing:

           A CROWD OF CIVILIANS, excitedly marching down the street, 
           waving flags. They're all headed towards the TOWN SQUARE 
           where we hear, faintly, a BRASS BAND warming up--

           The Captain pulls over into the mouth of an alley. Switches 
           off the bike. He quietly watches the moving crowd.

           Elsa slips off the motorcycle, scans the street:

                                 ELSA
                        Where do you think they're going?

           The Captain just shakes his head, as he keeps his eyes on the 
           Soviet Soldiers at the far end of the street. 

           Elsa notices an OLDER POLISH COUPLE slowly making their way 
           to the square. She crosses the street to speak with them.

           The Captain hangs in the alley, observing their conversation. 
           It's polite, friendly even. He suddenly lowers his eyes as--
           A dozen rowdy SOVIET SOLDIERS stroll by, rifles in hand, 
           laughing and whistling as they follow the crowd. 

           Elsa finishes up, makes her way back. The street is quiet, 
           almost eerily empty now. 

                                 ELSA 
                        The Russians brought free beer.

           The Captain stares back at her.

                                 ELSA 
                        A new minister arrived, straight 
                        from Moscow. They're holding a 
                        banquet in his honor.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        The Tracking Bureau?

                                 ELSA
                        Closed. But they'll all be there. 
                        They have to be. State orders.

           The Captain nods. In the distance, the brass band begins to 
           play their first song. He starts off towards the music, but 
           Elsa doesn't follow him. He stops, turns to face her.

           She struggles for a moment to find the words, then--

                                 ELSA 
                        Alfons delivered my baby.

           The Captain avoids her eyes.

                                 ELSA 
                        He's the one... who took her away 
                        from me.

           Elsa swallows hard, burying her sadness. Only anger left now.

                                 ELSA 
                        I want to be the one who kills him.

           The Captain studies her face for a long time, realizes she's 
           deadly serious. After a moment--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How would you do it?

           Elsa reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out--

           TWO MORPHINE SYRETTES - small tubes of highly-concentrated 
           morphine connected to a thin metal needle. One-time use. 
                                 ELSA
                        The nurse gave them to me. In 
                        Liegnitz... "One to take away the 
                        pain. Two for The Great Beyond."
                             (pauses)
                        She told me to use them on you. 
                        While you were sleeping.

           The Captain considers this. Stares back at Elsa. She's calm, 
           cold, determined... But, ultimately decides--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        It's too dangerous. To get that 
                        close.

           Before she can respond, he turns and continues down the street. 
           Elsa collects herself. Pockets the syrettes. Follows him.

           PRE-LAP: Swooning, melancholy MUSIC begins to play.

           EXT. ZAGAN - TOWN SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON

           A beautiful POLISH GIRL sings 'The Red Poppies of Monte 
           Cassino', a nationalistic ballad about the triumph of the 
           Polish Army. 

           She stands on a crudely-constructed stage, in front of a 
           BRASS BAND, at the head of the town square - crowded now with 
           TOWNSPEOPLE, SOVIET SOLDIERS and BUREAUCRATS, drinking beer, 
           swaying happily with the music.

           Rows of FIREWORKS line the side of the stage, ready for the 
           evening's festivities.

           ON A NEARBY ROOFTOP--

           The Captain and Elsa lean against the stone edge, scanning 
           the STAGE below - Elsa using a weathered set of BINOCULARS, 
           the Captain the CHIPPED SCOPE on his worn RIFLE.

                                 ELSA
                        I don't see him.

           The Captain continues to scan the stage, growing anxious.

           SCOPE POV: Dozens of cheery bureaucrats - but no Alfons.

           TOWN SQUARE

           The Polish Girl completes her song, to roaring APPLAUSE. As 
           she steps back and takes a bow--

           A lean, silver-haired POLISH ANNOUNCER in a tuxedo steps 
           behind the microphone, addressing the crowd.
                                 POLISH ANNOUNCER
                        My fellow countrymen, it is with 
                        great pleasure and great honor I 
                        present to you: Special Minister 
                        Vasiliev!

           As the Brass Band (poorly) plays an instrumental version of 
           'The Soviet National Anthem', a group of local GOVERNMENT 
           OFFICIALS file onto the stage to greet him. 

           ROOFTOP

           Elsa scans the stage with her binoculars, she suddenly stops, 
           zeroes in on--

           BINOCULARS POV: There, making his way across the stage, is 
           ALFONS NIEMANN. A proud, paunchy German with round eyeglasses 
           and a well-groomed mustache, carrying a cracked LEATHER 
           BRIEFCASE.

                                 ELSA
                        There. There he is.

           The Captain spots him. Narrows his eyes, watching coldly as-- 

           SCOPE POV: Alfons proudly shakes hands with the Minister 
           before taking a seat at the back of the stage.

           TOWN SQUARE

           The Minister steps up to the microphone and delivers a SPEECH 
           (in Russian, no subtitles) propagandizing Poland's new role 
           in the Soviet Union. As he drones on--

           ROOFTOP

           Elsa watches nervously as the Captain tweaks the dials on his 
           scope, making final adjustments. He lies flat on the rooftop, 
           stabilizing himself, settling in for the kill.

           SCOPE POV: Alfons sits there, legs crossed, oblivious. A man 
           of no moral principle, blending in seamlessly with his former 
           enemies, the new ruling class.

           The Captain flicks off the safety, takes a breath. It's a 
           long and challenging shot, and they'll only have minutes to 
           flee once Alfons goes down.

           Elsa's breathing is ragged as she waits.

           The Captain slowly re-positions his hand over the grip, his 
           eye never leaving the scope. He slowly extends his finger 
           over the trigger when, it begins to tremble.
           He closes his eyes, makes a fist, tries to steady it. But 
           it's no use. It only gets worse.

           Elsa notices that something's wrong, she watches, concerned.

           Finally, the Captain reaches for the trigger again, but the 
           tremor is running through his whole body now--

           SCOPE POV: The CROSSHAIRS weave back and forth, unable to 
           draw a steady bead on Alfons.

           On stage, the Minister finishes his speech, and suddenly the 
           other officials are up on their feet, moving across the 
           crowded bandstand, getting in the way of the Captain's shot--

           The Captain is short of breath, fighting to control his 
           shaking hands. He grips the rifle. Suddenly--

           Elsa carefully reaches over and puts her hand on his 
           shoulder, forcing the Captain to look at her--

           The Captain stares back at her, troubled, but hiding it well. 
           After a long moment, he lowers his rifle-- 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        It's too crowded. I can't get a 
                        clean shot.

           Elsa nods gently in support, then watches curiously as the 
           Captain packs up his rifle - processing this new side of him.

           INT. CROWDED BAR - NIGHT

           In the back of a CROWDED BAR, Alfons sits in a BOOTH, smoking 
           cigarettes and tossing back beers, while he discusses 
           politics with the TIPSY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS surrounding him.

           At a SMALL TABLE in a DARK CORNER at the other end of the 
           bar, the Captain and Elsa sit. Watching, nursing their own 
           beers, trying to stay invisible. Nearby--

           A small group of drunken SOVIET SOLDIERS pour their beers 
           into a GERMAN HELMET. They raise it over their heads, 
           laughing, as they open their mouths wide to catch the beer 
           streaming out through the jagged bullet-holes. 

           Elsa watches for a moment, then takes a sip from her glass. 

                                 ELSA
                        I'd forgotten what bars smell like.

           The Captain doesn't respond at first. Just when the moment is 
           about to pass--
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        What do they smell like?

                                 ELSA
                        Cigarettes. Beer...

           Elsa thinks.

                                 ELSA 
                        My father.

           The Captain looks at her now.

                                 ELSA 
                        We lived in Warsaw, and every 
                        evening he would go to Bar Prasowy. 
                        In the old town.  

           She takes another sip.

                                 ELSA 
                        He said it was so he could read the 
                        newspaper in peace. But my mother 
                        always said it was so he could 
                        watch the pretty girls walk by.

           Elsa smiles, relishing the sweetness of that memory - but it 
           fades quickly. She looks at the Captain. 

                                 ELSA 
                        I'll never really know what 
                        happened to them. Will I?

           The Captain looks down at the table. After a long silence--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Maybe it's better. That you don't 
                        know.

           Elsa frowns. Considers this.

                                 ELSA
                        Perhaps.

           Their attention suddenly shifts to--

           Alfons in the booth. He stands up, stubs out his cigarette, 
           and heads for the bathroom.

           The Captain rises, turns to Elsa. She nods, nerves frayed. 
           She's ready. Underneath the table, we see--

           Elsa snaps the caps off the SYRETTES, revealing their long, 
           sharp NEEDLES.
           INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A dim hallway leading to a LAVATORY. The door is closed - 
           occupied. Alfons stands nearby, waiting alone, his BRIEFCASE 
           in hand. He blows his nose in a HANDKERCHIEF, and studies the 
           result before folding it into his pocket.

           AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALLWAY--

           A figure steps out of the shadows. A young woman with her 
           hands buried in her coat pockets. Elsa.

           Alfons looks back at her, registers her face.

           Elsa holds her breath, unsure of what to expect. Then--

           He smiles politely at her. Gestures to the water closet. In 
           accented Polish:

                                 ALFONS
                        Five hundred liters of beer and one 
                        toilet.

           Elsa forces a smile. He doesn't remember her. She can't 
           believe it.

           They stand there like that - two strangers waiting for the 
           toilet - as the PARTY prattles on in the background.

           IN THE BAR, AROUND THE CORNER FROM ELSA--

           The Captain waits, his back against the wall, keeping watch. 
           His PISTOL concealed in the flap of his coat.

           BACK IN THE HALLWAY--

           Elsa watches Alfons, curiously - almost amazed to see him 
           standing there, totally out of context. 

           She's starting to make Alfons feel uncomfortable, but not 
           threatened. To him, she's just another naive local.

           Finally, the TOILET FLUSHES and an OVERWEIGHT POLISH MAN 
           steps out and lumbers back towards the party.

           Alfons turns to Elsa, extends his hand, chivalrously--

                                 ALFONS
                        After you.

           She just stands there, frozen. This is her opportunity, but 
           she's too stunned, too overwhelmed to make her move.
           Alfons tilts his head, a hint of recognition flashing across 
           his face.

           Elsa can't wait any longer. She pulls her right hand from her 
           coat pocket. Alfons doesn't notice, but in it: she's holding 
           the SYRETTES. 

           Elsa steps towards him, getting closer and closer, then--

           SOMEONE WHISTLES from behind her. She stops, looks back over 
           her shoulder, and sees--

           TWO SOVIET SOLDIERS at the end of the hallway. The TALLER ONE 
           calls out to Alfons in Russian:

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        The Minister would like to speak 
                        with you, Mr. Niemann.

                                 ALFONS
                        The Minister?

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        He leaves in one hour.

           Alfons smooths his tie and ambles towards the Soldiers. As he 
           brushes past Elsa--

           She returns the syrettes to her pocket with a shaking hand. 
           Averts her eyes. As soon as he's gone--

           IN THE BAR, AROUND THE CORNER

           Elsa joins the Captain. They watch apprehensively, as the 
           Soviet Soldiers usher Alfons out the front door.

                                 ELSA
                        What do we do now?

           The Captain thinks. Just then--

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! The sound of FIREWORKS from outside.

           His eyes narrow. An idea.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Let's go.

           And they're on the move.

           EXT. ZAGAN - TOWN SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           CELEBRATORY FIREWORKS LIGHT UP THE SKY above the TOWN SQUARE, 
           completely packed now with PEOPLE, staring up in awe.
           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

           Alfons watches, momentarily hypnotized. Then--

           Another WHISTLE from his Soviet escorts. He snaps to 
           attention, follows them to--

           A SOVIET MILITARY JEEP parked next to the BAR. The Soldiers 
           get in the front, Alfons gets in the back, and the jeep 
           rumbles away, headed for a nearby ALLEY.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! The FIREWORKS continue.

           INT./EXT. MILITARY JEEP/ALLEYWAY - THAT MOMENT

           The TALLER SOLDIER drives, sharing a cigarette with the 
           SHORTER SOLDIER riding shotgun, both a little drunk. Alfons 
           listens absently from the back as they chit-chat in Russian:

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        I'm going to eat a nice pirozhki. 

                                 SHORTER SOLDIER
                        I don't care about food. Everything 
                        tastes the same to me now anyway.

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        What do you mean?

           The Shorter One touches a scar behind his ear--

                                 SHORTER SOLDIER
                        Shrapnel. In Kursk. They say I'll 
                        never taste again.

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        A life without pirozhki?!

                                 SHORTER SOLDIER
                        'Pirozhki.' Who gives a shit. The 
                        first thing I'm going to do is fuck 
                        my wife.

                                 TALLER SOLDIER
                        You know, I changed my mind. The 
                        first thing I'm going to do is fuck 
                        your wife too.

           They share a big laugh, when suddenly--

           A FIGURE APPEARS in front of them - a man staggering 
           drunkenly towards the jeep, blocking their path.

           The Taller Soldier SLAMS on the brakes. 
                                 TALLER SOLDIER 
                        Look at this kozyol!

           He HONKS the horn. Yells out the window--

                                 TALLER SOLDIER 
                        MOVE YOU DRUNKEN BASTARD.

           Alfons cranes his neck, leaning forward to get a better look 
           out the FRONT WINDSHIELD--

           The alleyway is dark. The jeep's low headlights leave the 
           man's face in shadow. He's stumbling drunk--

           The Taller Soldier honks the horn again--

           The man staggers towards the jeep, steadying himself on the 
           hood for a moment. Alfons squints his eyes, trying to place 
           this man's face. Then--

           CRACK! CRACK! The fireworks illuminate the alleyway in QUICK 
           FLASHES OF WHITE LIGHT. In those quick flashes--

           A glimpse of the man's face. Those cold grey eyes...

           Alfons' mouth drops open. He knows this man. And suddenly he 
           understands everything. He's about to speak up when--

           CRACK! CRACK! More FIREWORKS BURST overhead, providing the 
           perfect cover for--

           The Captain to lunge forward and SMASH his LUGER into the 
           back of the Taller Soldier's head. Dropping the big man 
           instantly. Pivoting, the Captain WHIPS the heavy pistol into 
           the Shorter Soldier's forehead, knocking him out cold.

           It's all over in a split-second. Before Alfons even has a 
           chance to stand--

           The JEEP DOOR opens, Elsa slips inside and--

           IMMEDIATELY PLUNGES A MORPHINE SYRETTE INTO ALFONS' THIGH.

           Alfons cries out in shock as his body goes limp. He looks at 
           Elsa, eyes trembling, paralyzed by fear and narcotics. Elsa 
           stares back, voice barely a whisper:

                                 ELSA
                        Do you remember what you said to 
                        me, after you ripped my baby out of 
                        my body, and left me to bleed?

           She stares straight into his eyes, channeling all of her pain 
           and grief into this moment. A tear rolls down her cheek.
                                 ELSA 
                        You said 'let go'. You told me I 
                        could make all this pain go away if 
                        I would only 'let go'. 

           Alfons grabs Elsa's coat, squeezes tightly. He opens his 
           mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. Then--

           ELSA PLUNGES THE SECOND SYRETTE INTO HIS THIGH, ELEVATING HIS 
           HEARTRATE, SENDING HIM STRAIGHT FOR: The Great Beyond.

           Alfons gasps. He sinks into the seat, looking out the front 
           windshield, where he sees-- 

           The Captain, watching in silhouette, like some deathly ghost.

           Elsa grabs hold of Alfons' face, forces him to look at her.

                                 ELSA 
                        Let go, Herr Niemann. 

           Alfons stares straight at Elsa, eyes bulging, breath shallow. 
           He releases his grip on Elsa's coat as his head lolls back--

           Elsa holds it tightly, so Alfons has nowhere to look but her 
           eyes. She wants to watch it happen. She wants to see the 
           lights go out.

                                 ELSA 
                        LET GO.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Flashes of HAUNTING WHITE LIGHT fill the 
           jeep as the fireworks continues in the background. 

           Alfons' breathing gets slower and slower, until finally: his 
           eyes go dark, and he slips into the Great Beyond. 

           Elsa stares down at his lifeless face - feeling all the 
           vengeance, the malice, the pain swirling inside her.

           The other DOOR opens. The Captain stands looking back at her. 
           He glances at Alfons, confirms he's dead. Turns back to Elsa--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        The briefcase.

           With that, the Captain is gone. Elsa takes one more look at 
           Alfons' bloated face, then grabs his BRIEFCASE and races 
           after the Captain. As they escape into the shadows-- 

           The jeep sits motionless in the narrow alleyway, the 
           silhouettes of the THREE BODIES inside briefly illuminated by 
           the FIREWORKS BURSTING in the Town Square behind it. 
           CRACK. CRACK. CRACK...

                                                             HARD CUT TO: 

           EXT. THE BOBER RIVER - DAWN

           The Captain washes off the filth from the road in the clear 
           water of a FLOWING RIVER. Behind him--

           Elsa sits on the riverbank, neck wrapped with the Captain's 
           worn handkerchief. She struggles with the clasps on ALFONS' 
           BRIEFCASE, finally gets them open--

           PAPERS, STAMPS and FOLDERS spill out in a pile on the grass. 
           On top of it all: an SS-ISSUE LUGER P38.

           Elsa looks at the pistol, looks at the Captain--

           His back is turned, he's washing his face.

           In a snap decision, she picks up the gun and pockets it. One 
           more nervous glance up at the Captain--

           He didn't notice.

           She continues to rifle through the briefcase. Then, in a 
           small pocket of the case, she discovers--

           FOUR UNWRAPPED BARS OF CHOCOLATE!

           Elsa gasps. She can hardly contain her excitement. She calls 
           out, her voice a rasping whisper--

                                 ELSA
                        I found chocolate!

           She gleefully holds up the chocolate bars. The Captain gives 
           her the faintest smile and returns to his washing.

           Elsa tears open one of the bars and chomps into it. Her 
           eyelids flutter, her head falls back - pure ecstasy.

                                 ELSA 
                        It's fresh!

           The Captain couldn't care less about chocolate - fresh or 
           not. He's started in on his LAUNDRY.

           Elsa digs deeper into the briefcase, and finds--

           A small STACK OF FORGED PASSPORTS.

           She opens one up and sees-- 
           A PHOTOGRAPH of a somber, middle-aged man with sad eyes 
           staring back at her. This is SEBASTIAN - another member of 
           the Captain's doomed unit who we'll meet later.

           Elsa takes a moment to study his face. Can't place it. She 
           sets the passport aside, opens another one, and goes rigid 
           when she sees--

           ANTON RICHTER'S PHOTOGRAPH staring back at her. Shakily, she 
           turns to the Captain.

                                 ELSA 
                        ...look at this.

           The Captain puts his laundry on hold and approaches. She 
           hands him the passport--

                                 ELSA 
                        It's his.

           The Captain nods. Seeing Richter's face again has taken him 
           to a dark place.

                                 ELSA 
                        What does that mean?

           He takes one more look at the photograph, then folds the 
           passport and puts it in his back pocket.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        It means he's not going anywhere.

           The Captain kneels down and digs around in his own bag.

           Elsa finally opens the last PASSPORT in the stack. Her mouth 
           falls open, and all the breath leaves her body.

           CLOSE ON, a black-and-white PHOTOGRAPH OF LENI, Richter's 
           young daughter. This passport is for her.

                                 ELSA
                        Oh my God...

           Elsa's hands start to shake.

           The Captain looks back at her. She can't speak. All she can 
           do is stand, and offer the passport.

           The Captain examines it, and immediately understands. 

           Tears of joy stream down Elsa's face.

                                 ELSA 
                        She's alive... She's alive...
           She drops to her knees, breaking down. All those months of 
           not knowing, all that time spent fearing the worst, erased in 
           a moment. It's the most painful kind of relief.

           The Captain watches her, unsure how to react. He looks like 
           he wants to say something, but Elsa is completely lost in the 
           joy of the moment. 

                                 ELSA 
                        I can't believe it...

           Elsa smiles, wipes away her tears. Takes a deep breath. She 
           laughs softly to herself.

                                 ELSA 
                        She's alive!

           The Captain stares sadly back at her, slowly offers her the 
           passport--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Keep that safe.

           Elsa holds the passport in her lap, gripping it tightly. She 
           wipes her nose with her sleeve. Grins.

           The Captain returns to the river, troubled. Continues his 
           washing. He removes his shirt, his back to Elsa as he 
           splashes water over his chest and shoulders.

           Elsa watches him, absently. She's in her memories now, her 
           mood darkening.

                                 ELSA
                        I remember when he chose me. We 
                        were standing on the platform, next 
                        to the train. He pointed at me and 
                        said, 'that one.' 

           The Captain is listening, but doesn't respond. 

                                 ELSA 
                        I thought it meant I was going to 
                        be okay.

           He keeps washing until finally--

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You survived.

           She considers this, uncertain. The Captain turns towards her 
           now, and Elsa notices--

           The gruesome BURN SCAR over his old SS DEATH'S HEAD TATTOO.
                                 ELSA
                        Did it hurt?

           The Captain looks down at his chest. At Elsa.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        It hurt.

           Elsa stares down at her own tattoo. A permanent reminder. She 
           rubs at it gently.

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON, the Captain's SS DAGGER, resting on RED HOT COALS. 

           The Captain watches as Elsa wraps a rag around her hand and 
           pulls the knife from the fire. She examines the blade - 
           GLOWING WHITE HOT.

           She looks at the Captain.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You have to hold it flat.

           Elsa looks down at the outside of her left arm--

           143894. Her camp serial number.

           She takes a deep breath. Works up the courage. Then--

           Elsa presses the burning blade to her skin. It SIZZLES and 
           SMOKES and she SCREAMS IN AGONY. But she doesn't let go. She 
           burns her tattoo until there's nothing left.

           The Captain watches.

           Finally, Elsa drops the knife. The Captain takes his CANTEEN, 
           pouring COLD WATER on the wound - a vicious, blackened burn. 

           Elsa studies it carefully, fascinated. With a deep breath, 
           she closes her eyes.

           EXT. THE GHOST TOWN - AFTERNOON

           The Zundapp rolls into--

           A small village at the edge of a dense FOREST, undiscovered 
           by the Soviets, abandoned by the villagers.

           It's eerily well-preserved, almost untouched by the war. 
           Except for the fact that it's completely deserted. 

           DOORS to small COTTAGES sway in the breeze, offering interior 
           glimpses: A dining table is set for Sunday dinner.
           A pair of dress shoes sit on the floor by a chair. Fresh 
           laundry hangs in a yard.

           It's as if everyone just suddenly vanished into thin air.

           Elsa clings to the Captain as they glide down the street, a 
           DIRTY BANDAGE around her arm. The emptiness surrounds them.

           EXT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Captain pulls over and parks in front of a quaint, old 
           house. It's rustic, charming.

           He shuts off the engine. They dismount and study the house. 
           Elsa works the front gate back and forth nervously.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We could make it to Lake Müritz 
                        tomorrow if we leave at dawn. We'll 
                        spend the night here. 

           Elsa smiles bitterly to herself.

                                 ELSA
                        Home.

           INT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - DUSK

           Elsa and the Captain walk carefully into the quiet house, 
           listening closely. 

           The wind whistles through an open window. 

           Elsa places a hand over her nose and mouth, wrinkles her 
           face. She turns slowly to the Captain.

                                 ELSA
                        Smell that...?

           The Captain nods. He knows that smell. Death.

           He turns and climbs the stairs, performing a thorough sweep 
           of the house.

           Elsa glances at the open window, a season of dust and rain 
           has warped the windowsill, stained the curtains.

           Upstairs, the sound of heavy boots and sliding furniture. The 
           Captain's diligence.

           Elsa drops her satchel on the kitchen table. She wanders into 
           the living room, running her hand along the frame of the 
           door, the grain of the wooden walls - the feel of home.
           In the corner, sits a dirty BABY CARRIAGE covered in a ragged 
           red blanket. It stands out - doesn't belong here. 

           Elsa stares at it, her breathing goes shallow. She takes a 
           faltering step towards it, visibly upset. Closer and closer, 
           dread building with every step, when suddenly-- 

           She hears the sound of QUIET FOOTSTEPS from behind her--

           Elsa turns to see, A YOUNG ROMANI GIRL standing in the 
           doorway, defiant, scared. A SMALL KITCHEN KNIFE clutched in 
           one hand. She's barely twelve years-old. This is VERONIKA. 

                                 VERONIKA
                             (with a gentle accent)
                        We have nothing left for you to 
                        steal.

           For a second, Elsa looks like she might cry. She reaches out 
           towards the girl almost blindly. Veronika steps back, afraid. 
           She calls out, in Romanian:

                                 VERONIKA 
                        Josef, Lida, get the twins, we're 
                        going!

           Veronika brandishes the knife. She backs up slowly into the 
           kitchen, never taking her eyes off Elsa. 

           JOSEF (7) and LIDA (8) appear behind her, they look 
           terrified. They hold their meager belongings between them.

           Elsa kneels down, both hands held out in front of her. She's 
           gentle, open. We've never seen her like this before.

                                 ELSA
                        You're safe, it's okay, you're 
                        okay.

           At the sound of the voices, the Captain barrels down the 
           stairs, Luger drawn - but before he can say a word, Elsa is 
           hushing him--

                                 ELSA 
                        Wait. It's alright--

           As soon as they see the Captain, Josef and Lida begin crying, 
           hiding behind Veronika, speaking in a language neither Elsa 
           nor the Captain understand.

           The Captain takes in this bizarre scene, his gun half-raised. 

                                 JOSEF
                        Vero! Vero, help please--
           Elsa puts a hand on the Captain's arm, gently dropping his 
           aim to the floor. 

           From around the corner, two more children, MARKETA (6) and 
           VOJTECH (6) stand, frozen.

                                 VERONIKA
                        Please. Let us go.

           Veronika's eyes are pleading. 

                                 ELSA
                        There are so many of you.

           The band of orphans stares at the Captain, at Elsa, afraid. 
           They've seen only the bad in people for as long as they can 
           remember. 

                                 ELSA 
                        You're okay. It's okay. We have 
                        food. Food.  

           Elsa moves slowly towards the kitchen table, carefully 
           digging out a BAR OF CHOCOLATE--

           She turns back to the children, slowly opening the wrapper. 
           Vojtech stares, almost confused by the sight of it.   

           EXT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - BACKYARD - DUSK

           CRACK. The Captain splits firewood in the backyard, focused, 
           but keeping a loose eye on the two Romani Boys--

           Nearby, bathed in the light of a half-broken lantern, Vojtech 
           and Josef clumsily help him stack the pieces. 

           INT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Elsa watches the two boys outside through the kitchen window 
           as she digs through a pile of SHRIVELED POTATOES.

           Veronika sits nearby, toying with the empty CHOCOLATE WRAPPER 
           curiously.

           Behind them, Lida and Marketa play with ALFONS' LEATHER 
           BRIEFCASE, opening and closing its latches, giggling - their 
           fear already forgotten.

           Veronika presses the paper wrapper out on the counter, 
           running her hand across, trying to make it perfectly smooth.

                                 ELSA
                        You can help me... if you like.
           Veronika meticulously folds the wrapper and places it in her 
           pocket. She helps Elsa sift through the potatoes. There's an 
           odd emptiness about her, unfitting for a girl her age.

                                 ELSA 
                        You are Romani?

                                 VERONIKA
                        Yes.

                                 ELSA
                        All of you?

                                 VERONIKA
                        Yes. They brought us on the trains. 
                        To the camps.

           They work silently for a moment.

                                 ELSA
                        How do you say "potato" in your 
                        language?

                                 VERONIKA
                        ...Poovéngro.

           Elsa smiles.

                                 ELSA
                        In Polish, it is ziemnniak.

           Veronika nods, not giving her much. 

                                 ELSA 
                        How did you find this place?

                                 VERONIKA
                        I prayed for it.

           This unsettles Elsa.

                                 VERONIKA 
                        I closed my eyes and talked to God. 
                        Is that not how you found it?

           Elsa considers this, but doesn't respond.

                                 ELSA
                        ...are these all your brothers and 
                        sisters?

                                 VERONIKA
                        We met in the camps. My real 
                        brother is Pawel.
                                 ELSA
                        Which one is he?

                                 VERONIKA
                        He is in the tushni. I do not know 
                        the word for you.

           Veronika gestures to the BABY CARRIAGE in the far corner. 

           Elsa looks at it. Her face goes ashen as she suddenly 
           understands. The smell...

                                 VERONIKA 
                        He was too hungry.

           Veronika finds a rotten potato, sets it aside.

           Elsa is devastated. She turns away, on the verge of tears. 
           Slowly, she gathers herself. Picks up a potato. 

                                 ELSA
                        Kolyska. In Polish we call it a 
                        kolyska.

           Veronika finally looks at her. Gives her the faintest smile. 
           Elsa smiles back.

           They listen to the sounds of the children playing in the 
           background as they peel the potatoes.

           INT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The makeshift family sits around the dinner table, lit by 
           candlelight, an impressive spread before them. They've 
           already been sitting a while and half the food is gone.

           The Captain and Elsa sit opposite each other - the children 
           surrounding them.

           The atmosphere is relaxed - jovial even.

           Vojtech and Josef can't stop giggling. They pick small 
           potatoes out of the bowl and toss them into the air, trying 
           and failing to catch them in their mouths.

           Every time one of them tries and misses, the other erupts 
           with laughter. They're just children being children.

           Veronika laughs, lost in the moment, troubles forgotten. Even 
           the Captain is smiling.

           After another unsuccessful toss by Josef--

           The Captain picks the potato off the table.
           All attention is on him now, unsure of what to expect. 
           Vojtech and Josef are particularly curious, staring up at him 
           with mouths agape. Finally:

           The Captain tosses the potato high in the air and catches it 
           in his mouth. First try.

           The children's eyes go wide with amazement. They laugh and 
           cheer like it was the greatest thing they've ever seen.

           The Captain chews and laughs, completely disarmed. This is a 
           side of him we never expected to see. He locks eyes with--

           Elsa, across the table, staring at him with something like 
           gratitude.

           INT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The house is dark.

           Elsa sits in an old chair, the children curled up asleep in 
           the living room around her. She watches them, their chests 
           rising and falling. 

           The CREAK of a chair in the kitchen draws her attention. She 
           rises softly, heads for--

           THE KITCHEN

           The Captain sits, wide awake, hunched over the table, eyes 
           far away - his entire body trembling violently from an 
           intense panic attack. He slowly turns to see--

           Elsa, standing in the doorway, watching him. 

           His breathing is shallow and quick. He looks like a wounded 
           animal, curled up in a hole, waiting to die.

           Elsa takes a small step into the kitchen. Approaches him, 
           carefully - a powerful tenderness in her eyes. She notices 
           the STACK OF PASSPORTS open on the table.

           The Captain tenses up as she gets closer. He wants to stand 
           up, wants to leave, but he can't move. He breaks into a cold 
           sweat as the tremors penetrate deep into his core.

           She steps up behind him, and stands there, breathing with 
           him. He can feel the warmth of her body, close to his, and it 
           terrifies him. His heart pounds. He can't catch his breath. 
           He tries to stand, but--

           Elsa stops him, gently running her fingers through his hair.
           The Captain sinks back into his seat. He grunts as his panic 
           intensifies, nearly hyperventilating now. Elsa just holds him 
           tightly as she whispers--

                                 ELSA
                        Shh........

           The Captain closes his eyes and leans his head back, finally 
           surrendering himself to her touch. 

           Elsa gently pulls him close, shushing him softly as if 
           soothing a newborn baby.

           They stand there like that for a long time. Eventually--

           The Captain stops trembling. His breathing slows. Returns to 
           normal. The panic subsides, and he experiences a kind of 
           peace he hasn't felt since before the war.

           His body relaxes, all the tension he's been carrying for so 
           long evaporating through Elsa's fingertips. He sinks back 
           into the chair, leaning his head against her stomach. 

           In the dim light of a single candle, Elsa cradles the 
           Captain's head, gently running her fingers through his hair 
           as he breathes softly, in and out. 

           EXT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

           The Captain, stripped to the waist, digs a small PIT in the 
           backyard. A shuttered lantern casting a faint orange glow.

           THE WINDOW

           Elsa watches him, blank.

           THE BACKYARD

           The Captain digs. Beside him, a SMALL BLANKET-WRAPPED BUNDLE.

           INT. THE ABANDONED HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Morning comes. It's barely dawn. Elsa fixes her dress, the 
           children curled up in the room around her. 

           THE KITCHEN

           The Captain looks like he hasn't slept. His travel bag sits 
           out on the table in front of him. He's ready to go. Now.

           Elsa walks into the room. The Captain glances at her, then 
           shoulders his bag, and quietly walks out of the house into 
           the morning. 
           Elsa watches him go, reluctant to leave. Turning back into 
           the kitchen one last time, she notices--

           A SMALL PILE of their remaining CANNED FOOD and RATIONS 
           arranged on the table.

           She stares at it a long moment. Then reaches into her pocket 
           and retrieves a RUSTY CAN OPENER. She gently lays it down on 
           the table. Takes a deep breath, then turns to go--

           And there's Veronika, standing in the doorway to the living 
           room. She's wide awake, watching, betrayed. 

           They say nothing. There’s nothing to say. 

           Elsa lowers her head, and walks out of the house.

           EXT. ROADSIDE FARMSTEAD - MORNING

           Next to a narrow, unpaved road, WHEAT FIELDS stretch as far 
           as the eye can see. The wind rolls through it like swells in 
           some golden sea.

           The Zundapp rumbles past, the Captain and Elsa take in the 
           scenery. Finally, they spot--

           A tiny FARMHOUSE. The boarded-up windows and pitted roof 
           can't hide the steady plume of smoke rising from its chimney.

           The Captain stops the bike and dismounts. Elsa follows. They 
           look at the farmhouse for a moment. The Captain opens 
           Eckhart's Ledger, checking some careful list.

                                 ELSA
                        What is this place?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We're ten miles from Lake Müritz. 
                        This is our last man.

           Then, without another word, the Captain draws his Luger and 
           heads for the farmhouse.

           Elsa takes a few moments before she follows him, still shaken 
           from having left the children behind.

           INT. ROADSIDE FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           The door CREAKS open and the Captain steps inside with his 
           gun raised. He moves cautiously past the entrance. Elsa is 
           right behind him, staying close.  

           They're tense and alert - no idea what to expect. As they 
           round the corner, they're suddenly faced with--
           A small FAMILY eating lunch. Seated at an old, rustic table 
           with fresh rolls, hard-boiled eggs, and homemade jam - 
           mother, father, son and daughter. Their attention fixed on--    

           Elsa and the Captain standing next to the WOOD-BURNING STOVE, 
           his gun aimed squarely at THE MAN FROM THE PASSPORT--

           SEBASTIAN (36), the patriarch, aged far beyond his years with 
           thinning hair and deep lines in his forehead. He sits at the 
           head of the table, staring sadly at the Captain.

           The CHILDREN aren't more than 10 years old. They stare up at 
           the gun with wide eyes and gaping mouths. 

           CHRISTINE (34), their mother, places her hands on the table, 
           careful not to make any sudden movements. Her eyes swivel 
           between the gun and her children. She's scared.

           The room hums with quiet tension.

           Elsa locks eyes with Christine. Looks at the children. She's 
           horrified and ashamed. She wants to leave. But the Captain is 
           in control. In German: 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Stand up.

           All the color drains from Sebastian's face as he looks around 
           the table at his family. He knew this day would come - one 
           way or another. He stands.

           Christine reaches across, grips his hand, panicked:

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sebastian...

           Sebastian cradles his wife's face in his hand, comforts her 
           with a look. He bends over and gives her the most gentle kiss 
           on the forehead.

           She shuts her eyes. A tear rolls down her face.

           Sebastian turns to his children. Kisses them both. They don't 
           quite understand what's happening, but they know it's bad. 
           They start to cry, softly.

           He looks at his wife. Tender, but firm. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Stay inside. 

           She nods her head, trying to hold it together for the kids.
           This is all too much for Elsa. She's being torn apart inside. 
           She looks at the Captain.

           But he refuses to look at her. He's blocked out everything. 
           Everything except Sebastian:

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Let's go.

           Sebastian takes one last look at his family. Then turns to 
           face the Captain who guides him towards the front door. For 
           the first time we notice--

           Sebastian walks with a noticeable limp, no doubt a remnant of 
           the war. 

           Elsa absorbs this. She can't help but look over her shoulder 
           one last time as she follows the Captain outside. The moment 
           she does, she wishes she hadn't:

           They stare back at her, pleading for mercy with their eyes.

           EXT. ROADSIDE FARMSTEAD - FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER

           The three of them march through the fields in a line - 
           Sebastian in the lead, followed by the Captain and his gun, 
           and Elsa in the rear. 

           Sebastian moves slowly, the tall grass and uneven soil 
           getting the best of his lame leg.

           They walk for what feels like forever. Finally:

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Stop here.

           Sebastian stops. They're a good distance from the farmhouse 
           now. He turns around to face the Captain and Elsa.

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        On your knees.

           With great difficulty, Sebastian lowers himself to his knees. 
           He carefully removes his spectacles, holds them in his hands. 
           He looks up at them, a man resigned to his fate. Softly--

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Please do not hurt my children.

           The Captain gives him a small nod. Then steps forward, and 
           points his Luger at Sebastian's head. But before he can pull 
           the trigger, Elsa puts a hand on his arm--
                                 ELSA
                        Wait...

           The Captain looks at her for the first time since they entered 
           the farmhouse. He's angry - doesn't like her intervening.

           Sebastian observes them. He switches to English: 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You are Elsa.

           This strikes her like a dart in the chest. Hearing her name 
           come out of his mouth creates a connection between them that 
           makes all of this too heavy to bear. 

                                 ELSA
                        Yes...

           Sebastian speaks flatly, with an unsettling detachment--

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I know what Richter did to you.

           Tears pool in Elsa's eyes.

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        ...I was always afraid of the day 
                        when my children would ask me 
                        "why?" Why did we do this? 
                             (pauses)
                        I tried to imagine what I would say 
                        to them, how I could explain, 
                        but... there is no reason. No 
                        logic. Death is a void. It offers 
                        no explanation. We were its 
                        instruments, under its spell.

           The Captain keeps the gun pointed at his head, Sebastian's 
           statements weighing heavy on him as well.

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        I felt so guilty about surviving it 
                        all... until I realized the truth 
                        about this war.

           Sebastian looks right at her, deep into her soul.

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        There are no survivors.

           Elsa lets her tears fall, deeply affected. She opens her 
           mouth to say something when--
                                 CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                             (calling out)
                        FELIX!

           They all turn back towards the farmhouse to see:

           Way off in the distance, Christine is standing outside the 
           front door, arms wrapped around her daughter while--

           FELIX, Sebastian's 10 year-old son, runs full-speed straight 
           toward them. He's just a speck on the horizon right now, but 
           he's getting closer by the second.

                                 CHRISTINE 
                             (calling out)
                        FELIX! STOP!

           Elsa's face goes pale. She looks at the Captain--

           There's panic in his eyes now. He looks down at Sebastian who 
           pleads, desperate.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Please.... Do it now.

                                 CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                             (calling out)
                        FELIX! COME BACK!!!

           Felix keeps running. He's getting close.

           The Captain grips the trigger, torn.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Please. Don't let him see.

           Elsa's attention swivels from Felix to the Captain. She wants 
           to say something, do something, but she's paralyzed. Then--

           A FLOCK OF BIRDS flutters overhead. They fly towards the 
           TREELINE at the far end of the field. It's strangely beautiful.

           Elsa watches them a moment, in a daze. Until finally--

           She's snapped from her trance. She turns, raises a hand--

                                 ELSA
                        Don't-- 

           BANG. From a distance, we watch as Sebastian collapses face-
           first into the dirt, smoke rising from the Captain's gun.

           Felix immediately stops running. He stands frozen, as he 
           watches his father's body tumble to the ground.
           Elsa is stunned. Tears stream down her face. She can't speak.

           The Captain lowers his pistol, turns his back on Elsa and the 
           corpse. He takes a few steps into the field. 

           Elsa watches his shoulders rise and fall with his breathing. 
           She looks back at Sebastian. Then Felix. Her stomach turns.

           The Captain looks over his shoulder, tries to steady his 
           shaking hand.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We need to leave.

           He marches through the field, back towards his Zundapp.

           Elsa watches him go. Then looks back at the house and the 
           surviving members of the family. Something breaks inside her.

           EXT. NORTHERN WOODS - LATER

           The Zundapp roars down a forest ROAD. Elsa pounds furiously 
           on the Captain's back, screaming over the howl of the engine. 
           He pulls over and Elsa stumbles away from him-- 

                                 ELSA
                        You shouldn't have done it in front 
                        of his family.

           The Captain dismounts his bike, takes a few steps towards her--

                                 ELSA 
                        You shouldn't have done that.

           Then, something snaps in Elsa. She suddenly charges him, 
           furious, slapping him hard across the face.

           Elsa lashes out, again and again, but the Captain is more 
           concerned with calming her down than protecting himself. 
           Finally, he traps her arms, pulling her close - forcing her 
           into a kind of violent hug. 

           The Captain holds her like this as she fights him. Just as 
           suddenly, she stops, and sinks into his arms. She allows 
           herself to be held for only a moment before--

           Elsa pushes him away, viciously. 

                                 ELSA 
                        You murdered him. We murdered him. 
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        That man was responsible for 
                        Chamber Two at Einehof. He murdered 
                        four hundred people a day.

                                 ELSA
                        In front of his son!

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        He was there. He deserved to die.

           Elsa narrows her eyes.

                                 ELSA
                        And what about you? You were there 
                        too.

           The Captain looks away.

                                 ELSA 
                        How many of us have you killed? Do 
                        you even know? 

           The Captain doesn't respond.

                                 ELSA 
                        And children. Did you kill them 
                        too? 

           Something dark flickers behind his eyes. He's shaking now.

           There's only the sound of Elsa's shallow breathing, as she 
           stares at him with utter contempt.

                                 ELSA 
                        You think this is about justice? 
                        There is no justice. There's just 
                        people. Taking what they want.

           A long, tense moment as they stare each other down.

           Elsa picks up her bag and starts walking down the road.

           His hand instinctively goes for his gun, but he stops 
           himself. He watches her until she's a speck in the distance.

           EXT. THE BORDER WOODS - DUSK

           SERIES: The German countryside at dusk.

           The Border Woods. In the distance, clear-cut forests create a 
           desolate no man's land. The dividing line between the Russian 
           and British zones. 
           EXT. THE BORDER WOODS - CAMP - THAT MOMENT

           The Captain sits next to a campfire, alone again. He stares 
           blankly into the flames, a hollow look in his eyes.

           He holds his gun in his hands, absently working the safety 
           catch on and off. On and off. We've seen this before. 

           INT. SMALL OFFICE, 1944 - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           TEXT: Einehof Camp II, 1944

           The Captain sits behind a desk, motionless, wearing the same 
           blank stare. He's dressed in his ALL BLACK WAFFEN-SS UNIFORM, 
           which somehow doesn't look as impressive as it did before in 
           the bar.

           A RADIO in the corner is tuned to an AMERICAN BROADCAST:

                                 RADIO BROADCAST (O.S.)
                        --Allied armies in Normandy have 
                        pushed closer to their immediate 
                        objectives and cut the mainline of 
                        German communications in Northern 
                        France-- 

           A CIGARETTE burns in an ASHTRAY on his desk - a long, grey 
           cylinder of undisturbed ash. Beside it--

           OFFICIAL ORDERS from Berlin. Stamped and signed. The Captain 
           holds them loosely, staring into nothingness.

           He's surrounded by forms and reports - the kind of papers 
           you'd see in any office. 

           But these documents organize and record the deaths of 
           millions. We see fragments: name, date of execution, et al. 
           It's all very orderly.

                                 RADIO BROADCAST (O.S.) 
                        --Many of the German strong points 
                        along the Rhine have fallen, with 
                        more collapsing everyday--

           Finally, the Captain snaps out of his trance. He clicks off 
           the radio, gathers his OFFICER'S CAP, and exits into--

           THE OFFICE ANTECHAMBER

           The Captain's entire unit has gathered to receive the latest 
           update from Berlin. Twelve men standing at attention. Every 
           man the Captain has killed.

           The Captain joins them, standing stiffly.
           A door opens, and Werner steps into the room. In his hand, 
           the same SIGNED ORDERS from the Captain's office. He surveys 
           the men, then begins in emotionless German: 

                                 WERNER
                        In ten days time, our camp will be 
                        relocated further west. We don't 
                        have the time or resources to 
                        transport the prisoner population. 
                        Therefore, we must increase our 
                        liquidation efforts by a minimum of 
                        five hundred percent. We cannot 
                        allow anything from this camp to 
                        fall into the hands of the enemy.

           The Captain glances around at the other men. 

                                 WERNER 
                        We have been chosen personally by 
                        Commandant Richter to spearhead 
                        this great mission. 

           The men assembled stand taller at this, eyes burning with 
           passion. They still believe.

                                 WERNER 
                        This is our solemn duty as 
                        defenders of the Reich. We can not, 
                        and will not fail.

           Werner snaps his heels together, saluting fist to heart.

                                 WERNER 
                        My honor is loyalty.

                                 DEATH SQUAD
                        My honor is loyalty!

           The men chant as one. Again and again and again.

           The Captain stands, silent, staring straight ahead. Haunted.

                                 SEBASTIAN (PRE-LAP)
                        Chamber two is down again.

           EXT. EINEHOF CAMP II, 1944 - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Thousands of PRISONERS, men, women and children, all starving 
           and emaciated, some naked, some not, stand in lines guarded 
           by groups of SS SOLDIERS holding rifles.

           It's lightly SNOWING.
           This is a place of abject misery - the absolute worst place 
           in the history of the modern world. Yet, it is organized 
           misery. Everyone knows their place.

           The Captain marches through the CROWDS alongside Sebastian. 
           He doesn't spend much time outside his office these days, and 
           the sights and smells are difficult for him to process.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        They think it was due to a change 
                        in temperature. Last night dropped 
                        below zero. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How long has it been down?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Just under an hour. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How long is the queue?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Just over fifteen hundred.

           Finally they reach--

           THE GAS CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           An enormous, square, concrete BUILDING with no windows.

           Fifteen hundred PRISONERS stand outside, stripped completely 
           naked, shivering in the cold. They're being guarded by only a 
           handful of SOLDIERS. 

           On the side of the building is a LARGE METAL LOCKER 
           containing the MACHINERY that makes the chamber run. 

           Werner supervises as TWO SOLDIERS (Leo and Oskar from the 
           brothel) tinker with the valves.

           The Captain and Sebastian approach. Leo and Oskar immediately 
           drop their tools and salute them--

                            LEO
                                                           OSKAR
           Heil, Hitler.
                                               Heil, Hitler.

                                 THE CAPTAIN/SEBASTIAN
                        Heil, Hitler.

           Werner gestures to the locker--
                                 WERNER
                        The ventilator's broken. We need 
                        new valves from Gorlitz.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How long will that take?

                                 LEO
                        About twenty-four hours.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        That's fifty-six hundred prisoners.

           Shivering PRISONERS nearby are forced to listen to their 
           executioners discuss the logistics of their imminent death.

                                 WERNER
                        We need to organize a firing squad.

           Werner turns to Sebastian:

                                 WERNER 
                        Major, put the women in Block 
                        Eleven into Seven and Eight. Take 
                        six soldiers and three thousand 
                        rounds of ammunition.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Yes, sir.

           To the Captain:

                                 WERNER
                        Captain, take these prisoners and 
                        supervise a firing squad in Block 
                        Eleven.

           The Captain hesitates. Werner picks up on this.

                                 WERNER 
                        Is that agreeable, Captain?

           The Captain looks from Werner to Sebastian. Feels the 
           pressure of their stares. Finally:

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 WERNER
                        Very well.

           Werner and the other men spring into action. The Captain 
           looks back at the line of PRISONERS, locks eyes with--
           AN OLD WOMAN. Sunken face, sagging breasts. Her deep brown 
           eyes contain a frightening kind of sadness.

           The Captain stares at her.

                                 ERICH (PRE-LAP)
                        NEXT.

           INT. BLOCK 11 - LATER (FLASHBACK)

           TWELVE NAKED PRISONERS line up in front of a CONCRETE WALL 
           littered with BLOODSTAINS and BULLET HOLES. They each stand a 
           meter apart, facing--

           Six SS SOLDIERS with MP40 MACHINE GUNS. Among them, Klaus and 
           Petr from Radio Werwolf, and Leo and Oskar. Off to the side, 
           stand the Captain and Erich from Liegnitz.

           Everyone, including the prisoners, gives off the feeling of 
           people simply following orders. The whole operation is 
           sterile, emotionless, and above all, efficient. 

                                 ERICH
                        Set.

           The Machine Gun Soldiers raise their MP40s.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Fire.

           The Captain flinches as the twelve prisoners are mowed down 
           by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

           The Soldiers wait a moment, make sure they're all dead, then--

                                 ERICH
                        Clear.

           Four JEWISH SONDERKOMMANDO perform the unimaginable task of 
           dragging the bodies of their kinsmen out a nearby DOOR, and 
           stacking them outside in a growing pile.

                                 ERICH 
                        NEXT.

           Another DOOR on the opposite end opens and--

           Twelve more PRISONERS file in and line up against the wall.

           CLOSE ON, the Captain's face as he observes the next killing. 
           It's getting to him. 

                                 ERICH (O.S.) 
                        Set.
           We hear the sound of MACHINE GUNS BEING LEVELED.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Fire...

           TIME PASSES IN MOMENTS:

           Flames from the BARREL of an MP40.

           The DOOR opens. PRISONERS enter.

           The Captain watches, stone-faced.

           BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE.

           The Captain looks like he might finally crack, when suddenly--

           The DOOR opens - before Erich calls "NEXT" - and Richter 
           steps through it. He maintains his old air of authority, but 
           underneath he looks tired - beaten.

           The Captain is surprised to see him. He looks at Richter with 
           an odd mixture of reverence and disgust.

           The Sonderkommando are in the process of dragging BODIES off 
           toward the pile.

           Richter observes this, seems pleased. 

                                 ERICH
                        NEXT.

           As another group of PRISONERS file in behind him, Richter 
           approaches the Captain--

                                 RICHTER
                        Captain.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Commandant.

           Richter salutes:

                                 RICHTER
                        Heil, Hitler.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Heil, Hitler.

           They shake hands and Richter embraces him with a warm smile. 
           For him, this marks a reunion between old friends. For the 
           Captain, it's something else.
                                 RICHTER
                        It's good to see you. Although, I 
                        didn't expect to find you in here.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        The ventilators in Chamber Two are 
                        broken. We've ordered a replacement 
                        from Gorlitz but it will take a day 
                        to arrive. We've organized a firing 
                        squad in the interim.

                                 RICHTER
                        We can afford no delays at this 
                        point.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I received the orders.

           There's a strange unspoken tension running through their 
           entire conversation. They both know the war is lost, but 
           they're unable to address it.

                                 RICHTER
                        You've always been a good soldier. 
                        A man of principle. A man who 
                        follows orders.

           The Captain gives him a perfunctory nod of appreciation.

                                 RICHTER 
                        I know I can trust you with this 
                        assignment.

           Richter turns his attention towards the ENTRANCE DOOR. He 
           calls out--

                                 RICHTER 
                        Alfons!

           As the door opens, we immediately CUT TIGHT ON--

           The Captain's face. We can't see what he's looking at, but it 
           horrifies him. HOLD.

           EXT. THE BORDER WOODS - MORNING

           The BARREL OF A RIFLE is pressed firmly into the Captain's 
           right temple. He opens his eyes slowly--

           Above him, THREE SOVIET SOLDERS stand in the rain, rifles 
           leveled loosely at his face. They look a little drunk, 
           passing around a BOTTLE OF VODKA.

           The Captain looks up at them, expressionless. 
           Finally, they start laughing.

           Then, a boot SLAMS into his ribs, his face. They STOMP on his 
           right hand BREAKING HIS FINGERS. This isn't just a beating, 
           it's revenge.

           A rough ROPE binds his hands. Strong arms hoist him off the 
           ground. A rifle butt CRASHES into his head and we CUT TO--

           EXT. THE BORDER ROAD, THE TRUCK - DAY

           The Captain rides in the back of an open SOVIET TRUCK, badly 
           beaten, face red with blood and dirt. His hands are bound 
           tightly behind his back. 

           The Soldiers up front sing a SOVIET VICTORY SONG at the top 
           of their lungs, slurring the words. 

           Trees rush past overhead, the Captain's breath fogs in the 
           cold air. It's over for him.

           Across from the Captain, one of the Soldier's stares straight 
           back at him. He speaks, in Russian:

                                 SOVIET SOLDIER
                        Why did you make me come here? Huh? 
                        You had to start this war, you 
                        stupid shit...

           The Captain looks back at him through bloodshot eyes.

                                 SOVIET SOLDIER 
                        You goddamn stupid shit...

           The sound of grinding gears interrupts the Soldier - the 
           truck is slowing down. 

           We pull out from the back of the truck, up and over to reveal--

           THE ROAD

           There, 40 yards ahead, is Elsa.

           She stands by the side of the muddy road, one hand raised, 
           flagging down the truck. 

           The Soviet Driver and his Navigator leer at her, still drunk. 
           They slow down and stop about ten feet away.

           Elsa calls out, in her accented English--

                                 ELSA
                        I'm looking for my husband.
           The two Soviets exchange a confused look. Elsa tries again.

                                 ELSA 
                        Please, comrades, he's not right, 
                        he just wandered off. Have you--

           Elsa is cut short as a lean, SOVIET SERGEANT climbs out of 
           the backseat and into the mud. He looks weathered and half-
           starved with a large scar on his face. He looks unkillable.

           The man takes a few, measured steps towards Elsa, before 
           turning to his men, and muttering in rapid-fire Russian.

           They break out in raucous laughter - maybe some crude joke.

           The man keeps walking towards Elsa until he's only a few 
           steps away. He looks her over, genuinely curious.

           Elsa is on edge. He could do or say anything.

           The Sergeant speaks in soft English:

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        You shouldn't wander around here by 
                        yourself. In these woods, women 
                        don't last long.

           He examines her shaven head, her various bandaged wounds. She 
           makes for a strange character.

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT 
                        What do you want, young lady?

           Elsa, sweet but stubborn--

                                 ELSA
                        I told you, I'm looking for my--

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        --Husband. I know. I heard.

           The Sergeant leers at her for a moment, not speaking.

                                 ELSA
                        Please, sir, my husband isn't right. 
                        We've been traveling, trying to 
                        reach relatives in Hanover... but 
                        last night he wandered off on his 
                        own. Please.

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        Your papers.
                                 ELSA
                        Of course.

           Elsa digs out her dirty, creased REFUGEE ID PAPERS, handing 
           them to the Sergeant with shaking hands. 

           The Sergeant turns and gestures to his men, and two Soldiers 
           drag the Captain out of the truck bed, holding him, bruised 
           and beaten, for Elsa to see.

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        This the man you're looking for?

           Elsa starts forward, covering her mouth, aghast.

                                 ELSA
                        Oh--

           She's horrified by the sight of him. But she collects 
           herself. Turns back to the Sergeant: 

                                 ELSA 
                        That's him. Thank you for finding 
                        him. 

           The other Soldiers watch her hungrily.

           The Sergeant looks over Elsa's Refugee Papers carefully. He 
           notes the unmistakable RED J, and beneath it, in small 
           lettering, "Einehof II, Jan. 1945".

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        You were in Einehof.

                                 ELSA
                        Yes.

           He stares at her. Then gestures to the Captain--

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        And this man is your husband?

           Elsa is less sure of herself now--

                                 ELSA
                        Yes.

           The Sergeant looks at her, almost curiously, like he doesn't 
           quite know what to make of her and her story.

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        What about his papers?
                                 ELSA
                        In his back pocket. His trousers.

           The Sergeant mutters something to his men, and one of them 
           searches the Captain's pockets. He pulls out--

           ANTON RICHTER'S FORGED PASSPORT. The Soldier walks it over to 
           the Sergeant, hands it to him.

           The Sergeant studies it. He knows this is not the same man. 
           He's caught Elsa in her lie. He knows it, and very quickly, 
           she knows it too.

           The Sergeant stares at her for a long time, open passport in 
           hand. Elsa trembles, growing anxious.

           Then, in perfectly-accented Yiddish:

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        Do you love him?

           Elsa blinks, surprised. She looks at the Sergeant, more 
           closely now, as if seeing him for the first time. She 
           replies, in Yiddish: 

                                 ELSA
                        I'm sorry?

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        Do you love him?

                                 ELSA 
                        Of course I do, he is my husband.

           The Soviet Sergeant looks back at her. Accepts her reasons, 
           whatever they may be. He hands her both passports.

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT
                        May God guard you and keep you 
                        safe.

           He turns back to the truck, to his men, and starts to laugh. 
           A rough, grating laugh. He gestures towards the kneeling 
           Captain, in Russian:

                                 SOVIET SERGEANT 
                        Fuck him. I'm hungry.

           The Soldiers hesitate, only for a moment, then cut the 
           Captain's bindings, leaving him kneeling in the mud.

           The Soviets climb back into the idling truck, moods swinging 
           back towards revelry. 
           Elsa takes a few halting steps towards the Captain, putting a 
           hand to his face, checking his bruises, his bleeding lip. 

           The Soviet Sergeant watches them for a moment as his driver 
           shifts them into gear. He looks like he wants to say 
           something. But instead he turns his attention back to his 
           men, and the BOTTLE in his hands.

           Elsa slowly helps the Captain to his feet. The two of them 
           watch the truck drive off down the road for a long time. 

           A LIGHT RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.

           EXT. NOTHERN WOODS, OPEN CLEARING - DUSK

           Elsa stands out of the rain near a ROTTING STUMP, lost in her 
           thoughts. She looks worn out, exhausted. She stares down at--

           LENI'S PASSPORT, tracing the blurry details of the young 
           girl's face with her finger. 

           The Captain stands across from her, soaked, leaning against a 
           barren tree. He holds his fractured arm against his chest, 
           head hung low, too tired to even tend to his wounds.

           Finally, Elsa breaks the silence. She's not even looking at 
           the Captain. She needs to tell this story.

                                 ELSA
                        When I got pregnant, I hid it from 
                        Richter as long as I could. I was 
                        sure he would kill me if he found 
                        out. But he didn't... He 
                        congratulated me.

           Elsa smiles bitterly.

                                 ELSA 
                        I started bleeding one day, and 
                        they took me to see the doctor. 
                        Alfons. It was a girl. They let me 
                        hold her all afternoon. But the 
                        next day she was gone. 

           The Captain stares at his feet, unable to face her. 

                                 ELSA 
                        When I asked Richter about it, he 
                        beat me with one of his boots. I 
                        didn't wake up for two days. I 
                        never asked about my baby again.
                             (tears fall)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELSA
                        A few days before the Soviets 
                        arrived, a guard pulled me from the 
                        room they kept me in. He took me to 
                        the fields. Everyone was out there, 
                        all the prisoners. They had them 
                        digging a pit. And even then, we 
                        didn't understand. They had us line 
                        up next to the pit. Then the 
                        soldiers started shooting. The man 
                        beside me fell on me as he died...
                             (pauses)
                        They just kept falling. The people. 
                        It seemed like it would never end. 
                        They were so heavy. I couldn't 
                        breathe. And then they buried us. I 
                        wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I 
                        waited until I couldn't hear them 
                        burying us anymore. I could feel 
                        the blood in my eyes, in my mouth. 
                        The smell. I thought I would die 
                        there. But I didn't...

           Elsa swallows hard.

                                 ELSA 
                        Every day, since then, I just kept 
                        asking myself: Why me? Why did I 
                        survive? I nearly went mad trying 
                        to understand that. But now I know.

           She looks up at him, eyes wet with tears.

                                 ELSA 
                        I survived so I could save my 
                        little girl.

           Elsa stares at him, laid completely bare. Tears run down her 
           face as she sways on her feet.

           The Captain stares back, used up.

           She takes a step, then another, then she collapses in the 
           Captain's arms. Holding him tightly, fiercely, desperately. 

           The Captain puts his arms around her slowly. His face is a 
           mess of shame and guilt, as he grips her tightly.

           EXT. THE BORDER WOODS, OPEN CLEARING - THE NEXT MORNING

           The Captain sits on his Zundapp in the middle of the woods. 
           The rain has eased up. 
           He climbs off the bike slowly, and we see that it's been 
           stripped, its saddle bags removed, straps and leather all gone. 
           He grips the handle, touches the gas tank. Saying goodbye.

           Elsa stands nearby, watching as--

           The Captain stuffs a DIRTY RAG into the open gas tank of the 
           bike. He sets it AFLAME. He stares at it, eyes shining, as it 
           burns its way towards the tank. Suddenly--

           THE BIKE GOES UP IN FLAMES. Roiling orange fire that consumes 
           the steel frame, the rubber tires. Everything. 

           The Captain watches it burn a while. This isn't easy for him. 
           He turns and walks out of the forest onto the muddy road. 

           EXT. NORTHERN GERMANY - THE BRITISH ZONE - LATER

           EXTENDED SERIES: Barbed wire. Train tracks. Muddy roads. 
           Northern Germany rolls by through the window of a moving 
           train. It's calmer here, peaceful even. 

           - Long lines of REFUGEES on the move fill the horizon.

           - A COLUMN OF BRITISH TANKS rolls past, soldiers handing out 
           SPARE RATIONS to civilians on the road. 

           - A single WINDMILL turns and turns on a barren hilltop.

           The SERIES ends on:

           EXT. LAKE MÜRITZ - LATE AFTERNOON

           It's small and charming - still water surrounded by overgrown 
           reeds and brush. A short distance away is--

           THE COTTAGE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH. RICHTER'S COTTAGE.

           FROM A DISTANCE

           Elsa and the Captain walk steadily down the muddy, hard-
           packed road. Tired, filthy, resolved. They slow to a halt, 
           unnerved by the sight of the simple little cottage.

           The two of them stand stiffly, Elsa helping keep the Captain 
           on his feet. Their breath fogs in the cold as they take in 
           the scene, watching for signs of movement.

           With difficulty, the Captain checks the clip on his PISTOL. 
           With one hand, he locks it back into place. 

           Elsa starts forward--
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Wait.

           She freezes.

           They stare at each other. The Captain opens his mouth like he 
           wants to say something. Something important.

           But he can't find the words. 

           Finally--

                                 THE CAPTAIN 
                        Stay close to me.

           The Captain heads towards the wooden cabin. Elsa hurries to 
           keep up. 

           EXT. RICHTER'S LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The two of them move slowly through the tall grass. Nerves 
           frayed.

           Elsa stays close to the Captain, tense, barely breathing. She 
           slows a bit as they pass--

           A SMALL CHICKEN COOP where a half-dozen HENS strut around, 
           pecking the dirt. One of them stares straight back at her--

           Elsa keep moving.

           All we can hear is the gentle sound of chickens clucking and 
           the wind blowing through the fields around them.

           INT. RICHTER'S LAKE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           It's dark. Then the front door opens a crack, and light 
           spills into the dim hallway.

           The Captain enters first, gun held shakily in front of him. 
           He moves cautiously, his wounded arm held behind him, 
           hovering over Elsa, protective.

           They walk slowly, with no idea what to expect. A chill runs 
           down Elsa's spine as she follows the Captain into--

           THE LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           The Captain stands in the doorway, gun extended, frozen - 
           paralyzed by some terrible emotion.

           Elsa steps up behind him, sees the reason--
           LENI, Richter's young daughter, sits on the floor of the 
           sparse living room, playing happily with her dolls.

           On the wall behind her hangs a framed PORTRAIT OF ADOLF 
           HITLER. It seems to stare down at the little blonde girl, who 
           finally looks up, registers the new guests. She smiles.

           Elsa's eyes water - a knife in her chest. There she is. My 
           daughter. As powerful as the photo was, seeing her in the 
           flesh is almost too much to bear. Elsa can barely breathe. 

           She drifts towards Leni, hand outstretched, as if in a 
           trance. But before she reaches her--

           Leni suddenly looks past the Captain, and waves her little 
           hand. In German:

                                 LENI
                        Vatti.

           The Captain tenses up, breathing hard--

           Behind him, Anton Richter stands with a MAUSER PISTOL pressed 
           firmly into the Captain's neck. 

           Elsa turns. Goes pale.  

           Finally, Richter speaks, in perfect English:

                                 RICHTER
                        Hello, Elsa.

           Two little words. It's too much for her. All the pain he 
           caused her, the power he held over her, comes rushing back 
           all at once. Tears roll down her cheeks.

           Richter turns his attention to the Captain:

                                 RICHTER 
                        Please don't point your gun at my 
                        daughter, Captain.

           Just like with Elsa, Richter holds some strange power over 
           the Captain. He lowers his shaking hand.

           Richter smiles at Leni, in German:

                                 RICHTER 
                        Hello, darling, these are our new 
                        friends.

           He leans in close:
                                 RICHTER 
                        Give me the gun, Captain.

           Richter smiles, carefully taking the Captain's pistol. He 
           walks past him into the living room, brushing past Elsa. She 
           shivers uncontrollably.

           Richter sits down in an OLD WOODEN CHAIR next to Leni. He 
           places the two pistols in his lap and looks at the Captain, 
           almost disappointed.

           There's a long, tense silence. 

           Finally, Richter gestures to Leni:

                                 RICHTER 
                        She's beautiful, isn't she?

           He picks her up, and places her in his lap.

                                 RICHTER 
                        It hasn't been easy raising her on 
                        my own... After Berlin fell, Nina 
                        put a bullet in her head. She lost 
                        her faith.  
                             (pauses)
                        That's the real future of Germany. 
                        It's not enough for them to defeat 
                        us. They want us to destroy 
                        ourselves. 

           The Captain's breathing grows shallow. Richter runs his 
           fingers through his daughter's hair. 

           Leni doesn't understand English, so she has no idea what's 
           being said. She stares up at Elsa, wide-eyed. She's the first 
           woman Leni's seen in a long time, and their connection is 
           undeniable.

           Richter leans in, pointing at Elsa:

                                 RICHTER 
                        This is Elsa.
                             (pauses)
                        She's vatti's old friend.

           Elsa slowly kneels, almost in a daze. She looks to Leni--

                                 ELSA
                        That's a very pretty doll you have 
                        there. What's her name?

                                 RICHTER
                        She doesn't understand English.
           Leni looks back at her father for guidance. Richter continues 
           to stroke her hair.

                                 RICHTER 
                        She's asking about your pretty 
                        doll. Can you show it to her?

           Leni looks down at the doll, apprehensively. 

                                 RICHTER 
                        Go on. Be a good girl.

           She hops off her father's lap, waddles over to Elsa and 
           presents her doll. Elsa examines it--

                                 LENI
                        Hanna. 

                                 ELSA
                        Oh. Wow. How beautiful Hanna is.

           Leni smiles broadly - a child's smile. Pure innocence.

                                 RICHTER
                        She likes you. You'd make a good 
                        mother one day.

           What little solace Elsa had found immediately turns to ashes. 
           She looks up at Richter, frozen, suddenly confused. What does 
           he mean - one day?

           Richter picks up on this. Seems surprised.

                                 RICHTER 
                        Wait... Did you think... 

           He looks at the Captain, studies him. Then, a grin slowly 
           spreads across his face. He turns back to Elsa:

                                 RICHTER 
                        Did you think Leni was your 
                        daughter?

           Elsa can't breathe. Her world is crashing down around her.

           Richter leans back in his chair, savoring the moment. He 
           looks at the Captain, whose face has gone pale.

                                 RICHTER 
                        You mean... He didn't tell you?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Don't.
           Elsa looks back and forth between the Captain and Richter, 
           raw panic building inside of her. 

           Leni begins to sense the tension in the room. She grips her 
           doll tightly as she tries to understand what's happening.

           Richter slowly kneels, addresses his daughter.

                                 RICHTER
                        Schatzi... Would you like to go 
                        feed the chickens? 

           Leni nods, grinning--

                                 LENI
                        Huhn!

           Richter reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small bag of 
           CHICKEN FEED. As he hands it to Leni--

                                 RICHTER
                        Not too much, okay?

           Leni can barely contain her excitement as she drops her doll, 
           and shuffles out the door into the late afternoon light.

           Once she's gone--

           Elsa struggles to her feet. Stares at the Captain. 

                                 ELSA
                        What is he talking about? 

           The Captain won't look at her. 

                                 ELSA 
                        TELL ME.

           He stares straight at Richter, reeling.

                                 RICHTER
                        Are you going to tell her, Captain, 
                        or should I?

           The Captain trembles. Tears well in his eyes. He's trying to 
           hold it together, but the memories are too much. 

                                 RICHTER (PRE-LAP) 
                        Alfons!
           INT. BLOCK 11 - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           We're back in that moment, amidst the firing squad. Richter 
           is waiting, patiently. The Captain is staring at the door, 
           horrified. Finally, we see why--

           Alfons enters, carrying a beautiful, NEWBORN BABY GIRL - just 
           a few days old - wrapped in a GREY WOOLEN BLANKET. The baby 
           is strong and healthy, and when she BAWLS it echoes 
           throughout the room.

           Alfons approaches Richter, offers him the crying baby. 
           Instead of taking it, Richter gestures to the line of 
           terrified PRISONERS awaiting execution--

                                 RICHTER
                        Give it to the one in the middle.

           Alfons stiffly walks the crying baby over to the prisoners. 
           He presents it to a stout, naked JEWISH WOMAN, standing in 
           the middle of the line.

           The woman looks down at the baby with the deepest kind of 
           sadness. She cradles it in her arms, eyes searching 
           desperately for some sort of explanation.

           Alfons starts to walk away when--

                                 RICHTER 
                        Wait.

           He stops. 

                                 RICHTER 
                        Take the blanket.

           Alfons returns to the woman. With great difficulty, he 
           removes the baby's blanket, leaving her naked and squirming 
           in the woman's arms.

           No one speaks. No one moves. There's only the sound of the 
           baby CRYING and nothing else.

           It's deafening.

           Richter folds his hands, satisfied.

                                 RICHTER 
                        Okay, Captain.

           The Captain doesn't react. He just stares at the baby, nearly 
           catatonic, listening to her CRY. 
                                 RICHTER 
                        Captain...

           Finally, the Captain snaps from his trance. He looks at 
           Richter, who stares back at him firmly. This is his test, his 
           power, his cruelty.  

           The Captain looks at Erich. Gives him a small nod. Erich 
           addresses the firing squad:

                                 ERICH
                        Set.

           The firing squad raises their MP40 MACHINE GUNS, drawing a 
           sharp gasp of horror from the prisoners.

           The baby's CRYING grows louder... The woman pleads.

           Everyone waits for the Captain's command. Silence.

           The Captain looks at the firing squad. He looks at the baby. 
           He's taking too long and everyone knows it.

           The baby's CRYING grows louder... 

           He looks at Richter, who gazes back, darkness in his eyes. 
           Do it.

           The Captain turns to the firing squad. He closes his eyes as 
           he dies inside. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Fire.

           HOLD ON, the Captain's face, as we hear the sound of six machine 
           guns unloading into the prisoners. Silencing the baby instantly.

           INT. RICHTER'S LAKE HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Elsa stares at the Captain, ruined, empty. Her eyes fill with 
           tears. Barely audible:

                                 ELSA
                        No.

           The Captain looks at her. The shame on his face is all the 
           answer she needs.

                                 ELSA 
                        NO... NO...

           She collapses on the rough wood floor, body wracked by sobs. The 
           Captain watches, breathing heavily, hands shaking violently.
           Richter watches Elsa weep for a long moment, savoring it. He 
           looks at the Captain, putting the pieces together--

                                 RICHTER
                        He used you... He used you to find 
                        me.

           Elsa and the Captain finally make eye contact, and in a 
           moment, everything they ever had is shattered and gone. She 
           struggles to get the words out:

                                 ELSA
                        Why...? Why didn't you tell me?

           The Captain crumbles under the weight of his own guilt, his 
           cowardice - crushed by Elsa's gaze and all the words he can't 
           bring himself to say.

           Richter sits comfortably in his chair, watching them fall 
           apart. He starts to smile.

                                 RICHTER
                        When they took your baby girl's 
                        body outside, it took three men to 
                        carry the pieces. 

           Slowly, Elsa stands.

           Hollowed out, silent, she looks at Richter sitting in his 
           chair, at his eyes, his smiling mouth.

           And then she draws ALFONS' PISTOL from her coat and FIRES TWO 
           SHOTS STRAIGHT INTO RICHTER'S CHEST. 

           Richter's eyes go big in his head. He looks down at the 
           bullet holes in a kind of stupor, the two guns falling from 
           his hands onto the wood floor.

           Elsa stands, smoking gun held firmly, unmoving. 

           Richter touches the reddening wounds with shaking hands.

                                 RICHTER 
                        Oh.

           Slowly, Elsa turns towards the Captain, gun outstretched 
           before her. She struggles to find any words at all.

           The Captain takes a step towards Elsa. His eyes pleading, 
           begging her to do it--

           Elsa stands stock-still as he approaches. The Captain presses 
           his forehead against the still-smoking barrel.
           He grabs the gun with both hands, and holds it tight to his 
           head. He doesn't look away.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Please.

           Elsa searches his face, she wraps her finger around the 
           trigger. The longest moment of their entire lives--

           And then Elsa sees Leni. Through the window, in the distance, 
           the little girl happily feeds the chickens. Free of fear, 
           free of worry.

           Elsa takes one last long look at the fading Richter. The 
           dying man tries to speak, but nothing comes out.

           Elsa's face is stone and nothing else.

           And then she throws the gun at the Captain's feet. 

           With that, Elsa turns and walks out of the house. She stops 
           at the doorway for a moment, gently gathering LENI'S DOLL 
           from the floor as she steps outside into the dying light.

           EXT. RICHTER'S LAKE HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Elsa stands in the doorway, takes a little gasp of air, 
           returns to the land of the living.

           And then, she walks toward little Leni, standing next to the 
           chicken coop in the grass nearby. Leni looks vaguely worried--

                                 LENI
                        Vatti?

           Elsa kneels down to her level. Almost impossibly calm. She 
           holds up Leni's doll--

           Then, she hums a little tune and smiles.

                                 ELSA
                        We're going to play for a little 
                        while. Just you, me, and Hanna.

           She raises Leni's doll, makes it dance to the song. Leni 
           breaks out into a giggle, she can't help herself.

                                 ELSA 
                        Are these your chickens?

           Leni doesn't understand, but she follows Elsa's gaze. Sees 
           the chickens. She points--
                                 LENI
                        Huhn!

           Elsa smiles. Leni stares up at her with her big eyes, then, 
           offers her the little handful of chicken feed - your turn.

                                 ELSA
                        Thank you, Leni. That's very kind 
                        of you.

           Leni giggles, and Elsa just leans in and kisses her on the 
           cheek, taking the offered grain. Together, standing in the 
           tall grass, the two of them feed the chickens. 

           And then the front door of the little cottage slowly opens, 
           and the Captain steps outside.

           He takes a step and slowly locks eyes with--

           Elsa. Some kind of relief washes over her, but it's mixed 
           with something else. Disgust. Contempt. Confusion.

           They stare at each other for the longest time. Then, Elsa 
           notices--

           The gun still held in his hand.

           She looks back at him, at his face. She starts to understand.

           Leni tugs on Elsa's hand--

                                 LENI
                        Essen!

           They continue to stare at each other - Elsa and the Captain. 
           Their journey ends here. Or begins here. A crossroads.

           Finally, Elsa bends down and hoists Leni up into her arms. She 
           looks straight at the Captain, as she speaks aloud to Leni:

                                 ELSA
                        Come on, baby girl. Let's go into 
                        town.

           The Captain watches silently as Elsa turns and walks down the 
           road. Towards town, carrying Leni, headed towards a new life.

           After a moment, the Captain wanders slowly down to--

           THE LAKESHORE

           It's dusk. Haunting and beautiful. The wind whips across the 
           water, stirring up little ripples.
           The Captain takes it all in - overwhelmed by its beauty, 
           overwhelmed by its emptiness. He holds the dog tags loosely 
           in a bunch in his hand. 

           He stands there for a long time, holding his gun, studying it 
           carefully. Then--

           The Captain looks back over his shoulder - back towards Elsa 
           and Leni. Towards life. We can't read his face.

           CUT TO BLACK.
