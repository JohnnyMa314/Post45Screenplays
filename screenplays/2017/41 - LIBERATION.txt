           SUPER: During World War II, Britain recruited women into its 
           military intelligence service for the first time. This is the 
           story of its most decorated heroine.
           INT. BLACK MARKET DEN - EVENING

           A hulking BLACK MARKETEER looms behind the counter, 
           negotiating over the package laid before him --

                                 BLACK MARKETEER
                        One thousand and not a franc less.

           Reveal that he’s speaking to NANCY WAKE (30), a woman he 
           outsizes by six inches and a hundred pounds. And yet, her 
           incandescence dominates this dingy room -- 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re new to the black market, so 
                        I’ll be gentle. The White Mouse 
                        doesn’t tolerate war profiteering.

                                 BLACK MARKETEER
                        He isn’t here-- 

                                 NANCY
                        Stake your life on it?

                                 BLACK MARKETEER
                        Unless he’s hiding in your purse--

                                 NANCY
                        Perhaps he has eyes and ears 
                        everywhere. Perhaps he sends me as 
                        his courier precisely because 
                        mental deficients can see only a 
                        harmless housewife.

           Nancy grabs the package, but so does he -- a standoff. She 
           bores into him with her unblinking gaze -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps he’d be very fucking angry 
                        if he found out that you’re 
                        charging him housewife prices. 

           Intimidated, the Black Marketeer lets go, allowing Nancy to 
           take the package and back her way out the door --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Or perhaps I’m just a housewife.

           And she is gone. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER (PRE-LAP)
                        We are here to liberate you.
           EXT. BOMBED-OUT STREET - MARSEILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           A Gestapo wanted-poster hangs on a brick wall. It offers 
           100,000 francs for the capture of a French Resistance figure 
           known only as “The White Mouse”, whose crimes include 
           smuggling over 500 “enemies of the Reich” out of France. 

           Suddenly, Nancy dives behind the wall, clutching the package, 
           careful not to let it fall. She peers back over -- 

           And spots THREE GERMAN SOLDIERS closing fast, searching the 
           burning wreckage of this recently-bombed street. In the smoky 
           distance, she discerns the ominous mass of a Panzer tank 
           trundling toward her, its loudspeaker repeating --

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        We are here to liberate you. 

           SUPER: MARSEILLE, DECEMBER OF 1942

           Nancy draws a revolver from her purse. But as one of the 
           Soldiers comes perilously close, looming on the other side of 
           the wall, she does something we’d never expect --

           She unloads the bullets and tosses them into a pile of 
           cinders across the street. The Soldier is about to turn the 
           corner and see her, when -- 

           The bullets explode from the heat, drawing his attention. All 
           three Soldiers fire blindly at the sound. Nancy uses this 
           momentary distraction to slip away, darting down --

           AN ALLEY

           She sprints past boarded-up shops, taking a turn, but ahead --

           FIVE MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS hold a FRENCHMAN at gunpoint, 
           forcing him to his knees. Nancy ducks into an alcove, 
           watching as a Soldier aims, about to perform the execution --

           But the Frenchman lunges away -- desperately racing down the 
           alley toward Nancy -- and the Soldier shoots him in the back. 

           Jackboots approaching, Nancy tucks herself deeper into the 
           alcove. She watches as the Soldier stands over the dying 
           Frenchman -- and fires a bullet into his skull. Blood pooling 
           in a cobblestone crack at her feet, Nancy tries to remain 
           hidden, as the Soldier looks around... Finally --

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Supper time. 

           The Soldier heads off, but Nancy remains, staring at the 
           body, color draining from her face. Echoing in the distance --
                                 LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
                        We are here to liberate you. 

           EXT. HENRI’S MANSION - MARSEILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           A grand, old-money home near the center of the city. Nancy 
           composes herself, as if trying to hide what she just 
           witnessed. She knocks -- three taps then a kick. We hear a 
           heavy beam slide out of the way, and the door opens --

           HENRI FIOCCA (late 40s), a greying Frenchman in a tuxedo, is 
           relieved to see Nancy --

                                 HENRI
                        Thank God you’re safe--

                                 NANCY
                        Scold me inside, Henri, it’s past 
                        curfew.

           She hurries into --

           THE MAIN HALL

           Where a DOZEN STAFF prepare for a sumptuous party. In the 
           drawing room, we glimpse elegant WEDDING GUESTS. Henri bars 
           the door, his relief turning to frustration, almost like a 
           father chiding his rebellious daughter --

                                 HENRI
                        Where the hell were you?

           Nancy shows him the package -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Freeing France.

                                 HENRI
                        I asked for one day, just one, and 
                        you couldn’t even give me that.

           She opens the package, revealing neither bomb, nor gun, nor 
           top-secret file -- but rather, a bottle of 1928 Krug 
           champagne. Henri’s reaction tells us that it holds an acute 
           personal significance, but he’s still frustrated --

                                 HENRI (CONT’D)
                        You really shouldn’t have.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - HENRI’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Henri zips the back of Nancy’s blue-silk wedding dress --
                                 HENRI
                        Are we going to talk about this?

           Deflecting, she turns to face him --

                                 NANCY
                        How do I look?

                                 HENRI
                        Gorgeous, of course, but--

           She glances at the vanity mirror, styling her hair --

                                 NANCY
                        Up or down?

                                 HENRI
                        Nancy, the Krug--

           She kisses him before he can say more --

                                 NANCY
                        I’m so glad you like it.

           And she heads for the door, avoiding the conflict. 

           INT. MAIN HALL - HENRI'S MANSION - NIGHT

           A cork pops and 1928 Krug bubbles as a WAITER pours for 
           Nancy, who now wears a diamond wedding ring. Henri is next to 
           her, sharing the head of the table: A marriage of equals.

           Nancy stands and taps her glass, calling the attention of the 
           Wedding Guests seated all around --

                                 NANCY
                        My father couldn’t be here, so I’m 
                        afraid you’ll have to suffer 
                        through my feigned propriety.
                             (scattered laughter)
                        Thank you all for coming, 
                        especially under the circumstances. 
                             (re: her glass)
                        1928 Krug, not easy to come by of 
                        late. But back when France was 
                        free, a lonely girl in a nightclub 
                        was charmed by a suave older man, 
                        who sent over a bottle. The Nazis 
                        can’t stop us from drinking it. Not 
                        today. And if we’re free, a part of 
                        France is still free with us.
                             (to Henri, sincere)
                        Darling, I know I’m brash. I know I 
                        try your infinite patience. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        But I also know that you’re my 
                        bedrock. To you, my love.

           She toasts with Henri, who sips his Krug -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        To hell with propriety.

           Nancy gulps hers, and the Wedding Guests clap.

           LATER

           The party is in full swing. Everyone is happy, except Henri’s 
           father, CLAUDE, who is seated near the end of the table --  

                                 CLAUDE
                        --and where is her father, anyway? 
                        Dead of shame, I’d wager. A blue 
                        wedding dress. She’ll ruin my son, 
                        so impertinent. 

           Nancy’s friend, PHILIPPE, disagrees -- 

                                 PHILIPPE
                        If you haven’t noticed, there’s a 
                        war on and we need all the 
                        impertinence we can get. 

           Philippe stands and heads to the far corner, where Nancy is 
           holding a furtive conversation with several MALE GUESTS, all 
           of whom are members of her Resistance network --

                                 NANCY
                        --just shot him dead, right there 
                        in the street. Not even the 
                        pretense of legality, anymore.

           Nancy drains her glass, grabs the bottle of Krug off the 
           table, and refills. One of the men, ANTOINE, speaks up --

                                 ANTOINE
                        Perhaps we should suspend 
                        operations until things calm.

                                 PHILIPPE
                        He has a point. I didn’t want to 
                        broach it on your big day, but I 
                        hear the Gestapo’s doubling down 
                        and bringing in a new spy-hunter--

                                 NANCY
                        Well, the only way to beat a bully 
                        is to break his goddamn nose--
                                 PHILIPPE
                        Nancy, you’re not hearing me, he’s 
                        after The White Mouse--

                                 NANCY
                        He’ll never suspect I’m a woman--

                                 PHILIPPE
                        But what about the men around you?

           That lands, the men nodding gravely. But Nancy avoids the 
           hard question, draining her glass and pouring another -- 

                                 HENRI (O.S.)
                        You promised me a full day, Nan.

           She turns to see Henri, who gently takes her glass and sets 
           it down, as the BAND LEADER calls out --

                                 BAND LEADER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to 
                        present Monsieur and Madame Fiocca.

           Everyone claps, as Henri takes Nancy to the dance-floor and 
           THE BAND plays a waltz. He leads and she follows, and now 
           that he finally has her undivided attention --

                                 HENRI
                        I’m sorry, but I have to say it. 
                        Risking your life for the Krug--

                                 NANCY
                        For you--

                                 HENRI
                        Then why are you swilling it? 
                        Christ, this-- It’s not a game, 
                        Nan. If you must, must be The White 
                        Mouse, fine. I’ll support you. But 
                        not if it means burying my wife--

                                 NANCY
                        Alright, Monsieur Fiocca. 
                             (re: her wedding ring)
                        As your wife, I vow: If the Gestapo 
                        get close, I’ll quit.

           Henri nods, comforted, but as Nancy leans in to kiss him --

           A nearby bomb-blast shakes the building’s foundation, 
           frightening the Wedding Guests. Off the foreboding ripples 
           forming on Nancy’s glass of 1928 Krug, we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

           Antoine’s lifeless eyes stare up at us, his skull split open 
           by a bullet, brain exposed. 

           SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER

           His body lays on a blood-stained table. Philippe and a half-
           dozen more RESISTANCE MEN mourn, some openly weeping --

           But Nancy stands off to the side, notably apart, avoiding 
           Philippe’s recriminative eyes.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - HENRI'S MANSION - LATER

           Nancy brushes her hair before the vanity mirror, while Henri 
           readies for bed -- 

                                 HENRI
                        I’ll see that his family is cared 
                        for, of course.

           Nancy nods and continues brushing... Then -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Lost the small arms, too. Fifty 
                        thousand worth. We have people in 
                        Cannes depending on them--

                                 HENRI
                        Nan, I thought we agreed--

                                 NANCY
                        Yes, darling, but they’re not 
                        close. This was just bad luck, 
                        that’s all. Bad luck.

           She stops brushing and meets his gaze in the mirror --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Please?

           Henri lets out a sigh -- then, unable to deny her, he nods.

           INT. SHIPPING WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The slender, bookish CAPTAIN BÖHM (early 40s) glides through 
           the warehouse, flanked by THREE GESTAPO. FRIGHTENED EMPLOYEES 
           turn and stare as they pass --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM 
                        She wants a pony. My wife believes 
                        it’s decadent, but I’m inclined to 
                        indulge her. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAPTAIN BöHM  (CONT'D)
                        Early childhood forges the psyche. 
                        On the one hand, we need every 
                        horse for the war effort. On the 
                        other, war is troubling, so I want 
                        her to have something innocent.

           Böhm stops at the corner office and knocks politely, as one 
           of the Gestapo interjects --

                                 GESTAPO
                        Perhaps a puppy, sir?

           Böhm shrugs, and the office door opens, revealing Henri on 
           the other side.

           EXT. HENRI’S MANSION - MARSEILLE - LATER

           Philippe sprints up, out of breath, pounding the front door. 
           After a few moments, Nancy answers --

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP)
                        I demand to see my husband.

           INT. RECEPTION - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Cowed FRENCH PEOPLE await their fate on benches, but Nancy is 
           at the front desk, frantic, arguing with the GESTAPO CLERK --

                                 GESTAPO CLERK
                        I’m sorry, madame, but they have 
                        him sequestered--

                                 NANCY
                             (calling out)
                        Henri? Henri?

                                 GESTAPO CLERK
                        Madame, please--

                                 NANCY
                        HENRI--

           The door to the back offices opens, revealing Captain Böhm --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        No need for hysterics, Madame 
                        Fiocca.
                             (a proper bow)
                        Captain Böhm, at your service.

           INT. INTERROGATION - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy sits across from Henri, while Böhm stands in the 
           corner, observing with a keen eye --
                                 HENRI
                        We have the best lawyers on it, 
                        Vichy lawyers--

                                 NANCY
                        What are you charged with?

                                 HENRI
                        Don’t worry yourself--

                                 NANCY
                             (to Böhm)
                        What are the charges?

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        One of your husband’s employees 
                        alerted us to a conspiracy at 
                        Fiocca Shipping. It seems a large 
                        sum of money is missing--

                                 NANCY
                        I’m sure Henri has nothing to do 
                        with it--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Then I take it that you’re familiar 
                        with his finances?

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t appreciate your tone--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Because we have reason to believe 
                        that it’s being funneled to the 
                        Resistance--

                                 NANCY
                        That’s goddamn absurd--

                                 HENRI
                        The only thing my wife knows about 
                        my money is how to spend it on 
                        herself.
                             (firm)
                        Go home, Nancy.

           Nancy relents, playing the obedient housewife --

                                 NANCY
                        You know best, darling.

           She stands and Böhm graciously leads her to the door --
                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Just one more thing, Madame Fiocca: 
                        I must request that you remain in 
                        Marseille, as I may have further--

           Nancy brushes him away --

                                 NANCY
                        You think I’m the type of woman who 
                        takes a holiday while my husband’s 
                        being railroaded by the Gestapo?
                             (to Henri)
                        I’m not going anywhere without you.

                                 HENRI
                        Of course not.

           Nancy smiles, hopeful that she won’t have to leave Henri 
           behind. She opens the door, about to exit --

                                 HENRI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Nan? 
                             (she turns back)
                        Tell my mother not to worry.

           A sledgehammer. Nancy knows from this coded message that 
           Henri is indeed telling her to escape Marseille without him, 
           the distance between them now a widening chasm --

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll tell her you love her.

           Henri nods, holding back tears, as they stare into one 
           another’s eyes for what may be the last time...

           EXT. GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - MARSEILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy hurries down the steep staircase, which is framed with 
           imposing Nazi flags. Desperation building, she tries to 
           remain calm as she passes a GESTAPO GUARD, signaling to -- 

           A TAXI

           She climbs in, barely hanging on -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Drive-- Fucking drive.

           The DRIVER pulls away -- and Nancy begins shaking, 
           vertiginous under the immense weight of her guilt. She 
           glances out the back window and spots a black Mercedes 
           following. We push closer and closer on her face, flushing 
           crimson as she hyperventilates.
           INT. MAIN HALL - HENRI'S MANSION - EVENING

           Nancy’s still-shaking hand brings a shot to her lips, clearly 
           not her first. Philippe is with her --

                                 NANCY
                        I-- If I’d quit-- But no, not me, I 
                        just had to keep pushing him--

                                 PHILIPPE
                        Shhh. Henri made his choices, don’t 
                        take that from him.

           Nancy pours herself another. Philippe peers out the window 
           and spies the black Mercedes parked down the street --

                                 PHILIPPE (CONT’D)
                        Now it’s time to make yours.

           She ignores him, continuing to drink --

                                 PHILIPPE (CONT’D)
                        If not for you, then for him. 
                        They’ll force him to watch you 
                        suffer, and you will suffer.

           Nancy knows he’s right. She looks around at the life she’s 
           abandoning, awash in liquid melancholy --

                                 NANCY
                        This was my first real home.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HENRI’S MANSION - NIGHT

           A ghostly Nancy walks through, feeling her first real home 
           for one last time. She draws her hand across the oak table, 
           grazes the delicate lace curtains -- 

           And stops at the mantle, where her wedding photo with Henri 
           is displayed proudly, as we --

                                                              MATCH TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - HENRI’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           A photo of Henri’s mother, with a lifespan engraved on the 
           frame, indicating that she died in 1939. We now understand 
           the full meaning of Henri’s coded message, as --

           Nancy takes the photo off the wall and removes the back of 
           the frame, revealing a set of forged travel papers, which 
           will take her all the way to London. We notice that they’re 
           in her maiden name: “Nancy Wake”. She places them in her 
           suitcase, then removes her wedding ring and tucks it away. 
           Finally, she lays on the bed in the quiet darkness, feeling 
           the spot where Henri used to sleep...

           LATER - DAWN

           Nancy checks her watch: Nearly 6AM. She peeks out the window 
           to see that the black Mercedes is still parked out front --

           But suddenly, smoke begins to pour from the bakery across the 
           street. As the fire grows, distant sirens sound. 

           EXT. HENRI'S MANSION - MARSEILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           A fire truck screams up, blocking in the black Mercedes. As 
           FIREMEN race out to battle the conflagration --

           Nancy exits the mansion’s side door, suitcase in hand, 
           absconding in the chaos. 

           INT. BOARDING ZONE - TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           Nancy stands at the front of a line of TRAVELERS. She hands 
           her forged papers to a GESTAPO, who gives them a long look, 
           tension building... But he waves Nancy through, as we -- 

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -- Nancy rides in a first-class train car through occupied 
           France. Refugees, bombed buildings, Nazi flags, and German 
           troops abound. No sign of an organized Resistance yet.

           -- Sitting alone in the dining car, a sullen Nancy sips wine 
           and watches a happily married couple enjoy their supper. 

           -- A cattle-train packed with bedraggled Jewish prisoners 
           passes by Nancy’s, heading in into the maw of the Reich.

           EXT. STEAMER SHIP - SAN SEBASTIAN DOCKS - EVENING

           Nancy boards first-class, surrounded by other WEALTHY PEOPLE 
           fleeing the war. But her eyes go lower, to --

           THIRD-CLASS

           Teeming with JEWISH REFUGEES. Nancy focuses on a Jewish girl, 
           ARIANNE (16), who is riding alone, clutching her things, 
           forced to sit on the filthy deck because every seat is taken.

           INT. FIRST-CLASS CABIN - STEAMER SHIP - NIGHT

           Nancy leads Arianne into her luxurious cabin --
                                 NANCY
                        --was your age, I ran off from 
                        home, steamed from Australia all 
                        the way to Canada, flat broke. 
                        Trick is to tease an older man into 
                        buying you dinner, then get him so 
                        drunk, he can’t remember how to 
                        remove his trousers.

           Nancy wastes no time in pouring them both stiff drinks -- 

                                 ARIANNE
                        I don’t know how to thank you for 
                        your kindness, Madame...?

                                 NANCY
                        Nancy Wake.

           Nancy hands her the drink, which Arianne doesn’t even sip --

                                 ARIANNE
                        Arianne. Smith. Arianne Smith--

                                 NANCY
                        I was a reporter for years, dear, 
                        hesitation’s sure a sign of a lie. 
                        Next time, use something natural. 
                        Take me: Wake’s my maiden name.

                                 ARIANNE
                        I-- I’m not Jewish--

                                 NANCY
                        As far as I’m concerned, we’re all 
                        Jews now. Trust me, this helps. 
                             (toasting)
                        L’chaim.

           Arianne takes a sip, and Nancy gulps hers, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VIENNA STREETS - NIGHT

           A rock smashes a Jewish shop window, as BROWNSHIRT THUGS riot 
           in the center of the city. Nancy watches, horrified. The 
           badge on her shirt says she’s a reporter for Hearst. 
           Suddenly, a sight defying all decency and reason, as --

           A massive wooden wheel rolls past, with a BLOODIED JEWISH 
           FAMILY tied to the spokes, turning round and round, as a pack 
           of Brownshirts push them onward. A sick game. 
           Nancy locks eyes with a TERRIFIED GIRL, who resembles 
           Arianne. As she churns away, disappearing into the flaming 
           night, we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FIRST-CLASS CABIN - STEAMER SHIP - DAWN

           Nancy snaps awake, a half-empty bottle of booze laying next 
           to her. She looks over and sees Arianne, sleeping peacefully 
           in bed. Nancy slips a roll of bills into her ragged purse. 

           EXT. DOCKLANDS - LONDON - DAY

           Having just disembarked, Nancy spots a CHAUFFEUR holding a 
           placard with her maiden name. A number of CHAUFFEURS greet 
           other WEALTHY WOMEN, all sent to England to wait out the war. 

           But as Nancy is led to her car, she passes DOZENS OF ROYAL 
           NAVY MEN, her gaze lingering...

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE / EXT. LONDON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           The Chauffeur drives through a besieged London, while Nancy 
           rides in back --

                                 NANCY
                        I was hoping for word from my 
                        husband.

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        Apologies, ma’am, I have none. 

           They round a corner, revealing that the entire block has been 
           reduced to rubble --

                                 CHAUFFEUR (CONT’D)
                        Not to worry, ma’am, where you’re 
                        going, it’s still quite lovely.

           Nancy watches a weary GRANDMOTHER pick through the ruins with 
           her GRANDCHILDREN, trying to salvage rations... Finally --

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not going to the countryside.

           EXT. FREE FRENCH HEADQUARTERS - LONDON - AFTERNOON

           A French flag flies atop the seat of General Charles de 
           Gaulle’s government in exile, located at 3 Carlton Gardens, 
           blocks away from Buckingham Palace -- 
                                 FRENCH OFFICER (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m sorry, madame, but the Free 
                        French simply do not accept women.

           INT. RECRUITING OFFICE - FREE FRENCH HQ - CONTINUOUS

           A vexed Nancy sits across from a FRENCH OFFICER --

                                 NANCY
                        Horseshit. The Gestapo have my 
                        husband. Every second I’m not 
                        fighting to liberate France is a 
                        second more he’s suffering--

                                 FRENCH OFFICER
                        My sympathies, madame, but I’m 
                        afraid it’s a strict policy--

                                 NANCY
                        What would you have me do instead? 
                        Bake him a fucking cake--

                                 FRENCH OFFICER
                        You are, by nature, unsuited for 
                        warfare. It’s a scientific fact--

                                 NANCY
                        You’re a soldier and a scientist? 
                        Impressive. So, scientifically, 
                        it’s my-- What’s the scientific 
                        term? Oh, yes -- vagina. My vagina 
                        makes me unsuited for warfare--

                                 FRENCH OFFICER
                        Madame, it’s your demeanor. You’re 
                        far too emotional. Clearly, your 
                        loss has driven you to this crazed 
                        airing of your... womanhood--

                                 NANCY
                        You can’t even say it. Vagina--

                                 FRENCH OFFICER
                        Dear God--

                                 NANCY
                        That’s it! That’s how we win the 
                        war: Show the Nazis my vagina and 
                        they’ll piss themselves--
                                 FRENCH OFFICER
                        Silence. Madame, if you wish to 
                        help the war effort, I suggest you 
                        volunteer as a nurse, succoring our 
                        brave men. Indeed, you seem to know 
                        a great deal about anatomy. 

                                 NANCY
                        I’d gladly take a scalpel to your 
                        bollocks.

           Nancy heads for the door, offering a parting shot --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        But I suspect they’ve already been 
                        removed!

           And she slams the door, shaking the whole room.

           EXT. FREE FRENCH HEADQUARTERS - LONDON - EVENING

           Nancy walks out, frustrated. Her eyes scan the street and 
           settle on a pub. She heads for it, passing by --

           AN ENGLISHMAN, who is sitting on a bench and pretending to 
           read a newspaper -- a headline about a “LOOMING ALLIED 
           INVASION OF EUROPE” -- but in truth, he is watching Nancy...

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           The Englishman sits in the corner, furtively observing Nancy, 
           who drinks with a group of ENLISTED MEN at the bar --

                                 NANCY
                        --then he called it my womanhood. 

           The men laugh, good and drunk, as Nancy takes another shot --

                                 ENLISTED BRIT
                        Beginning to think that’s where you 
                        store all your booze.

           More laughter --

                                 ENLISTED SCOTSMAN
                        I volunteer to scout the territory. 

                                 NANCY
                        What are you, fifteen? Wouldn’t 
                        even know where to plant your flag.

           Huge laughter from the men -- but Nancy catches her thoughts 
           returning to Henri, no matter how much she imbibes --
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Besides...

           A moment of silence, as the men can see that Nancy is 
           pained... But she swallows it, turning to the BARKEEP -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        To hell with it. Champagne.

           He pops the cork and pours a glass, which she raises --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        To Henri.

           She drinks, the Englishman still watching. And perhaps Nancy 
           notices, because she pockets a paring knife off the bar...

           EXT. PUB - LONDON - NIGHT

           Nancy stumbles out, trudging around a corner. The Englishman 
           is close behind, following her into --

           A DARK ALLEY

           But Nancy is gone. The Englishman takes a few tentative steps 
           into the darkness, as --

           She appears behind him, holding the knife to his throat -- 

                                 NANCY
                        You’ve been following me since I 
                        left the Free French Headquarters. 

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                        I’ve been following you since you 
                        disembarked. You’re good, but not 
                        nearly as good as you think--

           In a flash, the Englishman knocks the knife from her hand, 
           flips her over his back, and slams her to the pavement -- 

           Stunned, Nancy gasps for breath. The Englishman bends down, 
           places a calling card in her hand, and walks away. Gulping 
           air, she regains her bearings and reads the card: “64 Baker 
           Street”. Off this cryptic image, we --

                                                              MATCH TO:

           EXT. 64 BAKER STREET - LONDON - MORNING

           The address, etched in stone, marking a nondescript office 
           building. A hungover Nancy limps up the steps.
           INT. RECEPTION - 64 BAKER STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           A modest setup, ostensibly selling war bonds. Nancy is struck 
           by a propaganda poster, which depicts a Nazi Stormtrooper 
           trying to rape “Mother Britain”. She approaches the --

                                 FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                        Purchase war bonds, ma’am? Do your 
                        part to help our boys win. 

                                 NANCY
                        No, I-- I’m not actually sure why 
                        I’m here.

                                 ENGLISHMAN (O.S.)
                        Thus is the human condition.

           Startled, Nancy turns to see that the Englishman is standing 
           in a doorway that wasn’t there before, opened via a panel in 
           the wall. He offers a handshake, revealing himself to be --

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Major Gielgud.

                                 NANCY
                        Forgive me if I don’t shake your 
                        hand. A strange man assaulted me 
                        last night, so I’m feeling shy.

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Good, then we won’t have to hear 
                        about your vagina today.

           With that, Gielgud turns and heads back through the door. 
           Nancy stands there for a moment, then follows him into --

           THE HIDDEN HALLWAY

           She hurries to catch up with Gielgud, who is stopped at a 
           checkpoint manned by BRITISH SOLDIERS. They search Nancy’s 
           purse, ushering her through a heavy metal door, to --

           A CATWALK

           Suspended over a vast hall, filled with hundreds of MEN ON 
           CODING MACHINES, orchestrating an inscrutable mechanical 
           symphony. Nancy doesn’t have time to take it all in, 
           following Gielgud to the end of the catwalk, now entering --

           A LIFT

           It takes them down into the depths of this strange edifice -- 
                                 NANCY
                        Just going to play it coy, then?

           Gielgud doesn’t respond. Rather, he slides open the lift door 
           and proceeds into --

           THE SUB-BASEMENT HALLWAY

           Nancy follows him down the hall, coming at last to --

           COLONEL BUCKMASTER’S OFFICE

           Wherein every flat surface holds maps, files, and photos of 
           France. Seated behind an oak desk is a rangy Oxford man with 
           probing eyes: COLONEL BUCKMASTER (41). Rather than offer 
           Nancy a seat, he ignores her and speaks to Gielgud -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        I ask for recruits, you bring me a 
                        battered drunk. 

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Afraid the war’s killed off all the 
                        good ones, sir--

                                 NANCY
                        Excuse me--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Prettier in her photos.

           Buckmaster pulls a thick file from a drawer and throws it on 
           his desk. It’s marked “Nancy Wake AKA The White Mouse” -- 

                                 NANCY
                        So you’re in intelligence--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        It’s the nose, sir, much bigger. 
                        Less in the chest, though--

                                 NANCY
                        Now look here, goddamnit--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Perhaps we can salvage her as a 
                        secretary.

           Buckmaster rings a bell, as if calling Nancy for service. In 
           response, she grabs the teapot off the nearby tray -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Assuming she’s even capable of 
                        making a proper cup of--
           And she smashes it on the floor, causing Buckmaster to at 
           last address her directly --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Never had anyone do that before. 
                             (gesturing broadly)
                        Welcome to the Special Operations 
                        Executive. I’m Colonel Buckmaster, 
                        head of the French Section. 

                                 NANCY
                        Then France is surely lost. 

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        I think we hurt her feelings, sir.

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        I’m afraid she’ll endure a helluva 
                        lot worse if she’s going to war. 
                             (to Nancy)
                        That is what you want, isn’t it?

           Gielgud pulls out a chair across from Buckmaster, offering it 
           to Nancy... And sure enough, she decides to sit --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Good, because unlike the Free 
                        French, I might just be foolish 
                        enough to give you the opportunity.

           Buckmaster points to a portrait of Winston Churchill --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Prime Minster wants us to “set 
                        Europe ablaze” -- and you fancy 
                        yourself a veritable pyromaniac.
                             (re: her file)
                        You lived in France since the age 
                        of twenty--

                                 NANCY
                        I started as a reporter for--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Hearst, yes, shabby prose. And when 
                        Hitler invaded in ‘40, you used 
                        your husband’s wealth to establish 
                        a Resistance network in Marseille. 
                        Called yourself “The White Mouse”--

                                 NANCY
                        Hold on, it wasn’t vanity, that’s 
                        what the Germans called me--
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        And you had some success--

                                 NANCY
                        Some? I ran guns, intel, many of 
                        your POWs--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Ever kill anyone, Nancy?

                                 NANCY
                             (she’s hasn’t)
                        I-- I don’t-- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Easy to play spy in a mansion, far 
                        harder to fight in the mud, which 
                        is what you’d be doing. If you make 
                        it through training-- 

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --a very big if--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --we’ll send you back into occupied 
                        France. You’ll be one of several 
                        dozen operatives working with the 
                        Resistance. But the French are a 
                        congenitally slipshod bunch, and 
                        it’s ten-fold harder to make them 
                        obey a woman. You’ll likely fail 
                        and end up dead or captured, just 
                        as most of the men--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --and the few ladies--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --we’ve recruited.

                                 NANCY
                        If you’re so damn certain I’m 
                        doomed, then why the hell send me?

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Because even after I’ve insulted 
                        you, abused you, and threatened you 
                        with agonizing demise -- you still 
                        want to go--

                                 NANCY
                        Absolutely.
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Which brings us to the crux: Why? 
                        Why do you wish to return to France 
                        so exigently, Nancy?

           This time, instead of invoking Henri, Nancy tries a more 
           Masculine approach --

                                 NANCY
                        It’s simple, really: The Nazis are 
                        bullies, and I won’t tolerate that 
                        shit. Certainly not in my home.

           But Buckmaster and Gielgud exchange a dubious glance --

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Bloody noble sentiment, sir.

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Which means it can’t possibly be 
                        the whole truth.
                             (to Nancy)
                        Go ahead, ask about him.
                             (she remains silent)
                        Nancy, we all know you desperately 
                        want to, so just ask--

                                 NANCY
                        Alright, have you heard anything 
                        about Henri--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        No and it doesn’t bloody matter. 
                        I’m sending you to help liberate 
                        all of France, not one Frenchman. 
                        If by some miracle you live long 
                        enough to let him get in the way of 
                        your mission, I’ll charge you with 
                        desertion. Clear?
                             (she again remains silent)
                        Clear?

                                 NANCY
                        Fine. Now are we going to dance all 
                        night, or are we going to fuck?

           Buckmaster looks to Gielgud, they both nod in agreement -- so 
           Buckmaster stands and offers Nancy a handshake, as we --

                        It’s a test. Mental health is just 
                        as important as physical. Perhaps 
                        more so, in your field.

           Her face now lacerated, Nancy eats breakfast alone. She takes 
           a bite and a droplet of blood falls onto her tray, just as an 
           apple hits her on the back. She turns --

                        So you had many friends?

           The Instructor heads down the line to yell at a slim Recruit, 
           who can’t even graze the target: DENIS RAKE (42) --

                        Yet they expect me to control 
                        myself.
                             (off her look)
                        That’s why they hate me, my dear. 
                        We both like cock. 
                             (off her surprise)
                        Unless you swing the other way?

                                 NANCY
                        No, I-- How can you be so...?

                                 DENDEN
                        Myself? Because if I can’t be who I 
                        am, the goose-steppers already have 
                        their jackboot on my throat.

           Nancy finds what she’s looking for: A bottle of booze --

                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        Besides, the only reason all those 
                        leather-clad krauts aren’t queer is 
                        because they haven’t tried it with 
                        me yet.

           Nancy bursts into laughter, forming an alliance of outcasts.

           EXT. JUMP TRAINING TOWER - ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Nancy and Denden sit on the tower platform, gazing upon the 
           moonlit countryside, sharing the bottle -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Did he use the ink-stain on you?
                                 DENDEN
                             (pretentious voice)
                        “What do you see?”
                             (they both laugh)
                        Oh, and he had an absolute field 
                        day when I told him my mother sold 
                        me to the circus at the age of six.

                                 NANCY
                        He actually believed that?

           Denden takes the bottle from Nancy, caps it and turns it 
           upside down, then balances it on his forehead --

                                 DENDEN
                        He actually believed it, Nancy--

           He flips the bottle up and catches it behind his back --

                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        --because it’s actually my life. 
                             (bowing)
                        Denden, the orphaned circus queer.

                                 NANCY
                             (clapping)
                        Bravo. You’ll be a hit in France.

           Denden sits next to Nancy and takes a drink --

                                 DENDEN
                        Unfortunately, the shrink doesn’t 
                        agree. Says I’m not fit because I 
                        refuse to hide my “homosexual 
                        illness”. I’m afraid he’s going to 
                        fail me. 

           Processing, Nancy comes alight with a drunken notion --

                                 NANCY
                        Wanna do something foolish?

           EXT. SOE OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           A brick building near the dorms. Denden stands guard, while 
           Nancy kneels at the side door, picking the lock... 

           INT. RECORDS ROOM - SOE OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy and Denden scan the shelves of SOE Recruit files and 
           find theirs, which they begin to read --
                                 NANCY
                        I get excellent marks in combat, 
                        tactics, explosives, lock-picking.

                                 DENDEN
                        “Rake’s among the best radio 
                        operators we’ve seen, but--” 
                        Christ. A one in marksmanship. What 
                        can I say? I loathe guns.

                                 NANCY
                        Well, I got a two on that damned 
                        jump training.

                                 DENDEN
                        Actually...

           Denden grabs a pen off the nearby desk and changes his “1” 
           into a “7” -- then he changes Nancy’s “2” into --

                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        You got an eight.

           They continue through their files, arriving at the 
           “Psychological Profile” --

                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        Ah, here we are. From the good Dr. 
                        Timmons: “Rake’s shameless 
                        perversion is a danger to troop 
                        cohesion.” Not true, I just want 
                        every man to get even closer. 
                        “And his obsession with--
                             (chuckling)
                        --scrotums indicates a severe 
                        mental illness.” I couldn’t help 
                        myself, he squirmed every time I 
                        mentioned bollocks.

           They both laugh, as Nancy begins reading her profile in the 
           same jocular tone --

                                 NANCY
                        “Wake is extraordinarily motivated 
                        to return to France--”

                                 DENDEN
                        I think that’s his version of nice--

                                 NANCY
                        “--but this bravado masks deep 
                        insecurity and a remarkable lack of 
                        self-awareness. The guilt over her 
                        husband’s--”
           Nancy pauses at the mention of Henri, her mood darkening --

                                 DENDEN
                        Alright, that’s quite enough--

                                 NANCY
                        “--her husband’s capture, coupled 
                        with childhood trauma, compounds 
                        the danger of grave instability. It 
                        is my judgement that she is not...” 

           She looks up at Denden, wounded by the harsh judgement --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not fit for command.

                                 DENDEN
                        Psychobabble horseshit.

           Denden pulls the page from her file, motioning to the 
           typewriter on the desk --

                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s tell our own story, shall we?

           INT. MESS HALL - MORNING

           Nancy and Denden finish breakfast, and as they walk out 
           together, they pass the table of Male Recruits -- 

           And Nancy drops an apple-core in front of the Redhead.

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (PRE-LAP)
                        “Wake is very popular with her 
                        peers.”

           INT. COLONEL BUCKMASTER’S OFFICE - 64 BAKER STREET - DAY

           Now in uniform, Nancy and Denden stand at attention before 
           Gielgud and Buckmaster, who review their doctored files --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        That’s what her file says. Funny 
                        thing, though: We employ Dr. 
                        Timmons to find flaws, not praise.

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Perhaps we’ve been duped, sir.

           Buckmaster stands and slowly walks around his desk, looming, 
           as Nancy and Denden shift nervously under his glare -- 
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        If a German spy were to penetrate 
                        the SOE, he -- or maybe she -- 
                        would surely covet access to our 
                        personnel records... 

           Buckmaster draws his sidearm, tension building -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m only going to ask nicely once: 
                        Whose idea was it to break in?  
                             (to Denden)
                        Was it you, Rake?

           Denden stays silent, refusing to rat out Nancy. Without 
           warning, Buckmaster pistol-whips him -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Answer me! Did the Germans send a 
                        queer into our midst?

           But Denden keeps his now-bleeding lips shut. Buckmaster turns 
           to Nancy and opens the chamber, revealing the bullet inside --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Or did they send a bitch?

           He presses the pistol to her forehead, her pulse racing -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Who was it? Who?
                             (cocking the pistol)
                        LAST CHANCE -- WHO?!

           His finger tenses on the trigger -- but Nancy still doesn’t 
           crack -- he squeezes -- CLICK. A dummy bullet.

           Shaken, Nancy catches her breath. Buckmaster calmly holsters 
           his sidearm and offers Denden a handkerchief for his lip --  

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Good show. A silent man may yet hold 
                        information, so he stays alive.
                             (to Nancy)
                        But a woman, she must ingratiate. 
                        Play the part, grovel, cry--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --fuck if you have to--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --swallow that pride. Because in 
                        France, the bullets will be real.
           Nancy and Denden exchange a glance: They’re going to France --

                           NANCY
                                                         DENDEN
           Yes, sir.
                                              Thank you, sir.

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        You’ll share the rank of Captain, 
                        but as your radio man, Rake will 
                        report to you, Nancy.

           Buckmaster nods to Gielgud, who pulls down a detailed map of 
           France, which is divided into SOE regions --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Each region represents an active 
                        SOE operation. Smuggling in Paris, 
                        foundering U-boats in Cannes. Even 
                        got a woman who blew up a munitions 
                        factory in Toulouse last week.

           He points to the Auvergne, a mountainous, remote region in 
           central France, with train-lines running throughout -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re assigned to the Auvergne. 
                        Not far from Vichy, teeming with 
                        Germans. Mud and blood. Harsh 
                        weather, impossible terrain, 
                        befitting the Resistance fighters 
                        who operate there: The Maquis--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --name themselves after scrub-brush 
                        because they’re hard to kill--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --and control. Your predecessor 
                        didn’t last a week before they ran 
                        him out. Man before that got 
                        dysentery and they left him--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --shit himself to death, alone in 
                        the woods--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --doubtful you’ll do much better. 
                        Your first mission is to establish 
                        command over the largest band of 
                        Maquis in the region. They’re led 
                        by Major Gaspard--

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        --a right prick--
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        --who hates the SOE. He fears that, 
                        once we clear out the krauts, we’re 
                        fitting to keep France for 
                        ourselves. Fortunately, he’s low on 
                        supplies, which we can provide.

                                 NANCY
                        And if he won’t cooperate?

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        You will bring him to heel or die 
                        trying. The Auvergne is centrally 
                        located, crucial for moving 
                        resources throughout France. We 
                        must control it if the coming 
                        Allied invasion is to be a success. 
                        So time is of the essence--

                                 NANCY
                        We’ll prepare to ship out at once--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Ship out? No, I’m afraid not.  
                             (to Denden)
                        You’ll be dropped at Montlucon, 
                        where there’s a radio waiting. 
                             (to Nancy)
                        And you’re dropping near the Cantal 
                        Mountains, where Gaspard and his 
                        Maquis are hiding. 
                             (Nancy blanches)
                        Relax, Captain. You got excellent 
                        marks on your jump training.

           PRE-LAP: Propellers beating and flak exploding... 

           INT. LIBERATOR BOMBER - NIGHT

           Wind whips past the open door of the Liberator, which is 
           jumping up and down, taking heavy flak over occupied France. 
           Nancy huddles nearby, vomiting ignominiously into a bag. 

           SUPER: MARCH 31, 1944 

           The AIRMAN approaches. Helping Nancy up under the staggering 
           weight of her pack, he leads her to the open door. She gazes 
           out into the darkness, afraid... But before she can even 
           think of turning back, the Airman shoves her out into --

           THE NIGHT SKY
           Nancy whips through void -- static line jerking -- her chute 
           opens as flak explodes nearby, sending her into a spin -- she 
           tries to pull out of it, aiming for a fallow field, ground 
           rushing up, terrifyingly disorienting --

           She misses the mark and crashes into the branches of a tree, 
           scratching her face and leaving her stuck hanging, hopelessly 
           tangled. She tries to get her bearings, but down the road --

           An ARMED FIGURE approaches. Nancy has no idea if he’s friend 
           or foe. She reaches for the pistol at her side, but she’s too 
           tangled to grab it. She strains, pulse pounding, as --

           He steps into a beam of moonlight, revealing a kind, soulful 
           French SOE contact: LIEUTENANT TARDIVAT (mid 30s) -- 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        If only all the trees in France 
                        could bear such beautiful fruit--

                                 NANCY
                        Just get me down, and cut out that 
                        French shit!

           Welcome back, Nancy.

           EXT. AUVERGNE COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tardivat helps Nancy down from the tree, offering a handshake 
           -- but she draws her knife instead --

                                 NANCY
                        The milk is sour.

                                 TARDIVAT
                        But the cream is fresh.

           Nancy nods, satisfied with the code, sheathing her knife -- 

                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        Lieutenant Tardivat. I’ll be your 
                        liaison with the Maquis.

                                 NANCY
                        Captain Wake. Where’s your spade?

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Sorry?

                                 NANCY
                        Get with it, Lieutenant.
                             (re: her parachute)
                        Protocol dictates that we bury this 
                        before the Germans find it--
                                 TARDIVAT
                        I haven’t seen this much silk since 
                        Paris fell-- 

                                 NANCY
                        Did you not hear the Captain part?

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Forgive me if this is more French 
                        shit, but I was a tailor long 
                        before I was a soldier.

           Nancy’s first test of leadership. Respecting the sentiment, 
           she chooses to ignore protocol and gives him the parachute --

                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Captain--

           On the road, headlights appear around the bend. Tardivat 
           yanks Nancy into the ditch, hiding in the tall grass, as --

           A VW Kubelwagen rolls up, freighted with GERMAN SOLDIERS. 
           They shine a spotlight into the ditch, tension building...

           But they drive onward.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS - CHAUDES-AIGUES VILLAGE - LATER

           Nestled in the foothills of the Cantal Mountains. Tardivat 
           leads Nancy around the perimeter, avoiding the GERMAN 
           CHECKPOINTS. But Nancy stops, training her binoculars on --

           THE VILLAGE SQUARE

           BINOCULARS POV: A spotlight illuminates a Nazi flag. A DEAD 
           WOMAN hangs beneath it, with a sign around her neck: “Maquis 
           Bitch”. Just below that, her belly has been knifed open, 
           viscera spilling out. And on the ground -- 

           A dead fetus.

           EXT. CANTAL FOOTHILLS - DAWN

           Tardivat leads Nancy through the thick, hilly forest -- 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        We’re getting close--

           Suddenly, a rifle-butt blasts Nancy on her forehead, knocking 
           her to the ground. An ARMED MAN looms, aiming at her. More 
           ARMED MEN appear, rifles trained on Tardivat.
           INT. CELLAR - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A hood is ripped off Nancy’s head, revealing a nasty gash, 
           dried blood on her face. She is tied to a chair, sitting 
           across from MAJOR GASPARD, who wears a patch on his left eye. 
           He is flanked by a half-dozen BATTLE-SCARRED MAQUIS --

                                 GASPARD
                        They send a girl this time, hoping 
                        her tits will save her neck. But do 
                        you know what I see? The Crown’s 
                        cunt, plotting to rule us.

           He leans close, right in Nancy’s blood-caked face --

                                 GASPARD (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that right, cunt?

                                 NANCY
                        That’s right, Major Gaspard. They 
                        told me to grovel and cry and even 
                        fuck into your good graces.

           The Maquis are surprised, if not impressed, by her candor -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        But I prefer to offer honest aid. 
                        Your Maquis are in need--

                                 GASPARD
                        SOE propaganda--

                                 NANCY
                        I can supply you--

                                 GASPARD
                        A deal with the devil to steal our 
                        homeland--

                                 NANCY
                        And you know you can trust me--

                                 GASPARD
                        No more than the Germans--

                                 NANCY
                        Because I’m Nancy Wake, The White 
                        Mouse of Marseille.

           That lands, silencing Gaspard --
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Yes. I am The White Mouse, and I 
                        love France as much as any man 
                        here. I don’t plot to be your 
                        ruler, I only hope to be your ally.

           We sense the room beginning to shift in her favor, but --

                                 GASPARD
                        Forgive me, I didn’t realize we 
                        were in the presence of greatness--

                                 NANCY
                        Hardly--

                                 GASPARD
                        But from what I’ve heard, the real 
                        story isn’t so great: You seduced 
                        an old fool, blew his money, and 
                        left him to rot in prison for your 
                        mistakes. Which explains why I 
                        found this in your pack--

           Gaspard produces Nancy’s wedding ring--

                                 GASPARD (CONT’D)
                        --instead of on your finger.

           He knows he has hit a nerve, as Nancy flushes red --

                                 NANCY
                        I-- I took it off to protect him--

                                 GASPARD
                        But I’m sure you can get another 
                        rich man to finance your escapades--

                                 NANCY
                        Give it back--

                                 GASPARD
                        In fact, you already have, and he’s 
                        a big step up: The King of England. 
                        But unlike you, I’m loyal--

                                 NANCY
                        Give it back, goddamnit--

                                 GASPARD
                        And I don’t want to end up buried 
                        next to your forgotten husband--

                                 NANCY
                        GIVE IT BACK!
           Nancy lunges at Gaspard -- but she’s restrained, so she just 
           tips herself over and writhes helplessly on the ground, the 
           gash on her forehead now bleeding again. Gaspard straddles 
           her, verging on sexual violation --

                                 GASPARD
                        See? Her tits make her top-heavy.

           He raises his fist and swings at her temple, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INTERROGATION - GESTAPO PRISON (MARSEILLE) - NIGHT

           Henri huddles in a dark corner, shivering, his naked body 
           covered with infected welts and burns. The door opens and 
           Captain Böhm enters. He approaches Henri, who reels in fear --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Shhh, it’s alright. Breathe...

           Böhm takes off his jacket and wraps it around Henri --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        She’s alive, Henri. I’ve just 
                        learned that she escaped through 
                        Spain and took a ship to England. 
                        Do you have any idea how many 
                        people we have there? We will find 
                        her, whether you tell me or not. So 
                        for your sake, please -- where did 
                        you hide her?

           Henri takes a long beat, perhaps wavering... But he throws 
           off the jacket, unwilling to cooperate. Böhm sighs, grabs it 
           off the floor, and heads for the door. As he exits, TWO 
           GESTAPO enter, armed with batons -- 

                                 HENRI
                        No, NO--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELLAR - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Nancy regains consciousness, still tied to the tipped-over 
           chair, Tardivat cutting the ropes and jostling her --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Captain? 

           He helps Nancy to her feet, giving back her wedding ring --
                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        He said take it and go. I agree. 
                        They’ll never accept you.

           Rather than hide it in her pack again, Nancy puts the wedding 
           ring on her finger, considering her next move... Then --

                                 NANCY
                        No. No, Gaspard already accused me 
                        of running out on my husband--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        I know a village where you could 
                        have a warm bed, a hot meal--

                                 NANCY
                        Running confirms his narrative--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        He’ll kill you--

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not running. 

           EXT. GASPARD’S CAMP - CANTAL FOOTHILLS - LATER

           Situated around an old farmhouse in the forested foothills. 
           We glimpse roughly 100 MAQUIS eating dinner throughout. 
           Gaspard holds court at the center fire-pit, as --

           Nancy and Tardivat sit on the perimeter. Nancy digs into her 
           pack and produces a bottle of chilli-sauce, dousing her 
           rotten mutton. Meanwhile, Tardivat tailors the parachute -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Something for your wife?
                             (he nods)
                        Do you feel guilty, leaving her to 
                        go fight?

                                 TARDIVAT
                        It’s the second World War in twenty 
                        years. We’re all guilty.

           Nancy nods, trying to put Henri out of her mind. She looks 
           around at all the hostile faces, watching her --

                                 NANCY
                        So how’s Gaspard going to kill me?

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Not openly, not a woman. We may all 
                        be guilty, but not that guilty. 
                                 NANCY
                        Poison, then.

           Nancy pushes away her plate of rotten mutton, hyper-alert, 
           surrounded by potential assassins...

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Captain, we can still go--

           But she waves him silent, as a handsome Frenchman, FRANC, 
           approaches from across the camp -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Of course, he sends the pretty boy.

           Franc saunters up, addressing Nancy --

                                 FRANC
                        Apologies, madame. As a proud chef, 
                        I must admit, this slop isn’t fit 
                        for your lips.

           Nancy glances at Gaspard, who’s trying to hide the fact that 
           he’s observing this interaction --

                                 NANCY
                        And what should my lips enjoy?

                                 FRANC
                        A serviceable bordeaux in my tent?

           Nancy stands and allows Franc to lead her into his tent. Both 
           Tardivat and Gaspard watch, tension building... Then a shriek 
           erupts and the whole camp to turns to look -- 

           As Nancy exits the tent, leaving a pained Franc sprawled on 
           the ground, holding his crotch. She heads directly to Gaspard 
           and tosses the bottle of chilli-sauce at his feet, speaking 
           loudly enough for all the Maquis to hear -- 

                                 NANCY
                        I’m hiking to the plateau to help 
                        any Maquis who’s willing. When 
                        you’re done starving, come find me.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Exhausted from the long hike, Nancy and Tardivat trudge up 
           the steep trail. They hear the rumble of an engine and take 
           cover behind a tree, drawing their pistols, as --

           A motorcycle approaches from behind. As it nears, Nancy 
           recognizes Denden, who’s riding on the back --
                                 NANCY
                        Sonofabitch.

           She flags him down. The MALE DRIVER parks and Denden hops 
           off, carrying a rucksack. He leans in to kiss the Driver, who 
           reels, afraid of open affection, then speeds off, as --

           Tardivat turns to Nancy, surprised, as Denden runs up --

                                 DENDEN
                             (hugging her)
                        When I heard you’d left Gaspard, I 
                        convinced a lovely young man to 
                        give me a ride. 
                             (off Nancy’s look)
                        What?

           Nancy just shakes her head and smiles.

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - LATER

           A squalid fire-pit and some moldy blankets. Flies swarm the 
           half-butchered cow that hangs from a branch. 30 THREADBARE 
           MAQUIS chat idly. Their grizzled leader, FOURNIER, picks a 
           filthy cigarette butt out of the mud and smokes it, as -- 

           Nancy, Denden, and Tardivat approach. All the Maquis turn and 
           stare, a few reaching for their ancient, rusty guns --

           But Nancy raises her hands in peace, as we begin --

           A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

           -- Denden unzips his rucksack, revealing radio components, as 
           we hear the famed Radio London opening --

                                 RADIO LONDON BROADCASTER (V.O.)
                        This is London.

           -- Denden masterfully assembles complex tubing and wires --

                                 RADIO LONDON BROADCASTER (V.O.)
                        The French speaking to the French.

           -- Denden runs the long antenna up a tree --

                                 RADIO LONDON BROADCASTER (V.O.)
                        Before we begin, please listen to 
                        some personal messages... 

           -- Finally, Denden sits before a fully assembled SOE radio, 
           adjusting dozens of dials --
                                 RADIO LONDON BROADCASTER
                        Jean has a long mustache. There is 
                        a fire at the insurance agency. The 
                        frog croaks thrice--

           He turns it down, as Nancy addresses the gathered Maquis --

                                 NANCY
                        Gentlemen, this is not gibberish. 
                        It’s code that can bring you canned 
                        meat and orange juice. Chocolate 
                        and cigarettes--

                                 FOURNIER
                        French cigarettes?

                                 NANCY
                        French cigarettes. Tents to shield 
                        you from the French rain. Boots to 
                        tromp through French mud. And 
                        penicillin for the clap you get 
                        from the French whores. 
                             (the Maquis laugh)
                        Most of all, it’s guns to kill the 
                        Nazis who are occupying French 
                        land. Because this is not at all 
                        gibberish -- it’s your salvation.

           The Maquis seem cautiously amenable. Nancy nods to Denden, 
           who begins to tap morse code over the radio, and we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CODING HALL - 64 BAKER STREET - DAY

           The vast hall that Nancy glimpsed from the catwalk, filled 
           with men on radios and coding machines. A RADIO OPERATOR 
           decodes a message and raises his hand -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (PRE-LAP)
                        She’s alive, at least.

           INT. COLONEL BUCKMASTER’S OFFICE - 64 BAKER STREET - LATER

           Gielgud shows Buckmaster the transcription from Nancy --

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        For now, sir. But she’s fallen in 
                        with bloody dregs. No real 
                        victories. Best known for pilfering 
                        livestock from nearby farmers. 
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Well, tell her she’s got eight 
                        weeks to turn them from rabble with 
                        guns into a disciplined regiment. 
                        Eight weeks, then all hell breaks 
                        loose.

           Buckmaster motions to his desk, which features plans for the 
           imminent D-Day invasion, code-named “Operation Overlord” --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIBERATOR BOMBER - NIGHT

           Engines roaring, BRITISH AIRMEN sweat and strain, heaving a 
           supply-crate out the bay doors, to --

           THE NIGHT SKY

           The parachute opens and the crate floats down, visible from --

           AN OPEN FIELD ON THE CANTAL PLATEAU

           Where Nancy, Tardivat, Fournier, and three Spanish Brothers -- 
           RODRIGO, JUAN, and MATEO -- watch from behind a rock --

                                 NANCY
                        As soon as it lands, we haul it 
                        away to safety--

           Ignoring Nancy, Fournier and the Spanish Brothers sprint into 
           the middle of the field, ripping open the supply-crate the 
           moment it touches down. Fournier grabs the cigarettes --

                                 NANCY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re dead, Fournier.

           He turns to see Nancy, pointing her pistol at him -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        The Germans have radar. They could 
                        be on us within twenty minutes, and 
                        you’re standing here, in the middle 
                        of a fucking field, smoking fucking 
                        cigarettes.

           In response, Fournier blows cigarette-smoke in her face. 

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - LATER

           Fournier and the Maquis enjoy the SOE’s bounty, trading tins 
           of meat, cigarettes, and bottles of wine. Nancy walks up --
                                 NANCY
                        Into your bags. We have a long day 
                        tomorrow and every day after. 

                                 FOURNIER
                             (saluting)
                        Yes, sir!

           Vexed, Nancy grabs a bottle of wine from the crate and heads 
           off, as the Maquis continue reveling.

           EXT. HOT SPRING - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAWN

           Nancy bathes in the hot spring, a rare moment of peace, 
           interrupted by a rustle in the bushes. She grabs her pistol --

                                 NANCY
                        Show yourself.

           Rodrigo, Mateo, and Juan appear, hands raised --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Rodrigo, Mateo, and Juan, the 
                        Spanish Brothers. You survived a 
                        civil war, came all the way here to 
                        fight the fascists, and I could’ve 
                        shot you dead -- for what?

           Nancy rises from the water, exposing her flesh. At first, the 
           Spanish Brothers gawk. But the longer she stands naked, the 
           less sexual she is -- now just a human being. She steps 
           toward them, gun still aimed, getting very close --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        This?

           Deeply ashamed, now, the Spanish Brothers look away --

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Yes, I’ve got hole.

           EXT. FOURNIER'S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           The hungover Maquis are lined up at attention. Nancy walks 
           past the Spanish Brothers, who are unable to meet her gaze --

                                 NANCY
                        You think this makes me weak.

           Fournier is at the end of the line, smoking a cigarette --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You think I’ll faint at the sight 
                        of a little blood. 
           Nancy smacks the hell out of him, sending his cigarette 
           flying. He stands there, shocked --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been bleeding my whole life.

           And she smacks him again. Enraged, Fournier throws her down 
           and pins her with his size advantage. He raises his fist to 
           strike, but can’t bring himself to do it, as we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. NANCY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

           NANCY’S MOTHER clutches a Bible in one hand, her other raised 
           to strike YOUNG NANCY, as we --

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           Nancy spits in Fournier’s face, so he cracks her on the jaw --

                                 NANCY
                        My fucking mother hit harder--

           Fournier hits her again and again, a series of sickening 
           thuds -- and Nancy takes it, showing the Maquis that she can 
           endure a brutal beating, as we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           Fournier relents, unpinning Nancy, who lies bleeding. 
           Disgusted, he turns his back on her and walks away --

           But Nancy isn’t finished: She grabs the lit cigarette off the 
           ground, stalks up behind Fournier -- and burns it into his 
           cheek, flesh searing, he screams --

           And Nancy puts him in a headlock. Writhing desperately, he 
           pulls her hair and bites her arm -- but Nancy holds fast, 
           choking Fournier into passing out. Covered in mud and blood, 
           she stands and faces the Maquis -- 

           Who stare in shocked silence.
           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           With Nancy in the lead, the Maquis jog through the rugged 
           forest. Fournier pukes up last night’s wine -- 

                                 GERMAN PROPAGANDIST (V.O.)
                        Women of France, we are here to 
                        liberate you.

           Nancy offers a helping hand, but he pushes her away, spitting 
           flecks of vomit on her boots, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           The Maquis assemble their new Bren Guns --

                        Your countrymen do not respect you. 

           Fournier points his Bren Gun at Nancy’s back, making a firing 
           motion, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCK WALL - FOURNIER’S CAMP - EVENING

           Nancy diagrams battle tactics, using a stone to make white

                                 GERMAN PROPAGANDIST (V.O.)
                        They do not listen to you.

           When she turns, she sees that the Maquis aren’t paying 
           attention, but rather talking and smoking, as we --

           EXT. FOURNIER'S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAWN

           Nancy squats behind a tree, urinating. She hears a rustle in 
           the bushes, pulls up her pants, and turns --

                                 GERMAN PROPAGANDIST (V.O.)
                        They impose sexual submission.

           To see the back of a Maquis who is running off, as we --

           Nancy hands out supplies to the Maquis, who grab everything

                        They usurp your body.

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           The Maquis fire their new Bren Guns at targets, but most 
           miss. Nancy tries to demonstrate proper technique -- but a 
           bullet slams into the tree by her head --  

                                 GERMAN PROPAGANDIST (V.O.)
                        They violate your soul.

           She whips around to see who fired, suspecting Fournier, but 
           nobody will make eye-contact, as we --

           Fournier and the Maquis sit by the fire-pit, eating dinner,

                        Goebbels is clever, I’ll grant him 
                        that.
                             (re: the Maquis)
                        Half a mind to turn them in myself.
                             (off Tardivat’s shrug)
                        Go on then, spit it out.

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Respectfully, Captain: A leader 
                        with no victories earns no respect.

                                 DENDEN
                        Oh, to hell with them, Nan, just 
                        respect yourself.
           Nancy processes their dueling advice... Then --

                                 NANCY
                        You’re both right.

           She turns the radio back on --

                                 GERMAN PROPAGANDIST
                        --women of France, we are here to 
                        liberate you--

                                 NANCY
                        Where’s this shit spewing from?

           Thunder cracks in the distance, and we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BROADCAST STATION - CHAUDES-AIGUES VILLAGE - NIGHT

           BINOCULARS POV: Rain pours, muting the three spotlights 
           posted at the corners of the razor-wire fence that surrounds 
           the radio tower. ARMED GUARDS patrol the perimeter --

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        I need five brave men.

           We PULL OUT to --

           THE FORESTED OUTSKIRTS

           Where Nancy hides with her Maquis, scouting the target with 
           her binoculars. Tardivat steps forward without hesitation -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Nobody else?

           Rodrigo steps forward, his taciturn brothers following -- 

                                 RODRIGO
                        We owe amends.

                                 NANCY
                        Then you’ll take the spotlights. 
                        Now I need one more man...?
                             (nobody volunteers)
                        This is the same village where a 
                        woman was hung in the-- Do I really 
                        have to remind you? With the baby?

           At last, Fournier steps forward --

                                 FOURNIER
                        Her name was Chloe.
                                 NANCY
                        I assume you meant to miss me with 
                        that shot in the forest?
                             (he nods)
                        Good, then you’re our sniper. Wait 
                        for the lightning, count to three, 
                        fire with the thunder.

                                 TARDIVAT
                        What about us, Captain?

           Nancy opens her pack, revealing bricks of C-4...

           EXT. FENCE-LINE - BROADCAST STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Mateo, Rodrigo, and Juan split up, crouching along the fence-
           line, each heading for one of the three spotlights, as --

           ON A NEARBY ROOFTOP 

           Fournier finishes climbing a drainpipe and lays down in 
           sniper position, calibrating his rifle-scope, as --

           AT A SPOTLIGHT

           Rodrigo skulks up behind a GUARD, draws his knife -- and 
           plunges it into the Guard’s neck. He takes hold of the 
           spotlight, dipping the beam slightly. In the rainy distance, 
           another spotlight beam dips, then the third, as --

           AT THE MAIN GATE

           FOUR GUARDS are alerted, calling out for their compatriots. 
           Two of them head off toward the spotlights to find out what 
           happened, leaving only two Guards left at the gate, as -- 

           BEHIND A NEARBY TREE

           Tardivat preps the C-4, while Nancy scouts --

                                 NANCY
                        It’s time.

           She draws her knife, which shakes in her hand --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Your first kill?

           But she masks her fear with bravado --

                                 NANCY
                        You have your orders, Lieutenant.
           He ducks low and heads toward the Guard on the south side of 
           the main gate, as --

           We stay with Nancy, who skulks toward the Guard on the north 
           side. She sneaks up behind him, just a few feet away, knife 
           poised, hands really shaking now, as -- 

           To the south, Tardivat stabs his Guard, causing a commotion. 
           The other Guard spooks, turning back -- and he sees Nancy. 
           They both stand, frozen for a moment... Then the Guard lunges 
           at her, grabbing the knife, as --

           ON A NEARBY ROOFTOP

           Fournier sees this struggle in a flash of lightning, aiming --

                                 FOURNIER
                        One... Two...

           BACK AT THE MAIN GATE

           Nancy’s losing, arms trembling as the Guard presses the knife 
           to her throat, but --

           Thunder cracks, masking the sniper-shot that sends a bullet 
           through the Guard’s temple, spraying blood on Nancy, as -- 

           Tardivat runs up, shaking her out of it, no time to process. 
           Together, they open the gate and slip into the --

           BROADCAST TOWER COMPOUND

           A broadcast building and a tall tower, which is supported by 
           three struts. Nancy and Tardivat grab C-4, as --

           AT A SPOTLIGHT

           One of the Guards who left the main gate stands over the dead 
           body of his compatriot. Alarmed, the Guard immediately flips 
           the spotlight back on, illuminating the --

           BROADCAST TOWER COMPOUND

           Where Nancy is rigging C-4 to one of the struts, setting a 
           short fuse, just as the beam of light hits her --

                                 NANCY
                        RUN!

           Tardivat lights the fuse on his C-4 and takes off, sprinting 
           for the main gate, as --

           ALONG THE FENCE-LINE
           The two remaining Guards aim their rifles, about to shoot 
           Nancy -- BANG -- one of them is taken out by Fournier’s 
           sniper bullet, which isn’t masked by thunder this time. The 
           remaining Guard ducks low, running for cover, as -- 

           IN THE BROADCAST TOWER COMPOUND

           Nancy finishes rigging the final strut with C-4, setting the 
           fuse even shorter. She sprints for the main gate -- 

           But she’s tackled by the last Guard. They roll around in the 
           muck, rain hammering down, as --

           ON A NEARBY ROOFTOP

           Fournier aims but doesn’t have a shot, he’d risk killing 
           Nancy, and the village alarm starts blaring --

           So Fournier switches his aim to the German barracks across 
           the village, where A DOZEN SOLDIERS rush out, heading for the 
           broadcast station. Well out of range, Fournier fires off a 
           fusillade, trying to delay them, as --

           AT THE MAIN GATE

           The Guard shoves Nancy’s face into a puddle, so that she’s 
           sucking muck, almost passed out --

           The first C-4 pack explodes, shrapnel flying --

           Giving Nancy an opening to buck the Guard --

           The second C-4 pack explodes, tilting the tower --

           This time, Nancy doesn’t hesitate: She chops the Guard’s 
           throat, crushing his windpipe, watching him gasp his final, 
           pained breath, the light leaving his eyes --

           The third C-4 pack explodes, toppling the tower, metal 
           shrieking and groaning like a death knell --

           Just as an old bus pulls up to the main gate. The doors open, 
           it’s Tardivat. He runs to Nancy, who is transfixed on the 
           body of the first man she killed. He pulls her away, into --

           THE OLD BUS

           Rodrigo drives. Mateo and Juan are here, too. Fournier hangs 
           out the window, laying cover fire. They speed off, as -- 

           The tower collapses in a heap of metal and flames --

           And a shell-shocked Nancy stares at her bloody hands...
                                 FOURNIER (PRE-LAP)
                        She killed him bare-fucking-handed.

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAWN

           Nancy slugs wine, repressing her conflicted emotions, as the 
           Maquis celebrate their first major victory --

                                 FOURNIER
                             (re: his scarred cheek)
                        I thought this was rough, turns out 
                        it’s her version of a kiss.

           Everyone laughs, so Nancy forces a smile. Fournier stands and 
           holds up his wine --

                                 FOURNIER (CONT’D)
                        To Captain Wake. 

           They all raise their glasses and drink. Fournier nods to 
           Denden, who turns on the radio, which is just static --

                                 DENDEN
                        Seems something happened to the 
                        Nazi radio station. 
                             (raucous laughter)
                        Let’s try the BBC, shall we?

           He adjusts the dial and lively music plays. Without warning, 
           the Maquis hoist Nancy and start dancing around her.

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - EVENING

           Catharsis. The Maquis clap as Denden puts on a circus show -- 

           But Nancy sits off to the side, drinking alone --

                                 TARDIVAT (O.S.)
                        It gets easier.

           She turns to see Tardivat, who sits next to her --

                                 NANCY
                        I’ve witnessed plenty of killing. 
                        But it was removed. Almost... 
                        exciting? That seems goddamn 
                        idiotic, now. 

           She holds up her bruised, and now lethal, hands --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        My husband took me to get my nails 
                        done, every Monday. He wouldn’t 
                        even recognize them anymore.
                                 TARDIVAT
                        My wife is many things, it doesn’t 
                        stop me from loving her.

           As Nancy fiddles with her wedding ring, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARK - MARSEILLE - DAY

           FRENCH FAMILIES stand aside, as Captain Böhm takes a stroll 
           through the park, hand in hand with his YOUNG DAUGHTER, who 
           has her German Shepherd puppy on a leash -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        --can’t let him off the leash, 
                        honey. You see, this park, it runs 
                        on rules. It’s up to good men like 
                        papa to enforce these rules.

           He points to his prominent swastika arm-band -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        That’s why this symbol is so 
                        important. It means order. Like... 
                        well, like a papa for everyone--

           Böhm stops when he sees his AIDE rushing up, winded -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        It couldn’t wait?

                                 AIDE
                        Sir, there’s news from the 
                        Auvergne. Rumors of a woman.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NANCY’S TENT - MORNING

           A frantic Denden shakes Nancy awake --

                                 DENDEN
                        There’s trouble!

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

           Leaving the camp behind, Nancy follows Denden, running 
           through the forest --

                                 NANCY
                        What-- What is it?
                                 DENDEN
                        No time to explain, just hurry--

           They come to a clearing that is the now-familiar --

           HOT SPRING

                                 ALL THE MAQUIS
                        SURPRISE!

           Nancy is shocked to find the Maquis, covered in grime, as if 
           they’ve been working through the long night. They part, 
           revealing the old bus from the raid --

                                 DENDEN
                        Your new home, Nan. 

                                 NANCY
                        How the hell did you get it up 
                        here? We stalled out in the 
                        foothills.

                                 DENDEN
                             (re: the Spanish Brothers)
                        They pushed it. All night. 

                                 RODRIGO
                        We thought you deserved some 
                        privacy, Captain.

           Nancy smiles as Tardivat leads her into --

           THE OLD BUS

           To reveal that several rows of seats have been ripped out, 
           the cushions made into a full mattress. There are curtains 
           hanging on the windows, and in the very back, laid out --

           A silk nightgown tailored from Nancy’s parachute, wan morning 
           sunlight filtering through. Nancy tries it on --

                                 NANCY
                        Tardivat, it’s perfect. But it’s 
                        for your wife. 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        As is everything I create -- but 
                        she can’t wear it. 
                             (off Nancy’s confusion)
                        She died in ‘41. She’d want you to 
                        have this.
           Touched, Nancy hugs Tardivat, as we --

           Thin soup is ladled into a bowl. Franc serves the gaunt, 
           Maquis, who sit around the fire. Gaspard swats a fly, as --

           We hear the ominous drone of aircraft engines. Suddenly, four 
           Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf fighters appear on the horizon -- 

                                 GASPARD
                        TAKE COVER--

           Off the banshee scream of machine-guns, we --

           EXT. FOURNIER'S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           Nancy and her Maquis eat breakfast around the fire -- as a

           Perched on a rock, Nancy looks through binoculars, at --

           THE FOREST BELOW

           Where the blood-spattered Gaspard limps slowly up toward the 
           plateau, leading his INJURED AND EXHAUSTED MAQUIS...

           INT. THE OLD BUS - DAY

           Gaspard sits unbound in a chair. Nancy sits across from him, 
           with Fournier, Tardivat, and Denden at her back --

                                 NANCY
                        Do you know the real difference 
                        between men and women, Gaspard? And 
                        please don’t say tits again--

                                 GASPARD
                        Fuck you--

           Fournier backhands Gaspard, silencing him -- 

                                 NANCY
                        See? Men solve problems with 
                        violence. The Germans were violent 
                        to you, which brings you here.

                        And you were violent to me, which 
                        makes my men want to hang you from 
                        the highest tree. But lucky for 
                        you, Gaspard, I’ve been thinking 
                        about how women solve problems. We 
                        do it by talking -- talking about 
                        our dreaded feelings. Right now, 
                        you feel fear. Anger. But beneath 
                        that, shame. We both know that acid 
                        churn. Exactly as you feel now, you 
                        made me feel. And I could’ve stayed 
                        in your camp, puffing my chest, 
                        until some man murdered me. I 
                        could’ve died of shame. But that 
                        would be a shamefully stupid way to 
                        die, don’t you agree?

           As Gaspard grudgingly nods assent, we --

                        every soldier I can get. So I’m 
                        going to heal your Maquis.

           their marks nearly every time --

           Back on Nancy and Gaspard --

                                 NANCY
                        All you have to do is accept that 
                        I’m now your commanding officer. 
                        Since you’re a Major, let’s say 
                        I’m... Colonel?

                                 GASPARD
                        Fine. Alright, yes.

           Nancy leans in and runs her hand through his hair, grabbing a 
           tuft and yanking his head back --

                                 NANCY
                        Yes?

           In answer to her question, we --

                        Colonel, let me apologize--

           LATER - SUNSET

           The Maquis are seated around a long table packed with food. 
           Nancy is at the head, giving a toast, an echo of her wedding 
           night that shows just how far she has come --

                                 NANCY
                        Enjoy, boys, because this may be 
                        your last supper.
                             (gallows laughter)
                        Very soon, we’ll get our orders, 
                        and we’ll begin the real fight to 
                        take back our home. So I suppose, 
                        in a way, that makes us family. 

           All the Maquis toast to family, then --

                        But don’t think of me as your 
                        mother, I’m not a bitter old bitch.

           Everyone laughs again, commencing the feast. And as the sun 
           dips below the horizon, darkness falling, we -- 

           PRE-LAP: The rhythmic clang of metal hitting stone...

           LATER - NIGHT

           The fire rages out of control. Shirtless Maquis drum their 
           rifle-butts on the rocky ground and dance in a circle, 
           slamming their drunken bodies into each other. It’s primitive 
           and raw, like a barbarian bloodlust ritual before battle --  

           But Nancy stands to the side with Denden, mere observers --

           A piercing yawp. Everyone turns to see Gaspard emerge from 
           the dark forest, knife in hand. He heads to the center of the 
           circle, perilously close to the fire, where he wordlessly 
           drags the blade across his scarred chest, drawing blood -- 

           One by one, the Maquis pass by, swipe some of Gaspard’s blood 
           -- and smear it on their faces. A rite of passage in which 
           even Tardivat takes part --

           While Nancy and Denden are still left out -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        Christ, why don’t they just fuck 
                        already--

           But Nancy’s feet are suddenly moving, summoned into the 
           circle by a force far deeper, and more ancient, than words -- 

           Guns hammering granite -- sweaty flesh -- howls --
           Nancy approaches Gaspard, meeting his eyes in the firelight. 
           She reaches out, places her hand on his chest --

           And she rubs his blood on her face, unleashing a primal 
           scream. All the Maquis scream with her, sweeping her in a 
           wave of orgiastic bodies, consumed by the Masculine...

                                                               FADE TO:

           of history --

                        Within the hour, Allied forces will 
                        begin storming France in what is 
                        the largest amphibious assault in 
                        history. If it fails, the Nazis 
                        will dig in and Western Europe will 
                        be lost indefinitely. Fortunately, 
                        we have the element of surprise. 
                        Thanks to an aggressive 
                        psychological op, Reichsmarschall 
                        Goering believes we’re landing at 
                        Pas de Calais, which he has 
                        fortified heavily. What he doesn’t 
                        know is, we’re actually landing at 
                        Normandy, where our troops should 
                        encounter light resistance. But 
                        only if the Germans can’t send 
                        reinforcements. Thus, the critical 
                        objective of the SOE is to sabotage 
                        their supply-lines.

           And clangs off a strut, alerting the Guard. He looks down, 
           about to spot Nancy and Franc, tension sky-high -- 

           But another Guard calls to him from the guard station, waving 
           the radio. The Guard runs off, alarmed, as --

                                 NANCY
                        Shit. Something’s gone wrong.

           In the near distance, we see the troop-train round a bend, 
           accelerating to maximum speed --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ARMOR CAR - MUNITIONS-TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Fournier and his remaining five Maquis stalk through the car, 
           which is full of armored plating, as --

                                 FOURNIER
                        The munitions should be just ahead--

           The brakes squeal and the train slows. Suddenly, the door to 
           the next car is kicked in and EIGHT GUARDS start firing, 
           bullets flying, one grazing Fournier’s arm, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUEL DEPOT - CANTAL VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Gaspard pulls a piece of shrapnel from his leg, as his Maquis 
           drag him to safety behind a tree. They’re taking heavy fire 
           from the German artillery, bodies falling all around, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

           The troop-train bears down, full-speed, moments away from 
           crossing the bridge. One of the alerted Guards spots Nancy, 
           hanging below. He raises his rifle to fire -- but a bullet 
           splits his head open -- 

           Fired by Tardivat from a cave below. He’s with the Spanish 
           Brothers, who lay cover for Nancy and Franc. In the 
           crossfire, a bullet strikes Franc in the gut, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUEL DEPOT - CANTAL VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Gaspard watches his men get shredded by a minigun, bullets 
           hammering the tree he’s hiding behind, wood-chips flying -- 

                                 MAQUIS
                        Sir, we must retreat--

                                 GASPARD
                        I won’t be upstaged by that cunt. 

           Gaspard peers around the tree and takes stock: The fuel-train 
           is pulling away, almost out of reach. Then he spots the 
           solution: A unmanned mortar-station, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ARMOR CAR - MUNITIONS-TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Bullets slam into a stack of armor, behind which Fournier and 
           his Maquis take cover, two of them nursing flesh-wounds, as --

           Fournier peers around the edge and sees that, past the 
           Guards, there’s a pallet of grenades in the next car. He 
           takes a grenade of his own and heaves it -- 

           But the Guards bat it back -- so Fournier grabs an armor 
           plate and slams it down on the exploding grenade, knocked 
           back by the blast, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

           Franc bleeds out, losing his grip on the strut. Nancy puts 
           pressure on his bullet-wound with her free hand, blood 
           pouring over her, far too much to staunch. 

           Meanwhile, Tardivat and the Spanish Brothers try to hold off 
           the Guards, laying cover-fire from the cave below --
           But the train will cross the bridge within 30 seconds -- 

                                 NANCY
                        It’s over, we missed--

                                 FRANC
                             (coughing blood)
                        No, I-- I can finish. 

           Nancy holds Franc’s gaze, knowing exactly what he means... 
           And she starts climbing down toward Tardivat, leaving Franc 
           hanging there, the train bearing down, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ARMOR CAR - MUNITIONS-TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Ears ringing from the grenade explosion, Fournier gets his 
           bearings. Two of his men are dead, limbs blown off, two more 
           badly injured. He peers around the armor stack --

           The Guards are advancing, nearly on them -- 

                                 FOURNIER
                        Get out. 

           The two surviving Maquis limp out the back, leaving only 
           Fournier. He grabs a Bren Gun, it’s broken. He grabs another, 
           one bullet left in the clip, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUEL DEPOT - CANTAL VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Gaspard dives behind the mortar station. In the distance, the 
           fuel-train pulls away, almost out of range, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

           The troop-train reaches the bridge, speeding over. Franc 
           fumbles with the detonator, trying to rig the last wire, but 
           the rumbling of the train overhead makes him slip, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUEL DEPOT - CANTAL VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Gaspard launches his mortar, arcing through the air, as we --

           INT. ARMOR CAR - MUNITIONS-TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Fournier leans out from cover, aiming, and he finds an angle 
           on a grenade resting on a pile in the munitions car. His 
           trigger-finger tenses, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

           Troop-train screaming overhead, Franc finally manages to get 
           the last wire in place, just as the last car passes --

           He presses the detonator, leaving this world in a gorgeous 
           and terrible flash, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ARMOR CAR - MUNITIONS-TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Fournier fires, bullet zipping past the Guards -- it hits the 
           grenade, triggering a chain-reaction that explodes all the 
           grenades in the pile --

           As Fournier sprints out the back, and we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FUEL DEPOT - CANTAL VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The mortar slams into the fuel-train, sending a fireball 
           outward that ignites the entire fuel depot, a column of black 
           smoke climbing into the sky, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

           The troop-train is nearly over -- but the bridge collapses, 
           taking the last few cars with it, which pull the entire train 
           down, a twisting mass of metal falling past --

           THE CLIFF-SIDE CAVE

           Where Nancy, Tardivat, and the Spanish Brothers watch. For a 
           split-second, Nancy locks eyes with a TERRIFIED GERMAN 
           SOLDIER who’s looking out the window in his last moment, as --

           The train crashes into the raging river below. Eyes glazing 
           over, Nancy looks down at the wreckage she’s wrought...

           A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:
           -- Back at camp, a blood-soaked Nancy holds down a wailing 
           Maquis, while Gaspard removes a bullet from his shoulder.

           -- Denden cinches a belt around the thigh of the terrified 
           Young Maquis he slept with, as another Maquis begins to saw 
           his leg off below the knee. 

           -- Nancy drags a dead body over to a pile of carcasses and 
           lays it down, confronting the dehumanizing toll of war.

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - CANTAL PLATEAU - DUSK

           Distant churchbells echo throughout the mountains, as the sun 
           sets over fresh graves. The surviving Maquis pay respect. 
           Nancy is at the fore, still covered in blood, somber --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        In France, we have a belief that, 
                        if you can hear your churchbells 
                        ringing, you fight that much 
                        harder. L’esprit de clocher. Today, 
                        they ring for our victory--

                                 NANCY
                             (re: the graves)
                        Fucking victory?

                                 DENDEN
                        Don’t beat yourself up, they knew 
                        the risks going in--

                                 GASPARD (O.S.)
                        Brave words from the fairy who 
                        didn’t fight.

           Denden turns to see Gaspard, whose leg is now bandaged -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        The radio’s my weapon--

                                 NANCY
                        Just shutup, both of you.

           And Nancy storms off.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - NIGHT

           Nancy sits before a mirror, cleaning the dried blood off her 
           face. She reaches into her pack and pulls out a tube of 
           lipstick. She applies is slowly, deliberately, as if trying 
           to regain some lost part of herself.
           INT. MEDICAL TENT - LATER

           Nancy pads through, passing wounded men, who moan deliriously 
           in their blood-stained cots. She comes to a Maquis who is 
           weeping softly, and when he turns over, she sees that half of 
           his face is badly burned.

           Rather than turn away, she embraces the vulnerability and 
           sits next to him, holding his hand, bearing his pain, softly 
           soothing him to sleep as a mother would her child...

           LATER - DAWN

           Nancy has been here all night, silently watching over the 
           burned Maquis, who is now sleeping peacefully -- 

                                 FOURNIER (O.S.)
                        Colonel!

           She looks outside to see Fournier running up.

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy stands with Fournier at the edge of the plateau,  
           looking through binoculars at --

           THE FOREST BELOW

           BINOCULARS POV: SCORES OF FRENCHMEN make their way up toward 
           the plateau to join the Maquis, as we go --

           BACK TO THE PLATEAU

           The normally stolid Fournier smiles --

                                 FOURNIER
                        France is rising. 

           At last, this is enough to lift Nancy’s spirits.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Revitalized, Nancy sits before the mirror, removing her 
           lipstick, as if returning to her duty as a leader of men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESTROYED RAILWAY BRIDGE - CANTAL MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Captain Böhm stands at the ragged edge of the destroyed 
           bridge, as if meditating on the meaning of it --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Describe her to me, please.
           He turns, revealing the sole surviving bridge Guard --

                                 GUARD
                        I’m sorry, sir, but there was so 
                        much happening--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Perfectly understandable that your 
                        mind would block a painful memory. 
                        May I try a technique?

                                 GUARD
                        Of course, sir-- 

           Böhm grabs the Guard and yanks him perilously close to the 
           edge, holding him over the void --

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        STOP-- STOP, NO--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Struggle and you fall. Just feel.

           The Guard ceases struggling, now staring in wide-eyed fear at 
           the carnage far below --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        The Jew Freud theorizes that 
                        inducing the emotions of a 
                        repressed trauma will bring it back 
                        with vivid terror.

           Böhm pulls the shuddering Guard back to safety, straightening 
           his askance collar --

                        Excuse me?

           Normally, Nancy would ease up, but this revelation regarding 
           Henri has hit a deep trauma, so she lashes out --

                        You know, Gaspard has a point. I’m

                                 DENDEN
                        --all of your self-loathing--

                                 NANCY
                        --and you won’t even pickup a gun, 
                        because you’re a coward. 

           That cuts --

                                 DENDEN
                        Apologize. You’re under a lot of 
                        stress, so I’m giving you a chance. 
                        Apologize this instant, Nancy.
                                 NANCY
                        It’s Colonel--

                                 DENDEN
                        Apologize, goddamnit--

                                 NANCY
                        It’s Colonel, so I don’t have to.

           That cuts even deeper. Wounded, Denden salutes -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        Colonel. 

           And he departs, Tardivat and Fournier following close behind. 
           Nancy is left alone, staring at the wanted poster for a long 
           time -- at herself... And just when it seems like she might 
           finally cry, she resorts to anger instead --

                                 NANCY
                        FUCK!

           She rips her own image in half, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COLONEL BUCKMASTER’S OFFICE - 64 BAKER STREET - DAY

           Buckmaster looks over a map of France: The Allies are pushing 
           in from the coast, but the Germans still control plenty of 
           territory, including Paris in the north and Marseille in the 
           south. Meanwhile, Gielgud reads Nancy’s latest transmission --

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Sir, she’s requesting leave to go 
                        to Marseille--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Leave? What does she think she’s 
                        going to do? Single-handedly spring 
                        her husband from the bowels of a 
                        Gestapo prison in an occupied city?

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Well, sir, Rake warns that she’s 
                        become a bit unstable--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Regardless, she’s a soldier and 
                        we’ve got a war to win. A war.

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Yes, sir, but-- If we don’t let her 
                        go, she may just... go.
                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Bloody fool woman...

           Buckmaster ponders for a moment... Then --

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Very well. Tell her she doesn’t 
                        need leave. If she’s hell-bent on 
                        Marseille, we’ll send her there, 
                        free of charge. 

           He grabs a file marked “Operation Dragoon” -- 

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER (CONT’D)
                        But she’s bloody well going to 
                        fight for it.

           He opens the file, revealing a map of German fortifications 
           all along the southern coast of France -- 

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP)
                        D-Day was only the first major 
                        landing. Operation Dragoon is its 
                        equivalent on the Mediterranean.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - MORNING

           Nancy briefs Gaspard, Tardivat, Fournier, and the Spanish 
           Brothers, but Denden is notably absent --

                                 NANCY
                        Allied forces will storm the 
                        beaches, from Cannes to Marseille.
                        We’ve been ordered to provide 
                        support. If successful, we’ll 
                        liberate southern France. But 
                        success is by no means guaranteed. 
                        For the first time, we’ll engage in 
                        open battle with Panzers. Our only 
                        hope of defeating them waits in 
                        Courcais, where I’m to meet an SOE 
                        contact who can supply heavy 
                        armaments. While I’m gone--

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           Nancy now stands before her swelling ranks of Maquis -- 
           ROUGHLY 500 YOUNG MEN -- mostly unfamiliar faces --

                                 NANCY
                        --Major Gaspard and Captain 
                        Fournier are your ranking officers. 
                        Listen to them. Respect them. Train 
                        as if your life is at stake.

                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        Because when I return -- we’re 
                        going to all-out war. 

           The youthful Maquis whoop and cheer, but --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        GET TO WORK. 

           The Maquis fall into line, as Gaspard begins to drill them. 
           Nancy approaches Fournier --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                             (re: Gaspard)
                        Don’t let him forget his place.

           Fournier nods, and she heads over to where three stolen VW 
           Kubelwagens wait. Tardivat drives the front car, Rodrigo and 
           Juan in the next, and Mateo in the third. Nancy hops in next 
           to Tardivat, and as the convoy rolls out of camp --

           Nancy locks eyes with an embittered Denden...

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -- Nancy’s convoy speeds across the countryside, which is 
           littered with bombed-out armored vehicles and rotting, 
           bloated German corpses. The blood-dimmed tide is turning. 

           -- Rolling through a village square, the convoy is greeted as 
           heroes. Tardivat gives the villagers a French flag, inspiring 
           them to tear down the Nazi flag and replace it.

           -- Waving the stolen Nazi flag, the convoy rolls up to a 
           German outpost. Two German soldiers come out to greet them, 
           not realizing until too late that Nancy has a Molotov 
           cocktail. She tosses it as they speed past, inured to the 
           horrific sight of the flaming Germans in the rear-view.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS - COURCAIS - EVENING

           The convoy is parked on a hill just outside the ancient, 
           idyllic village, which is seemingly untouched by war, but --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        We should be cautious, Colonel. 

           He points to a pole that flies the Milice flag, denoting a 
           French paramilitary group that collaborated with the Nazis --

                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        Courcais has fallen to the Milice.
                                 NANCY
                        Goddamn traitors.
                             (to the Spanish Brothers)
                        Wait here. If we’re not back in an 
                        hour, get help. 

           Nancy hops out of the Kubelwagen and chambers a round in her 
           pistol, addressing Tardivat -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take a stroll.

           EXT. COURCAIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy and Tardivat walk through the quiet streets, arm in 
           arm, like an innocent couple. But as they pass the houses, 
           WARY RESIDENTS watch through shuttered windows, tense...

           EXT. TAVERN - COURCAIS - MOMENTS LATER

           They approach the village’s sole tavern -- 

                                 NANCY
                        This is the rendezvous.

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Only one exit.

                                 NANCY
                        Just a quiet drink, that’s all.

           He nods and they walk into --

           THE TAVERN

           Where FOUR MILICE PATRONS turn and stare, suspicious. Nancy 
           and Tardivat take a seat in the corner, talking low -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t see any gingers, our man must 
                        be running late--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Shit. Above the bar.

           Nancy glances over: Her wanted-poster hangs prominently -- 

                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go while we still can.

           Tardivat readies to leave -- but as Nancy looks around at the 
           Milice Patrons, glaring at her, she begins to seethe -- 
                                 TARDIVAT (CONT’D)
                        I said, let’s--

                                 NANCY
                        You know what? I could really use 
                        that drink.

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Colonel--

           Under the table, she hands her pistol to Tardivat -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Be ready--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Nancy--

           Ignoring his pleas, Nancy stands and walks over to the young 
           barmaid, ANNE (17), all eyes on them -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Vodka, dear.

           Anne pours Nancy a shot, which she drinks -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        And what’s your name?

                                 ANNE
                        Anne. 

           Anne refills, and Nancy drinks again -- 

                                 NANCY
                        I love that name. From “Anne of 
                        Green Gables”.

                                 ANNE
                        One of my favorites--

                                 NANCY
                        Where are my manners? Striking up a 
                        literary conversation without 
                        properly introducing myself.
                             (re: her wanted-poster)
                        I’m Nancy Wake.

           The Milice Patrons stir, tension building, as one of them 
           slowly reaches for his pistol --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D) 
                        Know why the Gestapo offer steep 
                        rewards for people like me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not to motivate the Germans, 
                        no. It’s for the French. Clever. 
                        Makes us wary of friends and 
                        neighbors. My husband, he’s rotting 
                        in prison because one of his 
                        spineless employees ratted him out. 
                        But here’s the thing: Collaborators 
                        won’t get to spend their reward. 
                        No, we’re going to find them -- 
                        every Vichy politician, every 
                        Milice thug -- and we’re going to 
                        hang them by their quisling necks--

           Enraged, the Milice Patron draws his pistol and aims -- but 
           Tardivat guns him down. Another Milice lunges at Nancy -- 

           So she grabs a knife off the bar and whips it, hitting him in 
           the throat. He dies badly, gurgling blood, just as -- 

           A REDHEADED MAN walks in, incongruously carefree when he sees 
           the carnage, breaking out in hysterical laughter -- 

                                 RENE (PRE-LAP)
                        My Christian name is Rene Dussaq.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Rene clears away a pile of hay, revealing a hidden door -- 

                                 RENE
                        But the Nazis bring hellfire.

           He opens the door, leading Nancy down into --

           A PITCH BLACK CELLAR

                                 RENE (CONT’D)
                        And in that hellfire, I am reborn.

           Lighting a lantern, he reveals many crates of bazookas --

                        Call me Bazooka.

           Off Bazooka’s crazed smile, we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN BÖHM’S OFFICE - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS (MONTLUCON) 
           - NIGHT

           Out the window, we glimpse the town of Montlucon, located in 
           the Auvergne. Hanging on the wall, we note a PhD in 
           Psychology from Cambridge and a Tibetan mandala. 
           On the floor, we find Captain Böhm meditating, seated in the 
           center of a Tibetan rug that features a swastika. 

           A knock on the door. Böhm opens his eyes as his Aide enters --

                                 AIDE
                        Just confirmed, she’s in Courcais.

           As Böhm rises from his meditative pose, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BARN - COURCAIS - NIGHT

           On the edge of town, shrouded in heavy mist. The Spanish 
           Brothers help Bazooka pile the bazooka-crates onto a trailer, 
           while Tardivat and Nancy stand guard with Bren Guns --

                                 NANCY
                        On the double, if you want to make 
                        it back to camp alive.

           Furious about what went down in the tavern, Tardivat pulls 
           Nancy aside -- 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Hell’s wrong with you? 

                                 NANCY
                        You told me it gets easier--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        That doesn’t mean seek it out--

                                 NANCY
                        I shouldn’t fear them, they should 
                        fear me--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Well, now they’re blocking the 
                        fucking road--
                             (re: Bazooka)
                        --and we’ve picked up a fucking 
                        lunatic--

           A clatter nearby, so they turn, on guard -- as Anne appears 
           through the mist, hands raised -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Christ, you followed us? Liable to 
                        get yourself--
                                 ANNE
                        Take me with you. I can cook, I can 
                        clean--

                                 NANCY
                        Anne, I can’t--

                                 ANNE
                        I want to fight, my family is 
                        Milice--

                                 BAZOOKA
                        Ah, we don’t know her--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        We don’t know you, either--

                                 ANNE
                        But I know a back way out of town.

           That lands. Nancy looks to Tardivat, who nods grudgingly -- 

                                 NANCY
                        We’ll call it my penance.

           INT. VW KUBELWAGEN / EXT. DIRT TRAIL - NIGHT

           The convoy drives out of town, headlights off, taking an 
           overgrown dirt trail running along a wooded stream. As they 
           round a bend --

           Three Panzers wait in the distance, blocking the main road. 
           But instead of heading that away, Anne points them to a 
           shallow part of the stream. They cross, home free, until --  

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (O.S.)
                        Nancy? It’s Captain Böhm, remember 
                        me? I certainly haven’t forgotten 
                        you. I know you’re out there...

           Nancy waves the convoy to a halt. She looks back through the 
           tenebrous mist to see the outline of a man clad in the 
           Gestapo’s black leather, standing atop a Panzer, talking 
           through a loudspeaker -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been a bad girl, Nancy. That 
                        ugly business in the tavern. Very 
                        foolish. As if you want to get 
                        caught. Poor thing, the guilt has 
                        driven you mad. I wonder how your 
                        men feel? Do they know that you’re 
                        leading them to reckless ruin, just 
                        as you did Henri?
           Tardivat shifts uncomfortably --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Turn yourself in. If you do, I’ll 
                        allow Henri to live. If not, your 
                        petty little rebellion will get him 
                        and the rest of your men killed. 

           On edge, Nancy begins to crack, her jaw clenching -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You will come to me. You will 
                        submit. Because we both know, what 
                        you really want, deep down in that 
                        self-loathing psyche-- What you 
                        crave in the marrow of your bones, 
                        Nancy, is a damn good spanking. 

           Enraged, Nancy draws her pistol, about to get out --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        NO.

           Tardivat yanks her back, driving away before she can take the 
           bait. Fading behind them, we hear the nightmarish slap of 
           Böhm repeatedly spanking his thigh...

           INT. VW KUBELWAGEN / EXT. AUVERGNE COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

           Tardivat drives. Nancy sits in shotgun, staring straight 
           ahead, rattled by Böhm’s morbid prophecy. Anne rides in back 
           with Bazooka, who pats Nancy on the shoulder -- 

                                 BAZOOKA
                        Cheer up. You’re a bit crazy, yes, 
                        but that’s a good thing. To quote 
                        Saint-Exupery, “Perfection is 
                        achieved, not when there is nothing 
                        more to add, but when there is 
                        nothing left to take away.” And so, 
                        a perfectly sane woman could never 
                        achieve true perfection--

           Bazooka unbuckles and stands, unsteady, allowing the wild 
           wind to whip through his long, red hair -- 

                                 BAZOOKA (CONT’D)
                        --because she’d never do this shit!

           But as Nancy watches Bazooka, perched so perilously, she 
           finds no solace in his off-kilter mien. 
           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - EVENING

           The convoy arrives back at camp, exhausted from travel, when 
           a frantic Fournier runs up to Nancy. 

           EXT. PRISON PIT - FOURNIER’S CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           A group of young Maquis recruits stand in a circle, jeering. 
           Nancy pushes through the frenzy, until she sees a drunken 
           Maquis pissing down into a freshly-dug hole -- 

           Where the bloodied, brutalized Denden huddles. As the pissing 
           Maquis turns to see Nancy, she punches him, sending him to 
           the ground, and everyone falls silent -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Where’s Gaspard?
                             (no answer)
                        Where is that sonofa--

                                 GASPARD (O.S.)
                        Yes, Colonel?

           Gaspard steps forward, parting the crowd --

                                 NANCY
                        Explain yourself.

                                 GASPARD
                        He was caught defiling a recruit, 
                        plied the poor boy with wine--

                                 NANCY
                        I’m sure it was mutual--

                                 GASPARD
                        A crime against man and God--

                                 NANCY
                             (re: the prison pit)
                        And this? What’s this? 

                                 GASPARD
                        My orders were to hold him safely 
                        for trial, nothing more--

                                 NANCY
                        Get him out--

                                 GASPARD
                        Colonel, he’s a perverse coward--
                                 NANCY
                        And you need him!
                             (to all the Maquis)
                        You’d have no radio, no food, no 
                        weapons. All of you brave men would 
                        be utterly helpless without this 
                        perverse coward.
                             (back to Gaspard)
                        So get him out. Now.

           Several of the Maquis grab a ladder and lower it, but --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        No.
                             (in Gaspard’s face)
                        You. 

           She’s daring him to challenge her... But Gaspard climbs down 
           into the hole to pull Denden out. 

           EXT. HOT SPRING - CANTAL PLATEAU - NIGHT

           Nancy helps Denden out of his soiled uniform -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Gaspard will pay for this--

                                 DENDEN
                        It’s nothing--

                                 NANCY
                        It’s an outrage--

           But Nancy stops mid-sentence, gasping when she sees that 
           Denden’s back is covered in old scars --

                                 DENDEN
                        It’s nothing.
                             (then)
                        Before we met, I toured Europe with 
                        a circus troupe and passed 
                        information for the Allies. The 
                        Gestapo got me in ‘42, held me for 
                        six long months.

                                 NANCY
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 DENDEN
                        Because I joined the SOE to prove 
                        that I’m more than my scars.

           Denden gets into the hot spring, washing off the filth -- 
                                 DENDEN (CONT’D)
                        Life keeps handing me buckets of 
                        shit -- so it’s either laugh, or 
                        cry. And if I cry, I’ll just be 
                        another queer coward. 

           Nancy flushes with abject shame --

                                 NANCY
                        Denden, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean 
                        what I said--

                                 DENDEN
                        Then why’d you say it?

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t really-- I don’t know--

                                 DENDEN
                        You’re not getting off that easy. 
                        Why’d you say it, Nancy?

           Nancy sits at the edge of the hot spring, looking down at her 
           soaking feet, unable to meet his gaze... Finally --

                                 NANCY
                        When I saw my wanted-poster, I-- I 
                        really had to face it: I hurt my 
                        husband, I drove us apart. And 
                        suddenly, all I could hear was my 
                        mother’s voice, growling at you...
                             (then, looking up)
                        I’m fucked up, aren’t I?

                                 DENDEN
                        Damn good thing you’ll always have 
                        me to keep you in check.

           And they embrace.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - LATER

           Nancy readies for bed, pulling out her silk nightgown. Anne 
           brushes her hair in front of the mirror and hits a tangle --

                                 NANCY
                        Let me, dear.

           Nancy takes the brush and works it through in long, even 
           strokes. In this light, Anne looks a bit like Arianne, the 
           girl Nancy took in on the steamer. They share a wordless 
           smile in the mirror, a moment of maternal affection...

           LATER - PRE-DAWN
           Nancy sleeps peacefully, while Anne lies awake next to her, 
           wearing Nancy’s silk nightgown. She gets up quietly, careful 
           not to disturb Nancy’s slumber.

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

           Anne kneads dough at a table, preparing to bake bread for 
           breakfast.

           LATER - MORNING

           Anne serves fresh bread to the Maquis, Gaspard at the head of 
           the table. An easy camaraderie, until Nancy approaches and 
           they go silent. Gaspard stands and salutes officiously --

                                 GASPARD
                        Colonel.

           All the other Maquis stand and salute. But there’s a mutinous 
           undercurrent, as the Maquis who got his nose broken glares 
           from behind two black eyes --

                                 NANCY
                             (to Anne)
                        I’ll take breakfast with my 
                        officers, please.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy reviews a map of southern France with Denden, Tardivat, 
           Fournier, Bazooka, and the Spanish Brothers. They’ve marked 
           where the German Army is fortified around Marseille --

                                 NANCY
                        We’ve been ordered to attack the 
                        German Army’s flank, drawing them 
                        off the beach and giving the Allies 
                        a clear landing at Marseille. 

                                 FOURNIER
                        It’s going to be a helluva fight, 
                        they have a dozen Panzers--

           A knock at the door, as Anne enters carrying a tray of fresh 
           bread. She sets it down before Nancy --

                                 NANCY
                        Thank you, dear.

           Anne hurries out, as everyone grabs a slice. Mateo devours 
           his, and Nancy nearly takes a bite, but stops --
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Right, the Panzers. We’ll need 
                        higher ground to stand any chance--

           Mateo starts coughing. Slowly at first, then it builds --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Have some water--

           Suddenly, he’s spewing blood, frothing at the mouth. Rodrigo 
           and Juan panic, trying to revive their brother, as he 
           clutches his throat in mortal agony --

           And Nancy drops the slice of bread in her hand, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

           Anne sprints through the forest, tripping, running again -- 
           but she comes to a sheer cliff, nearly tumbling over, as --

           Nancy appears behind her --

                                 NANCY
                        Wait. Just wait.

           Fearful, Anne steps even closer to the edge, inches away --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I won’t hurt you.

           Anne looks over the edge, as Nancy holds out her hand --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I promise.

           At last, Anne steps away, taking Nancy’s hand.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - LATER

           Nancy pours two cups of tea and gives one to Anne. Wary, she 
           waits for Nancy to take a sip, then sips hers --

                                 NANCY
                        My better angels whisper that women 
                        solve their problems by talking.

                                 ANNE
                        The-- The Germans, they have my 
                        brother-- He forced me, Nancy--
                                 NANCY
                        So it wasn’t the Milice? Captain 
                        Böhm sent you? 

                                 ANNE
                        He said he’d protect me--

                                 NANCY
                        Well, he sure as hell can’t. Only I 
                        can do that, Anne, so tell me 
                        everything. Where is he now?

                                 ANNE
                        Montlucon, I think? I-- I swear, 
                        Nancy, that’s all I know.

           Nancy studies Anne for a hard beat... Then --

                                 NANCY
                        You’re a fool. A goddamn idiot 
                        little girl--

                                 ANNE
                        I’m so sorry--

                                 NANCY
                        But I’m going to let you live to 
                        regret it.

                                 ANNE
                        Thank you, thank you so much--

                                 NANCY
                        Now, until this is over, I can’t 
                        just send you home--
                             (then, realizing)
                        Sonofabitch. He told you to pose as 
                        a runaway, didn’t he?

           Anne nods. Nancy processes, her visage darkening -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m a runaway, Anne. He-- Fuck. He 
                        knows this-- Knows me... 
                             (really hitting her)
                        Because he tortured my husband. 

           Anne starts shaking with fear, rattling her teacup --

                                 ANNE
                        I-- I didn’t know--

                                 NANCY
                        You used his suffering.
           The teacup rattle builds --

                                 ANNE
                        Nancy, have mercy--

           Nancy grabs Anne’s hand, holding the teacup steady -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Enough. Talking.

           PRE-LAP: Anne’s strident wailing...

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           Juan and Rodrigo drag a weeping, struggling Anne through the 
           forest, as Nancy follows. They come to a clearing --

                                 NANCY
                        Stop here. 

           Rodrigo and Juan let Anne go, as Nancy draws her pistol --

                                 ANNE
                        No, please--

                                 NANCY
                        Shutup.

           Nancy offers the pistol to Rodrigo -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        She murdered your brother.

           But he won’t take it --

                                 RODRIGO
                        She’s just a girl, Colonel--

                                 ANNE
                        You can let me go--

                                 NANCY
                        I said, shutup.

           Nancy offers the pistol to Juan, who also refuses --

                                 ANNE
                        You’ll never see me again--

                                 NANCY
                        SHUTUP!
           Nancy cocks the pistol, aiming at Anne, who ducks behind 
           Rodrigo for protection. And as Nancy lunges for her, we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. NANCY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

           Young Nancy cowers under the kitchen table, as Nancy’s Mother 
           lunges for her, and we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           Nancy grabs Anne by the hair, violently dragging her away 
           from Rodrigo, and we -- 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. NANCY'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

           Nancy’s Mother drags Young Nancy out from under the kitchen 
           table, and we -- 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           Nancy throws Anne to the ground, aiming her pistol -- 

                                 ANNE
                        Please. You-- You promised.

           Nancy bends down, smoothing Anne’s hair once more... 

           BANG -- she fires a bullet through Anne’s chest. Rodrigo and 
           Juan have to look away, but Nancy can’t. Eyes glazing over, 
           she gazes upon the slumped body as the red stain grows, like 
           a broken heart writ large...

           MOMENTS LATER

           Now alone, Nancy stumbles into a forest clearing, falls to 
           her knees -- and vomits. Verging on breakdown. But instead of 
           letting it all out --

                                 TARDIVAT (PRE-LAP)
                        This is suicide, Nancy.

           INT. THE OLD BUS - AFTERNOON

           Haggard and unhinged, Nancy prepares her gear for a raid. 
           Tardivat and Denden try to dissuade her, while Bazooka, 
           Fournier, Rodrigo, and Juan look on -- 
                                 TARDIVAT
                        You can’t just up and decide to 
                        raid a Gestapo Headquarters-- 

                                 DENDEN
                        Dragoon is in five days--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        You’re putting the mission at risk--

                                 DENDEN
                        Taking his bait--

                                 NANCY
                        Enough. Gentlemen, I appreciate 
                        your concern. You’re right to be 
                        wary, and you don’t have to come. 
                        But I will not-- 

           She locks a clip into her pistol -- 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        --can not let this stand.

           Bazooka is the first to step forward, undaunted -- 

                                 BAZOOKA
                        Fantastic, I’m in.

           Rodrigo and Juan step forward next. Then Fournier. Tardivat 
           sighs, heading for the door -- 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        I won’t help you destroy yourself.

           And he is gone. Nancy turns to her volunteers --

                                 NANCY
                        Thank you. Be ready in one hour.

           The men salute and exit, leaving only Denden -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        Nan--

                                 NANCY
                        If I don’t make it back, carry on.

           Denden nods, knowing he’s not going to change her mind. He 
           heads out, offering a last word -- 
                                 DENDEN
                        Make it back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - MONTLUCON - NIGHT

           BINOCULARS POV: A formidable stone edifice, located in the 
           center of Montlucon. GUARDS patrol the main gate --

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        They expect a frontal assault.

           BINOCULARS POV: We sweep the windows of the Headquarters, 
           focusing on the second-floor dining hall, where GESTAPO 
           OFFICERS are drinking with their dinner. We watch as one of 
           the Officers gropes a FRENCH SERVANT GIRL...

           INT. BROTHEL - LATER

           Nancy negotiates with a shrewd FRENCH MADAME and THREE 
           PROSTITUTES, while Fournier and Rodrigo guard the door --  

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll pay a thousand francs.

                                 FRENCH MADAME
                        How can you be so sure they won’t 
                        recognize you?

                                 NANCY
                        They’re not looking at your faces.

           The Madame looks to her Prostitutes, who nod --

                                 FRENCH MADAME
                        A thousand francs for each of us-- 

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t have four thousand--

                                 FRENCH MADAME
                        That’ll do just fine.

           She points to Nancy’s wedding ring. Nancy hesitates a 
           moment... Then slides it off and gives it to the Madame.

           EXT. SERVANT’S ENTRANCE - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Now made-up, Nancy approaches with two of the Prostitutes. 
           They’re met by a PAIR OF GUARDS. One of them pats down Nancy, 
           finding only the vial of perfume in her pocket -- 
                                 GUARD
                        Usual girl’s fatter.

                                 PROSTITUTE
                        Sophie’s sick. From your men.

           The Guard looks at the wanted-poster sketch of Nancy, in 
           military attire, then at Nancy herself, tension building...

                                 PROSTITUTE (CONT’D)
                        We charge by the hour.

           The Guard relents and waves them inside. Nancy makes sure to 
           take her vial of perfume, and we -- 

                                                              MATCH TO:

           INT. DINING HALL - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy furtively pours the vial into fresh mugs of beer -- 
           which she then serves to the FIVE DRUNK GESTAPO OFFICERS, who 
           are enjoying the company of the Prostitutes. As they begin to 
           drink their beers --

           We PULL OUT to --

           A NEARBY ROOFTOP

           Where Fournier watches through his sniper-scope. He raises a 
           small mirror, reflecting the moonlight, as --

           We PULL OUT to --

           THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN

           Where Bazooka spots the signal through his binoculars. He is 
           at the wheel of a Kubelwagen, with Rodrigo and Juan riding in 
           back. They light Molotov cocktails. 

           INT. DINING HALL - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Back inside, Nancy watches as the Gestapo Officer who groped 
           her begins to cough. Slowly at first, his drunk friends 
           laughing at him -- but they start coughing, too. Soon, all 
           five Gestapo Officers are hacking uncontrollably, spewing 
           blood. Poisoned. 

           And now, we SWITCH TO --

           NANCY’S CRAZED POV:

           Adrenaline pumping, we grab the pistol and knife off a dying 
           Gestapo Officer. We glance out the window, as -- 
           IN THE STREET BELOW

           We glimpse the Kubelwagen as it speeds past the main gate. 
           Rodrigo tosses a Molotov cocktail, engulfing a guard station 
           in flames, creating a diversion, as -- 

           BACK IN THE DINING HALL

           Alarms start blaring, as we race into the --

           HALLWAY

           And we dive behind a column, just as SIX GUARDS run past, 
           heading down the stairs, en route to provide backup. Once 
           they’re gone, we run to a hallway-door and open it --

           AN EMPTY CLOSET

           We try another door -- locked. We kick it open, revealing --

           A BEDROOM

           Where a HALF-CLOTHED GESTAPO is cowering in bed with a FRENCH 
           GIRL. He holds her in front of him like a human-shield -- 

           But we shoot anyway, hitting him in the temple. The French 
           Girl screams, spattered with blood, as we go --

           BACK INTO THE HALLWAY

           Explosions echo outside and smoke wafts in. Breath heaving, 
           we sprint onward, rounding a corner --

           And we run into a GUARD. We raise our pistol, but he grabs 
           our hand. We slash our knife, but he grabs our other hand --

           Berserk insanity, as we smash our head into him, breaking his 
           nose, blood in our eyes --

           Then we yank our pistol up under his chin and pull the 
           trigger, taking off his jaw --

           And we run down the hall, finding a door at the end, which 
           leads us into --

           CAPTAIN BÖHM’S OFFICE

           Where his Aide carries a box out, preparing a retreat. When 
           he sees us, he drops the box, raising his hands --

           But we shoot him in the chest and he falls. We close the 
           heavy metal door behind us and lock it, as we SWITCH --

           OUT OF NANCY’S POV:
           Revealing that she’s covered in blood and bruises, her 
           darkest self made visible, as she at last comes face-to-face 
           with the unarmed Captain Böhm -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        I knew you’d come--

           She pistol-whips Böhm, sending him to the floor, where the 
           Aide’s blood is pooling on the Tibetan swastika rug -- 

                                 NANCY
                        Is my husband still alive?

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Why kill a man who’s helping me? 

                                 NANCY
                        Bullshit--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        He’s told so me much about you--

                                 NANCY
                        Bullshit. Anyone would break under 
                        torture--

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        --he feels used. Abandoned. Did you 
                        ever really love him, Nancy?

           Nancy begins to shake. Böhm can see that he is breaking her 
           down, cutting deep, as he points to the swastika rug -- 

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what this symbol means? 
                        It’s Tibetan in origin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STAIRWELL - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Bazooka charges down the hall toward Böhm’s office, but a 
           GUARD leaps out from behind a column --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (V.O.)
                        It represents the sun.

           And Bazooka plunges a blade into his gut, howling madly as 
           viscera spills out, and we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ROOFTOP - MONTLUCON - CONTINUOUS

           Fournier aims through his scope, following a GUARD from 
           window to window in the Gestapo Headquarters, leading him --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (V.O.)
                        The triumph of the will.

           He fires, hitting the Guard just as he appears in the next 
           window, a hideous mist of bone and blood, and we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - MONTLUCON - CONTINUOUS

           The brutal epitome of Masculine violence. Amidst the flaming 
           chaos out front, Juan gets shot dead by a GUARD. Screaming 
           with fraternal bloodlust, Rodrigo pounces, clubbing the man 
           again and again, caving in his face --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (V.O.)
                        The Supreme Masculine.

           Finally, Rodrigo snaps the Guard’s neck, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN BÖHM’S OFFICE - GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Nancy looms over Böhm, who is splayed on the swastika --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        The Fuhrer calls Germany the 
                        Fatherland. We all strive to please 
                        Him. And how old were you, when 
                        father left? Five, was it--

           She shoots Böhm in the leg, making him wail --

                                 NANCY
                        Is Henri alive?!

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        Yes! I can give him back to you.

           A firefight reverberates in the hallway, as boots slam 
           against the metal door, and we SWITCH BACK TO --

           NANCY’S POV:

           Our pulse races, the sound of our breath drowning out the 
           chaos, our consciousness flickering, overwhelmed as we 
           consider his offer --
                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        I can give him back, Nancy--

           But a white-hot explosion sends us tumbling into --

           MUTED FLASHES FROM NANCY’S POV:

           -- Bazooka drags us from the destroyed office, beating out 
           the flames on our dress.

           -- Bazooka carries us over his shoulder, down a hallway, but 
           we glimpse a Guard behind him, about to shoot us -- until 
           he’s knifed in the back by one of the Prostitutes.

           -- Fournier and Rodrigo meet us at the back entrance and help 
           throw us into a Kubelwagen. 

           -- The last thing we glimpse as we speed up into the 
           foothills is the outline of Luftwaffe bombers flying far 
           overhead, bound inexorably for the Cantal plateau.

           BLACKNESS.

           EXT. FOURNIER’S CAMP - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAWN

           Nancy awakens into hell. Acrid smoke engulfs the Kubelwagen 
           as they pull into camp --

           Which has been leveled by a bombing raid. Trees flattened, 
           fires still burning, corpses laying curled in agony. 

           Everyone is dumbstruck. Nancy stumbles out, trying to find 
           her bearings, soon covered in black ash. Up ahead, in the 
           distance, she discerns a form -- 

           It’s Denden, his face a mask of soot. He tries to piece 
           together what little is left of the destroyed radio --

                                 GASPARD (PRE-LAP)
                        This is your fault.

           EXT. WATERFALL CAVES - CANTAL PLATEAU - MORNING

           The remaining Maquis -- ROUGHLY 200 MEN -- have retreated to 
           the safety of the caves above a waterfall. Gaspard has 
           assumed command. He stands on a boulder, looking down upon --

           Nancy. She still has the loyalty of Denden, Tardivat, 
           Fournier, Rodrigo, and Bazooka, who stand with her --

                                 GASPARD
                        That little cunt spy you coddled? 
                        She gave up our position--
                                 NANCY
                        I made a mistake--

                                 GASPARD
                        You should’ve been here! Thirty 
                        dead, two hundred more deserted--

                                 NANCY
                        A fucking travesty. I’m nothing, 
                        I’m shit. But it doesn’t change the 
                        fact that we only have four days to 
                        regroup--

                                 GASPARD
                        How? Without your rich men in 
                        London, you have nothing. No food, 
                        no guns -- and no soldiers.

                                 NANCY
                             (to all the Maquis)
                        Is that true? All of you?

           In response, Gaspard simply turns his back on Nancy -- and 
           the other Maquis follow suit. A vote of no-confidence.

           EXT. THE OLD BUS - HOT SPRING - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy picks through the bombed-out wreckage of her old home, 
           salvaging scraps of fabric. Tardivat and Denden watch as her 
           balance gives out, and Denden grabs her -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        You need rest--

                                 NANCY
                        I need a radio, I can get it from 
                        the SOE man in Saint-Armand-- 

                                 TARDIVAT
                        That’s thirty-five kilometers-- 

                                 NANCY
                        Twenty over the mountains--

                                 TARDIVAT
                        Two of the Kubelwagens are 
                        destroyed, the third has no fuel--

                                 NANCY
                        So get me a bicycle-- 

                                 DENDEN
                        Slow down, Nan--
                                 NANCY
                        Look, I know I’ve been a damn fool, 
                        but this isn’t foolish. I fucked it 
                        up, I alone have to fix it.

           Denden and Tardivat exchange a look: She’s dead-set on this --

                                 DENDEN
                        I’ll find a bike. 

           He runs off on a search, leaving Tardivat, in whose hands 
           Nancy shoves her scraps of fabric -- 

                                 NANCY
                        How fast can you make a new dress?

           LATER - AFTERNOON

           Nancy sits on a rickety bicycle, disguised in a matronly 
           dress and bonnet made from the salvaged fabric. Denden and 
           Tardivat are with her --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        What if the Germans stop you?

                                 NANCY
                        You still don’t understand: They 
                        don’t see me.
                             (re: her dress)
                        They see a helpless widow.

           Tardivat takes off his crucifix necklace and gives it to 
           Nancy. She tries to refuse, but --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        War widows need God, trust me.

           Nancy grudgingly dons the necklace -- then sets off pedaling 
           on her long journey...

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -- Nancy pedals over rocky ground, tumbling and gouging her 
           leg. But she gets up, gets back on, and keeps going.

           -- Nancy loses her brakes down a hill and has to use her feet 
           to slow, rubbing them raw. 

           -- Nancy hides under a bridge, checking her saddle-sores -- 
           while a haggard German Army unit marches overhead. 

           -- As the sun sets, Nancy approaches the sleepy hamlet of 
           Saint-Armand, where Nazi flags still fly.
           EXT. COTTAGE - SAINT-ARMAND - NIGHT

           Bloody sores on her feet, Nancy pedals up. She approaches the 
           front door, which has a Nazi flag hanging above it, and 
           cautiously knocks. No answer. 

           She knocks again -- still nothing. 

           She’s about to knock a third time, when an OLD MAN peeks from 
           behind a curtain, motioning her around to --

           THE SIDE DOOR

           Which he cracks open, but won’t allow Nancy inside --

                                 NANCY
                        I’m looking for a friend-- 

                                 OLD MAN
                        He had to flee. Try the barkeep in 
                        Chateauroux.

           He tries to close the door, but she holds it open --

                                 NANCY
                        That’s a hundred-fifty kilometers--

           Down the street, the Old Man spots a GERMAN PATROL coming, so 
           he pushes Nancy back and slams the door in her face.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS - SAINT-ARMAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy pedals along the road out of town, cresting a hill to 
           see a German checkpoint just ahead. Too late to turn back, so 
           she pedals to --

           THE CHECKPOINT

           Where she sees her wanted-poster hanging prominently. One of 
           the GUARDS approaches, shining a lantern on her --

                                 GUARD
                        Papers?

                                 NANCY
                        I couldn’t get them in time. My 
                        son, he’s sick in Chateauroux.

           The Guard inspects her face, tension building... So Nancy 
           digs her bloody foot into her pedal, summoning a few tears --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        He’s very sick--
           Not wanting to deal with a sobbing mother, he waves her on --

                                 GUARD
                        You’ll never make it on that bike.

           CONTINUE MONTAGE:

           -- Nancy struggles in darkness over difficult terrain. She 
           has to get off and push, slipping on a rock and re-opening 
           the gash on her knee. 

           -- Nancy pedals through dawn rain, getting splashed by a farm 
           truck as it rolls by. 

           -- Eyelids heavy, Nancy slaps herself to stay awake as she 
           pedals onward, saddle-sores now bleeding through her dress.

           -- Bloody and bedraggled, Nancy passes a sign that says: 
           “Chateauroux - 16 Kilometers”. 

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS - CHATEAUROUX - AFTERNOON

           Nancy pedals up, half-dead and hoping to rest -- but she sees 
           that the town is crawling with GERMAN PATROLS. She rides 
           through a back alley, avoiding the main road. 

           EXT. TAVERN - CHATEAUROUX - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy pedals up and stops, her feet covered in sores, her 
           legs barely able to walk under the stress, as she enters --

           THE TAVERN

           Where a few PATRONS sip wine. They turn and look at Nancy, 
           suspicious. She sees her wanted-poster, hanging above the 
           bar. She takes a risk and approaches the BARKEEP --

                                 NANCY
                        A friend in Saint-Armand said you 
                        pour a fine wine.

           He nods and pours her a glass, motioning her around back...

           EXT. TAVERN - CHATEAUROUX - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy limps around and knocks on the back door. When it 
           opens, the Barkeep shoves a shotgun in her face -- 

                                 BARKEEP
                        I don’t know you.

                                 NANCY
                        The wanted-poster above your bar. 
           Now seeing through the disguise, he ushers her into --

           THE BACK STAIRS

           And climbs them with ease. But Nancy is daunted by this 
           simple task, each step agony, as she enters --

           THE RADIO ROOM

           A cramped space tucked above the bar, with an SOE radio in 
           one corner and a cot in the other -- 

                                 BARKEEP
                        Rest, you need it. 

           Nancy sits down on the cot, a wave of relief washing over 
           her. The Barkeep sits before the radio, turning it on --

                                 BARKEEP (CONT’D)
                        What do you want the message to say--

           Suddenly, there’s shouting downstairs. The Barkeep runs to 
           the window -- where he sees GESTAPO raiding the tavern --

           So he yanks Nancy back to her raw, bloody feet. In a blur, 
           she helps him load the radio into a pack and strap its 
           immense weight to her weary back. They hurry to the stairs --

           But THREE GESTAPO charge up. The Barkeep slams the door, 
           pushing his weight against it, pointing Nancy to the window --

           And she hurries over, climbing onto the ledge, a fifteen foot 
           drop with a heavy pack on her back. She wavers, just as 
           bullets pierce through the door -- 

           And Nancy tumbles out badly, slamming to --

           THE HARD GROUND

           Twisting her ankle, but no time to feel anything. She jumps 
           on her bike and rides toward the woods, surging with the last 
           of her adrenaline, Gestapo in pursuit, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COLONEL BUCKMASTER’S OFFICE - 64 BAKER STREET - EVENING

           Buckmaster and Gielgud review a map of southern France, which 
           displays placements of Allied Navy along the Mediterranean 
           coast. Operation Dragoon is imminent --
                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Allies are set to begin shelling 
                        the coast at anytime, sir. All of 
                        our remaining teams are in place--

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Still no word from Captain Wake?

                                 MAJOR GIELGUD
                        Afraid not, sir.

                                 COLONEL BUCKMASTER
                        Where the bloody hell is she?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - AUVERGNE COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Dogs barking in the distance, Nancy pedals for dear life, 
           straining through intense pain, pack weighing her down --

           And the dogs are getting closer. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - AUVERGNE COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Spotlights and dogs close behind, Nancy pedals up to a 
           farmhouse. She pounds on the door and a light comes on. A 
           French woman, CELESTE, cracks it open, and the moment she 
           sees Nancy, she knows exactly what it’s about --

                                 CELESTE
                        I’m sorry, I can’t--

                                 NANCY
                        Please.

           The barking grows louder, the spotlights visibly nearing 
           through the forest. Celeste tries to close the door --

           But Nancy wedges it open with her bloody, swollen foot. Her 
           eyes dart around, finding the Mother Mary painting hanging 
           near the doorway. She reveals her crucifix necklace --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        One Christian to another.

           Celeste stares at the crucifix, weighing her morals...

           INT. CELLAR - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy hides behind the stairwell, and as boots tromp 
           overhead, she can hear the voice of -- 
                                 GESTAPO (O.S.)
                        We’re looking for a woman. A very 
                        dangerous woman.  

                                 CELESTE (O.S.)
                        I have nothing to hide--

                                 GESTAPO (O.S.)
                        Then you won’t mind if we search. 

           The cellar door opens. Nancy huddles in the darkness behind 
           the stairwell, watching as a GESTAPO climbs down, holding a 
           lantern. Celeste follows him, as -- 

           He shines the light around the earthen-walled room, Nancy 
           trying to make herself as small as possible in the shadows, 
           holding her breath. He’s about to reveal her, when --

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mama?

           The form of a LITTLE GIRL appears at the cellar door --

                                 CELESTE
                        It’s fine, dear, go back to bed. 
                             (to Gestapo)
                        Time to leave, you’re scaring my 
                        daughter. 
                             (he lingers)
                        Unless you think a four-year-old is 
                        a dangerous woman?

           The Gestapo takes one last look around, then heads upstairs -- 
           and Nancy collapses in relief. 

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - LATER

           A ravenous Nancy devours bread and drinks water, while 
           Celeste watches -- 

                                 CELESTE
                        Who are you, dangerous woman?

           Nancy tries to speak through her full mouth, but --

                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Nevermind, it’s best I don’t know. 
                        I just hope you’re giving as good 
                        as you’re obviously getting--

           A creak in the floorboards, and they whip around to see that 
           it’s only Celeste’s daughter again, holding her teddy bear --
                                 CELESTE (CONT’D)
                        Back to bed this instant--

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        But I’m not tired--

                                 CELESTE
                             (harsh)
                        To bed.

           The Little Girl throws down her teddy bear and storms back to 
           bed, slamming the door as she goes --

                                 NANCY
                        Dangerous woman, indeed.

           Celeste picks up the teddy bear, brushing it off --

                                 CELESTE
                        She thinks I’m a tyrant, but I’m 
                        just trying to survive.

           This hits Nancy deep inside, resonating with her own fraught 
           childhood with her mother, tears welling --

           But she still won’t let herself cry.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - AUVERGNE COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

           Nancy straps on her cumbersome pack and gets back on her 
           bike, but the sores covering her legs are excruciating. 
           Celeste rips off a piece of her dress and hands it to Nancy --

                                 CELESTE
                        A trick I learned in labor: Bite 
                        this for the pain. 

                                 NANCY
                        Thank you.

           Celeste turns to head inside, but before she’s gone --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Celeste?
                             (she turns back)
                        You’re a good mother.

           Celeste smiles, and Nancy pedals away...

           CONTINUE MONTAGE:

           -- Biting the fabric, blood streaming down her legs, Nancy 
           pedals over rocky terrain, every inch a lifetime of pain. 
           -- Delirious, Nancy pedals under the glaring mid-day sun, as 
           if the celestial symbol of the Fatherland beats down upon her 
           with personal menace. She passes a sign, which she can barely 
           read: “Cantal Mountains - 84 Kilometers”. 

           -- Nancy slumps behind a boulder, as a Gestapo patrol rolls 
           by. The flesh on her legs is now totally raw. Everything has 
           been stripped away. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           Nancy’s wheel hits a gnarled root and she flips off the 
           bicycle, slamming to the ground. But unlike the times before, 
           she doesn’t get up. She lies here, trembling, as we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. NANCY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           Nancy’s original wound: Young Nancy stands on the front 
           porch, tears in her eyes, holding her FATHER tight --

                                 FATHER
                        Big girls don’t cry, Nancy.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           For the first time in our story, tears stream down Nancy’s 
           face, powerful sobs wracking her entire body. Baring her 
           soul. A catharsis far deeper than physical pain, as we --

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. NANCY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           Nancy’s Father gets into a waiting taxi. As it pulls away --

                                 FATHER
                        Mind your mother now.

           And he recedes into the hazy distance, disappearing from 
           Nancy’s life forever, as we -- 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           Nancy cries for everything she’s lost -- and we begin to 
           wonder if she’s ever going to get back up, as we -- 

                                                              FLASH TO:
           INT. NANCY'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           Young Nancy finds her Mother sitting at the kitchen table, 
           clutching a Bible and crying. In this new light, she’s not a 
           menacing monster -- but rather, an abandoned woman with six 
           children, just trying to survive.

           Blessed with this measure of understanding, and thus 
           forgiveness, we -- 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           Nancy’s teary eyes and find the full moon above, cradling her 
           in the mysterious grace of its supernal womb...

           And she picks herself up again.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. WATERFALL CAVES - CANTAL PLATEAU - DAY

           Gaspard and his Maquis sit around the fire, eating their 
           scant lunch. Then a faint sound, a rhythmic squeaking in the 
           distance, as if from a mouse...

           And Nancy pedals into camp, strangely placid, driven by a 
           power infinitely greater than herself. A hushed awe falls 
           over the men as they gaze upon the indomitable woman who just 
           biked 400 rugged kilometers in less than three days.

           Denden rushes up to help -- but Nancy won’t allow it. She 
           climbs off the bike, removes her pack and hands it to him --

           And she collapses.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           Nancy awakens in a dark cave. Her clothes are fresh, her 
           wounds dressed. She hears the echoing of excited voices. She 
           stands, heading out to the --

           MOUTH OF THE CAVE

           Where the Maquis are celebrating around a roaring fire, music 
           playing on the new SOE radio. Denden sees her, elated --

                                 DENDEN
                        She is risen!

           Denden tries to start dancing with her, but --
                                 NANCY
                        Easy, my legs are still marzipan. 
                        How long have I been out?

                                 DENDEN
                        Thirty hours or so--

                                 NANCY
                        What? What are you fools doing, we 
                        have a--

                                 DENDEN
                        Dragoon’s done, Nan. They didn’t 
                        need us. As soon as the shelling 
                        began, the krauts tucked tail and 
                        ran. It’s a full retreat.

           Nancy looks around at all the celebrating Maquis --

                                 NANCY
                        So... it’s over?

           A drunken Gaspard approaches, kissing her on both cheeks, 
           ready to make peace --

                                 GASPARD
                        It’s over!

           Gaspard starts dancing with her around the fire.

           LATER - DAWN

           Nancy awakens to find everyone sleeping off last night’s 
           victory celebration. Everyone except Denden, who’s huddled 
           over the new radio, furiously transcribing a message, as --  

           Nancy walks over, and he looks up from his work, the gravest 
           we’ve ever seen him --

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP)
                        It’s not over.

           LATER - MORNING 

           The Maquis pack up camp, preparing to go home -- but Nancy 
           speaks with Fournier, Bazooka, Denden, and Gaspard --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        We have one more sacrifice to make. 
                        The Germans are in full retreat, 
                        yes, but their aim is to get back 
                        to the Fatherland, dig in, and 
                        prolong the war indefinitely.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        That could mean millions more lives 
                        lost. So we’ve been called upon to 
                        stop them. The SOE wants us to hold 
                        two battalions at Cosne-d’Allier--

                                 GASPARD
                        That’s at least five thousand 
                        soldiers--

                                 NANCY
                        Please, don’t interrupt me, Major--

                                 GASPARD
                        It’s General.
                             (off her confusion)
                        I really didn’t want to get into 
                        this with you, but... When you were 
                        gone, I received word: I’ve been 
                        promoted to General of the Auvergne 
                        by de Gaulle, and from our 
                        perspective, the war is over. I’m 
                        not sending anymore Frenchmen to be 
                        cannon-fodder for your King.

           Nancy gives Gaspard a hard glare... Then pushes past him and 
           wordlessly climbs to the top of --

           THE BOULDER

           Where she stands above all the Maquis. She pulls out her 
           pistol and fires into the air --

                                 NANCY
                        Your General says you’re going 
                        home. After all the Germans have 
                        done to you, you’re going to let 
                        them scuttle off without so much as 
                        a kick in the ass.

           The Maquis who got his nose broken by Nancy pipes up --

                                 MAQUIS
                        Haven’t seen my wife in six months.

           A second Maquis joins him --

                                 MAQUIS 2
                        My boy was killed and I’ve yet to 
                        visit his grave.

           Other Maquis nod in agreement --
                                 NANCY
                        You think I don’t want to see my 
                        loved ones? Marseille is liberated, 
                        I could quit. But we have a duty--

                                 GASPARD
                        There is no “we” anymore, Colonel. 
                        You’re finished, go home.

           The Maquis go back to packing, but Nancy calls out --

                                 NANCY
                        Wait. What General Gaspard fails to 
                        realize is that he’s superseded by 
                        the Field Marshal of France--

                                 GASPARD
                        Outrageous, there is no--

                                 NANCY
                        There is and it’s me. I declare 
                        myself Field Marshal Nancy Wake-- 

                                 GASPARD
                        Outrageous--

                                 NANCY
                        Yes! Yes, it’s outrageous, all of 
                        it -- ranks, medals, flags. The 
                        whole fucking war’s outrageous. The 
                        only true authority I claim is that 
                        I love France. How do you think I 
                        rode that goddamn bicycle four 
                        hundred kilometers? She sustained 
                        me. Just as She sustains you. So 
                        now we have a choice, each of us. A 
                        moral reckoning.

           Nancy points to the Maquis, calling them out, as we --

           A French flag now hangs above the Gestapo Headquarters that 
           Nancy raided. She stands under it, speaking passionately to 
           the TOWNSPEOPLE, hoping to recruit more fighters -- 
                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        We can let the Brits and Yankees 
                        fight for us -- but that will only 
                        confirm what the world already 
                        believes: France is weak.

                        lives they take -- we hold our

           Nancy stands in the town square, where a massive cathedral

                                 NANCY
                        Most of all, we send a message so 
                        loud, it echoes through history: 
                        Don’t fuck with Mother France -- 
                        because she’s one mean bitch!

           Reveal that she’s standing before ROUGHLY 1000 MAQUIS, who 
           are in formation in the town square. They raise their guns 
           and cheer wildly --

           And even General Gaspard gives Nancy a respectful nod.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CHATEAU - NIGHT

           An ancient stone edifice, complete with tapestries and fine 
           woodwork. Nancy gazes out the window at the town square 
           below, which has been evacuated. There are sandbag 
           fortifications setup to block the main road, which leads to 
           the bridge just beyond.

                        Nerves?

           She turns to see Denden in the doorway --

                                 NANCY
                        Bed’s too goddamn soft.

                        I’m sure the owner won’t mind if we

                                 NANCY
                        No. I want to feel this.

                        Besides, shouldn’t you be searching

           silence, gazing out the window, as we FADE TO --

           SERENE DARKNESS.

           PRE-LAP: The ominous tromping of thousands of heavy boots...
           EXT. FORESTED OUTSKIRTS - COSNE-D’ALLIER - DAWN

           An amalgam of two battered German Battalions march along the 
           narrow road into town, which is lined by thick forests on 
           either side. We glimpse a long cavalcade of roughly 5,500 
           HAGGARD SOLDIERS, five dilapidated Panzers, and a few dozen 
           beat-up Kubelwagens --

           One of which carries Captain Böhm, who carries a crutch since 
           Nancy shot him in the leg. He’s riding with the GERMAN MAJOR 
           GENERAL in command. Suddenly --

           BANG -- a nearby soldier gets taken out by a sniper-shot -- 
           BANG-BANG -- two more fall, as --

           UP ON A FORESTED RIDGE

           Fournier takes shots, drawing German fire. A Panzer turret 
           cranks around toward him, as --

           IN THE FOREST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD

           A camouflaged Bazooka fires his namesake --

           EXPLODING THE FIRST PANZER

           Flaming chaos in the German ranks, as --

           IN BÖHM’S KUBELWAGEN

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM

                        The Allies are less than a day 
                        behind us. We have to take the 
                        bridge before they blow it.
                             (calling out)
                        FULL FORWARD!

           And the German Soldiers rush toward the town square, as -- 

           We PULL OUT to --

           THE CATHEDRAL BELLTOWER

           Where Denden watches through binoculars. He sees the German 
           forces incoming, so he holds up a red flag, signaling to --

           NANCY’S SANDBAG FORTIFICATION
           Down in the town square, where she waits with 100 MAQUIS. 
           Across from her, Tardivat and another 100 MAQUIS also wait 
           behind sandbags. Together, they guard the main road that 
           leads to the bridge, which is visible in the distance, as --

           Bazooka sprints into the town square, diving for cover behind 
           Nancy’s fortifications -- 

                                 NANCY
                        INCOMING--

           THE FIRST WAVE OF GERMAN SOLDIERS HITS 

           They flood the town square, getting cut down by the Maquis, 
           staining the cobblestones red, until --

           A PANZER ROLLS IN

           And fires on Tardivat’s sandbags, vaulting Maquis into the 
           air. Using the Panzer for cover, another wave of Germans 
           crash in, advancing toward --

           NANCY’S SANDBAG FORTIFICATION

           Where she and her men endure heavy fire, a Panzer bearing 
           down. Bazooka launches a shell -- but it bounces off the 
           armor and explodes just overhead, shrapnel raining down, as -- 

           In the chaos, Rodrigo sees a German Soldier aiming directly 
           for Nancy -- so he dives in front of her, taking a shot in 
           the chest, as --

           He reaches out, gurgling blood, and Nancy takes his hand, 
           comforting him as he dies... She looks at his body, then at 
           the overpowering waves of Germans advancing all around, 
           slaughtering her men --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        FALL BACK!

           Her Maquis lay cover-fire as they scatter from the town 
           square, and we go to -- 

           THE CATHEDRAL BELLTOWER

           Where Denden sees Nancy’s retreat and holds up a yellow flag, 
           which is visible down in -- 

           TARDIVAT’S SANDBAG FORTIFICATION

           Where Tardivat suffers heavy loses, men falling all around, a 
           second Panzer looming. Upon seeing the signal, he calls out --
                                 TARDIVAT
                        FALL BACK!

           And his Maquis retreat as well, allowing the Germans into the 
           square, as we --

           We sweep along the Gothic bridge, revealing packs of C-4 
           rigged beneath every arch, connected to a detonator at --

           THE FRONT OF THE BRIDGE

           Where Gaspard waits with another 100 MAQUIS, fortified behind 
           sandbags, the last line of defense, vastly overmatched as --

           Two Panzers roll straight for them, leading a charge of 
           roughly 200 German Soldiers, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDE DOOR - CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Brutal bedlam as Maquis exchange fire with German Soldiers, 
           more and more enemy forces charging into the square with each 
           passing second, as --

           Nancy runs up to a side door. She’s about to head in -- but a 
           German Soldier pounces from behind, slamming her head into 
           the wall. He pulls his pistol and fires --

           But it jams, as Nancy draws her knife and runs him through. 
           She opens the side door and ducks into the cathedral, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT OF THE BRIDGE - COSNE-D’ALLIER - CONTINUOUS

           Gaspard and his Maquis open fire on the Panzers, but the 
           bullets bounce off --

           And the Panzers return fire, demolishing the fortifications, 
           throwing up sand and blood --

           So Gaspard grabs the detonator and plunges it down -- but 
           nothing happens. He presses the detonator again -- nothing --

                                 GASPARD
                        Shit-- 

           And we PULL OUT to --
           BÖHM’S KUBELWAGEN

           Parked on a nearby hilltop, where the German Major General is 
           watching through binoculars --

                                 GERMAN MAJOR GENERAL
                        Their explosives failed.

           Ignoring Böhm, the Major General turns to his RADIO MAN --

                        RETREAT!

           His Maquis retreat over the bridge, and we --

           Bullets zipping past, the Maquis next to Gaspard gets shot

           Panzers and 200 German Soldiers in pursuit, as we --

           Tardivat takes a bullet in the shoulder but keeps firing, 
           cornered behind a pile of rubble, overwhelmed by the Germans, 
           who have now completely overtaken the town square, as we --

           Three more of Gaspard’s Maquis fall, dropping like flies, as

           EXT. BELLTOWER - CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Nancy watches it all from high above. The Germans have almost 
           taken the bridge. The town square is awash in German 
           Soldiers. All appears to be lost... 

           But Nancy knows that perceived weakness can be her greatest 
           strength, as --

           She rings the churchbell, a clarion call transcending the 
           horrific thrum of war, as we --

           Nancy’s plan reveals itself, as the 700 MAQUIS we haven’t yet

           Hearing the bells, Gaspard grabs a pack hidden in the bushes 
           and pulls out a second detonator, plunging it down as --
           We PULL OUT to --

           THE FULL BRIDGE

           The first C-4 explodes from beneath the center arch, throwing 
           ancient stones and dust, setting off calamitous tidal waves 
           in both directions -- 

           Hurling the two Panzers and 200 German Soldiers into the 
           river, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BELLTOWER - CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Nancy watches as all 700 Maquis unleash death from above, 
           firing from the rooftops, raining down upon the German 
           Soldiers trapped in the town square, and -- 

           Nancy grabs a bazooka of her own, prepared to fire --

                                 DENDEN
                        Let me.

           She hands the bazooka to Denden. He lifts the hulking weapon 
           onto his shoulder, aims awkwardly --

           And fires a round that incinerates a Kubelwagen, arcing 
           flames. He lets out a primal yell, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CHATEAU - CONTINUOUS

           Fournier leads a team of MAQUIS SNIPERS, picking off Germans 
           with lethal efficiency, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT OF THE BRIDGE - COSNE-D’ALLIER - CONTINUOUS

           300 GERMAN SOLDIERS and the two remaining Panzers reel from 
           the destruction of the bridge, trying to regroup, but --

           BOOM -- a Panzer explodes, throwing off hot metal, hit by a 
           shell fired from --

           A NEARBY ROOFTOP

           Where a laughing Bazooka and Tardivat are aiming bazookas, 
           along with 50 MORE MAQUIS, as we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BELLTOWER - CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Nancy watches her Maquis decimate the Germans in the town 
           square, dead bodies piling up, men dying all around -- 

           Then Nancy sees the first German throw down his gun and put 
           his hands up in surrender. Then another, and another, a wave 
           of defeated men --

           And Nancy stops the churchbell’s ringing.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. CATTLE FARM - COSNE-D’ALLIER OUTSKIRTS - EVENING

           The surviving Germans -- roughly 4000 MEN -- have been lined 
           up by the Maquis. They’re being searched, then corralled in a 
           fenced-in field. Nancy surveys the proceedings, her gaze 
           falling upon a familiar face --

           Captain Böhm.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Unable to stand on his injured leg, Böhm sits in the muck by 
           the fence-line. Nancy approaches, pistol in hand. The other 
           Germans back away, but Böhm simply awaits his fate --

                                 NANCY
                        Is Henri alive?

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        I’ll tell you, but you must do one 
                        thing for me. 

           He produces a letter --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        Get this to my daughter.

           She takes the letter --

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM (CONT’D)
                        Do I have your word?

                                 NANCY
                        Yes, now answer me.

                                 CAPTAIN BÖHM
                        The answer is in your hand. That’s 
                        a farewell letter. Because I know 
                        that you’re going to execute me -- 
                        just as I did your husband. Life 
                        has a cruel symmetry--
           Nancy cuts him off, pressing her pistol to his forehead... 
           But then, she lowers it --

                                 NANCY
                        No. No, you’ll stand trial for your 
                        crimes. 

           She drops the letter in his lap --

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I want your daughter to know what 
                        kind of man her father really is.

           Nancy turns and leaves. And from the expression on Böhm’s 
           face, we gather that this punishment -- this psychological 
           torture -- is far worse than death.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy walks out past the fence-line, where Denden is waiting. 
           The only thing he can do is hold her and let her cry...

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I was going to toast those we’ve 
                        lost.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CHATEAU - NIGHT

           A wistful Nancy spends one last night drinking with her 
           friends: Denden, Tardivat, Fournier, and Bazooka --

                                 NANCY
                        But I think I’ve drunk enough to 
                        the past. What about the future?

                                 FOURNIER
                             (patting his rifle)
                        We’re going to Berlin.

           They all toast --

                                 TARDIVAT
                        I suppose I’ll try to find another 
                        woman to make dresses for.

           Another round of toasts --

                                 BAZOOKA
                        I’m going back to writing 
                        children’s books.
                             (everyone laughs)
                        What?
                                 TARDIVAT
                        Is your pen name Bazooka?

           More laughter, as everyone toasts again.

           LATER - MORNING

           Nancy awakens to find Denden nudging her gently -- 

                                 DENDEN
                        One last surprise, Nan.

           He helps her out of bed and leads her out to --

           THE BALCONY

           Where she gasps, amazed and humbled, because down in the town 
           square below -- 

           ALL THE MAQUIS have lined up in perfect formation. Gaspard 
           stands at the fore, leading them --

                                 GASPARD
                        Field Marshal Wake, we salute you.

           SUPER: AUGUST 30, 1944

           Gaspard marches beneath the balcony, saluting Nancy. Then the 
           next man follows, and the next, and the next --

           A parade of proud Maquis, honoring their Field Marshal...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. JEEP / EXT. MARSEILLE - MORNING

           Nancy drives, Denden in shotgun. They roll into the recently-
           liberated city, which is just beginning to rebuild, French 
           flags once again flying proudly.

           EXT. HENRI’S MANSION - MARSEILLE - LATER

           Nancy and Denden walk up. The shrubs are overgrown, the 
           windows are broken, and front door has been kicked in --

                                 NANCY
                        I’d like to do this alone, please.

           Denden nods, taking his leave, as Nancy makes her way inside. 
           INT. MAIN HALL - HENRI’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy surveys the barren place that was once her home. 
           Looters have taken everything of value, leaving only smashed 
           vases, stained rugs, and faded memories.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - HENRI’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy sifts through the torn clothing and tossed papers. 
           Under a pile of cushions, she sees it -- 

           A scrap of her blue wedding dress. She picks it up, holding 
           it close --

                                 PHILIPPE (O.S.)
                        Welcome home. 

           She turns to see Philippe, standing in the doorway. Like 
           everyone, the war has changed him: He has a scar running down 
           the side of his face and a bad limp -- 

                                 PHILIPPE (CONT’D)
                        When I heard you were back, I had 
                        to come see you.

           Nancy embraces him, motioning to his scar --

                                 NANCY
                        What happened?

                                 PHILIPPE
                        They arrested me right after Henri. 
                        I was in the cell next to his.

                                 NANCY
                        I left him in hell. Be honest, old 
                        friend: Did he die hating me?

                                 PHILIPPE
                        That’s what I came to tell you, 
                        Nan. When they offered him a last 
                        meal, what do you think he 
                        requested?
                             (she waits, hoping)
                        A bottle of 1928 Krug. 

           Tears of longing and hope well in Nancy’s eyes. Philippe 
           heads out, allowing her to be alone. Clutching the scrap of 
           her blue wedding dress, she lies down on the bed and feels 
           the spot where Henri used to sleep...

           But then, she hears a commotion outside. She gets up and 
           heads over to the broken window, morning sunlight filtering 
           in through the torn curtain -- 
           In the street below, a FRENCH GIRL has spilled a wheelbarrow 
           full of bricks. She’s loading them back up, doing her part to 
           rebuild. Nancy leaves the frame, but we stay in the window, 
           watching the Girl struggle...

           And then, after a moment, Nancy appears by her side, loading 
           the last of the bricks. Together, they lift the wheelbarrow 
           and begin the long work of pushing it up the hill.

           FADE OUT.
           SUPER: For her heroic contributions to the war effort, Nancy 
           Wake was awarded France’s highest merit, the Order of the 
           Legion of Honor. She was also awarded the George Medal and 
           the Defense Medal by the United Kingdom, the Companion of the 
           Order of Australia, and the United States Medal of Freedom.

           She died in 2011, at the age of 98, and requested that her 
           ashes be scattered to the winds of the Auvergne.
