                                  New York City.
                                      Night.

                                       TIME

                                 Modern Day, 2015.
                                  NOTE TO READER

          In 2015, quintessential New York City cab companies were 
          begrudgingly partnered with UBER for a short time, allowing an 
          option for what was called an "UberT." 

          The alliance quickly dissolved, however, as cabs refused to 
          actually be paid through the app itself. After a great deal of 
          legal push back on both sides, UBER deleted the UberT option and 
          yellow cabs launched out, creating their own smart phone 
          application. 

          Unfortunately, as cabs were busy clinging to their antiquated 
          business model, their competition grew drastically with the 
          addition of VIA, JUNO, and LYFT, among others. 

          Yet, it won't stop there. One day soon, car services will solely 
          invest in vehicles that are self-driven. 

          The unique experience of chatting with a New York City yellow 
          cabbie is truly about to go the way of the dinosaur, making this 
          film a very purposeful and passionate time capsule of sorts. 

          Please keep this in mind as you read.
           OVER BLACK:

           In the darkness, an even darker rectangular object 
           ominously presses in, the outline resembling that of an 
           iPhone. 

           Nothing happens for a suspended moment of stillness. 

           Then, a flurry of activity ensues as the iPhone turns 
           bright white with a CLICK and a gray-bubble illuminates 
           screen-left with a loud DING!

                                 GRAY-BUBBLE

           In the text-drafting section below, center-screen, 
           “Getting on the plane now,” rapidly manifests, 
           accompanied by that all too familiar “typewriter” 
           clicking sound.  

           CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!

           BLOOP!

           A blue-bubble illuminates on screen-right.

                                 BLUE-BUBBLE
                                (TEXT)
                        Getting on the plane now.

           Another gray-bubble materializes, encompassing three 
           little dots waving various shades of gray, indicating a 
           new message being composed.

           Unlike the blue-bubbles, the texts in the gray-bubbles 
           are bursting with misspelled words, incorrect punctuation 
           and a staggering amount of emojis. 

           The drafting section CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICKS, “About 
           to take off.”

           The iPhone blurs in focus as the sound of a PLANE TAKING 
           OFF grows louder and louder until-

           INT. DREAMLIKE VOID

           The colors from the phone have smeared into dancing pools 
           of yellow, blue and red light, as if staring directly 
           into the sun.

           Within the dreamlike void, dark SHADOWS tease and flirt 
           in and out of focus, illusive and evasive.

           CLOMP, CLOMP, CLOMP.

                                 MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                                 (V.O.)
                                (barely audible, filtered 
                                through intercom)
                        ...will be passing through to collect all 
                        service items. Please secure your tray 
                        tables and lift your seats back to their 
                        upright positions. We’ll be landing 
                        shortly.

           CLOMP, CLOMP, CLOMP.

           From within the calliope of colorful light, one of the 
           DARK SHADOWS begins to materialize.

           The figure takes human form, the form of a YOUNG WOMAN, 
           confidently walking toward camera in slow motion, her 
           fellow shadows shown to be nothing more than NONDESCRIPT 
           TRAVELERS crisscross in the background.

           The red and blue and yellow smatters of light also begin 
           to take solid form, revealing-
           INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM - NIGHT

           -the JFK baggage claim, with soft blue walls, yellow 
           overhead light, and accents of red issuing from the break 
           lights of a passing handicap shuttle cart. 

           CLOMP, CLOMP, CLOMP.

           Trailing a small piece of rolling luggage behind her, the 
           young woman continues to march in slow motion toward 
           camera with the hyper-focus of a seasoned New Yorker, the 
           CLOMPS the sound of her thick-heeled, black ankle boots 
           landing hard against the ground.

           As she draws nearer, the mesmerizing details of this 
           beauty come fully into focus: 

           Dressed from head to toe in gray, black and white, 
           GIRLIE, late 20s to early 30s, sports a tight, white, see-
           through, plunging v-neck with a black lace bra visibly 
           underneath, black skinny jeans, black leather jacket, a 
           light gray scarf, and a small, black leather backpack in 
           lieu of a purse.

           CLOMP, CLOMP, CLOMP.

           Her impressive, urban edge might cause any passerby to 
           cowardly and shyly look away. However, Girlie’s fresh, 
           minimal make-up has allotted one color. 

           Red. 

           Bright red lipstick, perfectly painted within the soft 
           lines of full, very kissable lips, unapologetically 
           seducing any human - male or female - to stare as long as 
           they like.

           CLOMP, CLOMP, CLOMP.

           The SOUNDS of New York City crescendo with the HONKING of 
           HORNS, STRANGERS’ INDISCERNIBLE CELL PHONE CHATTER, the 
           STOMPING of feet, the ROAR of PASSING BUSES and the CRIES 
           of a newborn baby.

           EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, PASSENGER PICK UP - NIGHT 

           The cacophony of NEW YORK CITY NOISE swells even louder 
           as Girlie - with the clipped pace of a city dweller - 
           marches toward a bright yellow cab and parks her rolling 
           luggage near the right taillight just as the trunk POPS 
           open. 
           Having hurried from the opposite side of the cab, the 
           driver, CLARK, 40s, barely catches a glimpse of the left 
           side of Girlie’s face through her tussled, long hair as 
           she opens the back door and tosses her backpack inside.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (Standard American accent)
                        44th and 9th.

           With that, Girlie disappears into the back of the taxi 
           with a SLAM!

           Chomping on a wad of gum with the absentminded 
           determination of a Major League baseball player, Clark 
           hoists the small piece of luggage inside and-

           WHAM! 

           With one strong arm, Clark forces the trunk shut just in 
           time to notice his pretty passenger pressing the “OFF” 
           button on the small TV screen in the back seat.

           As he struts back toward the driver’s side, the bright 
           headlights of a passing vehicle embellishes the highly 
           masculine attributes of this New York native. 

           At first glance, one might assume Clark to be a hardened, 
           blue collar stereotype - tough exterior, thick arms, bold 
           chin, gold chain necklace, blue jeans, t-shirt, rugged 
           whiskers that are a bit sloppy, yet sexy all at the same 
           time.

           CLIP! He opens the door, jumps in, and- 

           SLAM!

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Though the dark shadows of HURRIED TRAVELERS still race 
           in and out of frame, inside the cab, the sounds of the 
           NEW YORK BUSTLE have been quieted - the STOMPING and 
           HONKING and CHATTER far less invasive. 

           The darkness there also provides a comforting hiding 
           place from the toxic, yellow cloud of light pollution 
           just outside - a mixed florescent stew of fixed street 
           lamps and rushing headlights. 

           Nonchalantly, Clark adjusts his rear-view mirror in order 
           to secretly catch another glimpse of his mysterious 
           passenger gazing out the window in the back.
           Filtered through the glass, the yellow florescent glow 
           from outside hints at something much deeper masked 
           underneath Girlie’s strong, stoic, city stare.

           Absorbing this truth, a surprising softness streams from 
           Clark’s eyes. An empathy. Empathy that can only be 
           crafted from a long life of hard knocks.

           Throwing the cab in drive, Clark pulls away from the 
           curb, immediately SLAMMING on the breaks, angrily HONKING 
           his horn far more times than necessary.

           HONK, HONK, HONK, HONK, 

           HONK, HONK, HONK, HOOOOOOONNNNNK!

           Through his rolled up window-

                                 CLARK
                                (thick, New York accent)
                        Fuck! What the shit, man?! 

           The neighboring cab has violently stopped only inches 
           from Clark’s front bumper. 

           Inside, an INDIAN CABBIE, 50s, SCREAMS back, spittle 
           flying from his mouth, his EXPLOSIVE EXPLETIVES muffled 
           by Clark’s rolled up window.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

           Clark HONK, HONK, HONK, HONKS again, causing the Indian 
           Cabbie to drive off in a huff. 

           With an aggressive TUG on the wheel, Clark successfully 
           pulls away from the curb-

           Launching the two out into the night.

           Neither Clark nor Girlie acknowledge their seat belts.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                                (barely audible)
                        Mother fucker.

           Slowly resuming the chomping of his gum, Clark pointedly 
           directs his eyes at the rear-view again, as if to 
           apologize for his outburst. 

           Yet, just as his attention falls on Girlie, she avoids 
           his gaze by turning to the window again, her red lipstick 
           - in this particular moment - more resembling armor than 
           a means of flirtation. 
           Clark wisely remains silent.

           Instead, he carefully takes note of the iPhone in 
           Girlie’s hand, face down, resting in her lap.

           Her phone case displays a playful design of a unicorn 
           getting a piggyback ride from a Tyrannosaurus, suggesting 
           that - on a better day - this striking Millennial might 
           actually have a sense of humor.

           Clark chuckles lightly with a closed mouth, the sides of 
           his lips curling upward with intrigue.

           As his cab picks up speed, the yellow florescent cloud 
           outside begins to dissipate as the two make their way 
           onto Interstate 678.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 678 AND BEYOND - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Lifting away from the yellow cab to more of a GOD’S EYE 
           VIEW, the awe and wonder of urban living becomes evident 
           through the beauty and poetry of light.

           From high above, the many roadways, highways and freeways 
           that lead to the island of Manhattan look more like 
           bright veins pumping bioluminescent yellow and red life 
           to and from the heart of an other worldly creature - the 
           city itself possessing a heartbeat, a beacon of 
           shimmering hope in the permeating darkness that surrounds 
           it.

           Moving back down again from macro to micro, we follow the 
           red taillights of countless vehicles racing along the 
           interstate until a bright yellow cab ZOOMS into frame. 

           The HUM of the cab’s rubber wheels kissing the asphalt 
           evoke a soothing, calming consistency. 

           HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.

           Through the back window, the lonely silhouettes of Clark 
           and Girlie cause the cab to look more like a cage.

           HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.

           Curving around the right side of the taxi, we come upon 
           Girlie’s face, still gazing out. 

           Pressed against the glass, her pensive expression creates 
           the perfect backdrop for the reflections of yellow, red 
           and blue streaks of reflective light - resembling some 
           abstract, animated film projected upon her porcelain 
           skin.
           HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.

           Finally, Girlie pulls her gaze from the window.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Carefully, Girlie peeks at the rear-view mirror ahead, 
           gifting her a secret glimpse of this unknown driver who 
           doesn’t seem to be paying her any mind anymore. 

           With a childlike curiosity, Girlie takes note of the 
           details of this fascinating character before her:

           -She observes the way his jaw moves up and down as he 
           chomps on his gum. 

           -She delights in the gusto in which his thumbs lightly 
           TAP PERCUSSION on the steering wheel to some song caught 
           in his head.

           -She notices small flecks of what looks to be dandruff 
           powered lightly across the bridge of his broad shoulders.

           The inescapable masculine qualities of this cabbie cause 
           Girlie to bite the inside of her cheek as she allows her 
           gaze to fall to the iPhone in her hand, resting in her 
           lap. 

           The playful unicorn and T-Rex on the cover bring no 
           comfort. Instead, they seem to cause a surge of pain in 
           their innocent, silly humor. 

           A haunting reflection of better days. 

           Days passed.

           She flips the phone over and caresses the darkened 
           screen.

           Drawing a deep, quiet INHALE, Girlie unlocks her phone, 
           the device automatically picking up right where she left 
           off - to a very specific text message thread. 

           The light issuing from the screen creates a bright white 
           rectangle in the darkness of each of her pupils, the gray 
           and blue bubbles prominently reflected within.

           EXTREME CLOSE UP ON THE PHONE

           Below the previous text conversation - between Girlie 
           (the blue-bubbles on the right) and “L” (the gray-bubbles 
           on the left) - a new message awaits.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Looking up, Girlie finds the reflection of her cabbie’s 
           eyes staring at her in the rear-view. 

           She stares back, assertively. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yup.

                        Good ol’ Midtown.

           Girlie locks her phone - CLICK - causing the blue and 
           white light in her lap to darken.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Up front, Clark happily TAPS out the tune to the song 
           playing in his head, carefully noting in the rear-view 
           Girlie flipping her phone face down again on her lap, 
           this time holding it loosely in both hands.

           It’s dark in the cab. And quiet. Except for the ever 
           present HUUUUUUMMMMMMM of rubber on asphalt. 

           The street lamps of the interstate race over them in 
           streaks of white light, contorting the darkness into 
           living shadows that seem to have a mind of their own.

           HHHHUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM.
                                 CLARK
                        You’re my last fare for the night.

           Once again, Girlie confidently matches his stare in the 
           rear-view.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah.

           A good-natured smile creeps across her lips.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I won?

           So grateful for that red lipstick smile, Clark lets out a 
           booming LAUGH only New Yorkers can muster.

                                 CLARK
                        You fuckin’ won, sweetheart. You did.

                                 GIRLIE
                        What do I get? For winning?

                                 CLARK
                                (mildly sexual)
                        Anything you want.

           This time, Girlie doesn’t look away, causing Clark to 
           continue to “test the waters” a bit. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I had a rough day of it. Short 
                        trips, barely nothin’ extra. This fuckin’ 
                        business with the credit cards. Cash? 
                        People’d throw you a ten, twenty, fifty. 
                        “Keep the change” ain’t a cliché no more. 
                        And when it was, it was nice. When it’s 
                        paper, you hand it over. Fucking Monopoly 
                        money, am I right? But you swipe that 
                        plastic, you got time to think, you stare 
                        at all those little numbers, and before 
                        you know it - I get fucked up the 
                        asshole.

           He looks to Girlie again in the rear-view. 

           She seems intrigued enough.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        And now, these fuckin’ apps, all of ‘em - 
                        can get a cab, a coffee, burger, soap, 
                        socks, wine, water, Chinese fuckin’ take 
                        out - you can get all that shit, and not 
                        even reach for your purse, not once, not 
                        even for tip. Nah, it’s all up in that 
                        cloud up there. That big fuckin’ cloud, 
                        thinkin’ it knows better. Swearin’ it can 
                        keep a secret. But what happens when that 
                        cloud starts leakin’, huh? What happens 
                        when it starts to rain? You bet your ass 
                        we’re gonna wish we’d stuck with the 
                        Monopoly money, am I right?
                                (a beat)
                        I mean... Salt used to be money. Mother 
                        fuckin’ salt. The same shit you sprinkle 
                        on your eggs. Yeah. Every mornin’ you 
                        toss that cheap-ass-shit all over your 
                        eggs with no idea that people used to die 
                        for it. Tea, coffee, same thing. All that 
                        shit you gloss over at the grocery store, 
                        at one point in time, humans fuckin’ 
                        killed each other for it. 
                                (a brief pause)
                        Bird’s eye view of that shit? Over the 
                        years, you see money go from salt to gold 
                        to paper and now? Money? It ain’t nothin’ 
                        but an idea. Little numbers on a screen. 
                        You can’t touch it or hide it or bury it. 
                        Nah, you just tie it to a fuckin’ 
                        butterfly and send it to that cloud up 
                        there. But, one of these days, I’m 
                        tellin’ ya, that cloud’s gonna open up 
                        and it’s gonna pour acid rain down... all 
                        over our dumb faces... Yellow cabs don’t 
                        play that game. Not in New York. Too much 
                        bullshit. You gotta pay me directly, you 
                        know that, right?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I know.

                                 CLARK
                        You can order me up on your phone, but 
                        you cannot pay for me on your phone. Not 
                        when you go yellow. 

           Cleverly, Girlie weights Clark’s words, coming to an 
           interesting conclusion.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Well... Not yet.
           A surprised GRUNT escapes Clark’s lips.

                                 CLARK
                        Fuck... You may be right. Fuuuuuuuuck... 
                                (a thoughtful beat)
                        That fuckin’ credit card machine... I 
                        didn’t want the damn thing to begin with. 
                        We fought it, we all fought it. Cash is 
                        king, you know? But they still put that 
                        shit in the backseat. Million dollars for 
                        a fuckin’ Medallion, and they put that 
                        shit in my back seat. And one day soon, 
                        like that, they’re gonna come back and 
                        rip that shit out again, like it was 
                        nothin’... Credit card machines, they’re 
                        gonna be like fuckin’ pay phones. Just 
                        sittin’ there. Lookin’ dumb. Waitin’. 
                        Waitin’ for somebody, anybody to give ‘em 
                        a ring. Havin’ no idea... the world’s 
                        moved on... And forget the credit cards - 
                        Cabs, yellow cabs? We’re fuckin’ 
                        Blockbuster, you know? We’re fightin’ it 
                        too hard, swimmin’ up stream. Busy 
                        swimmin’ and missin’ the whole fuckin’ 
                        boat... Me, too. I been fightin’ it, too. 
                        Swimmin’, swimmin’ hard... 
                                (another beat)
                        Some of the guys, they talk ‘bout gettin’ 
                        our own app, you know. Yellow cabs with 
                        our own fuckin’ app... But... I don’t 
                        know... If we’re Blockbuster... it’s 
                        already too late. Ten years time, there 
                        ain’t gonna be yellow no more. And the 
                        other guys, the guys takin’ over? They 
                        are gonna be nothin’ but a blip on the 
                        screen. Fuckin’ blink of an eye...  
                                (a pause)
                        Yeah... you’ll order up a car on your 
                        phone, just like before, but when you hop 
                        in, it ain’t gonna be no human behind the 
                        wheel, I can tell ya that. You’ll order 
                        up a car and that fuckin’ car will drive 
                        itself to wherever-the-fuck you wanna go. 
                        And it won’t speed, won’t stink, won’t 
                        ever get lost... Might even ask you ‘bout 
                        your day... Fuckin’ apps.

           In frustration, Clark frantically itches the back of his 
           neck like a dog trying to scratch away a flea. 

           Girlie offers another red lipstick smirk.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Ah, I’ve got you covered. 
                                 CLARK
                        Yeah?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah. My luggage in the back should 
                        settle us.

                                 CLARK
                        How?

                                 GIRLIE
                                (teasing)
                        It’s full of salt.

           Clark chuckles. He opens his mouth to say something 
           clever in response, but nothing comes out. 

           Finally-

                                 CLARK
                        You want some radio?

           He reaches for the radio.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Not really.

           Retracting his hand- 

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, it all sounds the same. ‘Specially 
                        in my business. After so many hours, 
                        drivin’ around... all sounds the same.

           In the quiet that follows, Girlie seems to be studying 
           him with curiosity, begging the question- 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You-uh... you ever get a white cabbie 
                        before? 

                                 GIRLIE
                        I... I’ve never really thought about it.

                                 CLARK
                        Think about it.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a beat)
                        No... I guess I haven’t.

           Clark nods his head, processing something in his mind.
                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        Is that supposed to mean something?

                                 CLARK
                        Not really. I mean... some people... 
                        Sometimes people ask about it.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Really?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah. Like, one guy, some Wall Street 
                        fuckin’ douche... he wanted to know why.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Why what?

                                 CLARK
                        Why a white guy’s drivin’ a cab. Wanted 
                        to know how I fucked up so bad.

                                 GIRLIE
                        That’s bullshit.

                                 CLARK
                        Right?! Bull-fuckin’-shit! I fuckin’ pull 
                        over, right then, I turn around and tell 
                        the guy, “Ride’s over, buddy. Get the 
                        fuck outta my cab.” Guy jumps out, don’t 
                        even pay. 

           After a beat, he beams at Girlie in the rear-view, a 
           squinted stare.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t even occur to you. Me bein’ white. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        No. 

           Nodding his head again, Clark seems very pleased with 
           this stranger in the back.

           He glances again at the iPhone still held limply in both 
           hands, resting in her lap.

                                 CLARK
                                (after a beat)
                        Nice you’re not on your phone. I mean, 
                        you don’t have to keep talkin’ to me or 
                        nothin’, but... it’s just nice. You know. 
                        To see a human. Not plugged in. 
                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah, I need a break from it.

           Reaching his arm to the floor of the passenger side, 
           Clark fishes out a diet soda from a small cooler. 

           He pops the can open - TSSSSSST - and takes a swig.

                                 CLARK
                        Picked up a couple this mornin’, 
                        LaGuardia, older couple. And they got 
                        their-uh, I don’t know, their 
                        granddaughter with ‘em - fifteen, 
                        sixteen. And she’s just textin’, the 
                        whole ride. First time in the city, and 
                        she don’t say a word. I make a joke to 
                        grandma - I was like, “So, what, you ask 
                        her questions and she texts you the 
                        answers?” Grandma laughed, but Princess 
                        gives me a glare. A glare, mind you, but 
                        still no fuckin’ word - barely looked out 
                        the window. And get this shit. I drop ‘em 
                        off near Macy’s, right? Pop open the 
                        trunk, start helpin’ Grandpa with the 
                        bags - Empire State, right there. I point 
                        it out to Grandpa, he points it out to 
                        Princess, and all of a sudden, Princess 
                        holds out her phone and snaps a fuckin’ 
                        picture - all smilin’ at the camera, big 
                        toothy grin - lookin’ all excited and 
                        shit. And then, she’s back on her phone. 
                        Not smilin’. Not talkin’. Nothin’. Just 
                        sendin’ a fuckin’ butterfly to that cloud 
                        up there. Makin’ her friends all jealous 
                        she’s in the big city. When the truth is? 

           Purposefully, in the rear-view, Clark LOCKS EYES with 
           Girlie. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        She never fuckin’ showed up.

           Girlie’s genuine gaze glows with an extremely rare 
           authenticity. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        What’s your name?

                                 CLARK
                        Why?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Just like to know people’s names.  
                                 CLARK
                        Fuck. You really are a human, aren’t ya? 
                        That’s sweet.

           He smiles at her reflection, a bashful shyness surfacing 
           then submerging quickly again. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Clark.

           Thoughtfully absorbing the name-

                                 GIRLIE
                        Clark.

                                 CLARK
                                (teasing)
                        You thought I’d say Vinnie or some shit 
                        like that.

           Girlie lets out an intoxicating laugh.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I... I don’t know what I thought.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s fine, it’s fine. I mean. Shit. We 
                        pass out these names, you know, random 
                        ass names to these cute, little babies. 
                        Any name you want. Whatever-the-fuck has 
                        a nice ring to it. Whatever-the-fuck 
                        gives you high hopes for higher education 
                        and bullshit. But that little thing in 
                        your arms, it’s never gonna be exactly 
                        what you had in mind. I mean, Clark plays 
                        tennis, he’s got a house in the Hamptons, 
                        goes to opera and shit. I just ain’t that 
                        guy.  

                                 GIRLIE
                        What name would you choose? If you could?

                                 CLARK
                                (with a shrug)
                        Ah. Vinnie.

           Clark secures his can of diet soda in a cup holder.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           After securing his can of diet soda in the cup holder, 
           Clark’s eyes dart to the rear-view again.

                                 CLARK
                        So-uh... You live here, right?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I do.

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, your little outfit gave you away.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (with a chuckle)
                        My outfit?

                                 CLARK
                        Says a lot about you.

                                 GIRLIE
                        What does it say?

                                 CLARK
                        That you can handle yourself.

                                 GIRLIE
                        How can you possibly know that?

                                 CLARK
                        It ain’t difficult to read people. I 
                        mean. You didn’t wait in a taxi line. No, 
                        you ordered me up on your phone. You 
                        jumped in the back, business as usual, 
                        you immediately turned off that damn 
                        little screen ‘cause you already know 
                        what fuckin’ Broadway shows are playin’, 
                        and you didn’t even think to reach for 
                        your seat belt. Why would you? You’ve had 
                        enough rides. In and out, am I right? 

                                 GIRLIE
                                (intrigued)
                        What else?

                                 CLARK
                        You gave me cross streets, not some 
                        fuckin’ address. And I can tell you’re 
                        not concerned with the meter, ‘cause you 
                        already know JFK’s a flat rate. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Impressive.
                                 CLARK
                                (a chuckle)
                        I’m not claimin’ to be some Sherlock or 
                        nothin’. Just a guy who pays attention. 
                        You’ve had a long day. You’re tired. You 
                        wanna go home, grab a shower, sleep in 
                        your own bed. And. You ordered up a 
                        mother fuckin’ taxi. Not some town-car-
                        bullshit. That’s a New Yorker that pays 
                        attention. Someone who knows what the 
                        fuck’s goin’ on.

                                 GIRLIE
                        And what about my “little outfit”?

                                 CLARK
                        You’re wearin’ boots, not sneakers. 
                        You’ve got a scarf, but it ain’t cold 
                        outside. Your purse is a backpack and 
                        you’re not afraid to look me in the eye. 

           Once again, they LOCK EYES in the rearview.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Like I said. You can handle yourself.

           Girlie’s smile hints at sadness.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I like to think so.

           Suddenly, Clark rolls down his window, inviting a warm, 
           early autumn wind to fill the taxi with its fresh breath 
           and all encompassing SOUND. 

           PPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH!

           As the crisp air rushes over her, a welcomed ocean wave 
           of newness, Girlie INHALES deeply, her long hair lightly 
           jostled by the wind.

           Clark rears back and launches his wad of gum out the 
           window with a loud-

           HOCK!

           The gross act causes Girlie to chuckle under her breath, 
           gifting us a hint of a chill tomboy underneath.

           Yet, Girlie’s amusement quickly fades as she glances down 
           at her unicorn and T-Rex iPhone cover. 

           PPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH!
           Looking like a junkie staring at a heroine needle, 
           Girlie’s face begins to contort with a sudden, 
           irresistible urge. 

           PPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH!

           The SOUND of the wind decrescendos into SILENCE as Clark 
           rolls up his window.

           In the following moment of suspended stillness, Girlie 
           closes her eyes, gifting us a moment of muddled memory.

           EXT. DREAMLIKE VOID - NIGHT (MEMORY)

           Against a dark night, the bright haze of yellow, blue, 
           green and red lights twinkle in strings of shining stars. 

           Within the confusing, cosmic glow, two SHADOWS emerge.

           It is difficult to be certain, but if you squint your 
           eyes and watch carefully, you might conclude that these 
           shadows are dancing.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT 

           As the SILENCE continues to hang thick in the air, Girlie 
           opens her eyes, soft focused on nothing in particular, 
           just as her iPhone chimes with a single DING! indicating 
           a new message.

           Her eyes grow wide with an aching addiction just before 
           Girlie slowly flips over her phone and unlocks it.

           This incessant “ping-pong match” of a text conversation 
           should intentionally feel cumbersome. The CLICKING and 
           BLOOPS and DINGS is very much meant to agitate, directly 
           showcasing Girlie’s burdened, yet addicting, obligation 
           toward this “L” person.

           The TEXTING-SOUNDS slowly begin to amplify in Girlie’s 
           mind, the pace and NOISE of this written conversation

           EXTREME CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE
           With the bright light of white, blue and gray reflecting 
           in her eyes, Girlie stares at her phone, not responding.

                                 CLARK (O.S.)
                        Where you flyin’ from?

           In her eyes, we see Girlie type, “It’s been a long week.”

                        What’s in Oklahoma?

           The three gray dots appear again, promising a response.

                                (to Clark)
                        I grew up there.

           The following should feel like a visual and audio attack. 
           It is intended to be highly uncomfortable in every way

           CLICK.
           Suddenly, Girlie locks her phone.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           In the rear-view, Clark catches a glimpse of Girlie 
           blankly staring at the darkened, locked phone in her 
           hands. 

                                 CLARK
                                (gingerly)
                        What about your accent?

           In the backseat, Girlie’s phone lets out a soft DING.

           Girlie glances up at Clark, in a bit of a daze.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Sorry... What?

           DING.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           ECU ON GIRLIE’S PHONE - The mute switch on the side of 
           the phone is slid to the left, showcasing the color red, 
           a sign that the phone’s sound has been turned off.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Her thoughts miles away, Girlie takes a moment to find 
           her driver’s soft gaze waiting for her in the rear-view.

                                 CLARK
                        Your accent.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (confused)
                        My accent?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah. Don’t people from Oklahoma - 
                                (badly imitating a Midwestern 
                                accent)
                        - talk like this?

           Girlie relaxes, allowing a chuckle.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (softly)
                        Not all of us, apparently.
           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           A sucker for that red lipstick grin, Clark continues, 
           clearly committed to keeping this mysterious beauty 
           happily distracted from whatever-the-hell she’s got 
           happening on her phone.

                                 CLARK
                        You from Tulsa?

                                 GIRLIE
                        People always ask Tulsa.

                                 CLARK
                        Only place we ever fuckin’ heard of.

                                 GIRLIE
                        What about Oklahoma City?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, but that’s too easy. You ask Tulsa, 
                        you sound like you know somethin’. 
                        Guessin’ Oklahoma City’s fuckin’ amateur 
                        hour.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’m from a tiny little town. 

           Girlie suddenly opens her back pack and plunges her 
           iPhone deep inside.

                                 CLARK
                        Where?

                                 GIRLIE
                        You’ve never heard of it.

                                 CLARK
                        Where?

           Enjoying the distraction, Girlie extends her right arm. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Okay. So... Oklahoma’s shaped like a pan, 
                        right?

                                 CLARK
                        You guys like to think so, but let’s be 
                        honest.

                                 GIRLIE
                        If my arm’s the panhandle, then I grew up 
                        here.
           She points to her right armpit.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        The armpit of Oklahoma.

                                 CLARK
                        What’s the name of the town?

                                 GIRLIE
                        You got it.

                                 CLARK
                        How many people?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Four hundred-ish.

                                 CLARK
                        Huh. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yep.

                        I honest-to-God would have never guessed 
                        Oklahoma.

                                 GIRLIE
                        What would you have guessed?

                                 CLARK
                        Not an armpit, I can tell you that. 
                                (a beat)

                                 GIRLIE
                        No shit. One more year, and I’ll be 
                        official.
                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, but let’s be honest, you’re 
                        official now. Anyone who chooses for nine 
                        years to wait at the post office until 
                        the idea of “goin’ postal” starts to have 
                        a nice ring to it - anyone who chooses

                        for nine years to drag their loads of 
                        laundry down the street to fight some 
                        tough-ass-broad for some machine that 
                        eats up all your quarters and gives ya

                        piss aroma every now and again as you run 
                        down the street, eatin’ your mornin’ 
                        bagel? You’re a fuckin’ New Yorker.
                                (after a pause)
                        That is... unless you got money and you 
                        don’t do any of that shit. That’s-uh... 
                        that’s a different New York, altogether. 
                        Might as well be another fuckin’ planet.

                        I did all that. For a long time.

                        more... girlie.

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, like a weddin’ planner or fashion 
                        or somethin’. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Not a lot of women code, I’ll give you 
                        that.

                                 CLARK
                        And you drew a line in the sand. Lifted 
                        your leg and made your mark.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (with a grin)
                        I don’t mind squatting.

           Captivated by her reflection, Clark watches as an 
           overhead street lamp illuminates this young woman’s 
           flawless face - those red lips - for a fleeting moment of 
           pure bliss. 

                                 CLARK
                        So... what’s the deal with the ones and 
                        zeros? 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Like...?

                                 CLARK
                        Like... I mean. They’re like building 
                        blocks or whatnot, right? Like, when I 
                        look at my computer, I’m really lookin’ 
                        at a bunch of ones and zeros or some 
                        shit.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah, something like that.

                                 CLARK
                        No, tell me. I honestly wanna know. 
                        Clearly I like to know a lot about a 
                        lotta different shit. Can’t be a know-it-
                        all if you don’t know nothin’.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Well? 
           For emphasis sake, Girlie perches on the back seat, 
           drawing closer to the plexiglass between them.

           Clark shifts his weight, doing his best not to look too 
           excited.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        Uh... the ones and zeros... in a way... 
                        they kind of mean “on” and “off.” But, 
                        what they become though, they become 
                        these strings called bytes. And you line 
                        them up by eight. You take eight ones and 
                        zeros, and then, you form a number out of 
                        that. 
                                (a beat)
                        There’s also a data type in programming 
                        called a Boolean Value.
                                (pronounced boo-lee-in)
                        And, with that, I guess... it isn’t 
                        really so much about saying “on” or 
                        “off.” It’s more about saying “true” or 
                        “false.” 

                                 CLARK
                        Ones and zeros mean true or false?

                                 GIRLIE
                        At the basic level.

                                 CLARK
                        So if- 

                                 GIRLIE
                        If something is true, it’s a one. If it’s 
                        false- 

                                 CLARK
                        It’s a zero.

                                 GIRLIE
                        You got it.

                                 CLARK
                        Huh.

                                 GIRLIE
                        But nobody writes in ones and zeros 
                        anymore. We have a higher level of 
                        programming now that’s been built on top 
                        of the ones and zeros. 

                                 CLARK
                        So, what do ya write? Instead?
                                 GIRLIE
                        It’s become its own language. Like. What 
                        programmers do, what I do, is write lines 
                        of code. But that code... it looks 
                        very... It’s sort of... odd. You’ll see 
                        all these weird words and punctuation 
                        that don’t make any sense, but it all 
                        means something. It’s not just gibberish. 
                        It’s a, like a library, like... when I 
                        write code, it refers to something 
                        someone else has written. And what 
                        they’ve written also refers to something 
                        someone else has written. And, yeah, it 
                        all goes back, all the way down, it does 
                        go back to the ones and zeros. Like 
                        building a skyscraper or something. Right 
                        now, we’re building floor fifty-five or 
                        whatever. But the foundation of the 
                        entire building, the very first level, is 
                        built from ones and zeros.

                                 CLARK
                        True and false.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Correct. Whether the answer was true or 
                        false, one or zero, is basically how... 
                        everything you see... operates.

           Pensively, Clark analyses this new information. 

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Having come closer to the plexiglass, Girlie has a better 
           view of Clark. 

           She studies his strong chin, his ropey neck, his rugged 
           whiskers. Something in her eyes registers surprise by how 
           handsome this cabbie is up close. 

           As she traces the back of his neck with her eyes, she 
           notices that his gold chain has slightly shifted to 
           reveal a very pale line of skin prominent within the 
           darker shades of sun-kissed, pigmented brown, suggesting 
           that Clark never takes that necklace off. Ever.

           Having been lost in thought, Clark finally draws his 
           conclusion with a shrug.

                                 CLARK
                        I mean... it makes sense. We all do that. 
                        Lay down our bricks of ones and zeros. 
                        Build our own little fort. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        And that shit, it starts young. I mean, 
                        think about it. “You are stupid.” True or 
                        false? “You are ugly.” True or false? 
                        “Your mother loves you.” True or false? 
                        And when you grow up? That shit don’t 
                        stop. “Climate change.” True or false? 
                        “Jesus Christ.” True or false? “I must 
                        wear pants today.” True or false? “I am 
                        gay, I am straight, I am bi, I am a man, 
                        I am a woman.” True or fuckin’ false. And 
                        on and on it goes.

           Girlie cannot stop looking at that fine tan-line of pale 
           skin from the gold chain around Clark’s neck.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                                (after a beat)
                        We all gotta choose our ones and zeros. 
                        And whatever we decide... yeah... that 
                        becomes the foundation from which we 
                        operate.

           SITTING BACK, Girlie falls silent a moment. 

           Finally-

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’ve never thought of it like that 
                        before.

                                 CLARK
                        Ah... I’m just talkin’ bullshit.

           In the rear-view, Girlie grins playfully again.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (as if to say, “False.”)
                        Zero.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           With a chuckle, Clark’s bashful side surfaces, then 
           quickly submerges again.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re a... you’re a surprising person, I 
                        gotta say.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Awwwww, shucks.

                                 CLARK
                        Very little surprises me these days. 
           Clark reaches for his diet soda.

                                 GIRLIE
                        And what about you? 

                                 CLARK
                        What about me?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Where are you from?

                                 CLARK
                        Hell’s Kitchen. Not far from where we’re 
                        goin’.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Nice.

                                 CLARK
                        Wasn’t nice back then. Those days... if 
                        Hell really did have a kitchen, that was 
                        it. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        You still live in Manhattan?

                                 CLARK
                        Own a place. Jackson Heights. Small 
                        house.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Still. It’s a house.

                                 CLARK
                        You better fuckin’ believe it.

                                 GIRLIE
                        So. Clark lives in Queens.

                                 CLARK
                        No, Vinnie lives in Queens. Clark’s gotta 
                        loft in TriBeCa.

           The two chuckle.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Right, right.

           Suddenly, Clark notices something up ahead, causing him 
           to tap the breaks.  

                                 CLARK
                        Oh, Fuck. That ain’t good. 
           CLARK’S POV

           Through the windshield, a wall of countless, stationary 
           red taillights force the cab to come to a complete stop.

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Turning, Girlie gazes out the back window, squinting 
           against the wall of endless yellow headlights crowding in 
           from behind.

           The two have been captured between uncompromising walls 
           of red and yellow light, the street lamps overhead 
           glaring down, now fixed florescent stars in the night 
           sky.

           Utter gridlock. 

           The worst kind. 

           The New York kind.

                                 CLARK
                        Dammit. Got some kinda fender bender up 
                        there. See the lights?

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB, FRONT SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           They both look ahead at the array of flickering emergency 
           lights - police cars, ambulances - far off in the 
           distance, proudly pulsing red and blue.

           Clark aggressively throws the cab in park. 

           THRUST! 

           “P.”

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry, sweetie.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Not your fault. 

                                 CLARK
                        I hate this shit. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        It’s fine. Really. 
                                 CLARK
                        Should’ve been payin’ attention. Could’a 
                        got off back there.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (teasing)
                        Well? I’m on the flat rate, so...

                                 CLARK
                                (a laugh)
                        No, I’m gonna meter your ass!

                                 GIRLIE
                        Nope. I won. I won again. Two to zero.

                                 CLARK
                        Leavin’ me in the dust over here.

           The glow of taillights ahead dissipates, prompting Clark 
           to-

           THRUST! 

           “D.”

           After gaining a bit of ground, the wall of red forces 
           Clark to stop again.

           THRUST! 

           “P.”

           Grabbing his diet soda, Clark takes a long swig.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Red and blue, red and blue, pounds upon Girlie’s pensive, 
           porcelain, a direct competition against the bright yellow 
           headlights that aggressively backlight this beauty from 
           behind.

           All is still. Too still.

           All is quiet. Too quiet.

           Girlie watches as Clark secures his soda back in the cup 
           holder and begins to play percussion on the steering 
           wheel again - unable to sit still. 

           As his thumbs TAP to the rhythm of some song stuck in his 
           head, Girlie’s gaze falls to her backpack.
           The BEAT of the driver’s thumbs crescendoes in Girlie’s 
           mind as that wave of fierce addiction washes over her 
           again.

           TAP, TAP, TAP - goes the “drums.”

           Her fingers twitch.

           She softly bites her bottom lip.

           TAP, TAP, TAP.

           Suddenly, Clark itches at the back of his neck in 
           frustration. 

           SCRATCH, SCRATCH, SCRATCH.

           Girlie watches as a small flake of dandruff falls from 
           Clark’s short hair in slow motion. 

           Her face turns very curious by this bright white fleck, 
           as pure as snow, as it innocently floats within the 
           pulsing red and blue lights, until it softly falls upon 
           the broad shoulders of Clark’s cotton t-shirt.

           Something about it proves perfectly imperfect. 

           A small glimpse of humanity. 

           The poetry found within our flaws.

           In a daze, Girlie reaches inside her backpack, pulls out 
           her phone and unlocks it.

           EXTREME CLOSE UP ON THE PHONE

           Two new gray-bubbles await.

           The drafting section types, “Lo siento. Caught in 
           traffic.” 

           With the phone still muted, this time the clicking 
           “typewriter” sound has been replaced with SILENCE.

           Surprisingly, a new gray-bubble immediately appears.

           BACK TO SCENE
           Red and blue pulsing on her face, Girlie simply stares at 
           the slew of texts before her. 

           Biting her right thumbnail, Girlie sits perfectly still. 

           Red and blue.

           Hovering just over her left shoulder, we eavesdrop as a 
           new gray-bubble - with waving gray dots - appears. 

           Then disappears... 

           Then appears... 

           Then disappears again. 

           Girlie’s disengagement has clearly caused “L” to greatly 
           question what he should say next.

           Finally---

                                 L (CONT’D)
                                (TEXT)

                        You their?

           A new gray-bubble - with waving gray dots - appears, then 
           disappears again into nothing. 

           Silence...  

           No more gray-bubbles... 

           Nothing.

           CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE

           Pulling her thumbnail from her mouth, Girlie begins to 
           compose another text in the quiet and darkness of the 
           back seat.

           Red and blue. 

           SUPERIMPOSED: TEXT MESSAGES ON SCREEN, GIRLIE’S TEXTS 
           SCREEN-RIGHT, “L”S TEXTS SCREEN-LEFT.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Girlie glances up, paranoid that Clark might be watching.

           He isn’t.

           He remains distracted by the song in his head.

           TAP, TAP, TAP. 

           Girlie looks down at her phone again-

           GIRLIE’S POV ON HER PHONE

           We see a quick CUT as a bathroom-stall-dick-pic has just 
           been delivered. 

           For those of you paying attention, this man has a 
           perfectly average cock, nothing to write home about.

           Girlie glances up at Clark again. 
           He’s still not paying attention. 

           She habitually puts her thumbnail between her teeth.

           Then, Girlie suddenly pulls her thumbnail from between 
           her lips and composes, “Such a big boy.” 

           She sends.

           REVERSE ON GIRLIE

           Utter SILENCE, as if all the air has been sucked out of 
           the scene. 

           Girlie herself looks as if she’s literally holding her 
           breath.

           Red, blue. 

           Red, blue.

           With a face of deep confliction, Girlie doesn’t even 
           blink for a long pause.

           ECU ON THE PHONE

           Impulsively and rapidly, Girlie suddenly types, “No. Save 
           it for me, baby.” 

           She sends.

                                 GIRLIE

           Clark watches as Girlie quickly locks her phone again and

           Taking her time to answer, Girlie stares out the window 
           again - red taillights illuminating her from the 
           windshield, yellow headlights backlighting her from 
           behind.

           Girlie pulls her gaze from the window with an almost 
           militant refusal to show weakness. 

           Instead, she cleverly deflects with a bit of light humor.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Her knees are huge.

                                 CLARK
                                (a chuckle)
                        I take it you don’t visit all that often?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Hadn’t seen her in years. 

                                 CLARK
                        Why?

                                 GIRLIE
                        We just stopped talking. We didn’t have a 
                        fight or anything, we just... stopped 
                        talking.

                                 CLARK
                        Why now?

                                 GIRLIE
                        She tracked me down. Asked me to visit. I 
                        had no reason to say no. 

                                 CLARK
                        How’d she track you down? The cloud?

                                 GIRLIE
                        The cloud.

                                 CLARK
                        Acid rain?

                                 GIRLIE
                        We had a nice time. I mean - she’s a 
                        total bitch, but we laughed a lot. We 
                        drank a lot and we laughed a lot.

                                 CLARK
                        She married?

                                 GIRLIE
                        She has a girlfriend.

                                 CLARK
                        Nice.
                                 GIRLIE
                        Named Red-Wolf.

                                 CLARK
                        Fuck me. She born with that name?

                                 GIRLIE
                        She was.

                                 CLARK
                        And I thought “Clark” was some bullshit.

                                 GIRLIE
                        She’s Native American.

                                 CLARK
                        She’s somethin’.

                                 GIRLIE
                        They seem happy. They live in a trailer, 
                        have two dogs, they’re saving up to move 
                        to Napa.
                                (after a beat)
                        She’s come a long way.

                                 CLARK
                        She older, younger?

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB, BACK SEAT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Red and blue. 

           GIRLIE’S POV ON CLARK’S EYES IN THE REAR-VIEW - Something 
           about the empathy softly swimming in those baby-blues 
           causes Girlie to answer plainly. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        She... she was eleven when I was born, 
                        so... she was like a mom growing up. But 
                        she was a fucked up mom, like... she used 
                        to tie me up, ankle to ankle, wrist to 
                        wrist, and put me in the bathtub and lock 
                        me in the bathroom. 

                                 CLARK
                        What the fuck? Bathtub full?

           In the SILENCE that follows, a faint RINGING sound 
           emerges, the sound that can be found deep within one’s 
           ear.
           Intensely backlit by the wall of headlights, Girlie 
           stares blankly ahead, allowing her mind to fall into a 
           distant, hazy memory. 

           RIIIIIINNNNNNNG as the headlights behind Girlie begin to 
           grow brighter and brighter until-

           INT. DREAMLIKE WHITE VOID. BATHROOM - DAY (MEMORY)

           All is white.

           RIIIIIIINNNNNNG.

           A SLOW PUSH IN ON a white porcelain, claw-foot bathtub 
           that slowly begins to take form within the void.

           As we move closer, the crisp, clean bright white of the 
           tub gives way to the brutal reality of its bleak 
           imperfections. 

           Though empty, the tub’s thin yellow ring lines its water 
           capacity, all the way around - small polyps of black mold 
           clinging for life near the drain.

           RIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNG.

           Above the tub, the frame of a small window takes form, 
           pale light from a rainy, gloomy day filtered through a 
           sheer, shabby, brown-mildew-stained curtain.

           PRESSING into the light of the window, we move through 
           the sheer curtain into-

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT

           The back window of the taxi where Girlie slowly turns her 
           head, ALMOST LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA - as if facing 
           the memory head on.

           The RINGING stops. 

           SILENCE.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (quietly)
                        Empty.

           In the front seat, Clark looks at the rear-view, seeing 
           Girlie thoughtfully staring out the back window.

           This new information seems to have rattle Clark to the 
           core. 
           One might wonder if it speaks to something much deeper. 

           A time gone by. 

           Memories this man has long since left behind.

                                 CLARK
                                (quietly)
                        Why the fuck would she do that?

           Girlie turns again, facing Clark’s stare in the rear-
           view.

                                 GIRLIE
                        It was her way of helping me practice.

                                 CLARK
                        Practice what?

                                 GIRLIE
                        If I ever got kidnapped, I’d be able to 
                        escape. That was her logic.

           Clark has been rendered speechless for a moment, his 
           thoughts held captive by something, something disturbing.  

           His cab in park, that stubborn, sinister wall of red 
           taillights before him, Clark stares at the giant “P” on 
           the dash, looking like a helpless child.

                                 CLARK
                                (quietly)
                        That is some crazy shit.

           Still staring at the “P”-

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                                (softly, simply)
                        Did you like bein’ tied up?

           When no reply comes, Clark TURNS HIS HEAD FOR THE FIRST 
           TIME, engaging in a real human connection - a moment in 
           time, capsulated in slow motion - advancing these two 
           souls far beyond mere reflections in a rear-view mirror. 

           The cab suddenly ceases to be “front seat” and “back 
           seat.” 

           Somehow this place, this metal cage, has emotionally 
           expanded. 

           And you can feel it. 

           It’s in the air. 
           It’s in the light. 

           It’s in the shared silence.

           CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE

                                 GIRLIE
                                (sincerely)
                        I liked the challenge of getting free.

           CLOSE UP ON CLARK

           A sense of recognition, an understanding, registers in 
           Clark’s eyes. 

           And what he sees in her is clearly a piece of himself.

                                 CLARK
                        You got loose... didn’t you? You sat 
                        there in the bathroom... in that cold, 
                        empty bathtub... for God knows how 
                        long... and you wiggled yourself free. 
                        Every. Fuckin’. Time.

           CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE

           A resiliency washes over Girlie’s face.

           Red and blue. 

           A shared understanding. 

           Red and blue.

           These two are survivors. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Kidnappers be damned.

           EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CLARK

                                 CLARK
                        Like I said... you can handle yourself.

           EXTREME CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE

           Her eyes simply reply, “Damn fucking straight.”

           BACK TO SCENE

           The red glow in the cab dims as the wall of red lights 
           ahead moves a bit. 
           Turning from Girlie, Clark THRUSTS his cab from “P” to 
           “D” and pulls forward a few yards.

           Putting the cab back in “P,” Clark falls silent, his 
           right leg prominently bouncing up and down.

           Red and blue. 

                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                                (after a beat, quietly)
                        You get a prize or somethin’? For gettin’ 
                        lose?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Not really. By the time I’d get free... 
                        my sister would... be at work or 
                        whatever.

                                 CLARK
                                (after a pause)
                        So... where was mom?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Mom was gone.

                                 CLARK
                        And where did mom go?

                                 GIRLIE
                                (with a deep, dramatic voice)
                        Mom went out for a pack of smokes and 
                        never came back.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s funny. You’re funny.

           Unable to engage again directly just yet, Clark relies on 
           Girlie’s reflection in the rear-view.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Cute as all hell. What are you? Twenty-
                        five? Twenty-six?

           Shaking her head-

                                 GIRLIE
                        No. I don’t answer that question.

                                 CLARK
                        Why the hell not?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Because it’s bullshit.
                                 CLARK
                        What, you weird about your age?

                                 GIRLIE
                        The whole world’s weird about my age! If 
                        I told you I was twenty-four or if I was 
                        thirty-four, your opinion of me would 
                        drastically change. 

                                 CLARK
                        That is not true.

                                 GIRLIE
                        For women? It is. It is fucking true. The 
                        moment we turn thirty, our value is cut 
                        in half.

                                 CLARK
                        I mean... Fine, fuck it, it’s true. It is 
                        true. But, listen- I mean- You really do 
                        look twenty-somethin’, but... by the way 
                        you talk, if I wasn’t lookin’, I’d guess 
                        you were fifty, so-

                                 GIRLIE
                        So, what does it matter how many times 
                        I’ve been around the sun?

           Put in his place, Clark draws a breath, but cannot muster 
           a reply. 

           Then-

                                 CLARK
                        Hell if I know... It’s just a question, I 
                        guess. Somethin’ people ask. Maybe you’re 
                        right, maybe it is bullshit. 
                                (a beat)
                        I guess... it’s just, it was my way, my 
                        way of tryin’ to understand. I mean... it 
                        is a bit confusin’ to meet some chick who 
                        looks twenty-two, but is clearly a 
                        fuckin’ rocket ship.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (amused)
                        A rocket ship, huh?

           He imitates the SOUND of a NASA rocket launching, 
           accompanied with a hand gesture. 

                                 CLARK
                        That’s you.
                                 GIRLIE
                                (like a bad ass)
                        Yeah. I feel it.

                                 CLARK
                        Feel it. Own it.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I get shit done.

                                 CLARK
                        Gonna take over the whole wide world, no 
                        question.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’ll build a small empire and leave the 
                        rest.

                                 CLARK
                                (after a chuckle)
                        You-uh... you plan on sharing that Empire 
                        with someone? A boyfriend or whatnot? 

           Girlie’s smile fades. She stoically looks out the window 
           again. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What? You need me to kick someone’s ass?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Nah. It’s okay.

                                 CLARK
                        What’s his name?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Doesn’t matter.

                                 CLARK
                        He fuck up that bad?

           No reply.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I told you my name, let’s hear 
                        his.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’d rather not say.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh. I see. I get it.

           This grabs her attention.
                                 GIRLIE
                        You get what?

                                 CLARK
                        He’s married. I get it.

           Throwing the cab into “D,” Clark inches forward. 

           As they reach another full stop, Girlie doesn’t say 
           anything for a long pause. 

           THRUST! 

           “P.”

           Finally-

                                 GIRLIE
                        Why do you think he’s married?

           Clark casually reaches across the dashboard for another 
           stick of gum.

                                 CLARK
                        You could’ve said his name and how would 
                        I ever know? As if there’s only one Bob 
                        or Sam or Jeff in New-York-fuckin’-City. 
                        Nah... you so afraid to say a name? The 
                        guy’s married. Or you’re married. Or 
                        someone’s fuckin’ married and no one 
                        wants to say that shit out loud. Gum?

           Clark offers the pack of gum to Girlie.

           Accepting his gift, Girlie pulls the pack of gum through 
           the small opening in the plexiglass divider between them. 

           Quietly, Girlie takes a stick and returns the pack to 
           Clark.

           After the gum has successfully softened in her mouth- 

                                 GIRLIE
                                (plainly)
                        He’s married.

                                 CLARK
                        I know he’s fuckin’ married. I know 
                        people. Don’t drive a cab for twenty 
                        years and not know people.

           Clark turns his whole body toward Girlie again, looking 
           directly at her.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Word of advice? And this is comin’ from a 
                        man married twice with a lotta action on 
                        the side. You ready?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Ready.

                                 CLARK
                        Don’t ever say the word “love,” all 
                        right? Just... don’t say it.

           Silence.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sweetheart... You fuckin’ said it, 
                        didn’t you?

           No reply - “deer caught in head lights.”

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You did! You said the fuckin’ “L” word! 
                        Oh, God, honey! That’s fuckin’ suicide in 
                        that world, didn’t you know that?! Fuck! 
                        He does not want to hear that from you. 
                        He wants to hear it from his mother, his 
                        wife, his kids - but he does not want to 
                        hear that shit from you. In the cognitive 
                        wheel that is his life, that is not your 
                        function.

                                 GIRLIE
                        And what is my function?

                                 CLARK
                        Sex! Touch me, suck me, lick me, but do 
                        not love me. Don’t you fuckin’ love me!

           This time, Girlie opens her mouth to say something, but 
           falters. 

           It takes a few tries until-

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’m not... that girl, okay? I just... I 
                        couldn’t not say it anymore. 

                                 CLARK
                        And what? He’s supposed to love you back? 
                        He’s supposed to ride in on a big, white 
                        horse and whisk you away to some cliff in 
                        Greece? Live out his days braidin’ your 
                        hair with wild flowers and forget-me-
                        nots? No fuckin’ way.

                        He’s not gonna be there when your olive 
                        oil dries up, sweetheart. You’re not that 
                        important. He knows that. I know that. 
                        But you, you just gotta catch up, it’s 
                        all right. Gotta change your ones to 
                        zeros, I get it, it takes time.

           Girlie wants to say something, but sits utterly 
           dumbfounded.

           Clark, in true form, barrels forward. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Honest-to-God, my first wife was 
                        everything you’d ever want - five-eight, 
                        hundred and fifteen pounds, tits out to 
                        here, hair full of bleach and a head full 
                        of nothin’. Men love women that are dumb 
                        as shit. They’re fuckin’ pigs in the 
                        bedroom. Mother-fuckin’-pigs and we love 
                        that shit.

                                 GIRLIE
                        You think that smart women- 

                                 CLARK
                        Cannot reduce themselves to pigs in the 
                        bedroom. That is right. Can’t have it 
                        both ways. Don’t exist.

                                 GIRLIE
                        That is not true.

                                 CLARK
                        You look like a smart girl. Went to 
                        college, read a lot, talk politics, all 
                        that shit?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yes.

                                 CLARK
                        You ever been a pig in the bedroom?

                                 GIRLIE
                        What’s your definition of a pig?

           Clark throws his head back, howling with laughter.

                                 CLARK
                        You see! Dumb chicks don’t need 
                        explainin’ - they just do it! Like they 
                        were made for it.

                                (imitating her, but 
                                offensively too high 
                                pitched)
                        “I do stuff.”

           Becoming all too serious, almost dark- 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, but do you love your own filth? 
                        Love it so much, you’d roll around and 
                        around and around... until you fuckin’ 
                        stink?

           No reply.

                        That was my first wife. Man... Everything 
                        a guy could ask for.

           For a moment, Clark loses himself in what must be fond 
           memories.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        But, uh... she-uh... she starts gainin’ 
                        weight, right? And it makes her feel bad 
                        about herself and she stops wantin’ to, 
                        you know-

                                 CLARK
                        Do her wifely duty and whatnot. And, in 
                        no time flat, honest-to-God, I go out and 
                        find myself a nineteen-year-old, put her 
                        up in an apartment down the street, pay 
                        for everything.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Are you serious?

                                 CLARK
                        Oh, yeah. Cute little thing. Polish. Long 
                        legs. Fucked the shit out of her. Best 
                        year of my life. Would’ve kept her around 
                        longer, but- 
                                 GIRLIE
                        Ahhh... the “L” word.

                        for you. I want I should have your 
                        babies.” 

           They stare at each other in the rear-view.

           Red and blue.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Not your function. You are there because 
                        their wives had kids and got fat. Or 
                        their wives have a career, or cancer, or 
                        whatever-the-fuck it is - men don’t want 
                        to hear that shit come outta your mouth. 
                        They barely want you to say a word at 
                        all.

           Red and blue. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        So, why get married? Why don’t men 
                        just... stay single so they can fuck 
                        whoever, whenever?

           With a cheeky grin, Clark corrects her grammar.

                                 CLARK
                        Whomever.

                        Dude. Seriously?

           With a chuckle, Clark continues, very much enjoying this 
           lively debate.

                                 CLARK
                        Men? We wanna look good for other men, if 
                        that makes sense. We wanna have a fancy 
                        suit, a phat house, a fast car. “He who 
                        dies with the most toys wins.” Sure, 
                        that’s talkin’ about the suit, the house, 
                        the car, but it also includes the wife 
                        and the kids. Toys.

                        Now... lotta guys out there, maybe they 
                        did fall in love. Maybe they really did 
                        wanna get married and have kids and 
                        whatever-the-fuck. But deep down? If 
                        they’re honest? Really honest?

                        feel loved. And, there it is - the “L” 
                        word again. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        That is such bullshit. I am certain there 
                        are plenty of women out there that can 
                        cheat just like a fucking man!

                                 CLARK
                        Sure, sure. There are some women out 
                        there that just wanna get fucked, no 
                        question. But, those women... they don’t 
                        just fuck any Joe Blow down the street. 
                        Nah. They reserve their skills for men 
                        that have money. Men who have power. 
                        Thus, causing men to want money and power 
                        all the more. The suit, the house, the 
                        car - we want those things, because we 
                        want those skilled women to fuck us, fuck 
                        us senseless, like a man, no strings 
                        attached. Therefore? You ladies fightin’ 
                        so hard to be our equal, is actually, in 
                        essence, still just reducing most of you 
                        to nothin’ but toys. And so the cycle 
                        continues.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I... seriously hate you right now.

           Clark laughs.
                                 CLARK
                        Look. At the end of the day, I do agree 
                        with you. Man or woman, people are 
                        people.  

                                 GIRLIE
                        Thank you.

                                 CLARK
                        And people get lonely. Don’t matter the 
                        reason. Humans just want a soft spot to 
                        rest their heads. For an hour even... one 
                        fuckin’ hour to forget yourself. 
                                (after a thoughtful beat)
                        But... in your particular case... 

                                 GIRLIE
                        In my case, what?

                                 CLARK
                        You mean it. 
                                (a pause)
                        Don’t use the “L” word unless you mean 
                        it. And that puts you in the 
                        “stereotypical category” as much as it 
                        makes you hate me.

           Silence.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Look. I know you’re not “that girl.” I 
                        get it. I can tell. All the little boys 
                        out there, they been chasin’ you. You 
                        don’t remember their names, you don’t 
                        wanna cuddle, and you most definitely 
                        don’t use the “L” word. You wanna get in, 
                        get out, go home, take a shower and sleep 
                        in your own bed. It’s not about havin’ 
                        babies for you. It’s not about bullshit. 
                        It’s about bein’ distracted. Just long 
                        enough that you can forget about whatever-
                        the-fuck.
                                (a beat)
                        But then... one day... for whatever 
                        reason... this guy grabs your attention. 
                        And suddenly... you don’t know yourself. 
                        Suddenly, you want things you never 
                        fuckin’ wanted. Am I right?

           No reply.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Good news is... you’ll know right when it 
                        happens next time, ‘cause you’ll actually 
                        know what the fuck’s goin’ on. Won’t be 
                        caught with your panties down on the next 
                        round, sweetie. Unless you wanna be.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Please don’t say “panties.” Can you 
                        just... call them anything else.

                                 CLARK
                        Pantaloons, underwears- 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Great. Fantastic.

                                 CLARK
                        Regardless... it will happen again. 

           Girlie looks instantly sick at the very thought.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (barely audible)
                        Ugh. 

                                 CLARK
                        Oh, yeah. You’ll meet someone. Doesn’t 
                        matter where. And the-uh, the 
                        conversation’ll start to go a certain 
                        way. Men know how to do that. Steer the 
                        conversation to see if there’s interest. 
                        When you met your fella, he was doin’ the 
                        same thing. He was pokin’ around to see 
                        if you had any candy to give. And the 
                        answer, clearly, was yes.

           Girlie almost objects.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Whether you knew it or not, you told him, 
                        “Yes. I got candy.” So, he kept pushin’ 
                        and pokin’ ‘til he got it. And there you 
                        were, thinkin’ how great this guy is and 
                        how nice he’s listenin’ and, oh, such a 
                        perfect smile and so warm behind the 
                        eyes. 
                                (a pause)
                        Bullshit. Bull-fuckin’-shit, sweetheart. 
                        It wasn’t no accident. He’s done it 
                        before. He’ll do it again. Ain’t nothin’ 
                        special about it.
                                (a declaration)
                        And now?! 
           With his right knee dramatically bouncing up and down, 
           Clark grabs an empty water bottle.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Now, I gotta piss like a Russian 
                        racehorse. 

           He starts to unbutton his jeans.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Dude! Do not do that in here!

                                 CLARK
                        What the fuck am I supposed to do?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Take it outside!

                                 CLARK
                        And get arrested?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Who the fuck is gonna arrest you?! Come 
                        on, Hell’s Kitchen! You’ve never taken a 
                        piss outside before?! 

           Clark desperately glances around the gridlock. 

                                 CLARK
                                (under his breath)
                        Fuck. 

           With that, Clark jumps out of the cab and SLAMS the door. 

           Left alone in the dark, in the quiet, Girlie stares at 
           her phone, but does not unlock it.

           Red and blue. 

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Red and blue.

           Ahead, the cars start to pull forward a few feet, the red 
           wall gifting some room. 

           Girlie nervously glances about, but cannot see Clark 
           anywhere.

           The cars behind the cab begin to HONK, some even pass in 
           a fury. 

           HHHHOOOOOOOONNNNNNNKKKK!
           Still no sign of Clark. 

           The lane to the left of the cab finally halts, leaving a 
           white sedan just parallel to Girlie.

           One LITTLE BOY, 3, in the back of the sedan stares at her 
           from his car seat, with large, dark, fascinated eyes. 

           She stares back.

           The boy’s beautiful Afro perfectly frames his stunningly 
           innocent face. 

           He smiles at her with bright, white teeth and lifts a 
           little FISH CRACKER in her direction - a genuine impulse 
           to share with Girlie the little he has.

           CLIP!

           The driver’s door opens.

           Clark jumps inside.

           SLAM!

           As Clark pulls the cab forward, the white sedan and the 
           little boy are stolen from GIRLIE’S POV.

           After a few yards- 

           THRUST!

           “P.” 

           Silence. 

           Then-

                                 GIRLIE
                                (quietly)
                        He gave me his card.

                                 CLARK
                        What?

           The two LOCK EYES in the rear-view. 

           GIRLIE’S POV

           SLOW PUSH IN ON CLARK’S RIGHT EYE until it morphs into-
           INT. DREAMLIKE VOID. MANDARIN ORIENTAL - NIGHT (MEMORY)

           -an elevator button, FLOOR 35.

           “L”S POV

           The small yellow light from the elevator button turns 
           off, prompting the doors to open.

           All is SILENT as we move from the elevator into The Lobby 
           Lounge, hosting a high-end, corporate, cocktail soiree. 

           NONDESCRIPT BUSINESSMEN in dark suits crisscross in and 
           out of frame as “L” makes his way to the bar.

           A HANDSOME MALE BARTENDER, 20s, glances up, immediately 
           recognizing “L.” 

           The bartender quickly pours “L” a snifter of Macallan 25, 
           neat, sliding the etched crystal tumbler across the bar.

           “L” throws a hundred dollar bill down (no change 
           necessary) and lifts the tumbler to his lips.

           Though the camera is undeniably tracking “L”s POV, we 
           should never see even the slightest glimpse of what this 
           man looks like - his hands, his physique, his race, not 
           anything.

           After sipping from his scotch, “L” turns from the bar. 

           This gorgeously appointed lounge has somehow been 
           bastardized into a very boring landscape of MEN in dark 
           suits doing business over cocktails.

           Across the room, however, a few SUITS suddenly part ways 
           to reveal Girlie, standing against the panoramic floor-to-
           ceiling windows of The Lobby Lounge, gazing out at the 
           magnificent views of the steel skyscrapers of Columbus 
           Circle against the expansive backdrop of the green 
           broccoli treetops of Central Park. 

           Dressed in an extremely form fitting, floor-length, green 
           silk gown, Girlie resembles a priceless emerald in this 
           dim “man cave” of charcoal-gray and black suits.

           Moving across the room, “L” approaches Girlie, her fully 
           exposed back an aching vision of female softness that 
           would drive even the most powerful of men to crawl over 
           glass for but one gentle touch.

           Shimmering against the spots of red, blue and yellow 
           issuing from the spellbinding skyscrapers behind her, 
           Girlie turns as if having been greeted by “L.”   
           She offers a sweet, red lipstick grin, her hair curled 
           and piled high, a few loose strands playfully dangling.

           In slow motion, Girlie reaches out her hand and accepts a 
           nondescript business card.

           Genuinely, she glances up, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA. 

           The red and blue lights from Columbus Circle grow 
           brighter as Girlie presses the straw of her vodka-soda to 
           her LUXURIOUS LIPS and takes a sip, still staring 
           straight ahead. 

           Red and blue pulses from the skyscrapers-

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT

           -Red and blue pulses from the emergency lights.

                                 GIRLIE
                        He didn’t ask for my number or anything. 
                        He just... he gave me his card.

                                 CLARK
                        Well...? There you go.

                                 GIRLIE
                        No... that’s my point. He gave me his 
                        card and I e-mailed him, not the other 
                        way around.

                                 CLARK
                        Uh-huh. Yeah. He’s good.

           Her head spinning- 

                                 GIRLIE
                        No, but- 

                                 CLARK
                        I bet that man gives out a shit ton of 
                        cards, wherever he goes. It’s a numbers 
                        game. Sometimes he gets the candy, 
                        sometimes he don’t. But you better 
                        believe he’s dishing out those cards like 
                        it’s fuckin’ ice cream. And when you 
                        contacted him, sweetie, you gave away 
                        your first piece of candy. Can’t blame a 
                        guy for wantin’ more.
                                (after a pause)
                        Think about it. His card had a business e-
                        mail on it, am I right?
           No reply.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        How long it take for him to switch you 
                        over to somethin’ more private?

           Clearly mentally dissecting her first interaction with 
           “L,” something starts to take hold in Girlie.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Blink of a fuckin’ eye, am I right?

           With the utmost sincerity, Clark turns to her again, his 
           face slightly distorted from a few scratches embedded 
           within the plexiglass.  

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        He wasn’t lookin’ for love, sweetheart. 
                        He wasn’t lookin’ to replace his wife. 
                        Who the hell wants to go to all that 
                        trouble? Nah. He’s all set up, the way he 
                        wants to be. He was just lookin’ for 
                        another toy to play with. And he found 
                        it. 
                                (after a pause)
                        For all your smarts and all the time and 
                        effort and everything you’ve clearly done 
                        to make yourself a fuckin’ fortress... 
                        somehow... you have found yourself back 
                        in that bathtub again. Your hands and 
                        legs all tied up. Fightin’ so hard to get 
                        free.

           Attempting to lighten the mood-

                        One to two. I’m catchin’ up to ya.

           Girlie forces a smile.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Touché. 

           Quietly, Girlie turns her gaze to the window again. 

           Clark notices her swallow, hard. Clearly, he’s gone a bit 
           too far.

           Red and blue. 

           Clark lets out a very soft EXHALE. 

           He stares at Girlie, her sweet, yet militant face, her 
           red lips... 
           And his brow furrows at himself.

                                 CLARK
                        Listen... I’m sorry. I run my mouth off 
                        sometimes... I’m too honest. That’s my 
                        problem.

                        It’s just somethin’ people don’t wanna 
                        talk about. You know? Who fuckin’ talks 
                        about this shit? No one.

           Red and blue.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Look... I can tell you’re a wonderful 
                        person. A human. Askin’ my name and 
                        shit... You got a good heart. I can see 
                        that. That’s why I gotta tell ya... 
                        you’re better off walkin’ away. Honestly. 
                        I mean, here you are all sad and shit... 
                        and you just gotta know... that guy of 
                        yours, right now, in this moment, if any 
                        sweet thing came along - I don’t care if 
                        she tells him to meet her in a fuckin’ 
                        outhouse - he’d be there, with his pants 
                        down, in two minutes. In two fuckin’ 
                        minutes. And he’d be pissed to have to 
                        wait that long. It’s just how men are 
                        made. How we’re wired. I mean... the way 
                        you look right now, that face of yours... 
                        It’s why I don’t go for the full candy no 
                        more. I mean, I’ll take a b.j. now and 
                        again, but... a lot of you girls these 
                        days, you grow a conscience in the 
                        mornin’, and I can’t deal with that no 
                        more. I’m too old.

           Girlie pulls an old receipt - a receipt for three IPA 
           beers and a burger - from her backpack and buries her gum 
           inside it. 

           After only a beat, Clark presses forward, a slave to 
           curiosity.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)

                                 GIRLIE
                        Old.

                                 CLARK

                                (after a pause, plainly)
                        He could be my father, yes.

                                 CLARK
                        So... I’m guessin’ you don’t have a 
                        daddy, right?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I mean, I do, but- 

                                 CLARK
                        But you don’t have a daddy. And you 
                        wanted him to be your daddy, am I right?

                        You call him “Daddy”?

           Girlie forces another melancholy grin.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a pause)
                        Two to two.

                        You call him “Daddy.” 

                                 GIRLIE
                        I do.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s hot.

                                 GIRLIE
                        It’s fucked up.
                                 CLARK
                        Nothin’ fucked up about that. I mean... I 
                        don’t know much about psychology or 
                        whatnot, but it don’t take rocket science 
                        to know that you got a little girl inside 
                        you. The little girl you used to be. She 
                        didn’t go nowhere. And that little girl 
                        didn’t have a daddy, but she still 
                        fuckin’ needs a daddy, right? 
                                (a pause)
                        So, you meet this guy, what, with his 
                        bald head - whatever the hell he’s got 
                        goin’ on - would make most girls your age 
                        wanna puke, but not you. ‘Cause he’s 
                        everything you missed out on back in the 
                        day. He’s all the things your friends 
                        had, but you didn’t fuckin’ have. All 
                        your friends who had daddies that gave 
                        ‘em allowance, keys to the car, a credit 
                        card... somethin’ shiny and pretty 
                        anytime they did somethin’ right. You 
                        were happy for your friends - you’re not 
                        a bitch - but let’s be honest, it was 
                        hard for you. I get it. I really do know.
                                (a pause)
                        And now, years later, yeah, you meet this 
                        older guy, and the little girl on the 
                        inside, she just wants her daddy to hold 
                        her, tell her nice things, read her 
                        bedtime stories. But, the grown woman you 
                        are on the outside wants, well... She 
                        wants a different kind of bedtime story, 
                        if you catch my drift. Put the two 
                        together, and that guy gets a chance at 
                        having somethin’ he would have never been 
                        able to fuckin’ touch otherwise.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a pause)
                        Me.

                        You.
                                (after a beat)
                        He’s a lucky son-of-a-bitch to have 
                        gotten your candy. If you don’t mind my 
                        sayin’.

           Clark pulls the cab forward a quarter of a mile, the 
           emergency lights growing closer than ever before.

           Red and blue.

                        three places they’ve lived if you set 
                        your mind to it.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a beat)
                        Why do you care?

                                 CLARK
                        Huh?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Why do you care if he has kids or a wife 
                        or any of it? What does it matter to you?

           Clark sincerely weighs the question.

                                 CLARK
                        I guess... I don’t know... Guess I’ve 
                        always been curious. About people. Gets 
                        me into trouble, I’m not gonna lie. I got 
                        a mouth on me, and I need to learn how to 
                        zip it now and again, I do know that. 
                                (a thoughtful beat)
                        I guess, I-uh... To be honest, I drive 
                        this beast around and... can’t do much 
                        else but think, you know? And when you 
                        think too much, you ask too many 
                        questions. Nothin’ special about it. 
                                (a pause)
                        But, hey, it ain’t all for nothin’, I 
                        mean - who else you gonna talk to about 
                        this shit? 
                                (another pause)
                        Not like you’re ever gonna see me again.

           Girlie looks down on her own fingernails perfectly 
           manicured in a very cool gray hue. 

           But one of her nails, her right thumbnail - the one she 
           bites on - has been slightly chipped. 

           Silence.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I found one picture of her. They’re 
                        pretty private.

                                 CLARK
                        They both in the picture?
                                 GIRLIE
                        They’re at some corporate thing. Like an 
                        award thing. 

                                 CLARK
                        What are they doin’ in the picture?

                                 GIRLIE
                        They’re just... sitting next to each 
                        other... smiling at the camera.

                                 CLARK
                        And?

                                 GIRLIE
                        And... they look... normal. They just 
                        look normal.

                                 CLARK
                        He win the award?

                                 GIRLIE
                        He did.

                                 CLARK
                        What, he some kinda big-shot or 
                        somethin’? Someone I’d recognize?

           No reply.

                        How old is she? The wife?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Late forties, I would say.

                                 CLARK
                        She pretty?

                                 GIRLIE
                                (sincerely)
                        She looks really sweet.

                                 CLARK
                                (a laugh)
                        So, she’s not pretty.

                                 GIRLIE
                        She’s lovely. She has this huge smile, 
                        like a really happy smile. 

           Girlie thoughtfully grazes the rough edge of the chip in 
           the nail polish of her right thumb.
                                 GIRLIE (CONT'D)

                        I looked at that photo for a long time. 
                        It gave me this strange feeling like, 
                        like maybe... maybe she and I could have 
                        been friends.

                                 CLARK
                                (genuinely)
                        Yeah. Maybe. Another time, another place. 
                        Maybe.
                                (a beat)
                        You meet the kids?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Oh, God, no.

                                 CLARK
                        You find pictures?

                                 GIRLIE
                        He shows me pictures.

                                 CLARK
                        Fuck. Like on his phone?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah. Video, too.

                                 CLARK
                                (actually surprised)
                        No kiddin’. That is some fuckin’ trust 
                        right there. That is some real fuckin’ 
                        trust. 
                                (a thoughtful beat)
                        Huh. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        What?

                                 CLARK
                        You did it. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        What did I do?

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t know. But you did somethin’. 

           Girlie’s expression begs for Clark to explain further.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        He let you in. As far as anyone in your 
                        position can possibly go.
                                 GIRLIE
                        And what am I supposed to do with that?

                                 CLARK
                        Look. It don’t change nothin’. But it is 
                        a compliment.

           Silence.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        The kids cute?

                                 GIRLIE
                        They’re adorable. 

                                 CLARK
                        Boys? Girls?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Twin boys and a girl.

                                 CLARK
                        Huh.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a beat)
                        He showed me this... this video of his 
                        daughter, dancing. Three years old and... 
                        she’s wearing this red cape. Like a 
                        princess cape or something. And she was 
                        just twirling and twirling.

                                 CLARK
                        Dancin’ for her daddy. That’s sweet. You 
                        ever dance like that for your daddy? Your 
                        real daddy, I mean. When you were a kid?

                                 GIRLIE
                                (simply)
                        No.

           Picking at the chip in her nail polish, Girlie 
           accidentally causes a larger piece to break off. 

           She throws the piece of gray polish to the ground.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        I had a cape though. A long, purple cape. 

           As Girlie loses herself in another hazy, distant memory, 
           the emergency lights pulse, this time in what feels like 
           a circular motion, as if on a dizzying carousel ride.  

           Red and blue, red and blue circle, circle, circle until-
           EXT. DREAMLIKE VOID. OKLAHOMA BACKYARD - DAY (MEMORY)

           Red and blue blend together to make purple - purple that 
           circles around and around and around.

           From within the void - filtered through what looks to be 
           an old, VHS recording - we see LITTLE GIRLIE, 3, in a 
           white t-shirt, white cotton underwear, pink cowboys 
           boots, and a long purple cape, spinning around and around 
           and around.

           Little Girlie suddenly looks into the camera, beaming at 
           whomever is filming - the sheer joy of childhood just 
           exploding from the innocence of her sweet, little face.

           After one, toothy grin, Little Girlie begins to twirl 
           again, around and around and around and around until the 
           hue of the purple of her cape begins to be torn apart, 
           separating once more into-

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT

           -Red and blue. 

           Girlie swallows, hard.

           Red and blue.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Made me think I could fly.

                                 CLARK
                        Cape wasn’t lyin’. You can fly just fine.

           After a silence-

                                 GIRLIE
                        I still have it. 

                                 CLARK
                        What?

                                 GIRLIE
                        My purple cape. It’s the only thing I 
                        kept. From back then.

                                 CLARK
                        Ever put it on?

                                 GIRLIE
                        No.
                                 CLARK
                        You should. Every once in a while.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah. Why the fuck not? 

                                 GIRLIE
                        It’s under my bed. In a garbage bag.

                                 CLARK
                        Pull that shit out, put that shit on, and 
                        walk down the fuckin’ street. In this 
                        town? No one’s gonna bat an eye.

           Silence.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        So, what about the twins? What do they 
                        do?

                                 GIRLIE
                        They’re silly. They like to shake their 
                        butts at the camera and say, “Nanny-Nanny-
                        boo-boo.”

                                 CLARK
                        I thought it was “Nanna-Nanna-boo-boo”?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I don’t know. They say, “Nanny-Nanny.”

                                 CLARK
                        Guess it don’t matter either way. They’re 
                        still gonna get a pop on the ass for 
                        wavin’ it around.

           The two chuckle lightly together.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Nothin’ “Nanny” or “Nanna” can do ‘bout 
                        it, am I right?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Ah, they seem like good kids.

           The two lock eyes.
                                 CLARK
                                (with sincerity)
                        And you get the feelin’ you coulda been 
                        friends. With the kids. Another time, 
                        another place.

           With a sad smile, Girlie simply nods.

           Another ocean wave of true empathy crashing over Clark’s 
           countenance.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, well... He can pretend to be a 
                        daddy to you, but he’s gotta be a real 
                        daddy to them. So... you get why you 
                        ain’t goin’ to Greece. 

           Girlie looks down. Her fidgeting has causes her perfect 
           manicure to look a bit homely.

           She throws another piece of gray polish to the floor.

           THRUST!

           “D.”

           As Clark slowly pulls forward, the emergency lights pound 
           upon their stark faces. 

           We don’t ever see the wreckage, but the reaction on Clark 
           and Girlie’s faces suggests that it’s bad.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Shit. That ain’t no fender bender.

           Girlie moves to the left side of the taxi, peering out.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 495 AND BEYOND - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           MALE POLICE OFFICER #1 SPARKS and drops a few bright red 
           flares, throwing them to the black asphalt as MALE POLICE 
           OFFICER #2 waves the yellow cab forward.

           The cab carefully maneuvers around the RED and BLUE, 
           gifting us a glimpse of Clark and Girlie each gazing out 
           their windows with a reverent fear and awe of mortality, 
           their faces aglow from the fire of the red flares.

           As the cab begins to pick up speed, the fixed street 
           lamps morph into shooting stars of passing light, the 
           HUUUUUUMMMMMMMM of rubber kissing asphalt beginning its 
           comforting song again.
           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Still rattled by the accident, Clark has fallen silent.

           In the back, Girlie has habitually chipped away at all 
           her nail polish.

           Her manicure now looks truly horrible.

           There it is again. 

           The perfectly imperfect. 

           Another glimpse of the poetry that is the human 
           condition.

           Putting her thumbnail between her teeth, Girlie stares at 
           her phone for a moment of hesitation. 

           Suddenly, she flips it over and unlocks it to find new 
           gray-bubbles awaiting.

           The phone illuminates her beautiful, conflicted face. 

           She types, “Still stuck in traffic.” 

           She sends.

           A new gray-bubble immediately appears, not so surprising 
           this time. 

           Clearly, “L” has been waiting.

           Softening, Girlie seems touched by this small glimpse of 
           sincerity. 

           A hint of a smile forms in the left corner of her mouth.

                                 GIRLIE

                        Tell me u are wet

           In the drafting section, Girlie composes a long text with 
           rapid fire: 

           “Can you please use real words? U=You. R=Are. K=Okay. 
           There’s a difference between your and you’re; their, 
           they’re and there; its and it’s! And what is up with your 
           punctuation?! You are not fucking twelve, you’re a grown-
           ass man. You’re the fucking face of a huge fucking 
           company, please fucking text like one!”

           After a beat, Girlie deletes the entire message and 
           drafts: 

           “Yeah. I’m wet. I’m so wet, Daddy. Thinking of you.” 

           She sends.

           Girlie locks her phone.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Girlie sits in silence, the wheels in her brain turning, 
           turning, turning.

           HUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMM - sings the rubber on asphalt.

           Looking up, Girlie studies Clark who seems completely 
           lost in thought - his eyes on the dark road ahead, his 
           thumbs gently TAPPING on the steering wheel again.

           Taking off her leather jacket, Girlie drapes it over her 
           lap. 

           With her eyes on Clark, Girlie unbuttons and unzips her 
           jeans, the act completely covered by her jacket.

           Then, shielded in shadow, Girlie carefully lifts her hips 
           and slides down her jeans just enough to barely open her 
           legs under the cover of black leather.

           Her eyes still darting to Clark now and again, Girlie 
           unlocks her phone, opens her camera, turns the flash on 
           and puts her phone between her legs.

           The act proves enormously sexy, greatly amplified by the 
           thrill and danger of potentially getting caught.

           Lifting her hips again, Girlie pulls her jeans back up. 

           Clark takes a sip of soda, none the wiser. 

           Girlie has taken three photos of her smoothly shaved 
           “pink.” 

           She flips through the three, each significantly blurred 
           under the tent of her black, leather jacket. 

           She chooses the least blurry photo, yet, after trying out 
           a few filters, doesn’t seem to be satisfied.

           Girlie deletes all three images and, as a last resort, 
           opens - “All Photos.”

           Scrolling through her albums, Girlie lands on a series of 
           boob-selfies she’s previously taken in the privacy of her 
           own apartment.

           One image showcases Girlie’s bare chested reflection in 
           her bathroom mirror.

           Selecting the photo, Girlie takes to editing.
           GIRLIE’S POV ON HER PHONE

           Girlie ZOOMS IN on her soft, young tits, cropping the 
           photo. 

           She chooses a filter which darkens the image a bit (to 
           make it appear as if it was taken in the back of a cab) 
           then sends the photo to “L.”

           Within an instant-

           REVERSE ON GIRLIE

           A junkie impatient for her next fix, Girlie waits for a 
           reply, her eyes wide with desperation.

                        Did you let your driver watch you?

           The screen suddenly goes dark as Girlie locks her phone.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Swallowing hard again, Girlie chokes back a wave of 
           emotion, a direct and highly stubborn refusal to cry. 

           Her chest pants up and down, but she doesn’t make a 
           sound. 

           Finally, the wave of emotion passes as Girlie’s face 
           hardens with her signature, militant resolve. 

                                 CLARK (O.S.)
                        So... what else did your sister do? 
                        Besides tie you up?
           Lifting her chin, Girlie faces Clark without the 
           slightest trace of weakness.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (simply)

                        best. 

                                 CLARK

                        Yeah, but she was still a kid... She was 
                        only seventeen when I went to live with 
                        her. 

                                 CLARK
                        You lived with her?

                                 GIRLIE

                                 CLARK
                        Can’t imagine any Oklahoma judge sayin’ 
                        that was all right.

                                 GIRLIE
                        No. No one said it was all right. But 
                        that’s what happened.

                                 CLARK

                        shouldn’t have done?

                        No... it was never like that.

                        just... never touched me.

                                 CLARK
                        Not ever?

                                 GIRLIE
                        It’s actually an easy thing to do, not 
                        touch someone.

                                 CLARK
                        Not one hug? Not once?

                                 GIRLIE
                        It didn’t have to be a hug. Pat on the 
                        back would have been nice.

           Clark nods. 

           He seems to greatly understand.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                                (a thoughtful beat)
                        But... the day we left... I remember my 
                        sister was getting in the car. She jumped 
                        in her car and my father was sitting on 
                        the porch. And just before I opened the 
                        door, the door to the front seat... I 
                        turned around and I looked at him. And he 
                        looked at me. And then he... he got up 
                        and he walked over to me... 

           She stares at the small, dark TV screen in front of her. 

           There, the reflection of Girlie’s present self, sitting 
           in a cab, begins to morph into-

           EXT. DREAMLIKE VOID. OKLAHOMA FRONT YARD - DAY (MEMORY)

           -YOUNG GIRLIE, 6, in the distance, getting into an old, 
           blue Buick.

           GIRLIE’S FATHER’S POV

           Standing from a porch chair, her father moves toward the 
           Buick, Young Girlie’s back to him.

           Though the camera is undeniably tracking her father’s 
           POV, we should never see even the slightest glimpse of 
           what this man looks like.
           Dressed in shabby, green-faded overalls and a “Hands 
           Across America,” hand-me-down t-shirt, Young Girlie’s 
           straggly hair hosts countless “rats’ nests,” indicating 
           this little girl hasn’t had her hair brushed in months.

           Moving across the backyard, her father approaches Young 
           Girlie. 

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        ...and he reached out... 

           The little girl turns as if having been called to by her 
           father, her lips stained with bright red Kool-Aid, a few 
           loose strands of hair dangling - a pathetic reflection of 
           her future, New York City self. 

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        ...and he shook my hand. 

           In slow motion, Young Girlie reaches out her hand and 
           moves her arm up and down, as if accepting a hand shake 
           from her father.

           Young Girlie glances up, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA. 

           This entire scene should act as a haunting mirror-image 
           of what we saw at the Mandarin Oriental when “L” crossed 
           the room and handed Girlie his business card. 

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        I’d never shaken anyone’s hand before, I 
                        was six...

           Young Girlie allows her Kool-Aid stained lips (stained 
           well outside the natural lines of her mouth) to curl up 
           in a very shy smirk.

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT

           Girlie purses her red painted lips, crisply applied 
           perfectly within the natural lines of her mouth. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        But I knew what it meant.

                        last year. Got my license, my-uh

                        Nassau. Sat on the edge of a boat and - 
                        they make you fall backward, right? You 
                        fall back in the water, and, once you 
                        find yourself upright again, you start to

                        down, down you go... I mean, I didn’t go 
                        too far.

                        Don’t have the trainin’ for the crazy 
                        stuff - shipwrecks and whatnot. But I did 
                        swim around this-uh, this mountain of 
                        coral, what with all these little fuckin’ 
                        clown fish and angel fish and barracuda 
                        and sponges and snapper and grouper.
                                (after a beat)
                        Saw a blue whale even. Yeah. A big ass 
                        blue whale passed right by us, not too 
                        far away, just swimmin’ along like it was 
                        nothin’. Fuckin’ poetry, that shit. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Wow.

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, wow. That was a big fuckin’ WOW! 
                        But... I don’t know if I’ll do it again. 

                                 GIRLIE

                        Takes a lotta guts to breathe under 
                        water. That’s the biggest challenge. 
                        Tellin’ your brain that it’s okay to 
                        allow your body to do this thing it 
                        wasn’t fuckin’ made to do. Had to take 
                        ten minutes just to breathe calmly, you 
                        know, in and out, in and out. Tellin’ 
                        myself I wasn’t gonna die. Tellin’ myself 
                        I could always surface if shit went down. 
                        Wasn’t afraid to see a shark, wasn’t 
                        afraid to be left alone, was just... 
                        mostly afraid of breathin’. In and out. 
                        In and out. That’s some scary shit right 
                        there. Findin’ yourself afraid to 
                        breathe.

                        Always liked sharks. Did you see one?

                        Great White. Thirteen feet long. Two, 
                        three tons. Swims around me, lookin’ for 
                        lunch. Until I look that fucker in the 
                        eye and give him the middle finger. Just 
                        like that, shark swims away. He knew 
                        what’s what. Fuck, I love that story. 
                                 GIRLIE

                        I do wanna go to Japan one day. Heard a 
                        lot about it. Heard about how, in that 
                        culture, if you are drunk or if you are a 
                        foreigner, you’re forgiven for makin’ an 
                        ass of yourself. And if you are both 
                        drunk and a foreigner, all the more mercy 
                        is extended your way. Which is great for 
                        me, ‘cause, I love gettin’ shit-faced in 
                        a new city.
                                (a pause)
                        They also got these-uh, these vendin’ 
                        machines with used bloomers in ‘em.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Bloomers?

                                 CLARK
                        Panties in vending machines! Least that’s 
                        what I heard. And I gotta see that shit.

                                 GIRLIE
                        They can’t really be used.

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t give a fuck either way. It’ll be 
                        mind over matter on that one.

                        wanted to learn how to play chess. 

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah. I think I’d be good at it.

           SLOW ZOOM IN ON GIRLIE

           The following monologue is delivered almost directly into 
           the camera, as a confession or admission.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (laced with a sad longing)

                        dance... Like get tossed around and 
                        stuff. It looks like a lot of fun... I-
                        uh... I’ve been thinking about having an 
                        herb garden in my window... and actually

                        birds. Someone that can recognize their 
                        calls... I want to learn how to play the 
                        ukulele, and not be afraid to sing... 
                        even though I can’t really sing... I want 
                        to see virgin rainforest before it 
                        disappears... some place in Brazil, 
                        maybe... I want to hablo español

                        and Rome and Berlin and Barcelona like

                        to stand at the edge of a fucking cliff 
                        in Greece... and BASE jump off that

           Clark laughs back.

                        What? Time for me to ante up? 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Damn straight.

                        How many chips you got on the table?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Two. We’re tied, remember? Two to two.

                                 CLARK
                        And you raise me one?

                                 GIRLIE
                        And it better be a good one.

                                 CLARK
                        I give you a good one... you’ll match me?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’m not gonna let you win, that’s for 
                        damn sure.

                                 CLARK
                        All right, all right, I can hang.

           Clark sincerely takes a moment to think, but nothing 
           comes.

                                 GIRLIE
                        And it has to be something personal, not 
                        one of your little anecdotes.

                                 CLARK
                        Well, fuck, I don’t know.

           Clark stares out the windshield.

           CLARK’S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

           The white lines in the dark asphalt - the separation of 
           the lanes - guide the cab onward around a curve.

                        Wanna know how I met my first wife?

           Clark chuckles at the memory, something he clearly hasn’t 
           thought of in a long time.

                        She was clubbin’ with her girlfriends. 
                        Ladies’ night or some shit. They were all 
                        in these tight dresses, and high heels, 
                        and smelled like flowers and booze and 
                        sweat. Fuck. I was in Heaven. All these 
                        pretty ladies, crammed in my cab, sittin’ 
                        on each other’s laps, talkin’ so loud, 
                        laughin’ and screamin’ out the window, 
                        askin’ me to turn up the music like some 
                        disco ball was gonna drop from a fuckin’ 
                        moon-roof. And, I gotta be honest -  My 
                        cock was so hard, just poudin’ in my 
                        panties, ‘cause odds were, I was gettin’ 
                        lucky that night. And if I wasn’t lucky, 
                        I’d have plenty of good material to rub 
                        one out later, you know?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Right.

                                 CLARK
                        And then, out of nowhere, blondie in the 
                        back doubles over and empties out her 
                        stomach. Which wasn’t holdin’ much, I am 
                        thankful to report. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        What happened?

                                 CLARK
                        Not much you can do. I drop ‘em off, 
                        light the “Off Duty,” get back to the 
                        garage, hose down the cab - and there it 
                        was. Her purse right there on the floor.

                        Like... when somethin’ happens and you 
                        gotta choice. That choice to get pissed 
                        off or the choice to laugh it off. And... 
                        she’d laugh. She’d choose to laugh every 
                        time.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah.

           Recalling the memory for the first time in years-

                                (a chuckle)
                        She did once. She-uh... she poured cold 
                        water on me when I was in the shower. A 
                        bucket of ice water - Niagara Falls - 
                        right down on top of me. And I had that 
                        same choice, you know, that choice 
                        whether to get pissed off or to laugh it 
                        off.

                        What did you choose?
           Clark grins, his gaze softly focused on the Interstate 
           ahead, but his mind elsewhere.

                                 CLARK
                        I laughed my fuckin’ ass off. Chased her 
                        ‘round the house in my birthday suit. She 
                        was screamin’ like a little girl, like we 
                        were playin’ tag or some shit... Finally 
                        caught her in the kitchen...  
                                (a thoughtful pause)
                        That was a good day.

                        summer day, you know? Not too 
                        complicated. Just... a beer and a bag of

                                 CLARK
                        Come on. There’s gotta be at least one 
                        more thing you haven’t told me. Something 
                        you are just dyin’ to say out loud.

           Girlie sits back again, thinking.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Take your time. Not like I’m goin’ 
                        nowhere.

           As Girlie sinks into the seat, she looks out the window 
           again, looking very lonely in the shadows, her backpack 
           her only company.

           The light pollution of New York City has grown outside 
           the windows.
           EXT. INTERSTATE 495 - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           TRACKING WITH THE CAB - the lights of Manhattan 
           shimmering closely in the background - we round a bend 
           and disappear into the darkness of the Queens Midtown 
           Tunnel, a passageway just under the flowing East River. 

           These two souls have literally just gone underwater.

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           This claustrophobic tube - covered wall to ceiling in off-
           white tiling - bathes the cab in that same sickening 
           yellow cloud of toxic light pollution. 

           The HUUUUUUMMMMM of rubber kissing asphalt echoes in the 
           tunnel, nauseatingly.

           Girlie notices that a few of the tiles covering the 
           inside of the tunnel have fallen. 

           Perfectly imperfect.

           Like her nails.

           Like Clark’s dandruff.

           There, in the yellowed dim, Girlie impulsively flips over 
           her phone and unlocks it.

           ECU OF GIRLIE

           Girlie sits in shock, that last gray-bubble reflected in 
           her eyes. 

           She draws a soft INHALE.

           TEXT MESSAGES CONTINUE FRAMING HER FACE:

           Not knowing what else to do, Girlie replies-

           Girlie lingers a moment more.
           Slowly, but surely, she finally types, “Goodnight.” 

           She sends.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (TEXT)
                        Goodnight.

           Girlie locks her phone just as-

           EXT. EAST 42ND STREET AND 1ST AVENUE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -the cab emerges from the bowls of the Queens Midtown 
           Tunnel into the bright bustle of Midtown Manhattan. 

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           As they head south on 1st Avenue, then west on 37th 
           Street - every color, across the spectrum, gleefully 
           bursts into the cab, dancing and flirting and teasing 
           away the shadows.

           The NOISE outside has unapologetically swelled as they 
           pass A GROUP OF TATTOOED MALE TEENAGERS loudly LAUGHING, 
           pinching and hitting one another as they skip down the 
           street. 

           Every other human - from police officers to punk teens - 
           in this ride has been male. 

           Girlie is the only woman in this entire story, imprisoned 
           in a world of men.

           A stop light turns from green to red, causing the cab to 
           come to a complete stop. 

           Girlie buries her phone in her backpack. 

           Clark’s eyes beckon in the rear-view-

                                 CLARK
                        Got a few more minutes, if you still 
                        wanna play for the win.

            A bit rattled, Girlie sits in silence. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What’s left? What haven’t you told me?

           Clark waits patiently as Girlie wrestles with something. 
           Finally, the red light turns green and the two are moving 
           again.

                                 GIRLIE

           CLOSE UP ON GIRLIE

           The glaring lights of Manhattan have demystified the 
           details of this beauty, offering a vulnerability unlike 
           we’ve ever seen in Girlie.

                                 GIRLIE
                        She was working... and so... my sister 
                        and I, we got drunk. We got really drunk. 
                        We sat outside her trailer, and... She 
                        has these little chili pepper lights - 
                        like Christmas lights or something - 
                        draped all around this, this porch-cover-
                        thing. And... we sat there, in these old 
                        beach chairs, and just... drank and 
                        drank.

           Though he has to pay attention to the road, Clark is 
           clearly right there with her.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        And... it was incredible, because... 
                        after all this time of not talking... 
                        there was never a pause.

                                 CLARK
                        You talk about the bathtub?

                                (with a laugh)
                        We did! I brought it up and she just... 
                        laughed. She laughed so hard, tears 
                        streaming down her face. She didn’t 
                        apologize or anything. It was amazing.

                                 CLARK
                        What else you talk about?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Everything. We talked about the perms our 
                        mom used to give us, sitting on a stool 
                        in the kitchen, with this old, pink towel 
                        draped over our shoulders...

                        That smell... that perm smell... it’d 
                        linger for days.

                                 CLARK
                        What else?

                                 GIRLIE
                        We talked about... the shitty rug in our 
                        living room... the antlers on the wall, 
                        the TV antenna... everything.
                                (a beat)
                        After our mom left... my sister started 
                        doing these, these rain dances in the 
                        front yard. At least... that’s what she 
                        called them. They weren’t real rain 
                        dances, they weren’t ceremonial or 
                        choreographed or anything. Basically... 
                        she would take off her shoes and just... 
                        dance her ass off... expecting it to 
                        rain. 

           Girlie swallows, hard.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        When she and I moved to Woodward... she 
                        invited me to do them. For years the two 
                        of us would take off our shoes, wipe mud 
                        across our cheeks like war paint, and... 
                        dance around our yard... asking the sky 
                        to change.

                                 CLARK

                        And there I am again, suddenly, in 
                        Oklahoma, sitting outside this random 
                        trailer and getting drunk with my sister. 
                        And my brain is just exploding, 
                        because... once and for all, I know for 
                        certain that’s it all real. I didn’t make 
                        this shit up. It actually happened. My 
                        sister’s the proof. I have the proof 
                        right there in front of me, sitting in 
                        this flamingo beach chair, drinking 
                        Merlot and finishing my sentences.

                        but they were really beautiful. Just this 
                        string of red and green and yellow and 
                        blue, all around us. And there were 
                        crickets. I’d almost forgotten what 
                        crickets sounded like, but there they 
                        were. And they were so loud. Like this... 
                        like a wall of sound. But a good sound. A 
                        sound you want to listen to... And... my 
                        sister opens another bottle. And we start 
                        talking about that day... the day she 
                        took me away. And I told my side of the 
                        story. And she told her side.

           EXT. 37TH AND 5TH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Coming upon 5th Avenue, a stop light turns from green to 
           red, forcing the cab to halt. 

           Within the intersection, the shadows of countless 
           NONDESCRIPT NEW YORKERS race in both directions. 

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           With extreme empathy, Clark turns around, engaging again 
           in a real human connection with Girlie.

                                 CLARK
                        What did she tell ya?

           The hurried shadows of NEW YORKERS cross in front and 
           behind the cab, the modern world with its lights and 
           sound and movement very much encroaching on this sacred, 
           hiding place.

                        She told me that my father was on the 
                        porch that day. She told me that we 
                        passed him on our way to her car. And 
                        then... she got in the car, and then, I 
                        got in the car. And then... we drove

                        isn’t real. I made the whole thing up in 
                        my mind somehow... But, when I think back 
                        on it, it doesn’t make any sense, 
                        because... in my mind, I can see it so 
                        clearly... even the feel of his hand... I 
                        remember thinking it felt like sandpaper.

                        and catfish and ramen noodles. I remember 
                        the feel of my mother’s fingernails when 
                        she’d rub the back of my neck. I remember 
                        my father’s breath - the smell of chew, 
                        mixed with coffee, mixed with hamburger. 
                        I can remember every detail of that 
                        place... but not the moment I left it.

           From outside, the reflection of stationary lights from 
           Fifth Ave shine across Girlie’s face through the glass. 
           There’s a hint of what resembles strings of colorful 
           lights. 

           The reflections grow brighter until-

           EXT. DREAMLIKE VOID. OKLAHOMA TRAILER - NIGHT (MEMORY)

           Against a dark night, the bright haze of yellow, blue, 
           green and red twinkle like shining stars in strings of 
           festive lights, shaped like chili peppers.

           The lights dim again, bringing us back to-

           EXT. 37TH AND 5TH, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           -mere reflections upon Girlie’s face.

           The red stoplight turns green, allowing the yellow cab to 
           cross Fifth Avenue.

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Still gazing out the window-

                                 GIRLIE
                                (after a beat)
                        We did a rain dance last night. My sister 
                        and I.

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Drunk off our asses, we took off our 
                        shoes and just started dancing around her 
                        trailer. 

                                 CLARK
                        Did it rain?

                                 GIRLIE
                        That’s just the thing... Two weeks ago, 
                        when I flew to Oklahoma... 

           Her eyes gloss over as she fights back tears, her chest 
           expanding with delicate, quickening PANTS - INHALE, 
           EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE.

           With that same, stubborn resiliency, Girlie attempts to 
           swallow back this ocean wave of emotion. 
           Yet, this time, her body refuses to obey, screaming, “If 
           you do not let me cry, my heart is going to explode!” 

           All goes SILENT, as if the air has been sucked out of the 
           scene again.

           There in the quiet, a gentle RINGING begins, like the 
           ringing in one’s ear.

           RIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNG.

           Until, finally, Girlie allows but one, small tear to 
           dance down her cheek.

           The RINGING stops for one more breath of SILENCE.

           Then-

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        ...I was pregnant.

           Clark simply nods his head.

                                 CLARK
                                (simply)
                        What’d your “daddy” have to say about 
                        that?

                                 GIRLIE
                        I never told him... I never told anyone.

                                 CLARK
                                (carefully)
                        You get rid of the baby?

                                 GIRLIE
                        No... 

           A few more tears just barely escape Girlie’s eyes, 
           carving a small, thin salt stain down each cheek. 

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        It got rid of me... First day in 
                        Oklahoma, I started bleeding.
                                (a beat)
                        My sister didn’t know. I just told her I 
                        was having a bad period. Like a really 
                        shitty period... She let me sleep a lot. 
                        Gave me a heating pad and ice cream. 
                                (a pause)
                        But... after seven days, when I just kept 
                        bleeding... I had to hide the tampons. 
                        Pretend it was just a regular period that 
                        ended... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        I had to get up and go out and meet all 
                        her friends and eat barbecue and drink 
                        beer and go to a Thunder game... feeling 
                        like shit. 
                                (a beat)
                        I mean... I wasn’t going to keep it. I’d 
                        already made up my mind that I wasn’t 
                        going to keep it. And I wasn’t going to 
                        tell anyone. And then... when it 
                        happened, when it just happened on its 
                        own... I was so relieved. I’d never been 
                        so relieved in my life... I still don’t 
                        know what to do with that.

           Clark gently turns right on 9th Ave, heading north.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        My sister had no idea, but - And I know 
                        this sounds so fucking stupid, but - Last 
                        night, when we were dancing... in my 
                        mind... I really did beg the sky to rain 
                        down on me. 

           The glow of passing lights outside the window begin to 
           smear into what resembles a living Monet painting, 
           stunningly surreal. 

           As we press closer to the glass of the taxi cab-

           INT./EXT. OKLAHOMA TRAILER - NIGHT (MEMORY)

           -we peer out the dirt covered window of a small trailer, 
           the outside laced with chili pepper lights, to witness 
           the awe and beauty of two FIGURES off in the distance.

           Two WOMEN.

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        To clean me... 

           Through a torrential downpour of what resembles gray and 
           blue water color, these two women dance in slow motion in 
           the middle of a green field of tall grass, shrouded in 
           the cover of night.

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        To wash it all away...

           UTTER SILENCE.

           One of the women - Girlie - lifts her hands and raises 
           her head to the sky, as if being baptized by the rain.
           Pulling away from the glass of the trailer window-

           INT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT 

           -Girlie pulls her face from the taxi window, large pools 
           of tears welling in her eyes.

                                 GIRLIE (V.O.)
                        ...All of it, the whole fucking thing - 
                        his fucking business card, my fucking e-
                        mail, that fucking dinner at the fucking 
                        Ace Hotel - every word we ever whispered - 
                        I asked the rain to take it all away...
                                (a pause)
                        And then... this morning, when I woke 
                        up... I wasn’t bleeding anymore. After 
                        two weeks... it finally stopped.

                                 CLARK
                        Rain dance worked. 

                                 GIRLIE
                        For the first time.

           With one laugh through free flowing tears, Girlie finally 
           allows the flood gates to open, the salt stains upon her 
           cheeks now healthy, necessary streams. 

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        Four to three.

                                 CLARK
                                (softly)
                        Shit, I fold. Can’t beat that. That’s for 
                        sure.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I win?

                                 CLARK
                        You win. That’s right. You win.

           Leaning her head back, Girlie let’s out a very soft 
           EXHALE.

           EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN AND BEYOND - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Lifting a thousand feet above, we watch this small speck 
           of yellow - this tiny taxi heading North on 9th - become 
           just one of the thousands of vehicles that race along the 
           streets of Manhattan, each holding their own stories, 
           their own secrets. 
           This was but one. 

           Moving back down again from macro to micro-

           INT./EXT. NYC YELLOW CAB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 

           Coming upon 44th and 9th, Clark watches Girlie silently 
           wipe the tears from her eyes in the rear-view.

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry, sweetie, this-uh... this you up 
                        here? 

           Immediately, pulling herself together- 

                                 GIRLIE
                        Yeah, the-uh, the blue awning. Right up 
                        there on the right.

           Pulling up to the curb, Clark puts the taxi in “P,” as 
           Girlie pulls a wallet from her backpack.

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have any cash. Sorry.

                                 CLARK
                        No one ever does.

           She pulls out a credit card.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I’ll leave you a big tip though.

                                 CLARK
                                (good humored)
                        Yeah, my advice don’t come free.

           She swipes her card prompting the little screen in the 
           back to spring to life again, gifting Girlie the option 
           to leave a ten, fifteen or twenty percent tip. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You gonna need a receipt?

                                 GIRLIE
                        Nah, I’m good.

           With that, Clark pulls a small lever at the left of his 
           feet, which POPS open the trunk. 

           He jumps out of the cab and SLAM!
           Behind her, the trunk lifts open as Clark rescues her 
           rolling bag.

           Unbeknownst to Clark, Girlie presses an optional “tip” 
           button which reads, “OTHER AMOUNTS.”

           EXT. 44TH AND 9TH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           One sturdy, black ankle boot plants onto the trampled-
           black-gum speckled, brown-stained sidewalk. 

           Then, another boot plants strongly, as Girlie assuredly 
           lifts herself from the yellow taxi cab. 

           She shuts the back door. 

           SLAM!

           The trunk still ajar, Clark places the rolling luggage 
           carefully next to Girlie. 

           The two stand, facing one another for the very first 
           time, granting a new perspective. 

           Clark is much taller than Girlie. 

           And stronger. 

           And broader.

           And handsome. 

           A man. 

           A real man.

           There’s a strange comfort in that, somehow.

                                 GIRLIE
                        So...

                                 CLARK
                        So.

           Her backpack hanging limply from one delicate shoulder, 
           Girlie looks far more frail than the powerful young woman 
           we saw marching from the baggage claim not long ago. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                                (after a beat)
                        You gonna be all right?
                                 GIRLIE
                                (simply)
                        I don’t know.

                                 CLARK
                        Listen... Your brain... it’s just 
                        confused right now. It’s in a panic, 
                        ‘cause it ain’t used to breathin’ 
                        underwater. It’s gonna try to tell you 
                        that you’re in way over your head, that 
                        this is it for you, no gettin’ out, 
                        you’re done, end of story... But you 
                        just... just keep on breathin’, all 
                        right? No matter how far down you go... 
                        you just keep on breathin’. ‘Cause 
                        someone like you, you are not a 
                        shipwreck. You’re gonna be all right. 
                        You’re gonna find your way. Gonna swim 
                        yourself back up again... back to all 
                        that life and color... Might even see a 
                        blue whale.

           Girlie forces a vibrant smile through forming tears.

                                 GIRLIE
                        I hope so...

           After a pause, Girlie reaches out a hand and gently 
           places it on Clark’s shoulder.

           Then, without really thinking, Girlie very 
           affectionately, very maternally, dusts the small flecks 
           of dandruff from Clark’s cotton t-shirt.  

           The act is sweet and soft and surprisingly sexy.

           Clark stands stunned by the tender touch of such a 
           remarkable young woman.

           Having successfully groomed Clark’s broad shoulders-

                                 GIRLIE (CONT’D)
                                (with utmost sincerity)
                        Thank you. 

                                 CLARK
                                (sincerely back)
                        You are most welcome.

           They share a moment of quiet, neither knowing how to say 
           goodbye.

                                 GIRLIE
                        Have a good night.
                                 CLARK
                        You, too.

           Taking her rolling bag, Girlie begins to walk away.

           Yet, Clark calls after her.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Mikey.

           Girlie stops, turning to him once more.

                                 GIRLIE
                        What?

           The two stand, their feet planted a distance away from 
           one another, though they seem only inches apart.

                                 CLARK
                        If I were honest, I... I always felt like 
                        a Mikey. Not a Vinnie. Not a Clark. If it 
                        were up to me... Mikey’s what I’d choose.

           Deeply touched by this, Girlie’s tears melt away with a 
           grateful grin.

                                 GIRLIE
                        That makes it four to four. 

                                 CLARK
                        We’re tied?

                                 GIRLIE
                        We are tied.

                                 CLARK
                        I have met my match.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (a chuckle)
                        You play a good game.

                                 CLARK
                        You, too.

           They smile at one another in another suspended moment of 
           stillness. 

           Then-

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You, uh... you live alone?
                                 GIRLIE
                                (with a gentle grin)
                        You’re not getting any candy.

           With a playful shrug-

                                 CLARK
                        Can’t blame a guy for tryin’.

                                 GIRLIE
                                (sweetly)
                        Goodnight, Mikey.

           Clark watches Girlie head toward her building, not 
           looking back, her luggage trailing behind her reinstated 
           New York strut. 

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah, you take care of yourself, girlie.

           With that, Clark slams the trunk tightly shut. 

           WHAM!

                                                             BLACKOUT.
