                “How nice -- to feel nothing, and still get full credit for 
                                      being alive.”

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

           ALEXIS, 17, Black, stares with vehement hostility. Her hair 
           ruffled, bottom lip slightly busted – it’s clear she’s just 
           lost a fight.

           She studies ELIZABETH, 24, Black. An austere desk and her 
           fragile veil of authority separate them.

           Alexis scans her... looking for weak spots in her defence. 

           But Elizabeth holds her ground with an unwavering 
           countenance… waiting patiently for Alexis to speak.

           Finally:

                                 ALEXIS
                        How old are you?

           The bell rings. Kids start shuffling through the halls – 
           filling the room with inaudible chatter and general 
           transition hustle and bustle.

           A group of DISRUPTIVE GIRLS walk past the open office door. 
           One girl NOTICES ALEXIS. Lelani. Her main agitator. 

                                 LELANI
                        ALEXIS STRAIGHT UP GOT HER ASS 
                        BEAT!

           The other girls crowd the door… laughing, taunting her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Lelani King. That’s enough! Get-

           Before Elizabeth can get up, Alexis pounces straight on 
           Lelani.

                                 ALEXIS
                        STUPID BITCH. SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

           Elizabeth tries to break them up. Other girls jump in.

           MARCUS, 27, Black, runs to Elizabeth’s aid.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey! Stop - Lelani. Off!

           Marcus grabs Lelani. Elizabeth takes hold of Alexis. The 
           other girls disperse. Laughing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Alexis – go to class.
           Alexis yanks away from Elizabeth. She sighs and shakes her 
           head. Drags her feet to class. 

           Elizabeth turns back to her office and meets MARCUS’S FACE. 
           He’s just a little too close for her personal bubble to 
           handle.

           Lelani stands against the lockers with her arms folded.

                                 MARCUS
                        You good, E? 

           Lelani tries to walk away. Elizabeth nudges in her direction. 

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Hey now, Lelani. Hold up. 
                            (to Elizabeth)
                        We’re just going to take a trip 
                        down to Ms. Baylor’s office. 

           Exasperated by the whole thing, Elizabeth flashes him an 
           indignant smile and shuts the office DOOR.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

           INSERT: A WALL CLOCK, with the time: 2:57pm

           Elizabeth quietly peeks her head out of her office. 

           She looks to her LEFT. Empty.

           Looks to her RIGHT. Empty.

           WAIT - A KID goes to the bathroom. 

           Okay, now the coast is clear. 

           Elizabeth walks quickly but with composure out of the 
           building. The BELL RINGS as she enters the:

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT – DAY

           Elizabeth runs to her car. Looks at her watch. 3:03pm...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Shit shit shit. 
           INT. ELIZABETH’S CAR – DAY

           She turns on the ignition and pulls away as quickly as she 
           can. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY - LOCKER ROOM – 
           DAY

           Elizabeth inspects herself in front of a mirror.

           She has the body of a true athlete. Slender, toned, powerful.

           She plays around with her hair, getting her updo just right. 
           Practices smiling and adjusts her cleavage.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY - HALLWAY – DAY

           Elizabeth breezes by gym patrons, many stop and look. Others 
           say hello. It’s like she’s a celebrity. It’s almost 
           fantastical, like this could be in her head.   

           She approaches a very long line of eager women in their early 
           20s to mid 30s, mostly White.

           Elizabeth puts on that smile she practiced earlier.

           In her best camp counselor voice she screams:

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Good evening, ladies!

           She unlocks the door to the -

           INT. SPINNING STUDIO – LATER

           Elizabeth gets herself sorted on the instructor’s bike 
           upfront. She connects her iPod to the speakers.

           Millennial boy band pop music plays.

           She gets her headset on. Watches the women settle in. 

                                 GYM PATRON
                        Ohmigod is it a Backstreet day?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You know it.
                                 GYM PATRON
                        Yes!!!!

           It’s a full house. It’s like a scene from some girl’s Bat 
           Mitzvah party circa 1998…

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay guys! We’re on speed and 
                        endurance circuits today. In the 
                        saddle for 5 minutes, keeping a 
                        steady cadence the whole way 
                        through, out of the saddle rest for 
                        30 seconds, back in the saddle 
                        sprint for 90 seconds and repeat. 
                        Decreasing the time in the saddle 
                        as we go. Alright? Let’s go!

           Elizabeth is in her element.

           She’s a good instructor… really perky, motivational, funny. 
           Is this the same girl we met earlier? At the High School?

           The class operates in a rhythmic swarm. The women bob their 
           heads and sway back and forth to the beat, just a few sing 
           along and one or two shout in exhilaration.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY – LATER

           Elizabeth heads towards the elevator. She spots CALVIN, 29.

           She presses DOWN. As the doors open, she hears:

                                 CALVIN
                        Hey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, hey.

                                 CALVIN
                        You on your way home?

           Elizabeth lets the elevator doors close. 

           Her back is turned to him still. Like she’s fighting against 
           looking at him.

           She turns around.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CLOSET – DAY

           Elizabeth and Calvin go at it. The sex is more necessary than 
           passionate. Only the necessary garments blocking access 
           points have been removed.

           They don’t look at each other.

           EXT. CLOSET – 20 MINUTES LATER

           Fully dressed, Calvin waits outside the door while Elizabeth 
           finishes changing. He checks his phone a couple of times.

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Clear?

                                 CALVIN
                        Yeah, you’re good.

           She slips out and rushes past him.

           INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

           Elizabeth unwraps a BURRITO that’s bigger than her face.

           She scrolls through her Instagram. She can’t help herself.

           Happy happy happy smiles party party fun. NEW JOB! New house. 
           ENGAGED!

           Elizabeth’s aunt, MONA, 40s, shuffles through in nurse’s 
           scrubs and a bag of groceries.

                                 MONA
                        Hey Libby.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re home early.

                                 MONA
                        New rotation. Did you eat?

           Elizabeth lifts up her burrito.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        You need to learn how to eat full 
                        meals, girl.

           Mona boils a pot of green beans on high.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You need to learn how to not boil 
                        the crap out of your vegetables.

                                 MONA
                        I’m just trying to help you girl. 
                        Before you end up with a big old 
                        booty.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elizabeth and Mona watch “How to Get away with Murder”. 

                                 MONA
                        Where’s Dani?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        At her work going away party. 

                                 MONA
                        Why aren’t you there?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because I’m not her spouse or her 
                        co-worker. 

                                 MONA
                        You and her act like you’re 
                        married. I’m surprised you’re not 
                        going to New York too.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (feigning surprise)
                        And leave you? I could never! 

                                 MONA
                        Girl, I wish you would. I can’t 
                        wait for you to make enough money 
                        to get out of my house.

           Beat.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        You call your daddy lately?

           Elizabeth deflects.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Shhh! It’s that puppy commercial!!!
                                 MONA
                        I know you hear me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No talking while the show is on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – NIGHT

           Well, it’s not really her room. It’s Mona’s guest room. 
           Although Elizabeth has lived here for over year, you wouldn’t 
           know it.

           A SLEEPING BAG, TENT and BACKPACK are lined up neatly at the 
           foot of her bed. She folds one last T-shirt carefully and 
           places it into the Backpack.

           Her phone rings. Mom. 

           Nope.

           She swipes her phone aside and glances at her bike.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WEST ADAMS – NIGHT

           Elizabeth rides her decently specked trek road bike. She’s 
           fast. She weaves around traffic.

           She goes faster and faster. Crosses underneath the 10 and up 
           La Brea until she reaches:

           INT. COFFEE SHOP – LATER

           Dark haired, trendy, 25 year-old Nadeesh, (NAD), sits on a 
           stool behind the bar reading INVISIBLE MAN.

           Elizabeth walks in with her bike. She slides it against the 
           wall. 

           Nad quickly glances up and nods.

           The crowd is just a little too cool for her but she walks 
           through like she owns it and carefully positions herself at a 
           table in Nad’s line of view, then empties the contents of her 
           messenger bag.

           Nad glances up from time to time.
           Elizabeth looks around trying to be cool.

           Finally, she approaches the bar.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can I get a flat white?

           Nad puts down the book.

                                 NAD
                        Heyyyyyy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey.

                                 NAD
                        This book is so good. I can’t 
                        believe I’ve never read it. Thank 
                        you so much.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No probs. Glad you like it.

                                 NAD
                        (playful) Flat white for the book 
                        fairy. Comin up.

           Elizabeth watches him make her coffee. She focuses in on his 
           lanky but toned arms, slightly too low low-rise skinny jeans, 
           and a tattoo that peeks through the hole in the back of his 
           shirt.

           She smiles bashfully. He’s too beautiful.

           He’s nearly finished. With grace, he free pours some latte 
           art on the top.

           Elizabeth snaps out of her intense gaze.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bellissimo!

                                 NAD
                        You’re like the only one who 
                        appreciates good coffee in this 
                        whole place.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (flirty)
                        Coffee? I’m here for the 
                        extraordinary customer service. 

           Nad purses his lips off her comment... unsure how to read it. 
           Without anything else to say to each other, they stand 
           awkwardly.

           Nad eases back to his chair and picks up the book. After a 
           few clueless beats, Elizabeth slinks back to her table.

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE – DAY

           Elizabeth scrolls through news articles, and gets distracted 
           by a FACEBOOK notification on another tab. This is a thing. 

           She flicks through pictures of some girl having a great time.

           Friends, food, drinks, guys, sunshine.

           Marcus pops his head in. He waits for her to notice.

           She does, but ignores him.

           He clears his throat.

                                 MARCUS
                        So glad spring break is here.

           Elizabeth briefly glances over to him, smiles and looks back 
           at her computer.

           A TEXT from DANI comes in on her phone. She looks down.

           Oooo girl, your boo is SINGLE now. 

           Elizabeth’s eyes widen. She sees the bubbles. Waits for it...

           Lana told me Zoha is not having it. HOT MESS. 

           She quickly flicks to Zoha’s instagram.

           She aggressively flicks through photos. ZOHA, 23, at a party, 
           Zoha at Coachella, Coachella, Coachella, Coachella, Zoha at 
           Lollapalooza, Lolla, Lolla, Zoha in Vegas with her hipster 
           friends, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

           Zoha and NAD at a rooftop bar. Her cursor hovers over the 
           photo.

           Elizabeth pulls the screen closer to her face, like she’s 
           searching for clues in the happy couple’s expression.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Huh. 
           INT. ELIZABETH’S CAR – DAY

           Elizabeth sits in her car. It’s unclear how long she’s been 
           there. She’s now looking at Nad’s Instagram, inspecting every 
           picture. Her laser focus is interrupted by Dani’s FACE 
           against the Driver’s side window.

                                 DANI
                            (in a deep man voice)
                        Hello Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth screams. Dani falls over in laughter. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh my god, I hate you. 

           Elizabeth jumps out of the car and sticks her hand out to her 
           friend’s aid... Only to yank it back, allowing Dani to fall 
           on her ass again.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I seriously thought I was gonna 
                        die. 

                                 DANI
                            (still in a man voice)
                        Elizabeth, it’s me, Nad. Kiss me.   

           Dani can’t help herself. There’s nothing she loves more than 
           teasing Elizabeth about her crush.

           Elizabeth grabs Dani’s backpack and puts it in the trunk, 
           with her CAMPING GEAR. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Let’s go, stupid.

                                 DANI
                        You’re stupid. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PCH – DAY

           --- Elizabeth and Dani drive North along the coast. Rage 
           Against the Machine blasts, their heads bob.

           --- Dani sticks her feet out of the window and lays her seat 
           back.

           --- Elizabeth reluctantly pops a squat on the side of the 
           road. Dani pulls away as she’s mid-stream. Horrifying 
           Elizabeth.
           --- Dani takes pictures on her phone.

           --- They laugh and joke.

           EXT. CARPENTERIA STATE BEACH – DUSK

           --- They pull into a campsite.

           --- The girls set up their tent.

           --- Elizabeth inspects to ensure that the campsite is 
           perfectly positioned. Two chairs… check, barbecue grill… 
           check, tent door facing the sea… check.

           --- Dani opens a bag of ice and carelessly stuffs a bottle of 
           champagne in it.

           --- They strip. Dani is completely naked while Elizabeth is 
           in her underwear.

           --- They run out to the sea.

           EXT. CAMPSITE – NIGHT

           Dani pours Elizabeth a glass of champagne. They clink.

                                 DANI
                        To a beautiful friendship.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Six great years. 

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Wrapped in their sleeping bags, the girls look into each 
           other’s eyes like lovers.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can you just stay until you get a 
                        job? 

                                 DANI
                        Girl, no.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t want to be alone here.

                                 DANI
                        You can always come with me. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        No thanks.

           Dani rolls her eyes.

                                 DANI
                        I think you need to do something. 

           Dani hesitates a little. Not wanting to be too hard on her 
           friend who is definitely having a rough time.

                                 DANI (CONT’D)
                            (firm)
                        I’m saying this because I love you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I love you too, Dani. You’re the 
                        sister I never wanted.

                                 DANI
                        I love you so much I hate you.

           They hold hands tightly.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HEAD. A MEMORY.

           THE FACE OF A MAN, IN HIS LATE THIRTIES. 

           He’s youthful, jovial even. This is Elizabeth’s father. 

           He smiles. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENT - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth is crying in her sleep. She’s getting louder. 

           Dani wakes up, with very little alarm. This is routine for 
           her.  

                                 DANI
                            (under her breath)
                        Not this shit again. Damn.

           She rubs her eyes, puts on her head-lamp and looks for 
           Elizabeth’s backpack. 

           She digs through Elizabeth’s backpack. Finds an open pill 
           bottle for XANAX. It’s empty.
                                 DANI (CONT’D)
                        Fuck Elizabeth, what the fuck. 

           She digs deeper in Elizabeth’s bag. Finds a white pill 
           looking thing. She holds it up closer to the light. TIC TAC.

           She sighs.

           Elizabeth starts to cry louder. 

           Dani grabs a WATER BOTTLE, opens it up and dumps the whole 
           thing on Elizabeth’s face. 

           Elizabeth snaps out of it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jesus, Dani!

                                 DANI
                        Take your damn Xanax and shut the 
                        fuck up. I am trying to sleep. 

           Elizabeth pulls a pill out of the sports bra she’s wearing 
           and puts it in her mouth. 

           EXT. MOUNTIAN TRAIL - DAY

           Elizabeth and Dani hike to the top and take in the view. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I went to 6-11 the other night. 

                                 DANI
                        ...And? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He called me “The book fairy”, 
                        which I guess is cute.

                                 DANI
                        Eghhhhh. He has the lamest game. 
                        (mocking Nad) Uh, can I like borrow 
                        your book, but then not talk to 
                        you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It didn’t go like that. 

                                 DANI
                        …aaand this is why he deserves that 
                        crazy White girl. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        She’s not crazy, she has a drug 
                        problem. 
                            (beat)
                        I think I should ask him out. Do 
                        you think I should?

                                 DANI
                        Not really...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You don’t think he likes me?

                                 DANI
                        No, I think he likes you. I just 
                        think... he’s kinda not about that 
                        life.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What does that mean?

                                 DANI
                        Just be careful. I’m not really 
                        sure Nad and his crew understand 
                        sincerity, or accountability.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You talk about them like they’re in 
                        High School. 

                                 DANI
                        Well...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well...?

                                 DANI
                        Nothing girl. Just, you make some 
                        stupid choices with men. 

           INT. SPINNING STUDIO – DAY

           Class is over.

           Elizabeth exchanges pleasantries with a few regulars on their 
           way out as she wipes down her bike and gathers her things.

           INT. SHOWERS – LATER

           Careful to not get water on her hair, she lifts her face into 
           the stream.
           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY - DAY 

           Dressed and ready for work, she spots Calvin.

                                 CALVIN
                        Hey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey.

           We all know what’s going to happen next. 

           INT. CLOSET – DAY

           Elizabeth puts her clothes back on post quickie. 

           Calvin is looking at his phone. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you keeping watch? Can I leave?

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh, um.

           He goes outside. 

           Elizabeth waits.

           He taps the door, signaling the coast is clear. 

           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Elizabeth leaves the closet with Calvin standing guard. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks. I’m late.

           He calls after her.

                                 CALVIN
                        You wanna do something this 
                        weekend?

           Without turning around - 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Text me or something.
           INT. ELIZABETH’S OFFICE – HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

           Elizabeth flips through articles on her computer, and gets 
           distracted by a FACEBOOK notification on another tab.

           She flicks through pictures of some girl having a great time.

           Friends, food, drinks, guys, sunshine.

           INT. TEACHERS’ LOUNGE – HIGH SCHOOL – LATER

           Elizabeth walks in with a carton of ICE CREAM.

           She sees Marcus and a few other “Teach for America” types.

           He spots her and waves her down.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey! E! Nice lunch.

           AT THE TABLE

           She sits uncomfortably in the company of the “type A” Teach 
           For America group.

           They all talk about their students like lab specimens, all 
           but Marcus who genuinely cares and sees the classroom as the 
           “ultimate” battleground.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth, I need you here. Common 
                        Core math standards?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (Lacks any real perspective 
                              on something she should 
                              really know)
                        Ridiculously low?

           One of the TFA girls sneer.

                                 TFA GIRL
                        Anyway, I really don’t get why 
                        there’s a big uproar...

           Elizabeth zones out for a bit as the group continue their 
           conversation. 

           She somehow manages to tune them out completely. She stares 
           blankly at Marcus who nods with enthusiasm, and then TFA girl 
           as she gabs on...
           ...and then something catches her eye past them both... 
           through the window.

           We hear sounds from outside. Traffic noise, wind blowing... 
           that type of thing.

           Elizabeth’s POV: ALEXIS sitting with the only non Black or 
           Latino students in her grade: FOUR WHITE GIRLS AND ONE ASIAN 
           GIRL... 

           The CAMERA moves closer in on Alexis. 

           Alexis looks in our direction. 

           Back on Elizabeth. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Anybody know the deal with Alexis? 
                        The senior? The one who fights a 
                        lot?

                                 TFA GIRL
                        Isn’t that supposed to be your job?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSY VENUE - NIGHT

           Elizabeth rubs shoulders with the crème de la crème of her 
           alma mater’s donor list. 

           Her name tag: ELIZABETH TURNER, ‘13, PHULWANI AWARD 
           RECIPIENT; sits proudly on her left shoulder. 

           She smiles. She is engaged. She’s exuberant. Her dress is 
           itchy.

           Most importantly:

           She never lets the hors d'oeuvres get too far away from her. 

           She is approached by college president, LINDA RAMMEL, 56, who 
           brings along another DONOR who is eager to meet her.

                                 LINDA
                        Elizabeth! I wanted to introduce 
                        you to another one of our donors! 
                        This is Mark Phulwani.

           Bad timing. 

           Elizabeth has just stuffed a block of cheese in her mouth.
           She finishes chewing. 

           Does that whole “got food in my mouth, how embarrassing” 
           gesture. 

           She takes a look at MARK, 55, Indian. 

           Wait.

           Could it be...?

                                 MARK
                        So sorry to bother you while you’re 
                        eating. 

           Elizabeth swallows and quickly rubs her hands on a napkin.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, no! Such a pleasure to meet you 
                        Mark. 

                                 LINDA
                        I wanted you two to meet, as Mark 
                        is normally so busy, but he heard 
                        you were going to be here.

                                 MARK
                        I have wanted to meet you FOR ever.  

           Elizabeth looks slightly confused.

                                 LINDA
                        He never forgot your application.

                                 MARK
                        It was just, I was so impressed 
                        with everything you’ve done, I had 
                        to come forward and just say what a 
                        pleasure it was to be a tiny part 
                        of that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh. Mark, I’m so touched. Thank 
                        you! I definitely wouldn’t be where 
                        I am now without that scholarship. 

                                 MARK
                        Absolutely. Absolutely. I’m sorry I 
                        didn’t introduce myself sooner. I 
                        travel so much.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course. Yes.
           She senses that he is a talker. She braces herself with some 
           more wine. 

                                 MARK
                        Do you know my boy? He was in your 
                        graduating class. I told him to 
                        keep an eye on you.

                                 LINDA
                        Nadeesh Phulwani. You know him 
                        right?

           Elizabeth chokes out of fear and possibly excitement. 

                                 MARK
                        Where is he? NADEESH! 

           NAD is summoned by his father whose voice manages to carry 
           clear on the other side of the room. 

           Nad yells back.

                                 NAD
                        What?

                                 MARK
                        (Louder) Get over here! 

                                 LINDA
                        Maybe we can go over to him, save 
                        some people’s ears, if possible.

                                 MARK
                        No way, he needs to come over here.

                                 LINDA
                            (uncomfortable)
                        It’s not a problem. Elizabeth?

                                 MARK
                        It’s fine. He’s coming over here. 

           He’s not.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        God Dammit Nadeesh!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ve met him before, so...

           Nad realizes they’re talking to Elizabeth. He heads over.
                                 MARK
                        Finally. Many thanks so much for 
                        joining us Nadeesh.

           Elizabeth clears her throat. She begins to shift the weight 
           in her legs in an attempt to look more relaxed. It’s a 
           fidgety mess.

                                 NAD
                        (to Elizabeth) How’s it going?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey.

                                 MARK
                        Nadeesh. I wanted you to come over 
                        and talk to this lovely lady, as we 
                        were just discussing how wonderful 
                        it is that she was able to make the 
                        most of my generous contribution.

                                 NAD
                        That’s great for both of you. 

                                 MARK
                        “Hailing from sub-rural beginnings 
                        in Atlanta with first-generation 
                        middle class parents funneling any 
                        and all extra income to my father’s 
                        healthcare, I’m left with very 
                        little to achieve my own academic 
                        goals.”

                                 NAD
                        Dad.

                        suit them be left behind?” 

                                 NAD
                        Dad.

                                 MARK
                        The answer is NO, Elizabeth. 
                            (beat)
                        Beautiful words.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You memorized it.
                                 MARK
                        Blew me away. So tell me, 
                        Elizabeth, what are you doing with 
                        yourself?

           Elizabeth’s fake smile stretches further. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, I’ve just completed my Teach 
                        For America fellowship at the 
                        school that I now work as a 
                        counsellor... Then applying to law 
                        school. 

                                 MARK
                        That’s wonderful. You hear that 
                        Nadeesh? Law school.

                                 NAD
                        Yeah Dad. Leave her alone. Please.

                                 MARK
                        Such a good girl.

                                 LINDA
                        Mark, I’ve got to pull you away. 
                        Barry Unger is over there and he’s 
                        the architect of our new green 
                        residence halls. You have to meet 
                        him. 

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, sure, okay. 
                            (to Nad)
                        You keep talking... could 
                        potentially learn something here. 

           Mark pats his son on the back and rushes off with Linda.

           Elizabeth is embarrassed. It’s all been a little too much.

                                 NAD
                        Sorry about him. He’s nice, just 
                        socially stupid.

           She looks around at the company she’s keeping. Feels 
           instantly out of place. So wealthy, so White, not a world 
           she’s used to... 

           And that scene. With a brown person no less? 

           She watches Nad navigate a plate of hors d'oeuvres in 
           surprisingly seamless, carefree manner.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        What does your dad do? 

                                 NAD
                        He’s an investment banker. Runs a 
                        firm or whatever. He’s everywhere 
                        and nowhere.   

           She digests this for a beat.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        What about your dad?

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HEAD. A MEMORY.

           THE FACE OF A MAN, IN HIS LATE THIRTIES. 

           We’ve seen this before. 

           Elizabeth’s father. 

           He smiles at his daughter - he looks at her in that way only 
           a proud poppa can.

           We focus on his HAIR, creased forehead, his big white teeth. 

           He’s just about to say something, until - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSY VENUE - BACK IN REAL TIME

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My dad? 
                            (Beat)
                        Who said I had one? 

                                 NAD
                            (taken aback)
                        Shit. I’m so sorry. That was really 
                        bad.

           Nad is the kind of person who never wants to offend, but 
           somehow finds his foot in his mouth more often than he’d 
           like. 

           A much more self-aware version of Mark Phulwani?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        No! I have a dad! Sorry. I was 
                        trying to be funny. 
                            (Beat)
                        I don’t know why I said that. It 
                        wasn’t funny.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLASSY VENUE - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth leans her back deep into a wall and breathes in.

           Nad comes around the corner with a bottle of whiskey. She’s 
           surprised to see him.

                                 NAD
                        I just took this. Want some?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Someone might see us!

                                 NAD
                        So?

           He takes a swig, then hands her the bottle.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        Here. 

           Elizabeth accepts. Takes a swig. Smiles.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

                                 NAD
                        Kinda needed that, huh?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Something like that. 

                                 NAD
                        If it makes you feel any better, I 
                        think my dad likes you more than he 
                        likes me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s not true.

                                 NAD
                        It’s not... Just feels that way 
                        sometimes. 
           INT. CLOSET - DAY

           Elizabeth sits on a box of cleaning solution waiting for 
           Calvin. 

           She checks her phone a few times. She’s been waiting awhile. 

           She decides to take off her jeans. 

           Tries to sit seductively. 

           She quickly changes her mind and puts the jeans back on. 

           Calvin finally arrives. He goes straight for her chest.

           Elizabeth pushes him away.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What the hell, man?

                                 CALVIN
                        Hey, sorry - had to take care of 
                        something.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You could have let me know. 

                                 CALVIN
                        Yeah, I - 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not gonna just sit around for 
                        you.

                                 CALVIN
                        Heyyyy, come on Elizabeth, relax.

           He tries to kiss her. She turns her face. 

                                 CALVIN (CONT’D)
                        But you’re so pretty...

           She gives in.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

           There’s another fight between Alexis and Lelani. 

           Alexis has pulled out Lelani’s weave and waves it in the air 
           before throwing it down the hallway.

           From her OFFICE DOOR:
           Elizabeth watches as Marcus and a few others break up the 
           fight. 

           Marcus looks up in her direction, but she closes the door 
           before he makes eye contact.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S OFFICE – LATER

           Elizabeth watches Alexis smoke outside.

           Her phone rings. 

           It’s her mother again.

           Ignore. 

           She watches Alexis, who throws her cigarette butt on the 
           ground and heads back inside. 

           A TEXT comes in from Calvin: DAVEY WAYNES?

           INT. DAVEY WAYNE’S BAR – NIGHT

           Elizabeth, Calvin and a few friends are gathered on the patio 
           outside.

           -- They drink

           -- They laugh

           -- They dance

           Calvin flirts with a few of the girls. Elizabeth clocks this 
           but pays it no attention. It’s not like they came together.

           Let’s be clear... this bothers her. He literally invited her 
           and what feels like 30 other girls. 

           But he likes her, want’s to know her. Elizabeth, quite 
           annoyed, bored and very stiff, isn’t the easiest to get to 
           know.

                                 CALVIN
                        Wait, where did you go again?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Pitzer. One of the Claremonts?

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh yeah… wait, my friend went to 
                        like Pomona. Margot Prosser?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        They’re different places, but yeah, 
                        I know her. We talked about this.

           There’s nothing between them. Granted Elizabeth’s general 
           ‘tude doesn’t help. 

           Calvin backs off. Sees another friend. 

                                 CALVIN
                        Oh, hey Lucy!!!

           The odd one out again, Elizabeth heads to the bar, squeezing 
           through random couplings.

           She finds an empty seat. She looks back over at the group she 
           came with. They’re happy without her. 

           She watches Calvin dance with Lucy.

           It hurts a little, but she brushes it off and quickly tries 
           it on with the bartender. 

           She pouts her lips and leans slightly forward.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi there… Can I get a Fat Tire?

           It’s so obvious and so bad. Bartender doesn’t even flinch.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Six.

           Dejected, She hands him the money.

           To her left:

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        Elizabeth?

           He’s excited to see her. The drink has had its way with him 
           leaving a more open and chatty guy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Heyyyy.

                                 NAD
                        I’ve never seen you here before.

           He’s grinning. Elizabeth has never seen him like this.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been?
           With a chip on her shoulder, due to her feeling particularly 
           un-cool tonight, she goes on defence. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You make it seem like I live under 
                        a rock or something.

                                 NAD
                        No, it was just in college you were 
                        always into other things.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I partied.

                                 NAD
                        Yeah, like wine tasting parties… 
                        which was cool by the way… I get 
                        it. You’re a sophisticated lady.

           He nudges her arm playfully. She stiffens.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I did other stuff.

                                 NAD
                        Okay.

           Beat. 

           She finally registers that he’s flirting with her. Idiot. She 
           resets. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (plays dumb)
                        Where’s Zoha?

                                 NAD
                        Didn’t you hear? We. Are. Done.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh. I’m so sorry.

                                 NAD
                        I’m not. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (fishing)
                        Oh, so you dumped her?

                                 NAD
                        She’s a parasite. I had no clue.
                            (changes the subject)

                                 (MORE)
                                 NAD (CONT'D)
                        How’s the law school applications 
                        going? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I haven’t really thought about 
                        them. 

                                 NAD
                        Why?

           JON, 23 – tattooed, lanky, British (hams up the accent) and 
           way too cool for Elizabeth calls after his friend:

                                 JON
                        Naddy Paddy! Mate! Where ya been?

           He clocks Elizabeth. Gives Nad a confused look.

                                 JON (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I’ve got this bird I want 
                        you to meet.

           Nad looks back at Elizabeth. She plays off her 
           disappointment.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I gotta get back to my friends. 
                        Nice to see you. 
                            (to the bartender)
                        Can I get another one of those, 
                        please?

                                 BARTENDER
                        You have a full one right there. 

           This is awkward. She doesn’t want to come off as a 
           lightweight.

           She downs the beer. Looks for approval from the men around 
           her. 

           Crickets. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (to bartender again)
                        Okay, so can I have another now?

                                 NAD
                        See you around.

           Jon grabs his shoulders.

                                 JON
                        Maaaate. Let’s go.
           Elizabeth quickly pays and heads back to the crowd. 

           She sees Calvin making out with Drunk Girl. 

           She sighs, looks around.

           She takes a swig of her beer, walks past them and out the 
           door.

           ACROSS THE BAR

           Nad watches her leave then turns back to Jon and CUTE BIRD.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – MORNING

           -- She awakens. Still in her clothes from the night before.

           -- She stares at the ceiling.

           -- Creates a playlist for her spin class. Listens to a few 
           seconds of songs... uses a RPM counter to get the beat just 
           right.

           Her phone rings. Her mom again. She answers, reluctantly.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey Mommy. 
                            (beat)
                        Yes I’m fine.
                            (beat)
                        It’s good, I feel like I’m making a 
                        difference. 
                            (beat)
                        Mmhmm.
                            (beat)
                        How’s daddy today? 
                            (long beat)
                        Can I talk to him??

           Tears begin to well in her eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Hey Daddy! How are you feeling?
                            (beat)
                        I’m great.
                            (beat)
                        Yes. Aunt Mona is taking good care 
                        of me. How about you? You taking 
                        good care of yourself? 
                            (beat)
                        Okay, well that’s not the end of 
                        the world. You’re getting stronger 
                        though, huh? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (long beat)
                        Hello? Oh, hey Mom.

           She listens. Tears roll down her face.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Love you. Tell Dad I love him 
                        too! Bye.

           EXT. WEST ADAMS – DAY

           Elizabeth rides her bike through town. She’s one with 
           traffic. Feels the wind in her face.

           She goes up a hill and enters:

           INT. KENNETH HAHN STATE PARK - DAY 

           Elizabeth sits on the grass, watches life go on around her:

           Family reunion, lovers strolling by the lake, speed walkers, 
           dog walker.

           She takes a cupcake wrapped in foil out of her backpack and 
           starts eating it.

           She notices A MAN walking towards her, who looks a hell of a 
           lot like HER FATHER. 

           She squints her eyes... she can’t really make out his face 
           perfectly.

           She squeezes her eyes shut and-

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET – LATER

           She’s back on her bike. She’s a little erratic. 

           She uses the short breaks in traffic for quick speed blasts.

           Finally a decent break. She gets up to speed quickly.

           She’s riding fast. 

           She stops at a red light. Sees the coffee shop in front of 
           her to her left. 

           Nad is outside smoking a cigarette. He sees her and waves.
           She gives an excited nod towards him.

           The light turns GREEN.

           She’s off making a left turn into the coffee shop parking lot 
           and then -

           WHAM.

           Out of nowhere A CAR HITS HER.

           Darkness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UTTER DARKNESS

           We hear the faint sound of a NAIL FILE, GOSPEL and HUMMING.

           We are in Elizabeth’s head.

           From her POV:

           She opens her eyes to discover she’s in:

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 

           She looks at her body laid down flat in a bed covered in 
           shitty hospital sheets. A white curtain surrounds her.

           She hears a nail file… Wait.

           The humming, the Gospel and the filing?

           She turns to AUNT MONA. Who has gospel coming out of her 
           phone speakers.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (groggy)
                        Ugh, Mona turn that shit off.

                                 MONA
                        You better believe. The father 
                        covered you in his blood. You need 
                        to hear this: You are alive, thank 
                        you Jesus, with your mind and body 
                        IN TACT – praise him, with a mild 
                        concussion and a broken arm. Praise 
                        be to God.

           Elizabeth rolls her eyes and turns away from her aunt.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You tell Mommy?

                                 MONA
                        Mmmhmm.

           She drifts back off to sleep.

           EXT. STREET – FLASHBACK

           WHAM.

           Cars are honking.

           From Elizabeth’s POV: 

           Her bike is several feet away from her... how? She looks at 
           her legs. She has a bloody knee.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Oh my God. Are you okay? Hello?

           Elizabeth looks over to the coffee shop parking lot. She sees 
           a pair of LEGS (Nad’s) running over to her.

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        Elizabeth? HEY! Can you hear me? 
                        Elizabeth?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        I didn’t see her. Fuck.

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        Elizabeth?

           She looks up at him but the sun is too bright and her vision 
           is blurred.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – DAY

           Elizabeth wakes up again. She watches Mona knit and hum to 
           herself.

           Mona looks over to her.

                                 MONA
                        Hey pretty girl. How you feeling? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Better.
                                 MONA
                        I was worried about you for a 
                        second there. By the looks of it, I 
                        wasn’t the only one.

           She knowingly raises her eyebrows at Elizabeth, who is 
           clueless. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        There’s some boy here for you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Huh?

                                 MONA
                        He said he’s your friend? He called 
                        the ambulance for you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Nadeesh?

                                 MONA
                        NUH-Who? I don’t know.

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Nad sits patiently with Elizabeth’s warped bike wheel in one 
           hand and a bouquet of flowers in another.

           Mona appears.

                                 MONA
                        Nadeesh?

                                 NAD
                        How is she doing?

                                 MONA
                        You can talk to her now.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM - DAY 

           Elizabeth grooms herself as well as she possibly can, 
           considering the circumstances...  She manages to sit up and 
           smooths over her sheets.

                                 NAD
                        Heyyyy!
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi! 
                            (points to the bike wheel)
                        Is that mine?

                                 NAD
                        Yeah. Your bike is in pretty bad 
                        shape. I took pictures.

           He puts the wheel down. Awkwardly fiddles with the bouquet.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (re: flowers)
                        Are those for me?

                                 NAD
                        Shit. Yes. Sorry.

           He hands them to her. She smiles and takes a big ol’ sniff.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you. They’re beautiful.

                                 NAD
                        I’m so glad you’re okay. I saw you 
                        from the shop. Fucked up, she 
                        completely ran that red light.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, I’ll be seeing that ho in 
                        court.

                                 NAD
                        Ha. Yeah.

           She looks at him strangely.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How do you know where I live?

                                 NAD
                        Oh! Yeah. Sorry. I also have your 
                        backpack... your wallet was in it.

           He takes off the backpack and puts it next to her bed. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

           And it’s quiet again. They both search for something to say.

                                 NAD
                        So your Mom said you got lucky... 
                        just broke your arm?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Aunt.

                                 NAD
                        Huh?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mona is my aunt. I live with her.

                                 NAD
                        Oh. Okay. Cool.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

                                 NAD
                        So, do you want to hang out or 
                        something? When you’re feeling 
                        better?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (can’t even play it cool if 
                              she tried)
                        I – I would love that.

                                 NAD
                        Let’s do that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Cool.

           Nad gets up to leave.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Do you even have my number?

                                 NAD
                        Uh.

           He looks through his phone.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        I don’t.

           Elizabeth reaches for his phone. 

           He obliges. She puts in her number.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Now you do.
           INT. MONA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAWN

           -- Elizabeth looks at her scarred up body in a mirror. Legs, 
           torso, arms... they’ve been through it.

           -- Elizabeth showers with her arm sticking outside the 
           curtain.

           -- Elizabeth reads in bed. Her cast gets in the way.

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE – HALLWAY - DAY

           Mona is on the phone to Karen. She paces around a bit as she 
           speaks. 

                                 MONA
                        ...and, so, I don’t get it. They 
                        want him in there every day?
                            (she listens)
                        Uh huh, ok, yeah I know what 
                        they’re talking about... I just 
                        don’t like how that sounds, really. 
                            (beat)
                        Just keep me posted I guess. 
                        Dialysis is so tough on the body. 

           She looks out to the open FRONT DOOR. Watches Elizabeth 
           outside.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        She’s fine, I guess. Seems in good 
                        spirits. Lord, I tell you, it could 
                        have been so much worse.

           EXT. MONA’S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Elizabeth half listens to her aunt as she takes in some fresh 
           air outside. 

           A text comes in.

           Calvin:

           Sry about ur arm. I’ve missed us workin so closely together… 
           Hurry bak… :)

           She rolls her eyes. Doesn’t respond.  

           She overhears Mona talking about work. 
                                 MONA
                        I TOLD that man, ten, maybe twenty 
                        times now. I don’t like these 
                        random changes to my shift. I need 
                        more than 48 hours notice - 
                        especially when I have family to 
                        take care of. First my brother, now 
                        my niece. It’s too much. 
                            (beat)
                        He don’t listen though. 
                            (beat)
                        You know, it’s not just me though. 
                        He had the nerve to call another 
                        nurse, Heather, and demand she come 
                        in when he KNEW she had no one to 
                        come pick up her baby from school.
                            (beat)
                        I’m so sick of him Karen, I don’t 
                        even know what to do. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE – DAY

           They sit in their usual spots on the couch... watching TV. 

           Elizabeth looks at her aunt. Debates opening her mouth. 
           There’s something on her mind...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How’s my mom?

                                 MONA
                        You should call her and see for 
                        yourself.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It was just a question, Mona. 

           Mona has an agenda and launches straight into it.

                                 MONA
                        Your mother seems to think you’re 
                        busier than you actually are.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am busy. I work two jobs.

                                 MONA
                        That’s what I told her, but I just 
                        want you to know, you’re not 
                        fooling anybody.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not sure what you mean, but 
                        oookay.

                                 MONA
                        What’s happening is scary. I know. 
                        But you don’t want to add to your 
                        momma’s stress by not communicating 
                        with her. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (indignant)
                        I talk to her. 

                                 MONA
                        Okay. Well, maybe actually tell her 
                        what’s going on with you instead of 
                        that little act you put on for 
                        them. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, so you do want me to stress 
                        them out? 

                                 MONA
                        They wouldn’t be stressed if you 
                        would just go ahead and grow the 
                        hell up... Think of that? 

           Elizabeth shrugs.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        That’s it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

           Mona mocks her shrugging. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I got nothin’. 

                                 MONA
                        Sometimes, I want to smack you.  

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – LATER 

           Elizabeth fidgets in her sleep. It becomes more frequent. 
           Increasingly violent. 

           She’s whispering something inaudible. Sleep muttering more 
           like.
           She starts to cry. 

           Harder.

           Louder.

           SCREAMS

           It’s loud. Piercing. 

           Her eyes are wide open.

           Mona comes in calmly. Walks over to one corner of the room 
           and watches Elizabeth. Careful not to wake her.

                                 MONA
                            (gently)
                        It’s ok Libby. It’s ok.

           Elizabeth cries and cries. She cries so hard she chokes on 
           her tears. 

           Mona just gently strokes her hair. 

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth skypes with Dani on her laptop. Dani is trying on 
           clothes. 

                                 DANI
                        What do you think of this blouse?

           It’s tight, see through and has a pretty low V-neck.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        For work… in an office?

                                 DANI
                        They said business casual.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dani. No.

                                 DANI
                        This is why I’m asking you. I don’t 
                        fucking know.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You need to go with that Navy 
                        pencil skirt – and a normal blouse.

           Dani puts back on the skirt. Takes out a “normal” blouse and 
           puts it on. It does indeed look a lot better. 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        IN other news... Nad has not called 
                        me.

                                 DANI
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s fine, I guess. I’m just glad 
                        he was there. It meant a lot. 

                                 DANI
                        I can’t get over how much of a hero 
                        he turned out to be, but he 
                        probably just felt bad for you. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sure.

                                 DANI
                        So he doesn’t like you then. On to 
                        the next one. I’m pretty sure you 
                        would be wasted on him.
                            (beat)
                        Wait, what about shoes? Fuck, I 
                        hate this.

           Elizabeth’s phone rings. It’s Nad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (excited, yet calm)
                        Dani. He’s calling me right now.

                                 DANI
                        Don’t even answer that shit. I’m 
                        serious. Elizabeth. It is 3 AM, my 
                        first day begins in 6 hours. I’ve 
                        got an emergency here. 

           She holds up two different pairs of shoes.

                                 DANI (CONT’D)
                        Which one?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bye!

                                 DANI
                        NO! Keep it on –

           Elizabeth shuts her laptop and answers the phone.
                                 ELIZABETH
                            (breezy)
                        I was starting to think you lost my 
                        number.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 

           Nad’s just finished closing. Chairs on top of tables… lights 
           off. He swings his keys around his index finger.

                                 NAD
                        Well, I know you had a concussion 
                        and everything so I thought I would 
                        let you, you know, handle that.

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 NAD
                        How are you feeling?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Getting there. I’ve got 6 more 
                        weeks with the cast, which has been 
                        a pain. But it could have been 
                        worse.

                                 NAD
                        I’m just getting off work, and I 
                        remember you saying you live in the 
                        neighborhood… could I come over and 
                        raid your book collection?

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM - LATER

           Nad digs through several tubs of books. She’s got all 
           sorts... including children’s books. Elizabeth comments on 
           his selections.

           She feels judged. Tries to explain herself.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m pathetically sentimental. They 
                        go with me everywhere. 

           He continues to dig. She doesn’t like the silence.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It’s why I’m not in any rush to 
                        move. 
                                 NAD
                        You’re going to inspire the shit 
                        outta some high school kid as their 
                        English teacher.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        If that ends up being my life, I 
                        will need to be shot.

                                 NAD
                        But you’re in Teach For America.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I was in Teach For America... To 
                        get into law school.

                                 NAD
                        But you work at a school.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And you work at a coffee shop. I’m 
                        assuming that’s not a forever 
                        thing?

                                 NAD
                        Could be. 
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        See?

                                 NAD
                        Do you even want to be a lawyer?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. 

                                 NAD
                        No?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But I needed to pick something.

                                 NAD
                        Why that? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have an obligation to make 
                        something of myself. 

                                 NAD
                        To whom?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Everyone? Your dad? My parents?
                            (defensive)
                        You wouldn’t understand.

           Nad puts the book down and looks at her.

                                 NAD
                        You don’t owe Mark Phulwani 
                        anything. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m pretty sure his scholarship 
                        fund has contributed to three 
                        quarters of my tuition. 

                                 NAD
                            (under his breath)
                        His better investment.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I teach spin classes 4 days a week. 
                        Ideally, I’d make a legit career 
                        out of that. Ride, read a lot, hang 
                        out. 

                                 NAD
                        Sounds like a good plan... For 
                        someone less motivated than you... 
                        but fine. Why not go for it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because that isn’t fair of me. 

                                 NAD
                        What isn’t fair is family trying to 
                        force you to do something you don’t 
                        wanna do. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Nooo. No one is forcing me to do 
                        anything. 

                                 NAD
                        I was talking about me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh.
                            (beat)
                        So, what do you want to do?

                                 NAD
                        I’m supposed to be figuring that 
                        out.
           He holds up a children’s book. 

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        Can I read this to you?

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – HALLWAY - DAY

           Elizabeth strolls through the halls. Her cast is in a sling.

           She walks past Lelani sitting in front of the Principal’s 
           office.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Good Morning Lelani.

                                 LELANI
                        Ohh Ms. Turner! Whatchu do to your 
                        arm?

           Elizabeth will now go through the motions of her day:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY 

           -- Elizabeth sits at lunch and listens to TFA bullshit while 
           eating a slice of someone’s BIRTHDAY CAKE.

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE – DAY

           -- Elizabeth sits at her desk and listens to a CRYING GIRL 
           complain about her breakup with her boyfriend.

                                 CRYING GIRL
                        And then his mom said that he 
                        didn’t want to waste his time with 
                        me...

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           More fighting. Marcus looks to Elizabeth. Elizabeth gestures 
           toward her cast... Sorry. 

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 

           -- Elizabeth watches Alexis smoke from her desk. Suddenly, 
           she gets up. 
           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           Elizabeth eases up to Alexis.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey.

                                 ALEXIS
                        What happened to your arm?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I got hit by a car. Can I have one?

                                 ALEXIS
                        You smoke?

           She’s never even tried it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sure.

           She hands a cigarette to Elizabeth and lights her up.

           Elizabeth starts coughing… a lot.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I thought you were gonna write me 
                        up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Why?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because I don’t care.

                                 ALEXIS
                        But what about my future?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Me stopping you from smoking on 
                        school grounds and reporting you 
                        for cutting class isn’t going to 
                        get you into college. Only you can 
                        do that.

                                 ALEXIS
                        It’s my free period, and I’m going 
                        to UCLA in the fall.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        In that case, there’s no real point 
                        to doing anything in this school 
                        ever again.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Are you trying to do some reverse 
                        psychology shit you learned on me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No.

           She takes another drag. Coughs.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        This is so gross.

           She puts out the cigarette and walks back inside.

           EXT. MONA’S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR - EVENING

           Nad clears his throat and rings the bell. He looks at his 
           reflection in the stained glass window on the door.

           He hears laughter. Looks behind him.

           Some kids are playing in the street. 

           They stop and stare.

           Elizabeth opens the door. She takes him all in.

           He turns back to her and smiles.

           INT. NAD’S CAR - EVENING

           It’s a mess. Tons of shit everywhere. Books, paper, paint of 
           all sorts.

           Nad helps put on Elizabeth’s seatbelt. Elizabeth studies him, 
           careful not to give away that she’s staring. She can’t 
           believe this is happening.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m sorry you had to come all the 
                        way out here. I’m not that 
                        comfortable with driving yet.

                                 NAD
                        It’s cool. I’m happy to do it.
           INT. MUSIC VENUE – NIGHT

           A folksy alternative band plays.

           They’re up front nodding their heads to the music. Nad is 
           attentive. He protects her injured arm from getting pushed a 
           couple of times.

                                 NAD
                            (yelling over the music)
                        Are you having fun?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hell yeah!

           She closes her eyes and gets deeper into the music. Nad takes 
           in all her free flowing beauty. Yeah, a little uptight – but 
           it’s in moments like this… he sees her.

           She opens her eyes, catches him staring at her. He pulls her 
           in and they dance closely.

           EXT. TACO TRUCK – NIGHT

           -- It’s late. They’re drunk. They giggle and flirt as they 
           wait their turn in line.

           -- They order.

           -- They kick an empty beer can back and forth to each other 
           while they wait for their food.

           -- They get their tacos. Nad digs into his, Elizabeth 
           struggles and drunkenly plops her face in her plate.

           -- Nad laughs, takes her plate and starts feeding her tacos.

           EXT. STREET – LATER

           They walk. In Elizabeth’s euphoric state, she skips a few 
           steps ahead of him.

           They stroll past a Cuban restaurant that’s having a salsa 
           night.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh my Godddddd! Salsa!!!! Do you 
                        know how to Salsa?

                                 NAD
                        Uh, ha, no.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ll teach you. Come on!

           She drags him into the restaurant.

           INT. CUBAN RESTARUANT - NIGHT 

           It’s dark, hot and sweaty. There’s some pretty spectacular 
           dancing happening… clearly regulars.

           Elizabeth doesn’t hesitate. She pulls Nad straight in.

                                 NAD
                        I really don’t know how to do this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just trust me. I’m going to lead.

           She sets him in neutral position.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Just follow the beat. Step forward 
                        with your left foot, lift up your 
                        right heel and then step back on 
                        it… good! Okay now bring back the 
                        left foot... yep. Andddd pause on 
                        count 4. Now we’re going to undo 
                        the first 4 steps… step back on 
                        your right foot, step into place on 
                        your left foot... okay yeah like 
                        that, and now bring back your right 
                        foot. Yes! Perfect.

           They dance… it’s clunky and messy but they’re having a good 
           time.

           An older and very attractive AFRO-CUBAN MAN cuts in. Nad is 
           more than happy for him to take her on.

           It’s intense. He gazes deeply into her eyes, which is very 
           awkward for her. She laughs a few times and looks over to 
           Nad, who nods and gives her a “thumbs up” in approval.

           The song ends. The man kisses her on the cheek and tips his 
           hat towards Nad. Elizabeth looks over with a big smile and 
           waves.

           Their eyes meet.
           EXT. STREET – NIGHT

           They walk towards Nad’s car. Both more quiet and pensive… 
           Sober.

           He’s going for it.

                                 NAD
                        So, my house is like 3 blocks away 
                        if you’re tired, or…

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ok.

           INT. NAD’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Pretty sparse. Hand-me down couches, and the like… a similar 
           set up to his place back in college.

           They walk down a hallway. Passing by a few rooms.

                                 NAD
                            (whispers)
                        That’s Jon’s room. And that’s our 
                        friend Cory’s room… They have real 
                        jobs so they get real rooms.

           They walk into a small space with books lined up along a 
           wall, a lamp, an easel and a fully made up mattress on the 
           cold wooden floor. It’s an alcove of sorts with no door.

           This is awkward for Elizabeth… probably not what she was 
           expecting but goes with the flow.

           He puts her face in his hands and kisses her.

           They move closer to his bed, he tries to undress her but she 
           pulls back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey, I’m not.
                            (beat)
                        Uh, I just really like you so…

                                 NAD
                        I really like you too. A lot.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Really?

                                 NAD
                        Yeah. I’ve had a crush on you for 
                        years.
                                 ELIZABETH
                            (disbelief)
                        You never asked me out.

                                 NAD
                        I was with Zoha!

           She retreats even further.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t fuck with me.

                                 NAD
                        I’m serious. Come here.

           She surrenders into him. He lowers her to her knees on the 
           mattress and gently helps get her cast through her shirt. He 
           takes off his shirt and gets on his knees as well to meet her 
           eye level. 

           In between kisses:

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        I should have asked you out 
                        instead. Zoha was fun, until she 
                        wasn’t.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can be fun.

                                 NAD
                            (sweet)
                        I know. I’m having fun with you 
                        now.

           He reaches over to turn off the light. 

           We see their silhouetted bodies come together. He eases her 
           down onto her back.  

           He climbs on top of her. Kisses her deeply then moves down, 
           kisses her entire body. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. NAD’S HOUSE – MORNING

           Elizabeth and Nad are fast asleep. Elizabeth with only her 
           panties on is the little spoon.

           Jon eats an apple and hovers over them. 
                                 JON
                        Aww, that’s adorable.

           She jumps up and registers Jon. Embarrassed, she reaches for 
           her top.

           Her sudden movement wakes up Nad.

                                 NAD
                        Dude. Come on –

                                 JON
                        You gonna make us breakfast? We’re 
                        hungry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NAD’S KITCHEN – LATER

           Nad is making breakfast as Jon, Elizabeth and CORY, 25, sit 
           at the table.

           Both men are staring at her… judging. She can feel it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, what do you both do?

                                 CORY
                        Too early.

                                 JON
                        We’re sound engineers.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What does that entail exactly?

                                 JON
                            (patronizing)
                        Well, we sit around in a recording 
                        studio and fiddle with little 
                        buttons.

           Nad breaks the hostility with the presentation of the food.

                                 NAD
                        Eggs, veggie bacon and quinoa 
                        muffins. Dig in.

                                 JON
                        Aw, thanks Dad.

           He brings Elizabeth a flat-white coffee, complete with latte 
           art that looks somewhat like a bicycle.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you!

                                 CORY
                        Dude. You never make us coffee and 
                        we let you live here.

                                 NAD
                        Elizabeth is the only one who would 
                        appreciate it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        (mid-sip) So GOOD.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – LATER

           Alexis and Elizabeth’s smoke breaks have become a thing. They 
           casually lean against the wall and look out to the parking 
           lot.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I don’t fight on purpose. Those 
                        girls are always messing with me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know.

                                 ALEXIS
                        So why do I get in trouble?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        They have to blame someone. You’re 
                        easier.

                                 ALEXIS
                        That’s messed up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Welcome to the wonderful world of 
                        education.
                            (beat)
                        So, why don’t they like you?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Were you picked on in high school?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.

                                 ALEXIS
                        People didn’t like you?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I mean. Maybe? I guess some 
                        people didn’t like who I was, in 
                        the sense that they thought I 
                        should act more… Whatever I wasn’t? 
                        I don’t know.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Why do people care so much?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        People are always going to try to 
                        change you. They pick on you 
                        because you won’t let them. This 
                        makes them mad because it shows 
                        that you don’t care what they 
                        think.

                                 ALEXIS
                        But I do care for real. I’m just 
                        bad at being any different.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP – NIGHT

           Elizabeth sits at her usual spot and reads a book. Nad is in 
           his usual place behind the counter, also reading when not 
           serving customers.

           They look over at each other from time to time.

           Elizabeth can’t help but sip her coffee with a smile.

           INT. NAD’S HOUSE – NIGHT

           Nad and Elizabeth watch a movie. It doesn’t take long for 
           them to start making out on the couch.

           INT. NAD’S ROOM - NIGHT

           -- They’ve moved to his bed and gotten much better at one-
           armed disrobing.

           -- Elizabeth sits cross-legged on the bed in post-coital 
           bliss.

           -- She looks around at the stuff on Nad’s walls.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Did you take those photographs?
                                 NAD
                        No. I painted them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        THOSE? Really? But they’re like 
                        pictures from a camera.

                                 NAD
                        Photorealism.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s a thing?

                                 NAD
                        It is a thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Damn.

           She walks over to them for a better look.

                                 NAD
                        It’s more hyperrealism, because 
                        it’s supposed to look high-def and 
                        then I put my own spin on it. I 
                        look deeper and try to expose 
                        something.

           She looks at A PORTRAIT OF ZOHA. It’s perfectly natural, 
           little makeup, straight hair but with dark eyelids and a 
           macabre disposition.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That portrait is low-key scary.

                                 NAD
                        Yeah, that was in my thesis show. 
                        It was like I knew something was up 
                        with her then and I was trying to 
                        warn everyone and myself.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you still paint?

                                 NAD
                        Not really. No. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You should. You’re really good.

                                 NAD
                        You only think I’m good because you 
                        don’t know what you’re looking at.
           She kisses him.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HEAD. A MEMORY.

           THE FACE OF A MAN, IN HIS LATE THIRTIES... 

           This again.

           We focus on her father’s HANDS... they’re gesticulating... 
           He’s talking to her. Joyful. His eyes light up with each 
           word. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NAD’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Over darkness is Elizabeth’s heavy breathing.

           A LIGHT IS TURNED ON.

           She’s sitting upright in full night-terror horror. 

           Nad is there with Cory. He runs over to her. Holds her bad 
           arm... tries to protect it.

                                 NAD
                            (to Elizabeth)
                        Hey... hey... Elizabeth!

                                 CORY
                        She just started doing that out of 
                        the blue?

                                 NAD
                        I can’t wake her up. It’s like she 
                        doesn’t hear me.

                                 CORY
                        I don’t think you are supposed to 
                        do that.

           Jon enters, casually.

                                 JON
                        Fuck-ingggg hell. 
           INT. NAD’S ROOM - LATER

           Elizabeth is awake, has had the episode recounted to her and 
           is beyond embarrassed. 

           Nad is panicked. His hands are gripped on her shoulders. He 
           faces her.

           She can’t even look at him.

                                 NAD
                        You kept screaming for your Dad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have night terrors. I honestly 
                        have no control over what I do or 
                        say. 

           She slinks into the bed and under the sheets.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You must think I’m fucking crazy. 

           He rubs her back.

                                 NAD
                        Hey, everything’s gonna be fine. 
                        I’m right here with you.

           She relaxes. Closes her eyes and tries to sleep.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Elizabeth?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (eyes closed, rested)
                        Yeah?

                                 NAD
                        If I go to sleep right now, are you 
                        going to be okay?

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mona loads the dishwasher in the kitchen. Elizabeth rushes in 
           and stuffs some powdered doughnuts in her mouth.

                                 MONA
                        I’ve been waiting to help you. 
                        Where have you been? 
                                 ELIZABETH
                            (rushing to her room)
                        I’m fine… I can handle it.

                                 MONA
                        Who has been helping you get 
                        around? That boy?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (on her way out the door)
                        His name is Nadeesh.

                                 MONA
                        (yelling after her) Who’s gonna 
                        watch Scandal with me?

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

           Elizabeth walks through the halls. She sees Marcus. There’s 
           nowhere to hide. 

           He’s not like his usual self. Seems almost irritated by her 
           presence. 

           She senses this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, hi Marcus. 

           He gives her a good look up and down. Gives a nod. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        How are you? What’s up?

           He looks to his left and right. Motions her close.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey- I know what you and Alexis are 
                        doing... not cool.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh?

                                 MARCUS
                        Don’t worry. I won’t tell. But you 
                        should really stop doing that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's not illegal, Marcus.

                                 MARCUS
                        It’s also not allowed on school 
                        grounds... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        this is a warning, but if I see it 
                        happen again, I’m going to have to 
                        say something.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (feigning fearfulness)
                        Oh no! Marcus! You wouldn’t! 

                                 MARCUS
                        You should take the lives of our 
                        young people seriously, Elizabeth. 

           INT. ART GALLERY - DAY 

           Nad and Elizabeth look around. Elizabeth breaks away as she 
           hones in on a particular piece.

           Nad grabs her hand.

                                 NAD
                            (excited)
                        You like it? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, it’s incredible. 

           INT. ARTS DISTRICT – DAY – CONTINUOUS

           Nad and Elizabeth walk in and out of various art galleries.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s keeping you from having your 
                        stuff shown?

                                 NAD
                        Commitment.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ouch.

                                 NAD
                        Honestly, I’ve got a long way to 
                        go.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So why don’t you commit?

                                 NAD
                        Why don’t you?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Maybe you should apply to MFA 
                        programs? Lend you some structure 
                        and time to really explore it.

                                 NAD
                        I’ll make you a deal. You go be 
                        super spin girl or a lawyer or a 
                        teacher or whatever you really want 
                        to be and I’ll go be an artist.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Elizabeth enters with a few shopping bags from the mall. She 
           walks past Mona on the couch watching TV.  

                                 MONA
                        Hey Libby. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi aunt Mona.

                                 MONA
                            (with attitude)
                        Hey Libby? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey yeah?

                                 MONA
                            (more attitude)
                        Do me a favor and call your 
                        parents?

           Nothing. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear me, girl?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I HEARD you. Thanks.   

           Mona clocks her bags:

                                 MONA
                        What happened? You buy the whole 
                        store? 
           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM - DAY 

           INSERT - SEVERAL CLOTHING TAGS BEING CLIPPED BY SCISSORS.

           Elizabeth models herself in a mirror. Changes her hair a few 
           times with different outfit options.

           With each new outfit she pretends to be a different person. 
           They are consistently more carefree with their language and 
           their bodies.

           She settles on a particularly revealing number.

           She puts her face straight in the mirror, slaps on some 
           lipstick and mouths:

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh hey, Naddie.

           Still in whatever character this is, she laughs.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           An Uber pulls up to a LARGE CRAFTSMAN HOUSE blaring music and 
           covered in string lights and lanterns. People mill about on 
           the front patio.

           Elizabeth struggles to get out of the car in one piece with 
           the incredibly short skirt she’s wearing.

           She rifles with one arm through her bag and proudly takes out 
           a gift-wrapped bottle of wine.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Nad pours himself another cup of home-brew. He looks around 
           the room. It’s packed, mostly with people he knows.

           He walks to the back of the house – sees ZOHA on the patio 
           dragging on a cigarette and talking expressively to a large 
           audience. 

           He immediately turns around.

           He peers into one of the bedrooms, where JON and a few others 
           SNORT COKE. Jon looks up, flicks him off. 

           He walks past a couple of girls, they smile flirtatiously. 
           He’s not into it.

           He finishes his beer and goes back into the kitchen for 
           another.
           He pours himself some more beer and runs into JEFF, 24.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey!! It’s good, right?

                                 NAD
                        Awesome.

                                 JEFF
                        Just for you, man. Been working 
                        hard on that one.

                                 NAD
                            (distracted)
                        Yeah, it’s good.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, sorry about Zoha.

                                 NAD
                        She can be here if she wants. 
                        Totally fine by me.

           Nad’s spirits lift once he sees: 

           Elizabeth enter the kitchen... like a lost puppy.

                                 JEFF
                        Is that… Elizabeth?

                                 NAD
                        Yeah.

           She’s HOT. She sees them. Makes eye contact with Jeff. Smiles 
           brightly.

                                 JEFF
                            (to Nad)
                        Wow.

           Elizabeth a little too excitedly approaches.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jeff! Hi!

                                 JEFF
                        Elizabeth… been awhile. You look 
                        great!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks! Nice to see you.
                            (to Nad, casually)
                        Hey you.
           They have a rather un-synched embrace. Jeff looks confused.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jeff, um, this is for you. 

           She fishes the wine bottle out with her good arm.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thanks so much for having me!

           He sweeps off a clean spot on his counter amongst bongs, 
           papers and empty plastic cups, and places the wine bottle 
           there.

           Nad checks on Elizabeth’s arm.

                                 NAD
                        How is it? Were you ok to get here?

           She nods sweetly. He lightly touches her wrist.

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        (quietly, to Elizabeth) Does that 
                        hurt?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. Not really.

                                 NAD
                        Okay, good.

           Pleasantly surprised, and intrigued, Jeff peers on at the 
           happy couple.

           FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

           Jon, who’s shirtless now and has a sailor hat on shouts into 
           the kitchen:

                                 JON
                        Nad, mate! Please come in here and 
                        take this photo for me!!!

           He puts a cigar in his mouth and makes a muscle pose.

                                 NAD
                        I don’t know what he’s been doing. 
                        Excuse me guys.

           Nad walks over to him. Jeff and Elizabeth watch as he calmly 
           takes the photo and talks Jon down.
                                 JEFF
                        So, how long has THIS been 
                        happening?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not really sure, I just got 
                        here…

                                 JEFF
                        NO, no! You and Nad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, not long.

                                 JEFF
                        Does Zoha know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        (defensive) There isn’t anything to 
                        know.
                            (changing the subject)
                        Can I have some beer please?

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE – LATER

           Jeff, Nad, Elizabeth and a few others play APPLES TO APPLES. 
           Elizabeth has loosened up.

           Nad, on the other hand is on high alert.

           He watches Jon and Zoha talk from the corner of his eye. It 
           looks heated. As Zoha’s body language intensifies, Nad braces 
           himself for what’s coming.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (to Jeff)
                        Where’s your bathroom?

                                 JEFF
                        Down that hall, three doors on the 
                        right.

           She heads off.

           Zoha clocks her.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE – HALLWAY

           Elizabeth slips through partygoers and into the bathroom.
           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE - BATHROOM

           She pees and embraces the peace and quiet.

           INT. JEFFS HOUSE – HALLWAY

           Zoha shoves partygoers out of the way as she trudges through.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE – BATHROOM

           Elizabeth pulls up her underwear... tricky stuff with one 
           arm. Flushes. Washes her hands. No soap anywhere.

           She rinses her hands under the sink for a second time.

           Looks for a hand towel… nope.

           She looks over at a bath towel that probably hasn’t been 
           washed in months. She shudders at the idea.

           She looks at her skirt.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE - HALLWAY 

           Zoha turns the knob on the bathroom door.

           Tries to push herself in. Locked.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE – BATHROOM - SAME

           Elizabeth wipes her hands on her clothes.

           She hears the rattling of the doorknob.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just a second!!!

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE – HALLWAY

           Elizabeth opens the bathroom door.

           ZOHA GRABS HER GOOD ARM (THANKFULLY) AND TUGS HER OUT TO THE:

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Elizabeth breaks free and shoves her.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Get off me!

                                 ZOHA
                        You fucked my boyfriend!! Fucking 
                        slut!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh my God. Chill.

                                 ZOHA
                        CUNT!!!!!

           Zoha swipes at her. Elizabeth steps back just in time.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Seriously. Zoha. You need to calm 
                        the fuck down.

           More worked up, nearly hyperventilating she grabs a LARGE 
           TREE LIMB and swings it at Elizabeth.

                                 ZOHA
                            (screaming)
                        IM GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!

           Elizabeth manages to grab hold of the limb before it smacks 
           the crap out of her. They struggle over possession.

           Nad, Jeff and Jon rush to the scene.

           Zoha gives it her all, lifting her end of the branch and 
           shoves it towards Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth’s bad arm isn’t strong enough yet and hurts like 
           hell – forcing her to be pushed backwards and trip over a 
           chair behind her.

           She falls to the ground, with the branch and Zoha on top of 
           her.

           Elizabeth pushes them off. Grabs her bad arm in pain.

           Zoha gets up and dusts herself off. She looks deranged.

                                 ZOHA (CONT’D)
                        What are you even doing here? No 
                        one likes you. You are ugly and you 
                        are boring. He is only with you 
                        because he feels bad for you. Look 
                        at you. With your stupid cast. Not 
                        so perfect now, are you Elizabeth? 
           Elizabeth marches right up to her and PUNCHES HER IN THE 
           FACE.

           Zoha is out cold on the ground.

           Silence.

           Out of nowhere:

                                 JON
                        Fucking bad-ass!

           Nad and a few of Zoha’s friends run over to her. Nad picks 
           Zoha up and carries her back inside.

           Near tears, Elizabeth is left on her own, watching everyone 
           around her fret over Zoha.

           Jeff walks over and hands her a bag of frozen potato wedges.

                                 JEFF
                        You okay?

           She takes the bag and puts it on her hand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth walks back inside. She passes by a room and sees 
           Nad sitting on a bed with Zoha’s head resting on his lap. 
           She’s crying and he’s rubbing her forehead.

           Elizabeth is done here.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. MONA’S HOUSE – KITCHEN

           Elizabeth watches music videos on her laptop with one hand in 
           a bowl of ice and another hand stuffing her face with 
           homemade brownies.

           Mona comes back from a shift at the hospital. She grabs some 
           leftovers from the fridge and heats it up in the microwave.

                                 MONA
                        Did you really eat all those 
                        brownies?
           Elizabeth doesn’t acknowledge her and Mona fails to notice 
           her hand.

           She does notice her outfit.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Girl, I hope you didn’t actually 
                        wear that out tonight. 

           Elizabeth turns the volume up on her laptop.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – SAME

           Elizabeth calls Nad. Get’s his voicemail.

           She hangs up and texts him: Hey! I haven’t heard from you. 
           You OK?

           She waits around for a response. Nothing. After another beat 
           or two she writes:

           Look, I’m sorry about last night. I didn’t mean

           She erases I didn’t mean

           She sends the text.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S OFFICE – DAY

           Elizabeth sits in front of her computer and anxiously taps 
           her finger against her desk.

           She studies Zoha’s facebook intently. Searching for 
           something, anything that can give her insight into why Nad 
           hasn’t reached out.

           Her phone rings.

           She grabs it thinking its Nad and quickly pulls the phone out 
           of her bag.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh. Hey mom. (beat) Yeah, I can 
                        talk. Yeah. Work is good. (beat) 
                        What’s that? A $600 something 
                        charge? Uhh well, I had to get more 
                        clothes... for work, so, Yeah.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NAD’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Elizabeth knocks at the door. No answer.

           She looks at the clock on her phone – 5:47pm

           She takes a book out of her bag and sits on the steps.

           Time passes. Elizabeth has gotten through a pretty decent 
           chunk in her book. She walks away.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           Elizabeth looks around. SOME OTHER GUY is working. No Nad to 
           be found.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey, is Nad here?

                                 SOME OTHER GUY
                        Nope. Switched to afternoons.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – NIGHT 

           She’s skyping with Dani, who can’t stand the sight of her 
           friend being so pathetic.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I fucked up.

                                 DANI
                        WRONG.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I hit her.

                                 DANI
                        She ATTACKED you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I embarrassed him.

                                 DANI
                        He’s a fucking embarrassment. It’s 
                        rude. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MONA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth pouts over her dinner with Mona.

                                 MONA
                        Elizabeth. Why are you always 
                        looking so sad? What’s wrong with 
                        you?

           Elizabeth shrugs.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        This is what you don’t get. You are 
                        blessed with a degree, a job, a 
                        roof over your head and people who 
                        love you. BE HAPPY.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you happy, Mona? With this big 
                        house but always working? Working a 
                        job you hate, mind you?

                                 MONA
                        I don’t hate my job. I hate my 
                        boss.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well why don’t you quit then? Why 
                        don’t you go somewhere else? It’s 
                        not like you have anybody! 

                                 MONA
                        Excuse me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re so negative all the time. 
                        All you do is criticize me. 

                                 MONA
                            (resigned)
                        That’s life, Elizabeth. You work to 
                        pay the bills, you don’t always 
                        meet the person of your dreams, 
                        others will let you down, people 
                        die, you can’t always do what you 
                        wanna do.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t accept that. Fuck that.

                                 MONA
                        Also- I don’t need anybody talking 
                        to me like that in my own house. 
                        Please leave my table.
           Elizabeth realizes she’s gone too far with her elder, and she 
           does know better. She softens, gets up and takes her plate to 
           the sink. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        You need to finally grow up and 
                        face reality little girl. The world 
                        is not going to change for you.

           Elizabeth’s lack of a response infuriates Mona. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        It’s about time you start paying 
                        your own bills, with your spoiled, 
                        disrespectful tail. I’m done with 
                        you.

           Elizabeth’s door SLAMS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

           Alexis teaches Elizabeth how to roll a cigarette.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I like this. Way healthier.

                                 ALEXIS
                        It’s pretty easy once you get the 
                        hang of it.

           They light up.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        How’s your dad?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You know what, he’s doing well. My 
                        mom keeps sending me pictures of 
                        him. Wanna see?

           She gives Alexis her phone.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Aww, that’s cute.

           MRS. BAYLOR, the school principal marches toward them.

                                 ALEXIS (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit!
                                 MRS. BAYLOR
                        Alexis, shouldn’t you be in class?

                                 ALEXIS
                        No.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is her free period.

                                 MRS. BAYLOR
                        Miss Turner, can you meet me in my 
                        office, please? 

           INT. MRS. BAYLOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mrs. Baylor speaks, Elizabeth isn’t listening, until:

                                 MRS. BAYLOR
                        Look, to be frank, they were 
                        cigarettes and Alexis has done 
                        better in school these past couple 
                        of months than she has in a year. 
                        But can I just say, a young African 
                        American woman such as yourself 
                        should be lifting up her community, 
                        not tearing it down. You’re a good 
                        role model for these young women. 
                        They need to see a college grad 
                        making a success of her life, so 
                        let’s forget about this.

           Mrs. Baylor stretches out her hand. Elizabeth shakes it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you.

                                 MRS. BAYLOR
                        You know, I see a lot of myself in 
                        you...

           Elizabeth examines the office around her. Stanford Graduate 
           School of Education Doctorate degree hanging proudly behind 
           her boss, photos of Ms. Baylor and girlfriends on a trip to 
           the Bahamas, a photo of her DOG on the desk... this woman has 
           lived a pretty safe life.

           Elizabeth sees nothing of herself in this woman. Nothing that 
           she wants at least. 

                                 MRS. BAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Hard worker, smart, so 
                        accomplished. 
           Something snaps inside of Elizabeth. Maybe it was the teddy 
           bear with a #1 Principal t-shirt on the desk, or her 
           realizing that she was looking 25 years into the future, 
           but...

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (kinda talking to herself)
                        Is that it?

                                 MS. BAYLOR
                        Pardon?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, no. I’m gonna quit. Ms. 
                        Baylor. Yeah, I quit. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY – DAY

           Elizabeth marches towards the door with her head held high, 
           triumphantly...

           And waltzes straight into:

           INT. UPSCALE EQUINOX TYPE FITNESS FACILITY - DAY

           Strong, calm, confident, excited. She’s free to do what she 
           loves, she’s taking life by the balls. 

           She’s also dressed in her spin clothes... a strange sight, 
           seeing as she still has her cast on.

           She heads straight for the:

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - DAY 

           She pops her head through the door to see MAGGIE, 31, on the 
           phone.

           Maggie waives her in.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, you are more than welcome to 
                        try our Gym for free. I can give 
                        you a complementary workout for you 
                        and your hubby, no problem. (beat) 
                        Great! I’ve got you down. Have a 
                        wonderful day!

           She hangs up and gives Elizabeth a big hug.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        How’s my beautiful girl!! We’ve 
                        missed ya over here. When are you 
                        coming back!? Wait, are you gonna 
                        take a class?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m back, and yours full time for 
                        now on, Maggie. I thought I could 
                        teach my usual class. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        First off, awesome. But. Sweetie, 
                        you’ve still got your cast on, so 
                        like, you don’t mean this class 
                        starting in 5.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s exactly what I mean. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Lizzie, honey, that’s not possible. 
                        You’re still injured. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can still teach. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        But we’ve got Jill. The ladies 
                        really like Jill...

           Elizabeth looks through the door at JILL, 21, White, Blonde, 
           not Elizabeth. 

           ECU on Jill talking to Calvin. 

           Elizabeth looks back at Maggie, with fire in her eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But it’s my signature class. I 
                        created it, and I can handle it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Elizabeth, you have a CAST on, 
                        babe. No one wants to see that. 

           The phone rings.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (trying to keep calm)
                        Maggie. I quit my job.

           Maggie answers, asks the person to hold. Puts her hand on the 
           receiver.
                                 MAGGIE
                            (whispers)
                        I’m happy for you, that’s great... 
                        But we are gonna have to figure 
                        something out when you’re all 
                        healed up and ready to work, 
                        because right now I can’t have 
                        imaginary conversations, ya know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Honey, I have to take this. Hold on 
                        a sec. 

           Maggie takes the call. Elizabeth walks out of the office.

           EXT. SPINNING STUDIO – DAY

           She watches Jill teach her class. Fucking Jill, with her 
           bouncy ponytail and faux pep. Elizabeth could run circles 
           around her.  

           Jill looks in her direction. 

           Elizabeth flips her the bird.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 

           She presses the crap out of the DOWN button. 

           She looks at her phone. Text from an unsaved number. 

           It’s A PHOTO of her very expensive leather jacket she was 
           wearing that fateful night. 

           This is Jeff. I think you left this at my house. 

           INT. JEFF’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jeff opens the door to find Elizabeth. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hey!

           He hands her the jacket. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi. I’m so sorry. Thanks so much 
                        for contacting me. 
                                 JEFF
                        No biggie. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey, I’m glad I’m here, actually. 
                        I’m so so so sorry for the other 
                        night. 

                                 JEFF
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m pretty embarrassed about how I 
                        acted…

                                 JEFF
                        You mean defending yourself?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah but I punched her.

           Elizabeth is visibly frazzled. She hovers over the landing. 

                                 JEFF
                            (reassuring)
                        Somebody needed to.
                            (beat)
                        Do you wanna come in?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Could we go for a walk instead?

           EXT. SOMEWHERE ON THE EAST SIDE - DAY 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, totally.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re so nice and I feel like 
                        you’ll be honest with me. Will you?

                                 JEFF
                        Shoot.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s wrong with me?

           Jeff laughs.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m serious. Like, what makes 
                        me so undesirable? Am I that 
                        unattractive? Am I that boring?

                                 JEFF
                            (still laughing)
                        There’s nothing wrong with you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Would you date me?

                                 JEFF
                        Are you asking? I mean, I –

                                 ELIZABETH
                        OH MY GOD.

                                 JEFF
                        Hold on Elizabeth. Relax and hear 
                        me out: You are great. Seriously.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But…

                                 JEFF
                        But nothing. I just think that you 
                        are one of those girls that guys 
                        feel like they need to have their 
                        shit together before they even try 
                        to approach you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        The fuck does that mean?

                                 JEFF
                        You won’t allow for anything less.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And that’s somehow my problem?

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t really know, Elizabeth. I’m  
                        just trying - 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You know, not that I want you or 
                        anything, because I don’t but I 
                        just think it’s crazy how I’m so 
                        great but like you won’t even date 
                        me... What does that say about you, 
                        JEFF?

           She walks away from him... quickly. 
                                 JEFF
                        Elizabeth, come on.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, Jeff. It’s cool!

           She bumps into A GUY pushing an ICE CREAM cart. Apologizes, 
           keeps walking, but then stops and retraces her steps back to 
           the Ice Cream guy to buy some.

           She unwraps it aggressively. 

           She gets an idea. Grabs her phone.  

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (with ice cream in her 
                              mouth)
                        What are you up to tonight??

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRENDY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Elizabeth is back in her very expensive outfit she wore at 
           Jeff’s party. 

           She waits in line alone. Looks at all the other women around 
           her... mainly Black and Latina. She tries to mimic their body 
           language. 

           She pulls her top down a little lower. 

           INT. TRENDY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Calvin waves Elizabeth over to the bar. 

           She marches right up to him. 

           Kisses him. Hard.

           INT. TRENDY NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           They’re on the dance floor. Elizabeth’s ass is planted firmly 
           in his crotch. 

           It’s gross.

           Calvin hands her a PILL. 

           She looks at it for a beat and then takes it.
           She’s proud of herself... “Look at me I’m so cool and 
           carefree”. 

           They keep dancing...

           From Elizabeth’s POV: The lights get brighter, the music 
           louder, the scene in front of her isn’t very stable. Images 
           whip and whirl around her. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CALVIN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Elizabeth sits on the floor in front of Calvin’s front door. 
           Hyperventalating. 

           This is not a night terror, as she’s fully conscious. 

           Just a full-on panic attack. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (in between breaths)
                        I. Seriously. Can’t. Breathe. 

                                 CALVIN
                        You just need to calm down.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My heart is going like 100 miles a 
                        minute. This is not fine Calvin! 
                        What the fuck did you give me?

                                 CALVIN
                        God Damn girl. It was just some 
                        Molly. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What the fuck is Molly!?

                                 CALVIN
                        You don’t know what Molly is? Why 
                        did you take it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m just trying to go with the 
                        flow. And I thought it was just 
                        Ecstasy or something. 

                                 CALVIN
                        Same shit!
                                 ELIZABETH
                        THIS DOES NOT FEEL LIKE ECSTASY. 
                        THIS FEELS LIKE SPEED.

                                 CALVIN
                        How the fuck would you know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (starts to cry)
                        Calvin. I’m really scared. I don’t 
                        want to die. I feel like I’m being 
                        punished for wasting my life... For 
                        hurting my body... just like HIM!

                                 CALVIN
                        Come here. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. I don’t trust you. I want to go 
                        home.

                                 CALVIN
                        Let me take you home.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        NO.

           She cries harder. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I can feel this shit running 
                        through my veins. Killing me!!

                                 CALVIN
                        So what the fuck am I supposed to 
                        do?

           INT. CALVIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Elizabeth is hunched in a ball in a corner. 

           Mona, tired and very concerned scoops Elizabeth up and hugs 
           her. 

           She cuts her eyes at Calvin.

                                 MONA
                        If I find out you date raped her or 
                        something I will have the po-lice 
                        on your ass so quick.

                                 CALVIN
                        Both of you bitches are crazy.
           INT. MONA’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Silence.

           Elizabeth quietly sucks water from a camelback. Still crying. 

                                 MONA
                        Elizabeth. You need to get it 
                        together.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – LATER

           Mona tucks Elizabeth in. Strokes her niece's head. 

           Closes the door.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S ROOM – MORNING

           Elizabeth sleeps. Peacefully for once. 

           Mona rushes in. Shakes her, awkwardly. 

                                 MONA
                        Libby... Libby... wake up baby. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 MONA
                        Your mamma’s on the phone. 

           Elizabeth groans. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can I call her back?

                                 MONA
                        You NEED to take this.

           Elizabeth registers the alarm in her aunt’s voice. She takes 
           the phone.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Libby lou?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s wrong?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Baby, I need you to come home.
           Elizabeth looks at Mona, who is trying her hardest to keep it 
           together. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Elizabeth, still in her dress from earlier, hair a mess, 
           mascara running, sits in the back of an Uber.

           She leans her head against the passenger window.

           Mona knocks on it. Gestures her to roll it down.

           Wipes Elizabeth’s face clean with a spit dampened tissue. 

           INT. UBER - NIGHT 

           Elizabeth watches the Los Angeles skyline from the I-10 zip 
           past her. Tops of houses, palm trees, the hills, the lights.

           There’s an old R&B song playing quietly. “I Can’t Get Over 
           You” by The Dramatics. The Uber driver sings along under his 
           breath. 

           This song. It takes Elizabeth back to a place. She begins to 
           sing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (singing, loudly)
                        This feeling I have for you 
                        is strong indeed with a flame I 
                        can't put out...

           She closes her eyes. Sings louder.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (top of her lungs)
                        I tired to do without you and find 
                        someone new, someone new...

           A voice joins in. Louder than her.  

                                 VOICE
                        You found yourself a new love 
                        And it's driving me insane...

           That’s not the Uber driver. 

           Elizabeth OPENS HER EYES. It’s her father, Robert. Driving. 
           Looking back at her. 
                                 BOTH
                            (in unison, with gusto)
                        I Can't Get Over You
                        Oh baby
                        I tired and tired, oh..... I just 
                        can't get you off of my mind
                        Your love, your love, your love 
                        means more to me then life itself
                        And without you I can't go on
                        There's nothing, nothing I can do 
                        To pick up the pieces no matter how 
                        hard
                        It seems that you were made for me 
                        baby 
                        And no matter how I try 
                        I can't, I can't, I can't...

           This is surreal. It doesn’t make sense. The song starts to 
           slow down, the words are warped. Her father isn’t her father 
           anymore. It’s the Uber driver. 

           It’s her father. 

           It’s the Uber driver. 

           It’s her father. 

           The song slows to a stop. The sound of static rises to a 
           screeching noise. The car fills with bright light.

                                                          FADE TO WHITE

           INT. AIRPLANE - TOILET

           Elizabeth pukes. 

           Flushes and takes a seat on the toilet... but not for long as 
           she pukes again.

           INT. AIRPLANE - SEAT

           Elizabeth squeezes back into her window seat. 

           The OLDER BLACK WOMAN next to her can’t stop staring. 

           Elizabeth smiles weakly, in hopes that satisfies her. 

                                 OLDER BLACK WOMAN
                        You okay?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mhum. 
                                 OLDER BLACK WOMAN
                        You were crying in your sleep.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have night terrors.

                                 OLDER BLACK WOMAN
                            (confused)
                        Oh.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My dad’s dying.

           Older Black woman holds her hand. Elizabeth is comforted by 
           this. 

           She looks at the clouds through the window.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        His kidneys don’t work anymore. 
                        Dialysis can’t help him. No one can 
                        help him. 

           EXT. HOSPICE CENTER – NIGHT

           Elizabeth is met by her mom, KAREN.

                                 KAREN
                        Hey baby.

           She takes Elizabeth’s bag. Fusses over her just a bit. She 
           starts to cry.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mom, please don’t.

                                 KAREN
                        Are you okay? I love you so much.

           Her mother’s hug suffocates her.

           INT. HOSPICE CENTER - NIGHT 

           Karen leads Elizabeth through the sterile halls. She looks 
           around at the glum faces of families who are in the throes of 
           the long goodbye.

           They arrive at a door. Karen lingers for a sec before she 
           opens it.
           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           They walk into the room filled with CHURCH PEOPLE she’s never 
           met who have surrounded her dad’s bed. They’re praying.

           ROBERT, Elizabeth’s father, notices Elizabeth come through 
           the door.

           He sits up and stretches his arms out to her.

                                 ROBERT
                        Elizabeth?

           She slips through the group and plops herself on top of her 
           father for a bed hug.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s my big girl.

           The prayer continues. It’s annoying.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (to Robert)
                        Can they please leave now?

           INT. HOSPICE CENTER - NIGHT

           Elizabeth pays a PIZZA DELIVERY MAN.

           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM

           Karen is sleeping on a roll-away bed in the corner.

           Elizabeth comes in with the pizza.

                                 ROBERT
                            (whispers)
                        Keep your voice down.

           She takes out a slice and holds it up so he can take a bite. 
           It’s slow going but he gets the pizza down easy enough.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Probably feels good to have 
                        everything off the forbidden food 
                        list.

                                 ROBERT
                        I love me some pizza.
           Elizabeth watches him, carefully. Studies his face. Tries to 
           solidify his image in her brain. 

           He know’s she’s doing it. He does it right back.

           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM – LATER

           Everyone is asleep. Elizabeth is knocked out in the chair 
           next to her dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        (weak) Kar. Kar. Karen?

           Elizabeth springs straight up in her chair. Karen is so tired 
           she doesn’t even hear.

           She gets close to him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dad? We’re here.

                                 ROBERT
                        Libby?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You okay?

                                 ROBERT
                        Can you get me some water honey?

           She opens up a water bottle and puts a straw in it. She 
           hovers the bottle in front of his mouth so he can sip.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Thank you Libby.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dad?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yeah?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you scared?

                                 ROBERT
                        No. I’m tired.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m scared.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re supposed to be scared. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m always scared. 

                                 ROBERT
                        My careful girl. Always so careful. 
                        Always so hard on yourself.

           She keeps hearing this. She takes it in for a moment. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth, I wasted so much time. 
                        Doing stuff I had to do, so you 
                        didn’t have to.

           He takes a deep breath.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I wish I had taken better care of 
                        my body. It’s my fault I’m here...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I wish you had, too.

           He grabs her arm... tight. He means it. Elizabeth knows it 
           and it’s uncomfortable for her. She resists his vulnerability 
           for a second but ultimately gives in, because her dad finally 
           admitted it. 

           She hugs him. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (still hugging)
                        I’m really mad at you, dad. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Please forgive me? 

           INT. HOSPICE CENTER - DAY 

           Mona walks briskly through the halls looking for Robert’s 
           room. Elizabeth sticks her head out and flags her down.

           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM - DAY 

           Mona sees her brother and instantly falls apart.

                                 MONA
                        (weeping) Oh. My big brother.
           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM – NIGHT

           Elizabeth reads a book in the chair next to her dad as he 
           sleeps. 

           Karen and Mona speak in hushed tones on the couch.

           Robert’s breathing looks more labored than before.

                                 MONA
                        Libby, I’m gonna take your mom home 
                        for a minute to take a shower and 
                        change clothes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay.

           INT. ROBERT’S ROOM – LATER

           Elizabeth fights sleep as she sits and watches her father.

           He wakes up from time to time to look at her.

           Their glances keep missing one another. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIZABETH’S OLD HOUSE – DAY

           Elizabeth grazes in the various food tables and avoids any 
           sort of interaction from anyone.

           She watches them all. They know not to bother her. 

           Except for Mona, who kisses her on the forehead. 

           IN THE KITCHEN, Dani helps Karen and Mona with everything. 
           Refills drinks, picks up discarded plates. She really and 
           truly is the sister Elizabeth never had. 

           Elizabeth passes through without a word and heads upstairs.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S OLD ROOM - DAY 

           She shuts the door and locks it. She sits on her bed 
           surrounded by the relics from her childhood: A Backstreet 
           Boys poster, various trophies, books, and an old bike. 

           Her phone rings.

           It’s Nad.
           She answers. Holds the phone for a minute. Finally:

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hello?

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        Hey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hi.

           Silence. She waits again. 

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        How’s it going?

           Elizabeth says nothing... Because, really?

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        Sorry it’s been awhile. I was crazy 
                        busy and –

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (confrontational)
                        Come ON, Nad.

                                 NAD (CONT)
                        Yeah, I know I’ve been kinda M.I.A. 
                        Completely my bad. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Uh huh. 

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        What are you up to right now? Wanna 
                        hang out or something?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What am I up to? FUCK YOU NADEESH.

           She hangs up.

           Rage builds in her body.

           She calls him back.

                                 NAD (O.S.)
                        Uh, hey?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        NO. Okay. NO. So you wanna HANG OUT 
                        after your ex-girlfriend ATTACKED 
                        me and then YOU decide to ignore me 
                        for over a fucking month? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Not cool man. Like an idiot, I kept 
                        trying to reach out and got 
                        nothing. NOTHING. WHERE HAVE YOU 
                        BEEN? WHY did you ignore me? Don’t 
                        I deserve better? DON’T I? The 
                        mature thing to do would have been 
                        to just say, 
                            (poorly imitating his 
                              voice)
                        Hey Elizabeth, it was fun 
                        fucking... but I don’t actually 
                        want to know you or be your friend.

           She waits for him to say something... anything. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (completely done)
                        You’re a shitty person Nadeesh.

           She hangs up again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NAD’S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Their first date:

           We see their silhouetted bodies come together. He eases her 
           down onto her back.  

           He climbs on top of her. Kisses her deeply then moves down, 
           kissing her entire body. 

           They make love. Slowly, considerably, consensually. This is 
           the first time she’s ever been so present and so vulnerable 
           with another person. This is the first time sex has meant 
           something. 

           INT. ELIZABETH’S OLD ROOM - NIGHT 

           She wakes up out of that memory. Her eyes widen. She sees her 
           mom sleeping next to her. Dani is curled up at the edge of 
           the bed with a quilt thrown over her. Mona is knocked out on 
           the floor with one of Elizabeth’s stuffed animals as a 
           pillow. She snores loudly.

           Dani opens her eyes and sees Elizabeth.

                                 DANI
                            (softly)
                        You good?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. Go back to sleep.

                                 DANI
                        You go back to sleep. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY 

           The doctor removes her cast.

           It’s off.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s so pale.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Can you move it for me?

           She bends and straightens it. Lifts it up and down.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s going to feel a little strange 
                        for a while. But you’re all healed 
                        up so you need to focus on 
                        strengthening.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long until I can ride my bike 
                        again?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Everybody is different, but if you 
                        stick to some good PT I’m thinking 
                        5-7 weeks?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jesus.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Just take it easy. Every time you 
                        have a knock or a strain you will 
                        be setting yourself back.

           EXT. MONA’S HOUSE – DAY

           Elizabeth opens up a BIKE BOX.

           She gathers all the brand new parts and puts her bike back 
           together again.
           Complete and just like new, she admires it.

           She then tries to ride her bike again. With that weak arm, 
           she’s hardly back to her former self.

           She takes it slow down the road.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM – DAY

           A graduation ceremony has ended.

           Elizabeth hovers to the side as she watches Alexis with her 
           family.

           Alexis looks up at her. Smiles. Heads in her direction.

                                 ALEXIS
                        I made it without killing one of 
                        those bitches.

           They high five.

           Alexis runs back over to her family.

           EXT. WEST ADAMS – DAY

           Elizabeth rides her bike like old times. Quickly, weaving 
           through traffic, wind in her face.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 

           She stands in the parking lot with her bike. Considers going 
           in.

           Thinks better of it.

           EXT. MONA’S HOUSE – DAY

           Mona helps Elizabeth load the last bit of stuff in her car.

           Elizabeth is finally moving out.

                                 MONA
                        You got everything Miss Libby?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ah, the only thing that won’t fit 
                        is one of my book boxes. Do you 
                        mind shipping it for me?
           Mona lifts the box.

                                 MONA
                        Um, this is gonna cost me damn near 
                        $100.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ll send you a check. Promise.

                                 MONA
                        But who’s gonna watch Empire with 
                        me?

           Elizabeth closes her trunk door and mounts her bike on the 
           bike rack.

           She turns around to see Nad watching her.

                                 NAD
                        You’re going on a road trip?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m moving.

                                 NAD
                        Where?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Back home, to Atlanta.

                                 NAD
                        Today?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. I just thought I would drive 
                        around Los Angeles with all my shit 
                        in my car.

                                 NAD
                        I get it, I’m a dick.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You are a dick.

           Nad gets an idea. 

                                 NAD
                        Can I come with you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        To Atlanta?

                                 NAD
                        I need a clean slate.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m not really trying to deal with 
                        anyone else’s shit...

                                 NAD
                        Look. I can deal with my own shit. 
                        I just think it would be cool to 
                        have a change of scenery while I 
                        paint, and, well, and I would like 
                        this thing between you and me to 
                        work. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What thing?

                                 NAD
                        Whatever the fuck this is. I like 
                        you, you like me, we like hanging 
                        out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’ll change your mind.

           She gets in the car.

                                 NAD
                        I won’t.

           Nad jumps in the passenger seat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You don’t even know who I am.

                                 NAD
                        That’s only because you wouldn’t 
                        let me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why should I? 

           He gets comfortable. Stretches out flirtatiously. 

                                 NAD
                        Because. 

            She challenges him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because?? 

           He looks at her sheepishly. He doesn’t know. 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you get your shit 
                        together first then call me?

                                 NAD
                        Yeah, sure.

           He slides out of the car. Shuts the door. 

           Stands there.

           Elizabeth starts the car. He’s still standing there. 

                                 NAD (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           She pulls away, watching him from her rear-view mirror. 

           He waves goodbye.

           As she drives, the image of him gets smaller and smaller... 
           until he’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NEW SPIN STUDIO - DAY

           Elizabeth teaches her signature 90’s pop class to a group of 
           predominately black women in their 30s. All shapes and sizes. 

           She’s back in her element.

           INT. TURNER HOUSE – LATER

           --- Elizabeth helps her mom paint the living room a fresh 
           YELLOW. 

           --- They rearrange furniture.

           --- Elizabeth finds Karen on the porch reading a book. She 
           hands her mom some iced tea. Karen squeezes her tightly. 

           EXT. ALTANTA SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

           Elizabeth rides her bike. 

           Besides the moon and the occasional street light, her 
           headlamp and flashing bike lights are the only source of 
           decent illumination. 
           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE – NIGHT 

           She approaches the door of a cute little bungalow. There’s a 
           large BOX labeled FRAGILE. Sender: N.P.,12201 Hyperion Ave, 
           Los Angeles. 

           She brings it inside.

           The decor is very Elizabeth, as is the fact that its 
           incredibly neat and organized. 

           She opens the box:

           A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF HERSELF. Clearly a Nadeesh Phulwani 
           original. 

           Throws her KEYS in a bowl.

           She then walks into her kitchen. Goes straight for the 
           fridge, pulls out A SALAD and a fork then plops onto her 
           couch.

           She opens her laptop. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
