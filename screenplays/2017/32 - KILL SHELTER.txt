           OVER BLACK

           Amália Rodrigues, belting out a gorgeous fado.  Singing her
           heart out through the tinny sound system of a

           INT. SAAB 900 HATCHBACK - PARKED - NIGHT (DAY 3)

           GORDON -- a tired man in his early 60s -- sits behind the
           wheel.  Just the battery on, headlights killed.  He's
           staring out the windshield at something up the street. 

           His eyes flit over to the dashboard clock:  10:04. 
           He lowers the volume, cracks the window... 

           He takes out a cigarette and BREAKS OFF the filter,
           tucks the filter back in the pack.  He lights what
           remains of the cigarette... takes one drag and instantly
           WINCES, repulsed.

           He takes another masochistic drag... COUGHS harshly. 
           He throws the cigarette outside in disgust.

           Gordon rolls up the window, turns up Amália again and sits
           back in his seat.  He crosses his arms... mouths a
           Portuguese phrase along with the music...

           He's waiting.  After a beat he SITS UP, attention roused
           by...

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           ... the front door of a SHABBY STUCCO HOUSE swinging open
           with a little too much force.  A YOUNG 20-SOMETHING WOMAN
           storms out into the quiet residential street.

           BACK IN GORDON'S SAAB

           He watches from a few houses down as the woman gets into her
           car.  She slams the door and drives off. 

           Gordon furtively checks his mirrors, then reaches over to
           the passenger seat... picks up a SILENCED HANDGUN.  He cuts
           the ignition, interrupting the fado mid-moan, gets out of
           his Saab and closes the door.

           EXT. STREET

           We PULL on Gordon as he walks up the sidewalk.  Nice shirt,
           light windbreaker, khakis...  Normal enough looking guy,
           except for the gun.  
           Things get even less normal when he puts on a HAIRNET. 
           He tucks the gun under his arm and snaps on a pair of
           LATEX GLOVES. 

           No fanfare.  No nervousness.  Gordon dons these items
           like a hungover Walmart employee throwing on their apron
           before the morning shift.

           He pauses when he reaches the house... moves past us...

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Gordon comes around the side of the house, stops in front of
           the BACK PORCH, then gingerly makes his way up the warped
           wooden stairs.

           About halfway up, he STOPS -- ducks a few inches --

           GORDON'S POV:  Inside the house, a YOUNG 20-SOMETHING MAN
           (back to us) is turning off the sink in the kitchen beyond
           the living room.  He dries his hands and disappears into
           another room...

           Gordon uses this moment to silently creep up the remaining
           steps.  Once on the porch, he tiptoes to the sliding glass
           door.  Edges around to peer inside...

           GORDON'S POV:  The Young Man, noticeably distraught, returns
           to the living room.  He plops down on a neon purple BOUNCY
           YOGA BALL... and starts CRYING.  Softly.  Head in his hands.

           ON GORDON:  At first confused, even a bit disgusted -- so
           it's gonna be one of these, huh?  But his face slowly
           changes, expression taking on more empathy, more sorrow...

           This guy really looks miserable...

           Something catches Gordon's eye -- from his POV, we TILT DOWN
           to reveal:

           A DOG

           Staring up at us, head bent to one side, tongue lolling. 
           Gordon almost jumps out of his skin -- it's right on the
           other side of the glass.

           The dog, a collar-less five-week-old HUSKY PUPPY, is so cute
           it's fucking painful.  Even Gordon can't help but crack a
           smile.

           He playfully puts a latex finger to his lips.  A beat as the
           dog stares back, winningly stupid...  Eventually Gordon
           looks back up.  Sighs.
           He SHOVES OPEN the sliding glass door...

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           ... and steps into the room, gun drawn.  The dog SCATTERS.

           Yoga Ball Guy TRIPS BACKWARDS, falling off the bouncy ball,
           scrambling to wipe away tears:

                                 YOGA BALL GUY
                        What the fuck is your-- you know
                        there's a front door??

                                 GORDON
                        Now now, calm down.

           Yoga Ball Guy -- real name BENNETT LASKY -- gets up,
           embarrassed, as Gordon slides the door closed. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Who are you??  Where's Mr.
                        Richmond?

                                 GORDON
                        He's out in the car.

           We get a look around:  a cute, old house gone to shit
           through neglect.  Clearly decorated by an elderly person. 
           Dishes and beer bottles invade the quaint space, as well as
           a couple DUFFEL BAGS overflowing with wrinkled clothes.  

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        You didn't really think he'd do
                        this himself...?

                                 BENNETT

                            (
                                         )
                        No.  No.  Of course not.
                             then, ashamed
                        How long were you, uh...

                                 GORDON
                        Long enough.  Struck out with the
                        lady, huh?...
                            (
                             there there
                                       )
                        Least you weren't jacking off. 
                        Or's that what this's for...?

           He softly kicks the bouncy ball across the room... 

           It caroms off a colorful, blinking MECHANICAL DEVICE that
           looks like a STRAITJACKET DESIGNED BY DAFT PUNK (more info
           to come).
           A beat as they both stare at it...

                                 BENNETT
                        ... Not that it matters to you, but
                        I suffer from spinal stenosis, an
                        abnormal narrowing of the--

                                 GORDON
                        You're right. 
                             then
                            (
                                 )
                        ... What's that smell?

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh -- sorry, I... I should take out
                        the trash...

           He looks Gordon over... hasn't really taken in the gun/
           gloves/hairnet combo until now.  Gordon notices his worry.

                            (
                             re: gun
                                 GORDON
                                   )
                        So you don't rob me. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        You've got the uh... the little,
                        uh...?

                                 BENNETT
                        ... The thumb drive?

           Gordon nods.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Do you have the money?...

           Gordon pulls a THICK, SEALED ENVELOPE out of his jacket,
           holds it up.  Bennett's eyes widen.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        ... 90 grand?

                                 GORDON
                        Mhmm.

           Bennett smiles, sincere.  Lets out a relieved chuckle:

                                 BENNETT
                        That's truly...  Thank you.  Thank
                        you.

           He reaches out to grab the envelope, but Gordon takes a step
           back, raises the gun:

                                 GORDON
                        Not before the wedding.
           Bennett's smile fades.  Becoming forcibly casual:

                                 BENNETT
                        It's -- just have to grab it --
                                                     )
                            (
                             gesturing to another room
                        Be right back.

           Gordon nods.  Bennett exits the room. 

           A beat as Gordon stands there looking around the living
           room.  He breathes a tired sigh.

           Bennett returns carrying a SMALL USB FLASH DRIVE.  The HUSKY
           PUPPY follows him in, sits contentedly in a doorway.

           ON BENNETT:  We TRACK behind him to see...

                            (
                             holding up the drive
                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                                                )
                        Got it.

           ... an OLD REVOLVER jammed in the back of his waistband,
           concealed from Gordon.

                                 GORDON
                        Good.  Good.

           He trains his silenced gun back on Bennett.  A beat as
           Gordon stares at him.  Unblinking.  Stoic.  Resigned...

           ON BENNETT:  Nervous...  Sensing something's changed.  He
           holds out the drive.  A peace offering. 

           His OTHER HAND (ever so gently -- imperceptible to Gordon)
           begins to inch toward his side... 

                            (
                             shaky
                                 BENNETT
                                 )
                        It's... it's formatted for PC, but
                        it should work in--

           PFT!-PFT! -- Gordon FIRES TWO ROUNDS into Bennett's CHEST. 
           Bennett lurches back -- the FLASH DRIVE flies out of his
           hand and slides to a STOP directly in front of the HUSKY. 

           Bennett slumps lifelessly to the floor. 

           A beat.  Gordon looks down at Bennett's body... 

           He turns to collect the flash drive, sees the dog sniffing
           at it --

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Hey...
           He WHIPS AROUND:  Bennett's still alive (barely), and
           holding out his REVOLVER, aimed shakily at Gordon.

                                 GORDON
                        Easy now...  Where'd ya get that...

           CLOSE ON THE REVOLVER:  Bennett weakly tries to SQUEEZE THE
           TRIGGER... 

           Can't muster the strength... 

           His arm collapses.

           ON GORDON:  Tension turning to relief, then pity... 

           He uses his shoe to nudge Bennett's revolver away, then
           bends down, presses two fingers to Bennett's throat.

           No pulse.  He goes into Bennett's front pocket, pulls
           out his IPHONE.  He places it on the floor, then
           STOMPS REPEATEDLY until it's a pile of circuits and
           powdered glass.

           He remembers the flash drive, turns around to grab
           it...

           GORDON'S POV:  It's gone.

           And oh boy does it get worse...  TILT UP to reveal:

           FOUR IDENTICAL HUSKY PUPPIES 

           Where there used to be only ONE.  A beat as Gordon stands
           there, bewildered.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        No.

           He drops to the floor, starts frantically feeling around for
           the flash drive...  No dice.  His searching gets more
           aggravated...

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        How in Christ...

           The four puppies look on placidly as Gordon loses his shit. 
           Tossing aside books and dishes, sliding over furniture. 
           Flash drive nowhere to be found.

           ON GORDON:  Now staring at the huskies.  He wipes his
           forehead.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        There's no way...
           Crouched on the floor, he goes down the line prying their
           mouths open, peering in, wiggling a gloved finger inside.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        ... You idiots.  You goddamn
                        idiots...

           His search comes up empty.

           Gordon stands.  The puppies look up at him, oblivious to his
           despair.  He wipes his hand on his pant leg. 

           He gets out his CELL PHONE, dials a number...  Takes a deep
           breath as it rings...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Gordon?  You're fucking late --
                        what happened?  You do it?

                                 GORDON
                        Hi.  Well --

                                 GORDON
                        Yeah.  He's gone, but --

                        MINUTES, Gina?!  Is that too much
                        to fucking ask?  THANK you.

                                 GORDON
                        Hang on, Grant -- there's a
                        problem.

                        Huh?  What?  What problem?

           A beat.  Gordon swallows.
                                 GORDON
                        I -- I don't have the drive.  Or, I
                        do.  Kind of.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Is this a fucking zen riddle?  What
                        is this shit?  Do you have it or do
                        you DON'T have it??

                                 GORDON
                        Yes, I have it.  Technically.  But
                        this guy...  He's got all these
                        dogs.  And I think --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        So?

                                 GORDON
                        I think one might've...  See, there
                        was a bit of a -- not a struggle,
                        exactly -- but, when I shot him, he
                        uh, he dropped it...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        You fed my flash drive to a dog?

           Gordon winces. 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You fed my flash drive to a FUCKING
                        dog??

           A beat, then...

                                 GORDON
                        One of them.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        One of them??  WHICH fucking one of
                        them??

                                 GORDON
                        I don't -- I'm not sure.  There's
                        four --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Four?!

                                 GORDON
                        -- and they all look exactly the
                        same --
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        God-fucking...  So just -- just cut
                        'em open one by one until you
                        fucking find it. 

           Gordon laughs this off.

                                 GORDON
                        Not happening.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        What do you mean not happening??

                        You kill people for a living. 
                        They're just fucking dogs, Gordon. 
                        You can't kill some dumb fucking
                        dogs??

                                 GORDON
                        I'd... prefer to find another
                        solution.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        You understand what happens if this
                        isn't taken care of?

                                                  )
                             Gordon tries to answer
                        Shut up.  No.  You don't.  One of
                        those dogs is gonna shit that thing
                        out the SECOND you leave -- and
                        when the cops find that ratfuck's
                        body, they find that, they find me,
                        they find you -- everything's
                        fucked.  So cut 'em open!!  Or
                        bring 'em to me and I'LL cut 'em
                        open if you're gonna be such a
                        whiny fucking pussy about it. 

                                 GORDON
                        Grant --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Fuck you.  Midnight.  At midnight,
                        you're either bringing me that
                        drive, or you're bringing me every
                        single one of those asshole fucking
                        dogs.  YOU fucked this up.  I
                        didn't fuck this up.  You did.  Fix
                        it.

           CLICK -- the line goes dead.  Gordon lowers his phone,
           stares out, morose.

           He sits on the YOGA BALL...  Stares down at the puppies....

           Off the huskies, slowly PUSHING IN:

           Pink.  "Guava Goddess."  Sitting on a fridge shelf.

           He's alone, wearing HEADPHONES that are connected to a large

           CONDENSER MICROPHONE, talking alongside the audio from a

           Bennett's speech is stilted and unnatural.  The small room
           (his "office") is dim and dingy with black soundproofing on
           the walls, only personalization being a 3D PIN ART BOX at
           his side -- one of those office toys where you push your
           handprint into a thousand tiny metal pins. 

           He sits in front of a DESKTOP COMPUTER, hands hovering over

           Bennett mouse-clicks a couple buttons on his screen, then
           visibly de-tenses.  Sinks back in his chair... 

           Because we're getting a direct line from the news studio,
           their AUDIO FEED continues through the commercial break. 
           Bennett listens stoically:

                                 GRANT (V.O.)
                        What the fuck is this??  "Guava

           Bennett winces.

                        Was that necessary, Grant?

           Off Bennett, pushing his raised middle finger into the pin
           art box and shaking it at the screen...

           INT. HORIZON CAPTIONING - HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           We PUSH down a dusty, fluorescent-lit hallway lined with
           identical, equally spaced doors.  More cell block than
           office.  An UNSETTLING MURMUR of muffled, emotionless voices
           fills the air (men and women robotically intoning various
           broadcasts.)

           REVERSE on BENNETT.  Going from door to door, peeking
           through each slat of glass...  Looking for someone... 
           He opens a door --

           INT. SMALL CAPTIONING STUDIO

           A nerdy, scruffy-looking GUY is reading pangrams into a
           microphone, doing a new trainee's best impression of
           caption-speak.  A coworker (SCOTT) sits behind him, jotting
           down notes.

           They JERK AROUND as Bennett pokes into the room.  Nerdy Guy
           pauses -- Scott gestures keep going, then looks at Bennett,
           annoyed, mouths:  what??

                                 NERDY GUY

                        Scott...

           On Nerdy Guy's COMPUTER MONITOR:  the bizarre words go from
           RED to GREEN like some kind of malfunctioning karaoke
           machine.
                      SCOTT
           She's your fucking trainee.
                                                    NERDY GUY

           Off Bennett's dejected face:

           A massive, character-less plaza downtown.  LOGOS next to the
           heavy glass doors show several business tenants (all
           broadcasting-related).  KCBB's logo is largest at the top. 
           HORIZON CAPTIONING's logo is small at the bottom.

           BENNETT emerges from the doors, walks a few feet to a BENCH
           by the entrance.

           He takes a seat.  Pulls a rumpled sandwich out of his
           backpack and starts eating. 

           As he eats, he looks out at something in the distance...
           Fixating on it...

           ACROSS THE STREET

           WEST TEMPLE ANIMAL SHELTER.  A long building that takes up a
           good chunk of the block it's on.

           Bennett's IPHONE RINGS...  He answers, still gazing across
           the street:

                                 BENNETT
                        Hey...  Grandma?  Hey, hi...  Sure,
                        sure, just eating lunch...

           CLOSER ON THE ANIMAL SHELTER:  Through the LARGE FRONT
           WINDOW, we see a couple EMPLOYEES behind the reception desk: 
           a 20-something woman -- LIZ, and a middle-aged Hispanic
           woman -- PAOLA.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I talked to the insurance people,
                        they're covering 75 percent...

           Liz appears to be helping a small family adopt a cat. 
           Perhaps we recognize her as the young woman leaving
           Bennett's place in a huff at the start of the movie (though
           her clothes are a little different here).
                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                            (
                             absent
                                  )
                        How're you settling in?...  The
                        dogs are fine, they're good... 
                        It's a shame, I know... but
                        it's... the room is private,
                        right?...

           Bennett's pretty checked out as he talks, instead focusing
           on Liz.  We're currently watching his favorite part of the
           day... the part where he spends 25 minutes creepily staring
           at the Girl From The Animal Shelter He'll Never Talk To.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I know...  It's uh, it's gonna get
                        better, I promise.  You just have
                        to make some friends...

           INT. SMALL CAPTIONING STUDIO - DAY - LATER

           A new employee, DOREEN, 50ish, anxiously struggles to repeat
           the words of a PBS-style educational video playing into her
           headphones (an off-air training exercise).  BENNETT sits
           behind her, observing.

                                 DOREEN
                        ... history of HOT -- HOT AIR
                        BALLOONS -- ISN'T just... a-lot-of-
                        hot-air.  PERIOD.  LAUGHTER.  1783. 
                        Three animals COMMA a sheep,
                        duck... ROOSTER.  First to
                        safely... in-a-balloon.

           ON BENNETT'S CLIPBOARD: a single piece of paper with two
           handwritten columns, "GOOD" and "BAD."  "BAD" has a strong
           lead.

                                 DOREEN (CONT'D)
                        Thanks to the -- Mawg-en-golfer?...
                        brothers from FRANCE.  The sheep
                        was named... money-seal?   Which
                        means -- MEANING -- climb.  Into
                        the skies.  PERIOD.

           CLOSE ON HIS NOTES:  he scrawls "SHITTY DIPTHONGS," joining
           "MISSING COMMAS" and "DROPPED CONTENT" in the pileup of
           criticisms under "BAD."

                                 DOREEN (CONT'D)
                        We will be RIGHT back... with
                        MORE...

           A beat... that appears to be it. 
           Thank god.  She breathes, takes off her headphones.  Then,
           to Bennett:

                                 DOREEN (CONT'D)
                            (
                             meek
                                 )
                        ... How'd I do?...

           Off Bennett, inhaling...

           INT. HORIZON CAPTIONING - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER

                                 MAE
                        I had to send her home.

           Bennett's boss, MAE (Filipina, 30s), lectures him from
           across her desk.

                                 BENNETT
                        Sorry...

                                 MAE
                        She was in tears.  She tried to
                        quit -- thankfully I talked her out
                        of it.  Her stepson had to come and
                        get her. 

                                 BENNETT
                        I just pointed out what she was
                        doing wrong.  She doesn't remember
                        ANYTHING from Unit 2, her
                        punctuation's garbage, her
                        dipthongs--

                                 MAE
                        Doreen's new.  She'll get better. 
                        You're supposed to help her do
                        that.  We can't have people
                        quitting because of a hostile work
                        environment, Bennett.

                                 BENNETT
                        So you want me to just rubber-stamp
                        them, even if they suck?

                                 MAE
                        She passed Horizon's pre-employment
                        screening.  She just needs time. 
                        This job is hard -- you know that. 
                        Rewarding, but hard.

           Bennett stifles a scoff.
                                 MAE (CONT'D)
                        Millions of people depend on us
                        every day.  And we're understaffed
                        to shit. 
                            (
                             exasperated
                                       )
                        You're one of our best, but
                        everyone's gonna keep "sucking"
                        until you learn how to share your
                        expertise... nicer.  Understand??

           Bennett sighs and nods, still standoffish.

                                 MAE (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Now don't you have Delaware
                        Supreme Court at 3?

           INT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

           THE YOGA BALL

           Depressed into an oblong under BENNETT's weight.  TILT UP to
           see his back facing us. 

           WIDER and we see he's in front of an armoire-turned-ersatz
           laptop desk.

           ON HIS LAPTOP SCREEN:  Search results for "power of attorney
           deed transfer."

           His IPHONE rings.  Bennett looks at the number... doesn't
           recognize it.  He declines the call, turns his attention
           back to the laptop --

           It rings AGAIN.  He looks down.  This time a totally
           different number.  Fuck.  He knows who's calling...

           He surrenders, picks up:

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah?  Hello?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello!  Hi!  Would this be Mr.
                        Bennett Lasky I'm currently
                        speaking with?

                                 BENNETT
                        Uh-huh.

           The voice is professional and cheery.
                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Great!  This is Rachel from Vantek. 
                        I hate to bother you at this hour,
                        but I'm calling regarding some
                        delinquent payments on your student
                        loan account.

           TWO HUSKY PUPPIES start BARKING from nearby. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah...

           Bennett gets up, clutches his back...  He shuffles the dogs
           into a room and closes the door.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        Your monthly payment amounts to
                        575.49...  We last got a payment
                        from you on... March 13.  Does that
                        match your records?

                                 BENNETT
                        Sure.

                            (
                                                    )
                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                             laughs a little too hard
                        Perfect, great.  So what we'll need
                        from you -- do you have a credit
                        card handy? -- we'll need a minimum
                        payment of 1,726.47 to keep you in
                        good standing.
                            (
                             a beat
                                  )
                        Otherwise we'll be forced to refer
                        your account to a collections
                        agency.

           A beat.  Bennett's been stewing this whole time...

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh Rachel...  Did it ever cross
                        your mind that maybe I don't have
                        seventeen hundred dollars?

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        Actually... to remain in good
                        standing --

                                 BENNETT

                        home...

                        You know what I do for a living? 
                        I'm a closed captioner.

                        you -- and Vantek -- can eat my
                        fucking dick.  How's that sound? 
                        Sound good??

           A long beat.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        We also accept money orders...

           CLICK -- Bennett HANGS UP.  Puts his phone down.  Steams for
           a beat...

           Muffled barking makes him remember the dogs. 

                                 BENNETT
                        ... fucking hate this shit...

           He goes over to the door he closed, opens it... 

           It's a midsize STORAGE CLOSET.  Inside we find ALL FOUR
           HUSKIES, plus a PISS-AND-SHIT-COVERED PEE PAD.  Bennett
           winces at the smell.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Okay.  Shhhh, shhh, I'm
                        changing it... shut up...

           He reaches into the BOX of disposable pee pads... 

           That was the last one.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Goddammit...  Just... you'll get a
                        new one tomorrow, okay?  Jesus --
                        hey -- shhhh!

           As he shuts the door on the barking huskies (and us):

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:  BRAKES CREAKING as a car slows...

           FADE UP ON:

           INT. CAR - NIGHT - (DAY 3)

           THROUGH A WINDSHIELD
           We're pulling up in front of a quiet apartment complex. 
           HEADLIGHTS rake across PAOLA, gray sweats, waiting for us.

           We stop.  She waves -- one sec -- then reaches into a nearby
           BUSH...  Re-emerges into the beams holding an ENORMOUS
           REPLICA SWORD.

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        The fuck...?

           Paola opens the rear door of Liz's 90's CAMRY, awkwardly
           guides the huge, heavy sword to the floor of the backseat. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Paola...

           She gets in next to Liz.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I meant like, pepper spray.

                                 PAOLA
                        Let's go.  Where's he live?

                                 LIZ
                        We're not gonna talk about the huge
                        ass sword?

                                 PAOLA

                        You gave me like four minutes to
                        get ready, Liz.  It's what I had.

                                 LIZ
                        Is it even sharp?

                                 PAOLA
                        Sharp enough.

           A beat.  Liz seems satisfied.

                                 LIZ
                        It is pretty intimidating...  Plus
                        it's not like we're killing the
                        guy.  Just taking the huskies.

                                 PAOLA
                        So gimme the lowdown.

                                 LIZ
                        Ohhhh man...
           Liz shifts into drive, pulls out onto the street:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                            (
                             pissed
                                  )
                        They were holed up in this tiny
                        closet.  All four of them... 
                        Dirty, barking... fucking
                        miserable.  He's not even fucking
                        walking them.

           Paola shakes her head in disapproval -- piece of shit.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        And... I don't even wanna...  There
                        was a pee pad...  I almost fucking
                        puked.  They'd been using the same
                        one for days.

                            (
                             disgusted
                                 PAOLA
                                     )
                        Damn...  Honestly doesn't surprise
                        me.  Seemed like a creep.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah.  I can now confirm that. 

                                 PAOLA
                        Well, just so we're clear...  You
                        know there're ways to do what we're
                        doing that are more... uh...

                                 LIZ
                        ... Legal?

                                 PAOLA
                        Legal.  And ethical.  And safe.

           A beat.  Liz nods, gets a little more serious...

                                 LIZ
                        We have to do this Paola.  The pups
                        need us.  We'll call it owner
                        surrender.
                            (
                             resolute
                                    )
                        We have to get them outta there. 
                        Tonight. 

           Paola understands this is very important to her.  She sits
           back.

                                 PAOLA
                        Oookay.  Just saying, he comes at
                        me... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAOLA (CONT'D)
                        I am straight up stabbing him in
                        the motherfucking chest with the
                        Blade of the King of Men.

           Liz smirks.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

           BENNETT's house.  SHIFT to see Liz's Camry pulling into a
           spot half a block away.

           INT. LIZ'S CAMRY

           Liz turns off the car, unbuckles her seatbelt.

                                 LIZ
                        So should we have like... a
                        strategy?

                                 PAOLA
                        If he won't give 'em up?

                                 LIZ
                        Well that's what the sword is for. 
                        I mean more like, should we have a
                        speech ready?...

           Paola snorts.

                                 PAOLA
                        Yeah sure.  How about "give us the
                        fucking dogs, asshole."  

                                 LIZ
                        Whoawhoawhoa --

           Something's caught Liz's attention:

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  In front of Bennett's house:

           GORDON.  Struggling awkwardly with a LARGE CARDBOARD BOX,
           roughly the size of a mini fridge, "WAKESTREAM" printed on
           the side.  HUSKY SNOUTS AND PAWS poke out of the top,
           harassing his face.  Their shifting weight forces him to
           constantly readjust his grip.

                                 PAOLA
                        Who the hell's that guy?

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know...
           Gordon's waddling back to his Saab as fast as he can, given
           the circumstances.  He trips on some grass, barely catches
           his footing.

                            (
                             squinting
                                 PAOLA
                                     )
                        Does he...  In that box...?

                                 LIZ
                        That's a box o' huskies alright. 

                                 PAOLA
                        Those are them?

                                 LIZ
                                 )
                            (
                             nods
                        Uh-huh...
                            (
                             a beat
                                  )
                        What the fuck's going on?

                                 PAOLA
                        You don't recognize him?

           Liz shakes her head, still staring at Gordon.  A beat as
           they watch him wrestle the puppy box into the back of his
           Saab...

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        I'm not exactly getting the vibe
                        he's here to rescue them.

                                 PAOLA
                            (
                             shrugs
                                  )
                        Guess we can skip Bennett.

                                 LIZ
                        So then -- wait -- what do we do? 
                        He didn't say anything about
                        someone coming to pick them up...

           Gordon's lights FLICK ON.  He starts maneuvering out of his
           spot...

                                 PAOLA
                        You got about three seconds to
                        decide.

                                 LIZ
                        Where's he taking them?  Fuck.

           Gordon's Saab starts down the street.

           Liz starts the car.  Paola grins, rubs her hands together.
           As the Camry pulls out onto the street after Gordon...

           EXT. GORDON'S SAAB - DRIVING - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Gordon, behind the wheel.  Calm for all of three seconds
           before SCREEEEECH!

           Liz's Camry SWERVES TO CUT HIM OFF, forcing him to PANIC
           STOP -- 

                                 GORDON
                        SHIT!

           -- Gordon's arm SHOOTS BACK reflexively to stabilize the
           puppy box.  He HONKS several times (now stopped on the side
           of the road).

           THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD

           Paola gets out of the Camry's passenger side, stares down
           Gordon.  Not breaking eye contact, she strides to the
           Camry's rear door.

           Gordon's pulled away from this by Liz POUNDING ON HIS HOOD:

                                 LIZ
                        Hey!  Sir!

           She comes around to his window, which he rolls down a couple
           inches.

                                 GORDON
                        ... Can I help you?

                            (
                                 LIZ
                             pointing
                                    )
                        Are those your dogs?  Sir?  No. 
                        Not your dogs.  We saw you taking
                        them.  We're from, uh -- we're
                        acting on behalf of the West Temple
                        Animal Shelter, and we uh... we
                        DEMAND you surrender them to us! 
                        This instant!

           A beat.  Gordon processes all this... decides he doesn't
           give a shit.

                                 GORDON
                        Sorry miss, I need them.
                            (
                             then, maybe recognizing
                                                   )
                        ... Wait... were you--?

           KRRKKKKK-KRK-KRRKK...
                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                            (
                                            )
                             craning his neck
                        Hey!  What are you doing?

           Paola is trying to PRY OPEN the Saab's rear door with her
           EGREGIOUSLY LARGE SWORD.  And it's kind of working.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Stop that.  Hey. 

           Gordon puts it in park, gets out.  Liz takes a step back. 
           Paola turns the sword on Gordon.

                                 PAOLA
                        Stay back!

           Gordon wearily PULLS OUT HIS GUN, aims it at Paola.

                 (
                      LIZ
                  stunned
                         )
                                               (
                                                            )
                                                    PAOLA
                                                disappointed
                                            Awwww... asshole...
           Holy fuck bro... wait up,
           wait up...

           Gordon swings the gun between them.  He kicks his door shut
           behind him, quickly locks the car.  (By now the puppies are
           out of their box, barking, squirming around the backseat.)

                            (
                             to Paola
                                 GORDON
                                    )
                        You.  Give me the sword.  Now.

           Paola reluctantly hands it over.  Gordon takes it -- it's
           heavy.  Gordon glares at her, very, very fucking done with
           all of this:

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Who even has this??

           Gordon puts his gun in his jacket, then goes over to Liz's
           Camry --

                                 LIZ
                        No -- dude! -- don't --

           -- and PLUNGES the sword into Liz's BACK TIRE.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You fucking -- ah, fuuuuuck you
                        dude.  Goddammit.

                                 GORDON
                        Stop following me.
           He impassively drops the sword on the pavement.  Liz and
           Paola are speechless...  (Though Paola does seem a little
           relieved she's getting her sword back.)

           Without another word, Gordon unlocks his door, gets back in
           his car.  We STAY with Liz and Paola as he awkwardly steers
           around the Camry and PEELS OFF...

           Puppies in tow, unfortunately. 

           A beat as Liz gazes helplessly after the Saab.  

                                 LIZ
                        He said he "needed" them...  What
                        in the fuck...?

           Paola picks up her sword.

                                 PAOLA
                            (
                             grim
                                 )
                        Looked like a perv to me.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT - LATER

           Gordon's Saab pulls slowly into a dark, deserted lot.  He
           angles the car so his headlights splash against a graffiti-
           ridden CEMENT WALL.  The engine silences but the lights stay
           on.

           Gordon steps out, moving quickly, professionally.  He snaps
           on LATEX GLOVES, then opens the back door.

           GORDON'S POV:  Scanning the dogs...

           ON GORDON:  Frowning.  Eventually he sighs, picks up the
           husky closest to him and shuts the car door.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           GORDON'S JACKET

           ... being laid flat one-handed on the cracked asphalt. 

           WIDER and we see Gordon's crouched in the yellow beams,
           using the reflection on the wall for more visibility.  He
           kneels on his jacket, then places the puppy in front of him.

           GORDON'S POV:  A beat as the puppy stares up at us.

                                 GORDON
                        Sorry, pal. 
           And he means it...  He places one hand on the dog's NECK and
           the other on top of its SKULL.

           ON GORDON:  we PUSH IN slowly...

           ON THE HUSKY:  Lightly squirming to get free...

           ON GORDON:  Still PUSHING IN... just take a deep breath... 
           He's about to TWIST when:

           ON THE HUSKY:  It starts licking his hand.  

           Gordon stares slackly at the puppy. 

           He can't fucking do it.  At least like this.  He releases
           his grip. 

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Yeah...  Okay...

           He closes his eyes.  Breathes. 

           He starts to reach in his pocket -- then PAUSES, something
           occurring to him.

           He scoots off of his jacket, patting it gently.  The puppy
           crawls onto it.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                             weak
                                 )
                            (
                        Better?...

           He goes back into his pocket and pulls out a FOLDING KNIFE. 
           He flicks it open -- it's a horrifying, S-curved TACTICAL
           BLADE meant for one purpose and one purpose only... and it's
           definitely not puppy evisceration.

           With his free hand, Gordon PINS the husky on its back
           against the jacket.  The dog's squirming gets more intense.

           Gordon awkwardly tries to HOLD THE DOG STILL so its belly is
           exposed...

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Stop, will ya?...  Don't make this
                        worse...

           But it won't stop struggling.  Gordon moves the knife over
           the puppy, trying to find a good enough angle. 

           The dog YIPS.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Hey... it's okay...
           CLOSE ON THE DOG:  Gordon begins LIGHTLY SCRATCHING it
           behind the ear.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        It's okay...

           And miraculously... the squirming STOPS.  The puppy lies
           still under Gordon's spell.

           ON GORDON:  Smiling now... but the smile quickly fades as he
           remembers the unpleasant task at hand.

           ON THE HUSKY:  Calm... belly up as Gordon scratches it....

           ON GORDON:  Lifting the knife, face tightening into a
           shameful wince...  Preparing to do something unforgivable...

           ON THE HUSKY:  BLADE TIP tickling FUR...

           A tense beat...  Gordon inhales DEEP...

           ... and PULLS AWAY. 

           He exhales.  Slow.  Shakes his head -- nope.  He closes the
           knife.  

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Uh-uh.

           A beat.

           He goes into a jacket pocket... pulls out his CIGARETTES. 
           He takes one, breaks off the filter.

           He PAUSES before lighting it.  A short beat as he grimaces
           at the filter-less tube of tobacco...

           Fuck this.  He tosses it.  He's having a real one.  He pulls
           a new cigarette out of the pack.  He lights it, exhales --

           Ahhhh yeah.  There it is...  He takes another puff. 

           He remembers the dog, looks down at it... solemn
           expression...

           He hangs his cigarette in his mouth, peels off a latex
           glove.

           Off Gordon, scratching the dog with his bare fingers... 
           Wondering what the fuck he's gonna do...
           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET

           Cheap, slow-building library music (pulsating synths,
           strings) plays over DRONE FOOTAGE of a pristine tropical
           beach.  We land on -- perched incongruously on the alabaster
           sand --

           THE WAKESTREAM HEDONE.

           The crazy blinking chiropractic device we saw at Bennett's
           house.  A bespoke leather U-shaped harness covered in LEDs
           and ROLLING SHIATSU BALLS.

           (We're currently watching a PROMOTIONAL VIDEO -- upscale,
           artsy.  Heavy on imagery, light on information).

           Superimposed over the WakeStream, which is now reclining in
           a LUSH BAMBOO GROVE:

                hedone (greek myth) - the personification and goddess of
                           pleasure, enjoyment, and delight.

                                 CHILD'S WHISPER (V.O.)
                        ...Hedone...

           We CUT TO the WakeStream, triumphant atop a SNOWY PEAK as if
           it climbed there itself, then --

           ANIMATED GRAPHICS:  A unisex diagram of a person's back/
           torso, wearing the device.  Glowing ORANGE pressure points
           turn COOL BLUE as the Shiatsu balls work their miracles.

                            eight motorized shiatsu spheres
                               hand-tooled platinum alloy
                                individually adjustable
                                 radiant light therapy

           The WakeStream is now resplendent on the TEAK DECK of a
           STEAMING ICELANDIC HOT SPRING, basking in the hypnotizing
           purples and greens of the NORTHERN LIGHTS.

                                  all-new TENS system

           As the music crescendos, REVERSE on:

           INT. SMALL CAPTION STUDIO - EVENING (DAY 2)

           BENNETT, watching the video on his work computer. 
           Entranced.  It's beautiful...  Could this be the answer to
           his back problems?...  To... everything?
           ON HIS SCREEN:  The WakeStream in a JAPANESE GARDEN,
           lounging on a carpet of cherry blossom petals.

           Bennett watches intently. 

           We eventually become aware of soft, tinny NOISE coming from
           OFF SCREEN...

           Bennett hears it, too -- the fuck is that?  Are those
           voices?  He PAUSES the video -- looks around...

           It's his HEADPHONES.  Lying on the edge of his desk.

           He looks over to the BUSINESS LANDLINE (CALL IN PROGRESS --
           both parties neglected to hang up/disconnect following
           today's broadcast). 

           Bennett reaches out to hang it up, but --

           A LOUD MOAN stops him in his tracks.  Coming from the
           headphones.

                                 BENNETT
                        ...huh...?

           He puts them on.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Yeah... oh yeah... ugh...
                            (
                             grunting
                                    )

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                            (
                             not enjoying this, but
                             playing along)
                        That feels so good...

           We all know what's happening.  Bennett's leering grin
           confirms he does, too.

                                 BENNETT
                        No way.

           With the quickness of a horny sparrow, he rushes and LOCKS
           THE DOOR to the caption studio. 

           He sits back down, eagerly slips the headphones back on.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Tell me... one more time, baby...

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Yeah?...
                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Who's my fucking guava goddess...

           A look in Bennett's eyes -- why is that familiar?... then:

                                 BENNETT
                        Shit.

                                 FEMALE P.A. (V.O.)
                        I am. 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Say it...

                                 FEMALE P.A. (V.O.)
                        I'm... your guava goddess, Grant.

           It's pretty much ruined for Bennett now.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        You fucking call me Mr. Richmond.

           We hear a SPANK followed by a YELP.

           Bennett frowns, now listening mostly out of morbid curiosity
           as Grant Richmond, respected news anchor, rails a PA who'd
           probably get fired if she wasn't going along with this.

           But Bennett's expression CHANGES... 

           His eyes slowly WIDEN...

           In a burst of movement he LURCHES to his keyboard/mouse,
           opens AUDIO RECORDING SOFTWARE (like Audacity).

           His knees bounce up and down as the software loads -- come
           on, come on...

           It finishes.  He RECORD ENABLES a track, hits the space bar,
           then swings over to the BUSINESS LANDLINE, cranks the volume
           all the way up --

                            (
                             tinny
                                 FEMALE P.A. (V.O.)
                                 )
                        Should I get on the desk?...
                            (
                             awkward movement
                                            )

           He presses one of the headphone cups over his CONDENSER
           MICROPHONE, looks at the screen for a signal... the METERS
           bounce with life.  Now BLARING from his computer speakers:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        -- my asshole -- put another finger
                        in my asshole --
           Bennett quickly turns off the speakers, embarrassed.  We
           still hear them going at it through the loud headphones.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Ohhhhh-ho-ho...  That's it -- keep
                        doing THAT.  Oh fuck...  You're
                        dirty, Sandra...

                                 FEMALE P.A. (V.O.)
                        Sandra?...

           Off Bennett, mind racing with possibilities...

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - LATER

           A BURNER PHONE

           Sliding across a scanner.  REVERSE on BENNETT, the customer
           buying it.

           The CLERK gives him some side-eye as he rings it up.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm... going overseas.

           He nervously grabs a CANDY BAR, places it on the counter.

           The Clerk stares at him -- uh huh.  Rings up the candy.

           EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX - NIGHT - LATER

           A dented, lipstick-red 2001 FORD ESCORT (BENNETT's pride and
           joy) sits across from the entrance/exit of the building's
           PARKING GARAGE.

           Bennett sits bored in the driver's seat, staking out his own
           place of work.  His LAPTOP rests on the passenger seat.

           He chews on the candy bar... seems to be regretting his
           choice. 

           His IPHONE RINGS.  Bennett struggles it out of his pocket...
           SCOWLS at the number.  Silences the ringer.  Must be
           Vantek...

           THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD:  The exit gate lifts for a BLACK
           TESLA. 

           Bennett sits up.  Here we go...  He sets aside his candy
           bar, starts his car. 
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

           The Tesla pulls into the driveway of a SMALL BUSINESS in a
           ritzy shopping district, disappearing into a rear parking
           lot.

           BENNETT's Escort isn't far behind.  It pulls into a space
           along the main drag.

           INT. BENNETT'S ESCORT

           Bennett turns off the car.  Clocks the name of the business:

                                SOLSTICE WELLNESS STUDIO

           He takes a deep breath.  Powers on his laptop.

           IN HIS HAND

           CLICK -- the FLASH DRIVE'S USB CONNECTOR slides forward like
           a switchblade.

           INT. SOLSTICE WELLNESS STUDIO - MASSAGE ROOM

           A FACE CRADLE horseshoes around a MAN's ruggedly handsome,
           late-50's face.

           This is, of course, GRANT RICHMOND.  Eyes serenely closed.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Iris, do me a favor and really
                        blast my right hamstring -- think I
                        did something, and Saturday I got
                        that fuckin' fun run for fuckin'
                        retarded kids...

                                 IRIS
                        Certainly, Mr. Richmond.

           Soft MUZAK wafts calmly through the room, which is
           simultaneously spiritual and chic in design -- half Buddhist
           monastery, half Apple store.  Around the room:  various new
           agey items including a CRYSTAL BUDDHA in the corner, a shelf
           lined with BONSAI TREES, and against the wall, a large GONG
           hanging from a wood frame.

           In the middle of it, like a centerpiece, is Grant Richmond's
           EXPOSED ASS.  He's entirely nude, lying prone on the massage
           table.  Iris mills around the room, preparing.
                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Hey can you use that fruity
                        lavender shit or whatever's
                        strongest?...  Goin' home to the
                        wife...

                                 IRIS
                        Might I suggest Ylang-ylang?  It's
                        our boldest essential oil.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Fire away, sweetheart.

           A QUIET KNOCK as Iris squirts the oil into her palms...

                                 IRIS
                        Excuse me one moment.

           We HOLD on Grant's ass as Iris goes to the door.

           ON IRIS:  In the doorframe, whispering with a MANAGER/
           SUPERVISOR.  The manager hands her a CORDLESS PHONE.  Iris
           turns to look at Grant, mild concern showing...

           BACK ON GRANT:  We hear the door shut.

                                 IRIS
                        Mr. Richmond...  There's an urgent
                        call for you.  A man...  He says
                        he's your doctor...?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        ... Huh?  Fuck are you talking
                        about?  Lenny's in St. Bart's...

                                 IRIS
                        He said he's been trying to reach
                        you...?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Give me the phone.  Give me the
                        phone.

           Iris awkwardly places the phone in his hand.  Grant tries to
           bring it to his ear -- not happening with the FACE CRADLE in
           the way.  Grant indignantly turns over, SITS UP.  Pissed. 
           Into the phone:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Who are you?  Pretending to be my
                        fucking doctor??

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Is this Grant Rich--
                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Who the fuck are you?

                        How do you know where I am??

           Iris tiptoes back to the wall, all too familiar with Grant's
           temper...

                        the fuck am I talking to you?

           Bennett hesitates, then hits the SPACE BAR on his laptop. 
           He holds his phone over the speakers.

           Bennett's finger hovers over the space bar, phone back to
           his ear.

                                 BENNETT

           INT. MASSAGE ROOM

           Grant is now STANDING, dick swinging freely as he hisses
           into the phone:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        -- you fucking sniveling SHITWORM --

           Iris timidly tries to hand Grant a bathrobe which he
           aggressively SWATS AWAY.
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)

           Iris, horrified, starts edging towards the door.

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Okay, okay --

           Click.  Bennett hangs up.  Exhales.

           Didn't really go as planned... but probably could've gone
           worse. 

           A beat, then, THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD:

           IRIS RUNS out of Solstice, SHRIEKING, hands in the air...

           ON BENNETT:  What the fuck?...

           INT. MASSAGE ROOM

           The CRYSTAL BUDDHA SMASHES into a thousand pieces as Naked
           Grant flings it into a STONE FOUNTAIN.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        AGHHHHHH!!!!

           He looks around for more stuff to break -- seizes on a
           POTTED BONSAI TREE which he SHOT-PUTS CLEAN THROUGH THE
           DRYWALL into another massage room.  We hear SCREAMS from the
           other rooms.

           He locks eyes on the GONG, sweaty, forehead veins THROBBING
           with rage...  You're fucking next... 
           He starts to LIFT the heavy MASSAGE TABLE:

                        Fuuuckkkking... raaaat.... fuck...

           With Hulk-like strength he grips the table like a BATTERING
           RAM, HURLS it at the GONG --

           INT. BENNETT'S ESCORT

           The APOCALYPTIC NOISE it makes is audible even out here on
           the street.  Bennett jumps, staring out, mouth agape --

           THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD

           Several NAKED CUSTOMERS (frantic, some clutching clothes)
           FLEEING into the cold night, tailed by equally alarmed STAFF
           MEMBERS. 

           Bennett looks on... awestruck...

                            (

                        Fuckin' A...

           He remembers that he's partly responsible for this --
           quickly looks around... then, with a shrug, keys the
           ignition.

           As the ESCORT putters away from the fucking Guernica
           unfolding in front of Solstice...

           EXT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT (DAY 3)

           LIZ and PAOLA -- grimy from changing Liz's tire -- get out
           of the Camry, which is parked close to Bennett's house.  

                                 LIZ
                        I'm getting his fucking insurance
                        I'll tell ya that much.  No way in
                        hell I'm paying for a new fucking
                        tire.

           She slams her door.  Paola gets her SWORD from the backseat. 
           We PULL on them as they walk up to Bennett's house.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                            (

                        Does it matter that he did it with
                        like, a sword we threatened him
                        with?...
                                 PAOLA
                        I dunno.  He might be able to call
                        it self defense. 

                                 LIZ
                        Self defense??  He's -- but -- he's
                        the one who had a gun.  He's the
                        one who's an evil fucking dog
                        thief.

                        Courts are fucked up, Liz.

           They reach Bennett's front door.  Liz hits the DOORBELL.

           A silent beat as they wait...  Nothing.  Liz hits the
           doorbell again, getting impatient.

                                 LIZ
                        C'mon, open up you piece of shit.

           Nothing.  She KNOCKS on the door.  Paola peers into a dark
           window, shrugs.

                                 PAOLA
                        Maybe he's not here.

           A beat.

                                 LIZ
                        Fuck that. 

           INT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dark, no lights on.  We're looking at the BACK PORCH out
           Bennett's back door (where Gordon entered).

           LIZ and PAOLA (illuminated by cell phone light) poke
           tentatively into view as they tiptoe up to the house.  Paola
           leads the way.

           EXT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH

           Paola gets to the door, SLIDES it open a foot.  She turns
           back to Liz, wiggles her eyebrows -- lucky us.  She finishes
           sliding open the door, readies her sword, takes one step
           inside and --
           INT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           CRASH! -- Paola TRIPS OVER SOMETHING just inside the door,
           sword flying out of her hand as she falls face first into
           the living room.

           Liz gasps, rushes in to help her up:

                                 LIZ
                        Paola!  Damn, you okay?

           The dark room becomes weakly illuminated with GLOWING
           RAINBOW COLORS.  Paola tripped over the WAKESTREAM HEDONE,
           and accidentally flipped it ON in the process.

                                 PAOLA

                        What the shit is that thing?

           A gentle chime, then a Siri-esque voice proclaims:

                        Bennett?...  Bennettttt??... 

           Paola's brushing off her knees when -- out of the corner of
           her eye -- BENNETT'S DEAD FACE comes into relief as a purple
           Wakestream light passes over.  She JUMPS:

                                 PAOLA
                        HOLY fuck --

           His body is slumped on its side at the edge of the room.

           Liz sees what she's talking about...  Bennett's looking a
           little worse than the last time we saw him on Day 3...    
           In addition to the gunshot wounds in his chest, he now has a
           Lord of the Rings replica sword JUTTING THREE FEET OUT OF

                        Did he get shot...?

                                 PAOLA
                        This is fucking baaaaad...

                                 LIZ
                        The guy who took the huskies... 
                        And stabbed my fucking tire.  He
                        did this.

                                 PAOLA
                        We need to leave.  Right the fuck
                        now.

                                 LIZ
                        What about the cops?  We have to
                        call the cops right?
           A beat as Paola turns, looks at Bennett... the whole
           situation...

                                 PAOLA
                        ... No cops.

                        Okay...  Okay...  Agreed.  But what
                        about the sword?...  We can't just
                        leave it.  It's like, evidence or
                        something...

                                 PAOLA
                        It's in his fucking ass, Liz. 
                        Deep.

                                 LIZ
                        So we have to pull it out.
                            (
                             off Paola

                        We pull it out or we go to jail.

           A tense beat as Paola comes to terms with this.  She nods
           solemnly, then:

                                 PAOLA
                        So... how should...  How do you
                        wanna...

           They position themselves closer around the body, sour
           expressions.

                                 LIZ
                        I guess... if I like, hold him
                        down... and you, uh, grab the
                        handle --

                                 PAOLA
                        Uh-uh.  Hell no.  How come I gotta
                        be the puller?

                        you pull it, I'll clean it...

                        ever happened.

           A beat.

                                 PAOLA
                        Ugh... motherfucker.  MotherFUCKER. 
                        Let's get it over with.

                                 LIZ
                        Alright, so... count of three...

           Liz PUSHES DOWN on Bennett's torso... 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        One...

           Paola makes a face as she GRIPS the sword handle, looking
           away...

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Two...

           Liz swallows, closes her eyes...

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        THREE --

           With a sickening, wet SSCHHHK the sword SLIDES FREE --

                            (
                                 LIZ/PAOLA
                             grossed-out moaning
                                               )

           Liz jumps back as Paola holds the sword out awkwardly, not
           wanting the blood-and-god-knows-what-else-covered blade to
           touch anything.

           A beat.

                                 PAOLA
                        I do not feel good.

                                 LIZ
                        It had to be done...  You did
                        great...  Now let's get the
                        fuuuuuck outta here.

           Paola nods, pale from this nightmare.

                                 PAOLA
                        Let's.
           We HOLD on Bennett's DEFILED CORPSE as Liz and Paola hustle
           out the back door.  The overhead light FLICKS OFF, letting
           the rainbow colors of the Wakestream take over the room
           again.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           SCANNING across the counter in quick succession:

           - FROZEN LASAGNA (a la Lean Cuisine)
           - A BOTTLE OF WATER
           - A SHARPIE
           - MASKING TAPE
           - PACKING TWINE
           - A BOTTLE OF LIQUID LAXATIVES

           Reverse on GORDON, the customer buying these items.  The
           SAME CLERK from before (different clothes) gives him a look
           as he scans the laxatives.

                                 GORDON
                        And uh... pack of Winstons?...

           The Clerk grabs the cigarettes.

           EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

           CLOSE ON the number 4 being written on a strip of masking
           tape... which is STUCK to a husky's furry side.

           WIDER and Gordon's sitting on a PARK BENCH, one hand holding
           a makeshift FOUR-WAY TWINE LEASH attached crudely around
           each dog's torso, other hand finishing off the last
           "nametag" (dogs 1-3 are already labeled).

           Gordon's shopping bag lies next to him on the bench.  He
           puts the sharpie back in the bag. 

           He looks around.  A few late night strollers, but the park's
           pretty empty.  He CHECKS HIS WATCH:  11:22.  Better get
           movin'.

           He TIES his end of the leash around a bench post, anchoring
           the puppies and freeing up his hands.

           He pulls the LASAGNA out of the bag, takes it out of the
           box, rips off the plastic seal...
           He leans over the side of the bench, turns the lasagna
           upside down, and with his thumbs, PUSHES the frozen food
           block out of the black microwavable TUB.  It thuds softly
           into the grass.

           He uses his jacket sleeve to wipe away some of the residue
           still inside the tub.

           He sets it down next to him, then grabs the WATER BOTTLE. 
           He cracks it, pours some into the tub.

           Then, LAXATIVE time.  He unscrews the bottle and pours a
           generous amount in with the water.  He lifts the tub,
           swishing it around a little.

                                 GORDON
                        Okay guys... showtime...

           He lowers the tub to the ground.  The thirsty huskies fall
           upon it excitedly.

           He lights a cigarette.  Sits back, closes his eyes...

           A calm beat... then:

           BARK-BARK-BARK!! -- Gordon's eyes JOLT open, he looks down:

           A FANCY SHIHTZU on a leash is trying to nudge its way into
           the water circle, but the HUSKIES aren't having it.  They
           snap at the shihtzu, barking uncontrollably.

           Gordon remembers the laxatives -- gently shoos the dog away.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Oliver!
                            (
                             whistling
                                     )

           Attached to the other end of the shihtzu is a WASPY,
           ATTRACTIVE COUPLE (30's), girl and guy.  The guy is quite
           large.

                                 WASPY GUY
                        I think he wants some water.

                            (
                             to Gordon
                                 WASPY GIRL
                                     )
                        Hi!  Excuse me, hi -- would you
                        mind letting Oliver have some of
                        your water?
                            (
                             to Oliver
                                     )
                        Someone's a bit thirsty from all
                        the hiking today, yes he is...

           A beat.  Gordon shakes his head.
                                 GORDON
                        Sorry, lady.

           A longer beat.  The couple looks at him, confused... 

                                 WASPY GUY
                        You serious man? 

           Gordon shrugs.

                                 WASPY GIRL
                        Brady, it's okay --

                                 BRADY
                        No, hold on --
                             to Gordon
                            (
                                     )
                        What's your problem, guy??  You got
                        plenty of water there.  Our dog
                        can't take one sip?... 

           Gordon doesn't answer.  A tense beat...  Brady steps closer.

                                 WASPY GIRL
                        Brady it's not worth it --

                                 BRADY
                        Gimme a minute Darcy --
                            (
                             to Gordon, angry
                                            )
                        Why're you being such a fucking
                        dick??  Huh?  Well??  Answer me.

           A beat...  Gordon stands.  He's had enough of these people. 
           Enough of this whole fucking night.  He gets in his face:

                                 GORDON
                        Cause, Brady, it's fun saying no to
                        people like you.  It's really
                        goddamn fun.

                                 DARCY
                        You are an awful man.

                                 GORDON
                        You seem to be a connoisseur.
                            (
                             stamping out his
                             cigarette, looking down)
                        Where'dja find this one?  He can
                        talk and everything.  Must've been
                        love at first sight.

           GORDON'S POV:  as we look up -- BAM! -- Brady's FIST hits us
           like a fucking FREIGHT TRAIN as Darcy SHRIEKS --
                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           A beat...

           FADE UP SLOWLY ON:

           A BEDSIDE ALARM CLOCK

           5:21 AM.  HUGE, GREEN digits designed for elderly eyes...

           INT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           BENNETT lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. 
           Hasn't slept a wink.  He rolls over, picks up the BURNER
           PHONE off the bedside table...

           No missed calls.  Goddammit.  He puts the phone back, lays
           back down.... sighs...

           MUSIC CUE:  "I Got a Feeling" by Ricky Nelson -- a sunny,
           bouncy rockabilly tune your parents probably drank
           milkshakes to.

           Bennett rubs his eyes, grabs the phone and crawls out of
           bed, stiff from back pain.

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        Well I've got a feeling / That I'm
                        gonna get you...

           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           THE BURNER PHONE

           ... resting on the kitchen countertop.  SHIFT FOCUS to
           BENNETT in b.g., staring at it while he distractedly fills
           an 80's Mr. Coffee.  Come on...  Ring...

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        Say I've got a little feeling /
                        That it won't be long...

           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           LOOSE DOG FOOD avalanches over FOUR PLASTIC BOWLS, spilling
           all over the place.  Bennett doesn't care -- as soon as the
           bowls are filled he hurries back over to the BURNER PHONE... 
           Checks it...  Frowns.
                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        'Til I hold you in my arms and,
                        baby / That's where you belong...

           INT. BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Bennett takes a shit -- one hand clutching the BURNER PHONE,
           other raising a COFFEE MUG with a baby picture of him on it. 

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        Well I've got a feeling / That you
                        think about me...

           He takes a sip, stares icily at the CLOSED DOOR, which
           jostles as the BARKING HUSKIES launch their bodies against
           the other side.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           THE BURNER PHONE

           ... lying on the carpet.  Behind it:  Bennett SLIDES
           SIDEWAYS INTO VIEW on a FOAM ROLLER, rocking in and out of
           frame, puppies in b.g. 

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        Well I've got a little feeling /
                        And I hope it's true...

           His eyes never leave the phone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Bennett, shirtless on the couch, sticks small ELECTRODES on
           his shoulders.  Their wires connect to a cheap, Chinese TENS
           MASSAGER -- a white plastic remote with a couple buttons and
           dials.

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        'Cause nobody else could want you
                        so / And love you like I do...

           Bennett punches a button that reads "UPER BODY" (typo
           included).  Turns the voltage dial all the way up.  His arms
           start to involuntarily TWITCH IN UNISON every two seconds. 
           He cranes his head down to the BURNER PHONE in his lap, arms
           still jerking up and down robotically... 

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Well I got a feeling / That our
                        love was meant to be...
           INT. BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           IN THE SHOWER

           CLOSE ON A SOAP TRAY where steaming hot water pounds against
           the BURNER PHONE, which is sealed in a plastic sandwich bag.

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        And there's a whole wild world of
                        happiness / Just waitin' for you
                        and me...

           Bennett scrubs himself down, staring at the phone,
           concerned...

           INT. BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Bennett, FULLY DRESSED, appraises himself sheepishly in the
           mirror.  He bends over for one last BACK STRETCH...  POP --
           a BUTTON flies off his shirt.  He notices -- fuck -- gets
           down on the carpet to retrieve it...

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        So why don't you tell me / That you
                        love me only...

           INT. BEDROOM CLOSET

           The closet door opens, revealing Bennett.  He rummages
           through some high shelves... finds a SEWING KIT.  He starts
           to open it -- PAUSES --

           Something deeper in the closet's caught his eye...     
           A SHOE BOX on the floor, peeking out between blankets
           and scarves...

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.)
                        'Cause I got a feeling / That you
                        really do...

           Bennett picks up the shoe box -- "WAYNE" is scrawled on it
           in sharpie.  He puts it on the bed and removes the lid.

           INSIDE THE SHOE BOX:  Bennett eagerly shoves aside layers of
           war medals and old photographs to get to the REVOLVER
           underneath...  It hasn't worked in 30 years, but Bennett's
           wide-eyed expression suggests he doesn't know that.

                                 RICKY NELSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And I never had this feeling / 'Til
                        I fell in lo--
           RING-RING!! -- Ricky Nelson is cut off by Bennett's PHONE. 
           He SHOOTS UP, surprised by the noise -- RING-RING!!  He
           frantically digs his IPHONE out of his pocket --
           fuckwrongphone -- flings it aside, digs deeper, pulls out
           the BURNER PHONE.

           He looks at the number...  It's him.  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
           RING-RI-- 

           Bennett answers... attempts to sound calm:

                                 BENNETT
                        Good... good morning.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LOWER LEVEL

           A KCBB NEWS VAN sits in the shadowy corner by the dumpsters
           and HVAC unit.  Not exactly a penthouse.

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)

                        how much do you want?!

           The van wobbles with Grant's anger.

           INT. BENNETT'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Bennett is holding his Grandpa's REVOLVER...  Feeling its
           heft...  As he strokes the barrel with his index finger:

                        ... Hello?

           INT. NEWS VAN

           Grant stares into space, placid, probably counting to 5. 
           Perfectly still except for the twitching of a single jaw
           muscle...  Eventually he swallows:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND

           Bennett's caught a little off guard.  He thinks for a

                        Right now I'm 117th in East Valley
                        rankings -- which is super good --
                        but I gotta break a hundred before
                        they let me advance.  MLR...

           He's talking (loudly so he can be heard over 40 barking
           dogs) to a LATE-60s MAN, here to adopt the pit bull.

                                 ISAAC (CONT'D)
                        Master Lineman's Rodeo.  Huge deal. 
                        They only hold it every couple
                        years.  Transformer replacements... 
                        Hurt-Worker Rescue Challenge...
           The man nods absentmindedly, feigning interest as they walk
           down the cage-lined corridor.  He's much more concerned
           about the pit bull.

                                 ISAAC (CONT'D)

                             to the dog
                                      )
                        That's it Shania, good girl...
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Keep my spurs and belt in the
                        trunk at all times.  Lotta good
                        practice poles around town.
                        Sometimes people see me up there
                        and wanna know if I'm a real
                        lineman, employed by the state.   
                        Legally I have to tell them no. 
                        But I guess my form's that good,
                        huh?

           The man gives a weak smile -- sure -- bends down to pet
           Shania.  Isaac tightens his grip.

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - RECEPTION AREA

           LIZ and PAOLA are manning the FRONT DESK.  A few other
           EMPLOYEES/PROSPECTIVE ADOPTERS circulate around the large,
           open reception area with various pets-to-be.

           ISAAC, the MAN, and SHANIA enter through DOUBLE DOORS, make
           their way to the front desk.  Liz brightens:

                                 LIZ
                        Shania!!  Are you getting adopted??

           She comes around the desk, takes the leash from Isaac and
           bends down to pet her. 

                            (
                                 MAN
                             laughing
                                    )
                        Yes ma'am, she is...

                                 PAOLA
                        'Bout time.

           Isaac leaves them with Liz and Paola, heads back the way he
           came in.

                                 LIZ
                            (
                             to the man
                                      )
                        So we'll need you to fill out
                        theeese...

           Paola passes a stack of paperwork over to Liz, who hands it
           to the man along with a pen.
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Microchip form -- so she's
                        registered in your name -- and then
                        some legal stuff, just your
                        initials, then signature down
                        there...  Basically you're just
                        promising to take good care of her. 
                        Walks, feeding, regular vet visits.

           The man nods along ("Uh-huh, uh-huh") as he scans the
           paperwork.

                                 PAOLA

                                          )
                        I'm SO glad you two found each
                        other, she is the SWEETEST. 
                        Shania's been here two years ya
                        know...  Unfortunately, older
                        dogs...

                                 PAOLA
                        And being a pit bull...

                                 LIZ
                        Not everyone's favorite combo.

           The man smiles.

                        I grew up around pitties.  Think I
                        can handle her.
                            (
                             smile fading

                        Though I will say I'm a little
                        nervous about her age...  I just... 
                        I wanna get as much time with her
                        as I can.

                                 LIZ
                        That's only natural...

                        Actually, I lost one of my dogs
                        recently...  An older dog.  Little
                        over a month ago...

                                 LIZ
                        She came in two weeks pregnant.  I
                        took her home 'cause we didn't have
                        any vacancies at the time...  Of
                        course, I immediately fell in love
                        with her. 

           Paola nods, somber.

                                 PAOLA
                        A great, great dog.  GORGEOUS
                        husky.

                                 LIZ
                        She...  She had a difficult birth. 
                        Didn't make it...

                        Every day was special.  I only had
                        a couple months with her, but she
                        was worth it.  Worth everything.

                        And you're gonna have SO much more
                        time with Shania.

                        I'm very sorry for your loss. 
                        Sounds like she was lucky to have
                        you.

           OVER BY THE ENTRANCE:  The main doors nudge open, awkwardly
           parting to reveal BENNETT carrying a CARDBOARD BANKERS BOX. 
           Nobody notices him as he makes his way inside.

                                 LIZ
                        That's for sure.  I spoiled the
                        shit outta that dog. 

           The man chuckles, then, gesturing to the paperwork:

                                 MAN
                        Well I should get going on all
                        this, uh...  Is there anywhere --

                        Oh -- you two can take a seat
                        anywhere against the wall.  Just
                        come back up when you're done.

                             trying it out
                        Come on, Shania...
           They saunter away from the front desk.  BENNETT, with his
           box, takes their place...

           An uncomfortable beat as he smiles at Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        Hi there.  Can I help you?

           Bennett sets the box on the desk, leans forward with his
           hand extended.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm Bennett.  I was curious if... 
                        I...  I've seen you around.  I work
                        across the street.  Used to,
                        actually.  Just quit... 

           Liz and Paola share a concerned look.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        But I decided, ya know, why not
                        just walk in and... and uh...  Do
                        you think -- whenever you're free,
                        maybe --

                                 PAOLA
                        I'm sorry -- can she help you with
                        anything pet-related?

           Bennett looks sourly at Paola before turning back to Liz:

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah... she can, actually.  I've
                        got some puppies at home --
                        adorable little huskies.  Adopted
                        here, from this shelter.  I've been
                        looking after them since my
                        Grandm--

                        huskies, couldn't bear to separate
                        'em!  How is she??

                        well... not really.  Last week she
                        started feeling weird, getting
                        dizzy and stuff.  She just moved
                        into a home, actually...

                                 LIZ
                        Wow...  I'm sorry, that's so sad...

                                 BENNETT
                        Mm.  It's for the best.

                                 LIZ
                        Guess it could've been worse
                        though, yeah?...

                             then

                        But -- so you're taking care of the
                        huskies now?

                                 BENNETT
                        I am, yeah.

           Liz looks him in the eyes:

                                 LIZ
                        You're not gonna believe this --
                        those are my dog's puppies. 

           A beat.  This is news to Bennett.

                                 BENNETT
                        What?  No way...

                        Your Grandma snatched them up as

                        You have GOT to let me come over
                        and see them!  Please! 

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah um...  Yeah!  Sure, of course. 
                        I mean, what a crazy coincidence
                        right?

                                 LIZ
                        I know!!  Are you free tonight? 

           Paola, who's been hovering off to the side in silent
           judgment, peers over Bennett's BANKERS BOX as the two of
           them talk --

                                 BENNETT
                        Absolutely, yeah, come over and say
                        hi to them!  I bet they'd love to
                        see you.

           -- INSIDE BENNETT'S BOX:  nothing but the 3D PIN ART BOX and
           a particularly vibrator-y looking MASSAGE WAND.

           Paola looks back at Bennett, weirded out.  He's now jotting
           down on some paper:

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        This is where I'm staying -- it's
                        actually my Grandma's house... 
                        When do you, uh, wrap up here?

                                 LIZ
                        I get off at 9, 9:30, so I could
                        probably get there around 10...? 
                        If that's not too late?...

                                 BENNETT
                            (
                             handing her the address
                                                   )
                        Perfect!  Not too late at all. 

           Off Liz... beaming:

           EXT. STREET - SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

                                 BENNETT
                        FUCK!

           Bennett stops in his tracks, realizing what he's done.  

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Idiot idiot idiot... fucking
                        MORON...
           He sets down the bankers box, looks around... goes searching
           for the BURNER PHONE in his pocket, cursing the whole
           time...

           INT. KCBB - GRANT RICHMOND'S OFFICE - DAY - SAME

           GRANT is scribbling on a POST-IT with his phone wedged
           between his ear and shoulder.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        No shit... perfect...  You're a
                        goddamn saint, Flanagan...

           CLOSE ON THE POST-IT:  DAD (JAVIER) -- ARBYS

           "ARBYS" is underlined three times.  As he puts his phone
           away -- a KNOCK on the door --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (
                             covering the post-it
                                                )
                        Yes!  Come in!

           A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER enters followed by GINA, Grant's
           jaded, 20something assistant.

                                 GINA
                        Grant, this, uh...

                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        Sorry -- hope I'm not
                        interrupting -- I'm Officer
                        Palacios.  I believe you were told
                        someone would be stopping by to
                        follow up on last night's incident.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                            (
                             all smiles
                                      )
                        Yes, yes -- I spoke with Sgt.
                        Roman, he warned me.  I'm happy to
                        continue the conversation.  Please,
                        have a seat.
                             ahem
                                 )
                            (
                        Gina?...

           She gets the message, leaves and closes the door.  Grant and
           the officer take seats on opposite sides of his Pottery Barn
           desk.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Palacios...  Palacios...  Where
                        have I heard that name?...
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (
                             before he can answer
                                                )
                        Hold on -- you're not related to
                        Javier Palacios are you?

           The officer smiles, nods:

                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        He's my dad.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Get outta town!  So you went and
                        followed in his footsteps... 
                        Family business... amazing.  You
                        know, when your father stopped that
                        Arby's robbery in '96, I was on the
                        scene. 

                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        No kidding. 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        I covered the story.

                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        He's still telling that story,
                        believe it or not.  Every chance he
                        gets.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Truly an incredible exhibition of
                        bravery and grace under pressure. 
                        You and your family must be so
                        proud.

           Grant's really buttering him up.  Officer Palacios smiles.

                            (
                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        Thank you, we are, we are.  I can't
                        believe you remember that, wow...
                             shifting gears, reaching
                             for a notepad)
                        So... Solstice isn't pressing
                        charges -- they said you'd come to
                        some type of agreement.  The county
                        might still hit you for disturbing
                        the peace.  Probably just a fine,
                        maybe some counseling.

           Grant's newsanchor façade strains to contain his rage:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Mhm.  Of course.  Of course.
                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        I did have one followup question --
                        based on some information gathered
                        after your statement was taken. 
                        Your masseuse... a Miss...
                             checking notepad
                            (
                                            )
                        Iris Bozajian.  She mentioned that
                        you -- during your, uh, tirade --
                        you screamed the word "blackmail?" 
                        Is that correct?...

           A beat.  Grant plays it cool.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Blackmail?...
                            (
                             laughs
                                  )
                        Absolutely not.  No.  I'm afraid
                        that's wrong...  Absurd.  She
                        misheard me.  You should have it
                        there in the report -- the call was
                        just some kid messing around... 
                        You see, as a public figure, I'm
                        subject to a little harassment from
                        time to time.  It's the cross I
                        bear...  Unfortunately, sometimes I
                        just, uh...
                            (
                             trailing off
                                        )
                        ... lose my, uh...

           GRANT'S POV:  GINA is gesturing through the window looking
           into his office, holding a PHONE, pointing to it
           energetically.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry, officer, could I --
                        could you excuse me a minute?...

                                 OFFICER PALACIOS
                        Oh uh -- sure.  No problem.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        I'll be quick.

           Grant gets up, strides casually out of his office...

           INT. KCBB - RECEPTION ROOM

           ... closes the door and approaches Gina -- what the fuck??

                            (
                             worried
                                 GINA
                                   )
                        Sorry, it's just -- your doctor's
                        on the line.  It's urgent.
           A beat as Grant clenches his whole body to stop from
           screaming. 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Why is everyone so fucking stupid??

           He looks toward the main office door, starts gunning for
           it --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (
                             over his shoulder
                                             )
                        Say I'll call him right back -- DO
                        NOT say anything to the cop about
                        the call --

                                 GINA
                        Wait -- you're leaving??

           INT. KCBB - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant passes a smattering of KCBB employees as he FULL-ON
           SPRINTS down the hall...

           INT. CONCRETE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant runs down the steps so fast it almost qualifies as
           PARKOUR...

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LOWER LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant BURSTS through steel double doors (painted YELLOW),
           runs past a row of parked cars until he arrives at:

           THE DUMPSTERS AND HVAC.  Next to them...

           ... Empty space.  No news van.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Fucking SHIT!  SHIT!

           Might as well be a sign that says "Gone Newsin'."  Grant
           looks around frantically, trying to catch his breath,
           furious...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Jesus... CUNT-FUCKING Christ...
           INT. PARKING GARAGE - GROUND LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant BURSTS through steel double doors (painted PURPLE),
           making a break for his TESLA...

           He gets his PHONE and a WADDED UP PIECE OF PAPER out of his
           pocket, opens his car door and gets in.

           INT. GRANT'S TESLA

           Grant squints as he dials the number off the piece of paper,
           trying to move fast.  He puts the phone to his ear...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Pick up you fucking ASSHOLE --

           He SLAMS the steering wheel.

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        What the FUCK do you want??!

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY - SAME

           Bennett's moved to an alley off the main street.

                                 BENNETT
                        Okay so -- don't get mad -- but is
                        there any chance we can
                        reschedule?...  Maybe tomorrow
                        night?...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Was there a fucking gas leak at the
                        circle jerk??  Fuck no. 

           INT. GRANT'S TESLA

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        I want you, and this whole goddamn
                        mess OUT of my life TONIGHT.  We
                        had a deal.  If you're not at
                        Saddle Ranch, the deal's fucking
                        off.

           A tense beat.

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)
                        Okay, okay...
           EXT. ALLEYWAY

           Bennett bites his lip... winces...  It's the only option.

                                 BENNETT
                        I can do it tonight, I just... I
                        have to change locations.  There's
                        a house...  If you uh, need a
                        second to find a pen or --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        Give me the fucking address.

           Bennett takes a deep breath, then, already somewhat
           regretting this:

                                 BENNETT
                        1819 Avenue 30...  Got it?...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (V.O.)
                        1819 Avenue 30.  10 o'clock.  Are
                        we fucking done here??

                                 BENNETT
                        I might be, uh... with someone... 
                        But just ring the doorbell and I'll
                        come meet you outside.

           INT. GRANT'S TESLA

           Grant rolls his eyes -- none of this matters considering
           what he has in store for him.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Ooookay.

                                 BENNETT (V.O.)
                        I'll see you tonight then?...

           Grant HANGS UP.  Guess that's a yes.  He SPRINGS out of the
           car, SLAMMING the door behind him.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY

           Bennett, alone in the alley, lowers his phone...  All quiet
           except for some cars humming along the main street...

           He looks nervous.  This whole thing's starting to spiral
           away from him...
           He bends down to pick up his BANKERS BOX...  STOPS.  He
           looks inside.  Grimaces at the items...  What a bleak
           fucking existence.

           Without much fanfare, he picks up the box and HEAVES IT INTO
           A DUMPSTER.  He wipes his hands, turns to go.

           Off Bennett, walking out of the alley, having just thrown
           his life away...

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:  BRAKES CREAKING as a car slows...

           FADE UP ON:

           EXT. PAOLA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - LATER

           LIZ'S CAMRY pulls to a stop out front.

                                 PAOLA (V.O.)
                        Wait why are we...?

           INT. LIZ'S CAMRY

           The sword -- blade now wrapped in Liz's West Adams apron --
           sits on the backseat floorboard.

                                 PAOLA (CONT'D)
                        ... Want me to run up and grab
                        something?

           A beat.  Liz stirs uncomfortably.  CHUNK -- unlocks the
           doors.

                                 LIZ
                        I'm dropping you off.

           Paola tries to interject, but --

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I shouldn't have dragged you into
                        this...  I'm so sorry.  Everything
                        got so fucked up...  I mean
                        Bennett's fucking dead.  And we
                        just pulled a fucking SWORD out of
                        his BUTT. 

           Paola nods, trying not to think about it.
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You're an amazing friend for
                        helping me... really... I'm sorry
                        for all this.  I'll take your sword
                        back and clean it with like,
                        peroxide or something.  You've done
                        enough tonight.

           A beat...  CHUNK -- Paola re-locks her door.

                                 PAOLA
                        Not a lot of people would take home
                        a sick, pregnant dog, Liz.  That's
                        a lot of responsibility to take on,
                        even for straight up professional
                        animal-lovers like you and me. 
                        Those little huskies are alive
                        'cause of you, and what you did for
                        their mama. 
                            (
                             then, steely
                                        )
                        ... I don't know what that
                        murderous old asshole's game is,
                        but I am not throwing in the towel
                        yet.  We owe it to Gloria.

                                 LIZ
                        Thanks... but Paola, we're out of
                        moves.  That murderous old asshole
                        and the pups are gone...  We lost.

           Paola plops Bennett's BURNER PHONE between them on the
           dashboard.  Liz's eyes widen, realizing what it is.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit, Paola. 

                                 PAOLA
                        I stole a dead guy's phone.  It's
                        dead, too, unfortunately.

           Liz picks it up.

                                 LIZ
                        You are my fucking hero.

           A beat.  Paola sighs...

                                 PAOLA
                        We couldn't save Gloria, but maybe
                        we can still save her kids.
           EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT

           The HUSKY PUPPIES take turns pawing at GORDON's darkly-
           bruised, unconscious face. 

           He's laid out on the ground, dogs still tethered to the park
           bench. 

           Gordon's eyes CRACK OPEN...  He tries to touch his face --
           brushes aside some dogs first -- FUCK that hurts...

           He elbows himself halfway up... groans... leans his back
           against the bench seat.  Exhales deeply and cradles his
           forehead.

           He notices the LASAGNA TUB is OVERTURNED, which makes him
           remember --

           On his knees, he crawls around in front of the bench, hoping
           for some DOG SHIT --

                                 GORDON
                        Come on, come on...  None of you??

           He stands up... CHECKS HIS WATCH:  11:39.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Shit...  Goddammit.  Shit.

           He looks down at the eager, innocent puppies...  A beat... 
           His voice breaks slightly:

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry, guys.

           INT. GORDON'S SAAB - SHORT TIME LATER

           Gordon sinks into the driver's seat holding the FROZEN
           LASAGNA BLOCK to his forehead.  He tosses the lasagna
           outside, shuts the door.  The dogs are in the backseat,
           returned to the WAKESTREAM BOX (one or two are trying to
           climb free).

           Gordon turns on the battery, jabs the stereo.  AMÁLIA
           RODRIGUES comes to life through the speakers.  Soulful. 
           Melancholy.  You could cut the saudade with a knife.

           He cracks the window an inch, fishes out a CIGARETTE... is
           about to light it --

           AROOOOOO!! -- Gordon turns -- what the fuck?
           One of the huskies -- #3 -- is HOWLING along with Amália. 
           Singing, even...  Gordon can't believe what he's seeing...

           AROO-ROO-OOOOOO!!  TWO MORE DOGS join in.  The essential
           sadness of the Portuguese condition's really gotten 'em
           going.  (Huskies and some other breeds are known to "sing"
           around music.)

           ON GORDON:  Laughing for once.

           He puts down his cigarette, reaches in the backseat to pet a
           couple of the crooning huskies...

           After a beat, he pulls back, faces the road...  Laughter
           replaced with cold resolve...

           He retrieves his SILENCED GUN from the glove compartment,
           stuffs it in his jacket.  A beat...

                                 GORDON
                        Okay.

           He fully keys the ignition, causing a MOMENTARY PAUSE in the
           fado...  When it RESUMES, you better believe the puppies do,
           too.

           Off Gordon's Saab, pulling out onto the street as the DOG
           CHORUS SWELLS...

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Our favorite CLERK, glaring at us...  Reverse to find LIZ
           and PAOLA on the other side of the counter. 

           In front of them:  a NEW BURNER PHONE (exact model as
           Bennett's), a STACK OF GARISH BEACH TOWELS, and TWO LARGE
           TUBS OF VASELINE. 

           Paola adds TWO MORE Vaseline tubs... stares the Clerk down
           for a beat.

                                 LIZ
                            (
                             holding up the phone
                                                )
                        We just want the charger -- do we
                        really gotta buy the whole phone??

           INT. WEST TEMPLE ANIMAL SHELTER - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

           THE NEW BURNER PHONE, still in its plastic clamshell
           packaging... oh well.  PAOLA, alone at the front desk
           (everyone gone, most of the lights off), struggles to get it
           open.
                                 PAOLA
                            (
                             calling to a room behind
                             her)
                        Hey lemme know when you're gonna
                        lube it up!  I wanna supervise.

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - UTILITY ROOM - SAME

           LIZ -- smock, safety goggles, N95 mask, latex gloves, and
           rubber boots -- stands hesitantly before a LARGE INDUSTRIAL
           SINK normally used for animal baths.

                                 LIZ
                            (
                             preoccupied
                                       )
                        Sure Paola...

           THE SWORD is lying at the bottom of the sink, taking up its
           entire length.  This is our first real glimpse since
           Bennett's steel colonoscopy...

           And it is fucked.  A foot of the blade is covered in PURE
           HORROR...  A seven layer dip made entirely out of things
           that would make you throw up.  Viscera and feces hardened
           into a crusty base...  Blood and bile mixed into a
           nightmarish, chunky mole sauce...

           Because of the mask, all we see are Liz's FEAR-STRICKEN
           EYES.  She's used to cleaning up shit, but this is a WHOLE
           NEW LEVEL of fucked up and gross.

           She turns on the faucet, starts running hot water over the
           blade.  She picks up a BEACH TOWEL, then uncaps a huge jug
           of HYDROGEN PEROXIDE...

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - FRONT DESK

           Paola plugs BENNETT'S BURNER PHONE into the new charger --
           the phone's CHARGING LIGHTS illuminate.

           INT. UTILITY ROOM

           Liz is sloughing off the larger surface clumps with a
           peroxide towel, averting her eyes, desperately trying to
           distract herself.

                                 LIZ
                        ... Baton Rouge, Louisiana...
                        Bismarck, North Dakota... Boise,
                        Idaho...
           INT. RECEPTION AREA - FRONT DESK

           Bennett's burner phone POWERS ON --

                                 PAOLA
                        Heeeeell yes.

           Paola picks it up, waits for it to finish, then...

           CLOSE ON THE SCREEN:  She navigates to "CALL HISTORY." 
           Three phone calls, three different numbers.

                            (
                                               )

                             calling back to Liz
                        Think we're in business!

           She moves to the DESK PHONE, dials a number reading off
           Bennett's phone.  RING... RING...

                            (

           She hangs up.

                        Grant Richmond... 

           She grabs her CELL PHONE to look him up...

                        Grant Richmond...

           A beat... then she slowly looks up from her phone...  Looks
           out the WINDOW at the OFFICE COMPLEX across the street (KCBB
           sign in view)...

                                 PAOLA (CONT'D)
                            (

                        Liz...
           THROUGH THE WINDOW:  Out on the street, GORDON'S SAAB rolls
           by, turns into the complex's PARKING LOT ENTRANCE.

                                 PAOLA (CONT'D)
                        LIZ...

           Off Paola, gaping out the window:

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

           SAAB HEADLIGHTS

           ... flooding the concrete ramp as the car slowly descends. 
           We follow the Saab around the lower level (only a couple
           scattered cars, pretty much deserted) until it arrives at
           the KCBB NEWS VAN, now back in its spot.   

           Gordon pulls in next to the news van...  He turns off the
           Saab, gets out.  Locks the doors.  He leans against the car,
           looks around...  No sign of Grant...

           ... until the van door SLIDES OPEN, startling Gordon --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                             stepping out of the van
                                                   )
                        Did you call me??

                                 GORDON
                        What?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        From some random 323 number -- did
                        you just call me??

           Gordon shakes his head -- nope.  Grant closes the van door,
           looks around... Huh... 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        The fuck happened to your face?... 
                        Nevermind -- just tell me you have
                        it.  Please tell me you have it.

           Gordon stares at him a beat...  Before he can soften the
           blow --

           BARK-BARK! -- muffled from the backseat.  Gordon winces.
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (
                             hissing
                                   )
                        Oh FUCK YOU, Gordon.

           Grant LUNGES for the Saab door but Gordon's a BRICK WALL --
           he gets control of Grant, BACKS HIM UP against the news van. 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                             struggling
                                      )
                            (
                        Fuck you!!

                                 GORDON
                        Grant -- just stop --

           Gordon produces his SILENCED GUN -- puts it to GRANT'S HEAD. 
           Grant stops squirming:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Yeah fucking right.  You wouldn't.

                                 GORDON
                        Listen to me one goddamn second,
                        will ya?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        What's there to fucking say??  Give
                        me the fucking dogs.

                                 GORDON
                        They drank some laxatives.  About
                        40 minutes ago. 

           Grant scoffs.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Just wait with me...

           A couple huskies bark EXTRA LOUD.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        ... shouldn't be long.

           A beat...  Grant considers... nods.  Fine.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        At least drop the fucking gun?

           Gordon swallows... 

           ... tucks the gun back in his jacket.  A beat as Grant
           straightens himself out.  Gordon sighs, leans against the
           Saab.
                                 GORDON
                        What's gonna happen with the girl?

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Fired her this afternoon.

           Gordon shakes his head in disgust.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 GORDON
                        Didn't say anything.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        I did her a fucking favor, getting
                        her away from all this bullshit.

                                 GORDON
                        How noble.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        And you're the Dalai Lama all of a
                        sudden?  Mr. fucking discount
                        hitman??  Taking my money and
                        fucking up the whole fucking job??

           Gordon's gaze intensifies.

                                 GORDON
                        You made the mess, Grant.  You
                        asked for my help.  I'm not the one
                        cheating on his wife with a goddamn
                        infant.

           Grant CHARGES AT GORDON, PULLING THEM BOTH down to the
           ground.  TWO SCRAPPING OLDER MEN, grunting and rolling
           around in all their awkward glory.

                      GORDON
                                                    GRANT RICHMOND
           Christ --
                                            ...fuck... AGHH -- my leg --
                 (
                  gasping
                         )

           They look like they're finishing up a long, angry game of
           Twister...  Grant, painfully contorted on the cement,
           wheezes out:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Fuck the deal...  Keep the money... 
                        But if you EVER talk to Mikey... 
                        I'm telling him what you do.

           ON GORDON:  Shaken by those words -- how could you?
                                 GORDON
                        The kid... deserves... to know his
                        uncle...

           Mmmhmm... 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                            (
                             in a headlock
                                         )
                        I could not... disagree... more...

           Gordon and Grant are BROTHERS.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                            (
                             shouting
                                    )
                        Hey!

           They STOP FIGHTING -- still entangled on the ground, they
           CRANE THEIR HEADS in the direction of the voice, REVEALING,
           over by the yellow-painted stairwell doors...

           LIZ.  (Sans sword-cleaning gear.)  They stare at her, mouths
           open, frozen --

                                 LIZ
                        I know what you did to Bennett! 
                        You're a fucking MURDERER!

           ... A long, silent beat.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        What's up??  Got nothin' to say?

           ON GORDON AND GRANT:  A split second as their eyes meet --
           then Grant PLUNGES HIS HAND into Gordon's JACKET, going for
           his GUN.  Gordon grabs Grant's arm -- PFT! -- the gun GOES
           OFF inside his jacket as Grant YANKS IT OUT.

           Liz JUMPS -- oh my god -- RUNS BACK through the yellow
           doors.

           Grant, holding the gun, staggers to his feet as Gordon
           RAGDOLLS back to the concrete...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                            (
                             stunned
                                   )
                        Gordon...  What've you...

           He sees Gordon's BLOODY JACKET... 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        The fuck...

           Grant turns to the YELLOW DOORS -- shit -- turns back to
           Gordon...  Gordon's sweaty now, clammy, breathing heavy...
           An anguished beat... 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        I...  I'm...
                            (
                             beckoning to the doors
                                                  )
                        You know I have to...  Sorry.

           He makes a break after Liz.

           We STAY with Gordon as the yellow doors close with a
           resonant THUNK.

           A beat...  Gordon groans as he rolls over on his side,
           turning to FACE THE SAAB.

           GORDON'S POV:  Low angle, looking up at the BACK WINDSHIELD. 
           Inside we see the YELPING HUSKIES.  Their barking is MUFFLED
           and WARPED...

           Still Gordon's POV -- from the dogs, we turn slowly to see
           PAOLA, tiptoeing towards us and the Saab...

           ON GORDON:  Weak.  Bleeding.  Jesus fucking Christ...

           Paola gives Gordon a sympathetic grimace as she goes for the
           car door.  She tries it... 

           ... Locked.  Shit.  She scans around the parking lot --
           SPOTS SOMETHING in the distance.  ON GORDON as Paola jogs to
           retrieve it...

           After a beat she comes back with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.  She
           positions herself at the front passenger window, RAISES THE
           EXTINGUISHER OVER HER SHOULDER, trying not to look at
           Gordon...

           She takes a deep breath, RUSHES FORWARD --

           CHUNK -- the lock shoots up -- Paola FREEZES, fire
           extinguisher INCHES from the glass --

           She looks at GORDON:  he's holding up his KEY FOB, which
           slips through his trembling fingers, hitting the pavement.

           Off Paola, staring at Gordon... hesitantly lowering the fire
           extinguisher...

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - GROUND LEVEL - SAME

           Liz is RUNNING FOR HER LIFE through the empty garage, scared
           shitless.
           In b.g., the PURPLE DOORS FLING OPEN to reveal GRANT --
           sweaty, crazed, armed.

           Liz turns to look, keeps on running...

           Grant snarls, takes off after her as she disappears out the
           MAIN GARAGE ENTRANCE/EXIT.

           EXT. WEST TEMPLE ANIMAL SHELTER - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz races up to the ANIMAL SHELTER'S FRONT ENTRANCE, unlocks
           the door and rushes inside --

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

           She BLOWS PAST the dark reception area, going through double
           doors, into --

           INT. DOG CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- the DOG SECTION of West Temple, where we met Shania and
           her new owner.  BARK-BARK!! -- Liz's panicked footsteps
           cause some SLEEPING DOGS to stir, in turn waking up more
           dogs...

           (The dogs are NOT hanging out in their cages, by the way --
           at night, they're herded into small CUBBYHOLES at the back
           of each cage, which are walled off by large, SLIDING STEEL
           PLATES operated by a LEVER just outside the cage door.)

           Liz frantically unlocks a CAGE DOOR, then pulls the OUTSIDE
           LEVER --

           IN THE CAGE:  THREE SMALL, ODDLY-SHAPED DOGS pour out as the
           cubbyhole wall RISES. 

           Liz opens the cage door, steps in...

           INT. RECEPTION AREA

           Grant BURSTS through the front door, gun raised.  He looks
           around, getting the lay of the land... 

           A SECURITY CAMERA catches his eye.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Fuckers...
           INT. DOG CAGE

           Liz marshals the small dogs back into the cubbyhole:

                                 LIZ
                        Sorrysorrysorry -- no -- Skeeter --

           She gets them back in, then kneels down, POKES HER HEAD
           INSIDE the cubbyhole, looking from side to side... 

           She pulls her head out, looks back at the OPEN CAGE DOOR,
           nervous...  Hope this works...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - SAME

           The OPEN CAGE DOOR, sticking out like a sore thumb in
           grainy, gray-blue SECURITY FOOTAGE (all the other doors are
           closed).

           Reverse on GRANT, watching on a shitty MONITOR, loosening
           his tie.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                            (
                             harsh whisper
                                         )
                        Goddammit, Gordon...

           He aims the gun at a COMPUTER TOWER under a small desk...

           COMPUTER POV:  PFT! PFT-PFT!

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:  A cacophony of BARKING DOGS...

           INT. DOG CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           ... Barking dogs we CAN'T SEE even when we FADE UP.  We
           TRACK SLOW along the cages:  eerie, all seemingly empty
           despite the DEAFENING NOISE...

           Reverse on GRANT, creeping down the hall, not reacting well
           to this environment:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!!

           GRANT'S POV:  The AJAR CAGE DOOR about 10 yards down the
           corridor, getting CLOSER AND CLOSER...  The SILENCED GUN
           rises into frame...
           ON GRANT:  SCARED beneath the rage...  Scared enough to
           MURDER THIS GIRL in cold blood if he has to.

           We're coming up on the cage door now...  Easy... easy...

           Grant TURNS TO POUNCE --

           INT. DOG CAGE

           Totally empty.  Grant drops his shooting stance,
           exasperated.  He stomps angrily, making the barking dogs
           redline.  As he's turning around --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        ...fucking dumb fucking SLUT...

           A CHEESY RINGTONE starts emanating from behind the cubbyhole
           panel.  "By the Seaside" (stock on most iPhones).

           Grant WHIPS BACK AROUND, gun raised.  He smirks.  A beat... 

           He steps inside the cage, following the noise to the STEEL
           PANEL at the back...

           He bends down, gets his fingers under the plate.  Painfully
           LIFTS:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Aghh!!!

           It's not supposed to open this way, but it can be done.  He
           wrests the steel plate into its OPEN/LOCKED POSITION, then
           KNEELS to peer inside...

           Just Skeeter and his pals.  Jumping around a RINGING IPHONE
           lying in the middle of the cubbyhole.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        ... you fucking bitch...

           SLAM!!  The cage door SHUTS behind him as a LIZ-SHAPED BLUR
           RUNS BY.

           Grant JERKS AROUND, stands up -- no -- he SHAKES the cage
           door...  Yup.  Locked.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        You fucking BITCH!!

           The Shelter Dog Philharmonic is still going strong.  Grant
           looks at his feet -- the three weird dogs are pawing needily
           at his legs.
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (

                             kicking/waving the gun
                        Get the fuck away from me!!
                             then, yelling out
                            (
                                             )
                        REAL fucking clever, sweetheart --
                        I was just gonna shoot you, but now
                        I'm gonna slice off your tits and
                        use them as fucking kneepads while
                        I SKULLFUCK THE EYES OUT OF YOUR
                        FUCKING HEAD!!!
                            (
                             shaking the cage door
                                                 )

           Skeeter wags his tail, unfazed.  Grant STOPS mid-shake,
           noticing/remembering his GUN.  He grins.

           He steps back a few feet, aims the gun at the LOCK:

           PFT! -- SPARKS fly out of the steel locking mechanism,
           scaring the hell out of the small dogs, who flee back into
           their cubbyhole.

           Grant tries opening the door -- 

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           He steps back, re-aims --

           PFT! -- Sparks fly again... but the door still won't open.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Motherfucker COME ON.

           He inhales deep, aims the gun at the DENTED LOCK.  A tense
           beat...

           PFT! -- the door FLIES OPEN as a SPARK SHOWER sprays Grant
           in the UPPER LEG -- he falls over:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                            (
                             screaming in pain
                                             )
                        FUCK!  FUCK!!

           He looks down to inspect...  Through the singed holes in his
           khakis:  a strip of CHARRED, BLISTERED SKIN.

                                  GRANT RICHMOND
                            (
                             seething
                                    )
                        YOU'RE FUCKING DONE YA HEAR ME??!

           He PULLS HIMSELF UP, grunting, all traces of fear gone --
           now nothing but WHITE-HOT ANGER.  As he limps out of the
           cage:
                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        You're fucking done...

           INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SAME

           PAOLA, anxious, sits at the kitchen counter in Liz's Ikea
           gift certificate of an apartment, watching her CELL PHONE
           with growing concern.  A smattering of HUSKY PUPPIES frolic
           on the carpet in b.g.

                                 PAOLA
                        ...okay Liz...  Wheeeere are ya...

           She picks the phone up, checks the time.

                                 PAOLA (CONT'D)
                        Shit...

           She looks at a WALL CLOCK just to be sure.  Breathes deep. 
           Tries to shake off some nervousness.  She grabs Liz's keys,
           stands up. 

           CLOSE ON HER PHONE SCREEN as she dials:

                                         9-1-1

           Paola raises the phone, worry in her eyes...  Hope she's
           okay...

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - CAT ROOM - SAME

           A CUTE CAT

           Moon-eyed, peering out its cage.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (O.S.)
                        Fucking twat...

           WIDEN to reveal GRANT bent over a steel sink/counter in the
           corner of the CAT ROOM, a midsize facility with tall rows of
           CAT CAGES lining the walls.

           CLOSE ON GRANT'S THIGH:  He finishes tying his TIE around a
           mass of DAMP PAPER TOWELS pressed against his leg.

           CLANG-CLANG! -- out in the DOG CORRIDOR, a NOISE makes Grant
           twist to the door.  He snorts.

           Gotcha now...
           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LOWER LEVEL - SAME

           GORDON lies supine, panting on the ground a few yards from
           his Saab.  Back door flung open, EMPTY.  No dogs, no box.

           Gordon's JACKET is off -- wadded-up now, pressed to his
           ABDOMINAL WOUND.  Looks like it's already sponged up a lot
           of blood.

           Gordon groans as he SWITCHES HANDS applying pressure, then
           slowly gets his free hand in his FRONT POCKET...  Every inch
           hurts, but he eventually gets out his CELL PHONE.

           CLOSE ON THE SCREEN as a blood-caked finger types:

           His thumb drifts to the CALL BUTTON...

           ... hovers over it...

           ON GORDON:  Pale.  He closes his eyes for a beat.  Opens
           them again.

           He DROPS the phone -- CLACK.  Feels around for it on the
           ground...

           His hand comes up again... holding the KEY FOB instead.

           Keeping the jacket pressed to his torso, he very painfully
           rolls to one side, manages to prop himself up on his
           ELBOW...

                            (
                                 GORDON
                             groaning in pain
                                            )
                        Goddammit, Grant...

           Using all the strength he has left and then some, Gordon
           LABORS AGONIZINGLY to his feet.  Once "standing," he TRIPS
           forward -- catches himself on the back of the Saab. 

           A beat as he leans head-down against the trunk, catching his
           breath, holding his wound...  He drags himself to the
           DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR using the Saab roof for support.  He gets
           the door open --

           LOW ANGLE ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR:  Gordon's wadded-up jacket/
           tourniquet FLUTTERS to the ground as the door SHUTS. 

           PUSH IN on the jacket as a RED POOL grows around it...

           CLOSE ON THE JACKET (for the rest of the scene):  CHK-
           CHK-VROOOM -- we hear the SAAB ENGINE come to life, then
           the sound of the door RE-OPENING...
           Gordon's weak, BLOODY HAND quivers into frame, fishing out
           his smeared, crumpled CIGARETTES.

           THUNK -- we hear the door shut again.  Gordon turns up THE
           FADO...  Filtered and boomy from our POV outside the car...

           Off the jacket, wet and oozing on the pavement... 
           Apparently no longer needed...

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DOG CORRIDOR - SAME

           SKEETER AND HIS CAGE-MATES stand at the far end of the dog
           corridor, gathered over an UPSIDE DOWN ALUMINUM BOWL,
           pebbles of DOG FOOD spilled all around.

           Reverse on GRANT -- other end of the corridor -- aiming his
           gun at this.  Brow furrowed in consternation...

           He grunts contemptuously as he half-lowers the gun.  Starts
           limping his way down the hall, scanning the cages.

           ANGLE ON DISTANT GRANT from the other end of the corridor,
           inching closer to us...

           ... TRACK SIDEWAYS to reveal LIZ in f.g., crouched behind
           the last cage -- still as a mannequin -- one hand holding an
           ENORMOUS HOSE, the other a SNARE POLE (a 5-ft pole with a
           noose that tightens via a pull-cable protruding out the
           handle).

           Grant's voice becomes a little more newsanchor-y as he calls
           out to Liz:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        I -- I take it you saw some things
                        that upset you...  I don't want to
                        hurt you.  I mean it, we can work
                        this out... 

           No response.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        I can raise money for the shelter. 
                        Do a nice little human interest
                        piece...  Hey -- I can even get
                        you on televi--

           FWOOSH!! -- Grant is BLASTED to the ground by a TORRENT OF
           HOSE WATER -- the SILENCED GUN goes FLYING, sliding across
           the wet cement as Skeeter & Co. haul ass down the corridor.
                            (
                             gripping his leg
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                                            )
                        God-fucking--!

           Liz steps out from behind the cage, drops the hose and
           RUSHES UP to momentarily-out-of-commission-Grant with the
           SNARE POLE, wrestles the NOOSE around his neck --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck're you -- AGH! --

           -- and YANKS AS HARD AS SHE CAN on the pull-cable.  Grant's
           eyes and veins BULGE as the cable DIGS SHARPLY into his
           trachea. 

           He tries to grab the pole but Liz STOMPS ON HIS CHEST,
           pinning him down.  She gives the cable a QUICK TUG for good
           measure:

                            (
                                 LIZ
                             all business
                                        )
                        Listen up, fucko.  When I loosen
                        the rope, you're gonna get up
                        slowly, and then you're going back
                        in the cage until the cops get
                        here.  You try anything...  I pull
                        'til your fucking head pops off. 
                        Got it?
                            (
                             a beat
                                  )
                        Only gonna loosen if you got it.

           Grant, asphyxiating, does his best to NOD YES.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Good boy. 

           PSH! -- A puff of air as Liz taps the RELEASE BUTTON --
           Grant GASPS, gulping for oxygen as the rope slackens a
           centimeter.

           Liz takes her foot off his chest, backs away with the pole
           as Grant, dripping wet, SLOWLY RISES.

           He holds up his hands, turns to start walking down the
           corridor...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        I didn't even know his name until
                        you said anything...  What was
                        it... Bennett?...

           Liz trails behind him, slow, gripping the pole, watching for
           any funny business. 
                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        He was trying to blackmail me.
                        He would've destroyed me.  My whole
                        life.  My fucking family.

                                 LIZ
                        Well, now I'm doing that.

           A beat.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Fucking fishstick was that dear to
                        you, huh...

                                 LIZ
                        No.  But you didn't have to shoot
                        him.  You didn't have to shoot that
                        guy across the street, either.

           ON GRANT:  That last bit struck a nerve.  He spots the GUN
           up the corridor a ways, lying in the shadows...

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        You have no fucking idea what
                        you're talking about.

                                 LIZ
                        Uh... I saw it.  You saw me see it. 
                        You shot him.  You di--

           Grant GRABS the pole behind his head and LEAPS FORWARD --
           Liz reacts in time to YANK THE CABLE --

                            (
                             pained gasp
                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                                       )

           -- but the POLE RIPS OUT OF HER GRASP as Grant's bodyweight
           pulls it to the ground, causing her to LURCH FORWARD and
           lose her footing.  She tries to pick herself up but Grant
           SMACKS HER IN THE FACE WITH THE POLE --

           She FALLS BACK as Grant -- WET AND CHOKING -- desperately
           tries to PUSH THE RELEASE BUTTON, but it's too far down the
           pole, just out of arm's reach. 

           A charged beat as Liz wipes the BLOOD from her temple... 
           She clambers to her feet, wastes no time -- she CHARGES PAST
           STRUGGLING GRANT right as (PSH!) he FREES HIMSELF (sort
           of -- the pole's still attached but he can breathe now). 

           Grant TAKES OFF AFTER HER, pole dangling behind him.  Liz
           bolts through the RECEPTION DOORS -- Grant, not far behind,
           SCOOPS UP THE GUN before following suit --
           INT. RECEPTION AREA

           ON LIZ as she makes a dash for the FRONT DOORS -- PFT! --
           SPARKS fly off the doorframe as Grant fires off a round --

           Liz JUMPS, freezes -- 

                                 LIZ
                        Jesus fuck!

           Reverse on Grant, gun trained, pole dragging behind him:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        DON'T YOU FUCKING MOVE!  Stay RIGHT
                        the fuck there!!

           Liz rears back, hands in the air...  Turns to face him. 
           Grant, foaming at the mouth, limps a few feet closer. 

           He HOLDS OUT the POLE.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Press it.

           A beat...  Liz doesn't want to.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        PRESS IT!

           Liz carefully approaches...  PSHHH -- she hits the RELEASE
           BUTTON, quickly STEPS BACK --

           Grant works the noose off his head, gun never leaving Liz. 
           He furiously THROWS DOWN the snare pole, catches his breath. 
           Then, strangely calm:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Get behind the desk.

           He beckons with the gun.  Liz takes a beat... reluctantly
           obliges.  Grant positions himself across from her.

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Keys to the dog cages.

                                 LIZ
                        What?...

           He shoves the gun in her face:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Get them.
           Liz rummages through a drawer behind the desk, takes out a
           SINGLE KEY attached to a FADED ORANGE DOGBONE KEYCHAIN.

                                 LIZ
                        Opens all of them... 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        ... Can I ask why?

           Grant snatches the key, pockets it:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Slain employee?  Bunch'a fuckin'
                        dogs running loose?... 
                            (
                             gesturing around
                                            )
                        Looks to me like some PETA shit that
                        just got a little too Manson-y.

           Liz stares at him hatefully.

                                 LIZ
                        You're a fucking idiot.

           Grant shrugs, READIES THE GUN --

                                 GRANT RICHMOND
                        Says the girl who got herself
                        killed.

           ON LIZ:  defiant but shaking...

           Grant sighs, then:

                                 GRANT RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                        Such a tragedy...  I look forward
                        to interviewing your grieving
                        family.

           Liz SHIFTS HER GAZE as her jaw goes slack, eyes slowly
           WIDENING...  She sees something behind Grant. 

           Grant notices her mien as LIGHT pierces through the FRONT
           WINDOW behind him -- he PIVOTS to the window --

           CRRRAAASSSHHHH!!! -- GORDON'S SAAB SAILS THROUGH THE FRONT
           WINDOW/WALL of West Temple Animal Shelter in an explosion of
           debris and broken glass -- the car HITS GRANT, CRUNCHING HIM
           brutally into the RECEPTION DESK, sandwiching his lower body
           as it comes to a halt.

           DRYWALL and DOCUMENTS snow around the room as AMÁLIA
           RODRIGUES fills the air, blasting from the car speakers.

           Grant is folded over the Saab hood, face-down.  Dead.  Gun
           on the floor.
           As the dust settles, Liz uncoils from a defensive crouch at
           the end of the room.  Rises to take in the wreckage...

           A beat as she looks around, speechless at the destruction. 
           Eventually: 

                                 LIZ
                        ...fuuuuuccckkkkk...

           She pushes through piles of rubble to get to the SAAB.  Once
           there, she looks at Grant dubiously... pushes his head
           lightly...

           Nothing.  A SPUTTERING COUGH turns her attention to the
           DRIVER'S SEAT:

           GORDON, covered in small cuts and bruises, pushes out his
           last breaths as a barely-smoked cigarette tumbles from his
           lips. 

           Liz bends down through the shattered car window...  Under
           the fado:

                                 GORDON
                        Are they... okay...

           It takes her a second to realize what he's talking about...

           She nods.  Gordon closes his eyes.  She reaches through the
           window, puts her hand on his.

                                 GORDON (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about... my brother...

           And with that, he's gone. 

           ON LIZ:  Looking at him sadly.  Mercifully.  Like he's an
           animal being put down... 

           This evil fucking dog thief just saved my life...

           After a beat she leans in further -- puts the Saab in PARK,
           switches off the headlights, then twists the key until the
           car and fado go silent.

           SIRENS can be heard blaring faintly in the distance. 
           Outside, a couple LATE NIGHT DRIVERS slow down to gawk at
           the scene.

                                 LIZ
                             remembering
                                       )
                            (
                        Paola...
           Liz negotiates back through a pile of splintered furniture,
           eventually reaches the DOG CORRIDOR DOORS...

           INT. DOG CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           LIZ'S PHONE in the CUBBYHOLE, right where we left it.  (The
           shelter dogs are barking like a cat just got elected
           president.)

           LIZ snaps up the phone, stands -- Skeeter and his friends
           are JUMPING AT HER HEELS.  She gets behind them, ushers them
           in:

                                 LIZ
                        Fun's over guys...

           She quickly exits the cage and slides the OUTSIDE LEVER,
           shutting the cubbyhole panel.  She turns, walks briskly down
           the corridor as she DIALS HER PHONE, picking debris out of
           her hair while it rings.  As she pushes through the doors to
           the RECEPTION AREA --

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Pick uuuuupppp...  Paola pick --

           INT. RECEPTION AREA

           PFT! -- A BULLET bites into the steel INCHES FROM HER
           HEAD -- Liz SCREAMS, drops her phone --

           Reverse on GRANT...  STILL ALIVE AND GUN IN HAND.  Pinned by
           the Saab but now SLUMPED TO ONE SIDE, angled facing her.

           CLOSE ON HIS FACE...  Through the filth and sweat:  a
           GROTESQUE LUNATIC GRIN...

           SSCHHHK!!! -- GRANT'S GRIN IS BISECTED BY SIX INCHES OF
           BLOOD AND SHIT-ENCRUSTED STEEL, STICKING OUT OF HIS MOUTH
           like the tongue of a sexually adventurous Robot Gene
           Simmons.

           A GURGLE OF BLOOD... then he falls out of frame to reveal
           PAOLA behind him.  She DROPS THE SWORD HANDLE -- ewww. 
           Backs away.

                                 LIZ
                        Paola!!  Oh my fucking god!!

           The SIRENS AND LIGHTS are getting close.  Liz rushes over:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        What the FUCK...
                                 PAOLA
                            (
                             to Grant's corpse
                                             )
                        I do not love the bright sword for
                        its sharpness...  Only that which
                        it defends.
                            (
                             looks at Liz, shrugs
                                                )
                        Already impaled one guy today... 

           Liz HUGS her.

                                 LIZ
                        Reggie's gonna fucking kill us.

                                 PAOLA
                        Safe to say... 
                            (
                             looking around
                                          )
                        Man...  what fucking happened here,
                        Liz??

                                 LIZ
                        Family problems I think?... 
                        I don't know.  I don't care.

           She pulls away, looks at Paola, genuine:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        All I know is we're alive...  Thank
                        you.  For everything. 

           Paola smiles, shrugs -- think nothing of it.

           Liz remembers, concerned:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        The huskies -- were you able to...?

           Off Paola, smiling under FLASHING RED LIGHTS... 

           As the SONIC ANARCHY of arriving emergency personnel
           crescendos...

           INT./EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - SHORT TIME LATER

           A DIALOGUE-LESS MONTAGE:

           - The warzone of a reception area bustling with police,
           firefighters, paramedics, etc.

           - LIZ and PAOLA being tended to by EMTs in the back of an
           AMBULANCE out on the street.

           - FLASH-FLASH -- A FORENSIC TEAM takes photos of Gordon and
           Grant's corpses, the sword, and the Saab.
           - Paola talks animatedly to the police, miming the sword
           thrust.  Liz looks on, nodding her head, exhausted...

           EXT. LIZ'S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Hours later.  The bruise-blue light of a new morning.

           A SQUAD CAR slows to a stop outside Liz's building.  LIZ
           steps out of the passenger door, bone-fucking-tired.  Gauze
           bandage stuck to the side of her head, clothes stained and
           frayed, miscellaneous nicks and scrapes all over.

           She wearily shuts the door, half-waves as the cop drives
           off...

           INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door opens revealing Liz, ORANGE DOGBONE KEYCHAIN
           dangling from the lock.

           She's warmly greeted by SIX -- count 'em -- SIX HUSKY
           PUPPIES.  Gloria's WHOLE LITTER, together again.  Two of
           them (puppies Liz kept) have COLLARS.  The other four bear
           Gordon's SHARPIE NAMETAGS.

           Liz bends down to administer pets, smiling, tired, aching. 

           She pauses, something across the room CATCHING HER EYE.  And
           her nose...  She stands, walks to the RUG in front of her
           couch:

           A masterpiece of dog diarrhea.  Streaking over an impressive
           amount of the rug.

           ON LIZ:  Not happy about this...  She looks at the dogs: 
           one of them hides shamefully in the WAKESTREAM BOX.  She
           turns back to the soiled rug... smirks.  Sighs.

           INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           LOW ANGLE ON THE RUG:  In f.g., a GLINTING SILVER PIECE OF
           PLASTIC, mostly submerged in the sludge.

           Yup...  Bennett's FLASH DRIVE. 

           Liz doesn't notice it as she ROLLS UP THE TAINTED RUG from
           the other end.

           She stands, wincing in disgust/pain as she HOISTS the rug
           tube over her shoulder...
           EXT. LIZ'S APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY - DAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           A small back alley behind her building.  A DOOR kicks open
           as Liz hustles the rug outside...

           She THROWS the rolled-up rug into a DUMPSTER.  It juts out
           awkwardly over the edge.

           Liz wipes her hands, lets out a long, exhausted sigh.    
           She turns to go back in.  We STAY ON THE RUG, poking out of
           the dumpster...

           A beat, then it's SWALLOWED UP as some garbage settles
           beneath it.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.
